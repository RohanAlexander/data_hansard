3,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-It gives me pleasure today to table on behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts the the committee's 338th report, Accrual accounting-A cultural change. Report 338 is the result of the committee's review of two reports presented to the parliaaccrual ment by the Auditor-General in 1994. The reports were Audit report No. 32 1993-94, Efficiency audit, Accrual reporting-Are external agencies ready? and Audit report No. 16, 1994-95, Follow-up audit, Accrual reportimpact ing-Are agencies ready? The audit reports sources. contained an assessment of whether Commonwealth agencies were adequately prepared meet their obligations to report on an accrual basis for the 1994-95 financial year. Prior this the majority of Commonwealth agencies had been reporting on a cash accounting basis. Accrual accounting has been with us for long time and is the basis for accounting in the private sector and for government enterprises. Accrual accounting recognises revenue and expenses in the accounting period in which they occur, which contrasts to cash accounting which records transactions when cash is exchanged. Accrual accounting therefore aims to match the costs incurred during a particular reporting period with the benefits earned in that period-a commonto sense approach. The committee's interest in promoting the use of accrual concepts has a long history. Report 34, The trust fund, which was tabled in 1957, the committee argued that Commoncan wealth bodies operating on a trust account, rather than from the consolidated revenue fund, should keep a profit and loss account a balance sheet which should be certified by the Auditor-General. Later, in 1982, the committee recommended that cash based accounting should be eliminated as the primary basis for financial reporting by Commonwealth authoritic- and, instead, that Report accrual accounting should be adopted. It has also become clear in the committee's recent inquiry into the commercialisation of sector operations that many Commonwealth agencies, particularly those which had moved to adopt a more commercial approach to program and service delivery, had found Joint accrual reporting and accounting to be a results of valuable management tool. For this reason the committee broadened its inquiry beyond the assessment of the readiness of Commonwealth agencies to produce based financial statements for 199495, to the uses of accrual information by the government, by agency managers and by reviewers, to facilitate better judgments about operating performance, economic and the stewardship of public reDuring the review, the committee received to evidence at public hearings in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney, at which the experito ences of agencies within the Commonwealth, Victorian and New South Wales jurisdictions were canvassed. As well, information was sought from other states and territories, and a from New Zealand, which has been at the forefront of introducing accrual accounting for business government agencies. In reviewing the progress in the Commonwealth arena, the committee was keen to examine: the use being made of accrual-based financial information both within agencies and elsewhere; the progress being made by agencies from accrual reporting to full accrual accounting; and the assistance being provided agencies by the central coordinating agencies. Report 338 considers at some length the In uses to which the information in accrual reports can be put. In particular, information be used to make comparisons between reporting periods and between agencies. Such information has the potential to be of great benefit to the parliament, to which agencies are held accountable, and to the public through media commentators. The committee has recommended that the financial statement guidelines be amended to require the inclusion of a range of charts and tables to enable comparisons to be made and that the Department of Finance should collect, analyse and table in parliament a consolidated series of charts and tables enabling the comparison of the performance of all Commonwealth agencies against a range of key performance indicators. To assist those interpreting accrual based financial statements, the committee has recommended that the Department of Finance should develop a professional marketing strategy directed at the potential users of agency financial statements and also that the departments of the Senate and House of Representatives develop information and training packages on the new financial reports for parliamentarians and parliamentary staff. For its part, the committee intends to write to all parliamentarians and party whips informing them of the type of accountability and performance information that can be derived from such reports. The committee believes that accrual information is an essential tool for modern public sector day-today management. Without regular access to accrual information, it is possible to make accurate assessments of the cost of service provision, and thereby the efficiency of program performance. It is of concern to the committee that as yet only a few agencies have recognised the value of accrual information, and even fewer have taken the initiative to explore the full potential of accrual information. The committee believes that, at agency level, accrual based financial management systems should be introduced and more should be done to educate managers in how to make best use of accrual information. There should also be incentives to encourage agencies to adopt the reform. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the government should consider providing supplementary funding to agencies to help them redevelop their financial management systems so as to provide full accrual accounting functionality and also consider making available interest free loans to help in the transition from cash based to accrual based accounting systems. The committee also received evidence that small and medium agencies felt accrual accounting had for them limited usefulness. The committee feels that the weight of evidence does not support this contention but, nevertheless, has recommended that Finance consider sponsoring a joint working party to examine and make recommendations about appropriate financial management information systems for small and medium sized agencies, and facilitate meetings of agencies with similar characteristics with the aim of encouraging them to share the costs of implementing new systems. The committee notes that there is a basic incoherence in the Commonwealth's financial management system-funds are appropriated on a cash basis, but end of year reports are now made on an accrual basis. This, in the committee's opinion, not only is inelegant but also sends mixed messages to managers. Managers are inclined to focus on cash-it is cash they have appropriated-but the end of year accrual reports mean they are held accountable for more than just managing cash. Such a system is likely to undermine the not potential of the reforms undertaken to date. The committee has recommended, therefore, that there should be a major review of the Commonwealth's system of budget appropriations to consider the merits or otherwise of requiring that budgets be prepared and appropriations made on an accrual basis. Report 338 concludes with a discussion of the next major accounting reform for the Commonwealth-whole of government reporting. The committee believes that preparing such reports on an annual basis would provide information of great value to cabinet, to the government's key economic advisers, to parliamentarians and to many other external users. Whole of Commonwealth government reports would help inform strategic decisions about government priorities and policies and would enable the government to better account for its use of public resources. Much work needs to be done in teasing out the issues surrounding the preparation of whole of government reports, and the committee has decided to maintain its involvement in this area by conducting a separate and more detailed review of the issues involved. The committee intends to report on these matters in the course of the current parliament. In concluding, I would like to emphasise that the recent introduction of accrual reporting across the Commonwealth public sector should be seen as only one step in the reform process. The committee has found that the core sector area still retains a cultural attachment to cash accounting, and the committee believes there is a danger that the reform process will stall unless the government sets new targets beyond just accrual reporting. The government should articulate a clear vision for the future of financial reporting in the Commonwealth, incorporating whole of government reporting, accrual management and, possibly, accrual based budgeting. A statement of direction from the government would give great impetus to the tentative steps now being taken by agencies towards accrual accounting and accrual management. Finally, and on behalf of the committee, I would like to express our thanks to those people who contributed to the review by preparing submissions and giving evidence at public hearings. I would also like to thank the staff of the secretariat for assisting the committee in preparing the report-in particular, Laura Gillies, Donna Christophers, Jennifer Hughson, John Carter and our hard working secretary, Grant Harrison. I commend the report to the House.",11
4,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report being tabled this morning-report No. 338 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, Accrual accounting-A cultural change-is a very important one. The significance of the name of the report is that it is requesting and requiring a cultural change within the Commonwealth bureaucracy. It was interesting to note in the address of the chairman of the committee, the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), that the Commonwealth Public Accounts Committee has been requiring these sorts of changes for some time. In fact, it goes back to 1957 when report No. 34 on the trust fund was tabled. The committee then argued that Commonwealth bodies operating on a trust account rather than from the consolidated revenue fund should keep a profit and loss account and balance sheet to be certified by the Auditor-General. Later, in 1982, the committee recommended that cash based accounting should be eliminated as the primary basis for financial reporting by Commonwealth authorities and that accrual accounting should be adopted in its stead. From the evidence we took in this inquiry we found that there was a great unwillingness to progress much past accrual reporting into full accrual accounting. If the Commonwealth agencies that we spoke to are going to progress further, become leaner and meaner and be able to provide the information that needs to be provided to modern governments, they will have to take on board the recommendations contained within this report. We found that a number of agencies said that it would take four or five years to implement accrual accounting across the board. The opinion of a number of members of the committee was that these agencies should follow our recommendations, such as recommendation 1, which was aimed primarily at the Department of Finance, and says: The Department of Finance should: (a) develop a professional marketing strategy directed at potential users of agency financial statements and with the aim of promoting the use which can be made of the accrual based information contained in financial statements; It should even go to the extent of providing incentives for agencies to get up and going with full accrual accounting. It is not good enough in the public sector today to be still using cash accounting systems. Local governments have been forced by their higher authorities into different accounting standards. Tiley have not been given the choice that Commonwealth agencies have at the moment. It is now incumbent upon the government, as a result of the inquiry that we have undertaken, to force the issue along a little bit faster. It was interesting to note some of the comments that the new Auditor-General has made with regard to management practices generally in Commonwealth agencies. There is a hell of a lot of room for improvement. We could be doing things far more effectively and efficiently within the Commonwealth if this cultural change were allowed to take place in those departments. It is with pleasure that I support the committee's findings and all the recommendations in this report. It has been a good subcommittee to work on. It has been very interesting. Certainly, it is an exciting time, far as the Commonwealth is concerned, if the government, the Department of Finance and key agencies take note of the recommendations that have been made in this report. As the chairman said, the committee believes wholeheartedly that accrual information is an essential tool for modem public sector day-today management. Without regular access to accrual information it is not possible to make accurate assessments of the cost of service provision. When competitive tendering is taking place it is not a level playing field if accrual accounting practices are not implemented. I reiterate the indications that we had from a number of agencies-that is, that they are not moving at a very rapid rate towards implementing accrual accounting. We are recommending to the government in this report that it should hurry that process along, by whatever means it wishes to use-whether it is by a carrot or a stick or whether it is by incentives or a boot along the way. Ultimately, if we implement this system throughout the Commonwealth, the taxpayers of Australia will certainly get much better efficiency and effectiveness out of the taxpayers' dollars that are being spent by the Commonwealth. In closing, I would like to thank the staff who worked with us on this'report, headed by Grant Harrison, John Carter, Laura Gillies, Donna Christophers and Jennifer Hughson. I also commend the report to the House.",13
5,Mr ROBERT BROWN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I would like to endorse the comments that have been made by the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), and by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), another member of the committee, in connection with this report. I would like to emphasise that the choice of the name of that report-Accrual accounting-A cultural change-was very deliberate. It represents, in effect, an appeal on the part of the Public Accounts Committee and from the Public Accounts Committee to the government to ensure that a cultural change takes place within the method of accounting within the as Public Service and within the public sector generally. It was emphasised that modem public sector management cannot be as good as it should be without a firm and observable shift towards accrual accounting. It is understandable that traditionally and historically the public sector and those heads of agencies and people responsible for management of government departments and government agencies, instrumentalities and authorities would have been preoccupied with cash. They depended, to the extent to which they were able to pursue their responsibilities, on the receipt of cash and they measured the provision of the services for which they were responsible from the outlay of cash. It is not a satisfactory management tool. The private sector has long abandoned that simplistic approach to management. I am also interested in some of the extensions of this particular question. At present there are government agencies which are conducting their accounting on a cash basis. At the end of the financial period they are converting that for the purpose of reporting to an accrual basis. That represents two things: firstly, an acknowledgment on their part that the government should be determined that the transition to an accrual basis for both accounting and reporting will take placei'and, secondly, in some cases some degree of inertia on the part of those agencies concerning the extent to which and the speed with which they will move to accrual accounting. But it becomes even more significant than that. The shift to accrual accounting within government agencies will simplify, as the chairman of the committee has also indicated, the next transition-that is, towards whole of government accounting and whole of government reporting. That will be a necessary and desirable extension. Also tied up with that is the whole question of the basis upon which and the way in which the aggregate budget is determined. That needs to be determined as well-and will be determined-on an accrual basis when all of these other measures are put in place. That brings me to the last point that I want to make. Since the end of the Second World War there have been only four occasions, apart from an estimate of a budget surplus this year, when federal governments have delivered a budget surplus. Those four occasions were four years under the Labor government during the 1980s. The important thing about this is that there have been very few occasions when the recurrent elements of that budget have not been in surplus. In fact, the bottom line deficit for each of those budgets since the Second World War has resulted essentiallv from the fact that there has been a deficit in the capital account or the capital elements of the budget. All that means is that successive Commonwealth governments, national governments, have borrowed to finance investment, to finance public sector infrastructure. I say: not? Sensible people do. People normally borrow in order to finance investment. That is the essential reason for most of those deficits since the Second World War. That then reflects on the fiscal capacity, on the fiscal stringency, on the fiscal responsibility, of national governments. People say, 'There's that Australian national government budgeting for a deficit again. Why doesn't it ensure that it raises sufficient revenue to meet its commitment?' Let me emphasise that we do and we have. In conclusion, we quite correctly have borrowed to finance investment, to finance infrastructure. If we were to have the budget divided into those two separate areas-a recurrent budget and a capital budget-it would be clearer, and people would understand better the quality and the nature of budgetary management. The particular provisions that are in the report which the chairman has just tabled are a necessary first step in the total continuum towards more effective accounting and reporting processes across the whole area of the public sector and particularly in relation to the financial management of the national government and government agencies.",14
6,Mr LES SCOTT,COMMITTEES,by leave-I move: That the House take note of the report. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Public Works Committee Reference,15
7,Mr LEE,COMMITTEES,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (9.53 a.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development of facilities for the Artillery Centre, Puckapunyal, Vic. The Department of Defence proposes to relocate the artillery centre from North Head in Sydney to Puckapunyal to meet training requirements and to make best use of existing why facilities at Puckapunyal. This proposal will provide the artillery centre with ready access to a suitable field firing range. It will ensure utilisation of existing facilities at Puckapunyal after the departure of the 1st Armoured Regiment for Darwin and will allow the vacation of the property at North Head. North Head is an unsuitable location for the artillery centre because it is remote from a field firing range. The proposal will provide office accommodation, instructional and storage facilities, repair facilities and living accommodation. The estimated outturn cost, on advice from my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), is $34.8 million. It is anticipated the construction will start in April 1996 and be completed by November 1997. I commend this motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.5) 1995 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be taken into consideration forthwith.

8,Mr LEE,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"Do bell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (9.55 a.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments go to an issue of timing. The amendments are technical and necessary to ensure that section 475 (2)(e) of Migration Act 1958 is amended correctly, whether this bill or the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1994 receives royal assent first. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1994 has passed the other place with government amendments.",16
9,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRA TION LEGISLATION,"I think Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1994 is yet to come before this House and I am not sure what the government's program is to deal with that matter. As I understand it, we are dealing with Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.5) 1995 and the amendments here are consequential amendments relating to start-up times. They are not opposed by the opposition; but it does reflect the difficulty the government has had in handling its legislation, obviously. This bill was intended to be dealt with during the last session. We are having to make these amendments because the government was not able to program its legislation to be dealt with in this chamber and to be dealt with in the other place in a timely and appropriate fashion. I do not think that matter should be let pass items 19 and without some observation. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1995 Consideration of Senate Message Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for requested amendment announced. Bill returned from the Senate with a request for an amendment. Ordered that the request be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's requested amendmentAfter clause 2, page 3, insert the following clause: Operation of Schedule 3 of the Social Security Act 1991 ""2A.(I) Despite subsection 2(1) of, Part 10 of and Schedule 3 to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1994 (the 1994 Act): (a) Schedule 3 of the Social Security Act 1991, as in force immediately before the commencement of Part 10 of the 1994 Act, continues in force; and (b) Schedule 3 of the Social Security Act 1991, as substituted by the 1994 Act, does not come into force; until the Agreement on Social Security between Australia and the Republic of Italy, set out in Schedule 3 to the 1994 Act, enters into force in accordance with Article 23 of that Agreement. ""(2) If: (a) before the commencement of this section, a person received from the Commonwealth a payment that purported to be made under the Social Security Act 1991; and (b) the payment was not a valid payment; and (c) had subsection (1) been in force when the payment was made, it would have been a valid payment under the Social Security Act 1991; any right of the Commonw-alth to r-cover - he payment is, by force of this subsectlon, extlllguished."".",16
10,Mr LEE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (9.58 a.m.)-I move: That the requested amendment be agreed to. The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1995 serves to make various portfolio amendments to social security and associated legislation. A number of government amendments and a request for an amendment were moved to the bill in the Senate. These related to the following areas: requiring a qualification assessment to be made for either disability support pension or disability wage supplement if a person has been subject to a compensation preclusion decision, has appealed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal about that decision and has requested the assessment to be made; making some minor technical amendments to the partner allowance qualification provisions; changing the commencement dates for those initiatives relating to the qualifying age for the seniors health card and revised income test arrangements for certain under 18-yearold beneficiaries; and the international social security agreement between Australia and Italy. These amendments and the request for an amendment were unanimously supported by the Senate.",17
11,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (9.59 a.m.)Let me just say in relation to these matters that they were amendments agreed to by the Senate. I note the reference to 'unanimous', but it does not actually explain the genesis of these matters. They were the subject of some observations by interested parties in which the government ultimately recognised that its original bill as proposed was deficient and the amendments appropriate. Some of the matters that are of interest relate to the Italian pensions agreement which was updated. The minister went overseas to sign a fresh agreement. We legislated for it to operate here because of the political changes that have been occurring in Italy. The agreement was not implemented in that country. We now have to go back and re-enact, for the time being, the previous agreement or at least maintain its validity for the payments that are being made under it. That, itself, is a matter of some interest. The matter that is of concern to me relates to the application of the compensation provisions to claimants. This request arose as a result of initiatives from the Welfare Rights Movement. It ought to be acknowledged that it was involved in considering quite detailed and complex issues and proposing, at first, discussions with the government that I think should have been undertaken well before the legislation arrived at this place to see what that organisation's views might be. The social security legislation, as I think the Welfare Rights Movement has made abundantly clear in its most recent publication, is extraordinarily complex. It is developing the same sort of complexity that we see in areas of taxation law, company law and immigration law. We are already seeing efforts to simplify many of those laws for the purposes of putting in place arrangements which are comprehensible to ordinary Australians. I think the view that Welf(lre Rights are putting that there is a need for simplification of social security law can be well seen by the complexity of the amendments that we are dealing with here, particularly in relation to the way in which compensation is to be taken into account for the purposes of assessing people's other entitlements under the Social Security Act. Question resolved in the affirmative. SOCIAL SECURITY (NON-BUDGET MEASURES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration of Senate Message Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for requested amendment announced. Bill returned from the Senate with a request for an amendment. Ordered that the request be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's requested amendmentClause 2, page 2, after subclause (2), insert the following subclause: ""(2A) Sections 8 and 9 are taken to have commenced on 1 July 1995."".",17
12,Mr LEE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (10.03 a.m.)-I move: That the requested amendment be made. The Social Security (Non-Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 provides for the implementation of a number of minor initiatives. A number of government amendments and a request for an amendment were moved to this bill in the Senate. These related to refining a qualification criterion for the sole parent pension, omitting proposed amendments relating to the disclosure of information and changing the commencement date for an initiative relating to the restoration and suspension of fringe benefits to disability support pensioners. These amendments and the request for an amendment were unanimously supported by the Senate. In addition, a number of non-government amendments were successfully moved to the bill. These related to the reviewability of certain decisions of the employment secretary and the Minister for Social Security; the continuation, variation and termination of determinations, with the result that social security payments will not necessarily cease to be payable even though a person has lost qualification and there will be no period of grace for maximum payment rate; and making a notice issued by the Minister for Social Security specifying a class of debts that may be waived, a disallowable instrument, and making that notice effecti ve only after the expiration of the disallowance period. Although the government did not support these amendments in the Senate, it will not press that opposition.",18
13,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (10.05 a.m.)There are a number of issues dealt with here, and I thank the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) for his explanation in relation to each of them. As I said in relation to the previous legislation we dealt with, social security law is becoming increasingly complex and difficult, and there are a wide range of issues dealt with in this legislation. I am glad that the government is not pressing a difference of view on those matters on which the opposition held some strong opinions and pressed for amendments. I will not regale the House over what they were, save to say that there were some compromises on the opposition's part in relation particularly to provisions dealing with disability matters. The extent to which we supported the government's approach in the other place was dependent upon certain administrative changes being put into place by the department in relation to the way in which claims for disability payments, particularly to people with psychiatric illnesses and those who have suffered some brain damage, may be assessed. There are concerns that in some cases, with people who have been shown to lack appropriate motivation for work, the government argues that they may be thought to be malingering in one form or another and that they ought not to be able to make claims based upon a lack of motivation but rather their claims ought to be pressed on the basis of substantially proven claims related to a 20 per cent disability-and particularly when the matters under consideration can be psychiatric or brain damage related. The assessment of these matters, and particularly the extent of any disability that is a precursor to the application, is an important factor. The way in which these matters are dealt with does require some sensitivity and, in some cases, some expertise. As I understand it, guidelines have been approved of to ensure that where there is some doubt about the adequacy of assessment the appropriate expert advice, beyond the opinion of the Commonwealth Medical Officer, will have to be obtained. We have seen the proposed form of words for those guidelines and approve of them. I would of course welcome the minister's affirmation in this place that the guidelines that were part of the compromise arrangements are intended to be implemented by the government. Mr Lee--On advice, I understand that I can give that commitment requested by the shadow minister. Question resolved in the affirmative. RACIAL HATRED BILL 1994 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendmentPart 2, line 1 (page 2) to line 18 (page 3), the Part.",18
14,Mr LEE,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (10.09 a.m.)-I move: That the amendment be agreed to. The amendment made by the Senate deletes from the government's Racial Hatred Bill 1994 the proposed amendment of the federal Crimes Act to create three criminal offences. The offences provided for are threats against people and property together with the offence of incitement to racial violence because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The Senate did not amend the civil prohibition in the bill. Once enacted, it will therefore provide an avenue of complaint through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for people who suffer offence or who are insulted, humiliated or intimated because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The government accepts the Senate amendment solely on the basis that the community must have the protections provided by the bill, even if limited to the civil prohibition. However, the government is committed to amending the Crimes Act by reintroducing after the next federal election the criminal offence provisions based on racial hatred. For me, I think it is a great tragedy that, given the state parliaments in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland have been prepared to put into their criminal codes an offence against incitement to racial violence, we were not able to secure the support of the opposition to impose the same provisions for the federal Crimes Act. While there has been an attempt to suggest that certain people are responsible for the government supporting these measures, I was very struck by arguments that were put to me at one meeting with some of the Jewish community in Melbourne. They made the point that the families who migrated from Europe in the postwar years are probably those who are least under threat these days. For better or worse, they have assimilated to a large extent into the Australian Anglo Saxon community. It is the more recent migrants to Australia who need the protection of a provision such as this and who have been omit granted this protection by Liberal governments in some of the states. It is an enormous tragedy that we were not able to say that this bill received the unanimous bipartisan support of all members of the House. I repeat the government's commitment that after the next federal election we will introduce a bill to amend the Crimes Act to ensure that these criminal offence provisions prohibit the incitement to racial violence.",19
15,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I do not intend to at length detain the House with this matter save to say that there is no particular virtue in the government's being opposed to racial vilification, racial hatred, racial discrimination. Members on this side of the House equally are concerned about those issues. We do not in any way condone such behaviour, but there are other issues in a free society that have to be balanced in relation to legislation of this sort. It is the opposition's view that the government's legislation went a little too far. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) would know we have exposed our own legislative draft that we believe more appropriately addresses the concerns to which the minister expressed and we believe reflects the sorts of values that have been affirmed by our coalition colleagues in legislation in other parliaments around Australia. When this legislation was considered in the Senate, an amendment was introduced by our colleagues in that place known as the Greens. They proposed the amendment which we are dealing with. This amendment was passed in the Senate with the support of the opposition. The amendment varies the criminal sanctions, and we are now dealing with it in this House. We understand that the government is accepting the amendment but wants to press its view that enlarged criminal sanctions should be pursued at a later date. That is the government's right to press those matters. I note that it is going to do so after an election. It is an interesting approach. I thought they were going to press it before then, but we welcome that advice. Our position is that in this place we support the amendment. We have expressed some concerns about aspects of civil sanctions. We have done that. We were not able to get the amendments that we proposed to the civil sanctions dealt with in another place. For that reason we still have concerns about the bill. The criminal sanctions have been removed. In that sense, we are happy to support this amendment as it is drafted. I do foreshadow, for the purposes of discussions in other places, that we still have reservations about aspects of these civil sanctions. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Mr Lee)-by leave-proposed: That the proceedings on the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which lapsed on Wednesday, 30 August 1995, be resumed forthwith at the point where they were interrupted.",19
16,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I am not surprised that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) has not bothered to give the House an explanation for this unprecedented motion. He has given no explanation because it is a matter of very great embarrassment to the government that a minister would have to get up, in this unprecedented way, to restore a matter to the Notice Paper. The House at least deserves an apology from this government for its shambolic, hopeless, inefficient management of the House. I am amazed that you were not prepared to at least outline the circumstances leading up to the motion you have just moved. That, therefore, leaves it to the opposition to put on the public record some explanation of the events leading up to this incredible motion now being put before the chair. Yesterday the House was debating the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill, which is a very important bill. It attempts to rectify the shambles of the government's earlier legislation, which outlines and provides for the right of employees to seek redress where they have been unfairly dismissed. That original legislation has been a disaster. As Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, once said, it has prevented a lot of young people from getting jobs. We have had the most extraordinary examples thrown up where people have been dismissed and then reinstated under the government's law. In fact, there was one case-it was so bad that I recount it to the House-where it was shown by the facts that a university lecturer had used his position to obtain sexual favours from his students in return for his giving them good marks-a case of gross sexual harassment. He was the subject of disciplinary action by the university, which sacked him-a sensible decision by the university. Under the government's law, this lecturer was able to seek redress. He appealed against what he said was unfair dismissal and, believe it or not, he was reinstated under the government's industrial relations law. As a result of that case and others which make up a list as long as your arm, the government was forced to introduce some amendments, which we started to debate yesterday. They are very important. They obviously need to be put through the parliament without any undue loss of time. Mr Leo MCLeay-Well, sit down.",20
17,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Here is the dope himself. I will come to that in a moment. That is, therefore, the reason that the coalition is prepared to give leave, so that these matters can be reinstated on the Notice Paper and that the bill can proceed in the normal way. During the debate yesterday, the government's abuse of parliamentary processes led to a number of quorums being called by opposition members. On both sides of the House it is recognised and agreed-it is one of the conventions of this place-that the government is responsible for ensuring that a quorum is present in the House at all relevant times. The practice is that, when a quorum is called, it is the duty and obligation of members of the government to attend the parliament to ensure that the numbers are here so that the parliament's business can proceed. Yesterday, in response to one of the calls for a quorum, the government's members failed to turn up. They were absent without leave-they went AWOL. As a result, the House was required to be suspended by Deputy Speaker Jenkins, the member for Scullin. The member for Scullin advised that the House would resume in five or six minutes and he appointed a time for its resumption. The bells were duly rung and members were given notice of their requirement to return to the House but the government, for the second time, failed to produce sufficient members in the House to satisfy the quorum requirements in the standing orders. As a result, the House was adjourned and the matters before the House were lost from the Notice Paper. I am told that the Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo MCLeay) was very unhappy with the fact that a number of quorums had been called by the opposition and, to teach us a lesson, he told his members not to front up. Absolutely oblivious to the consequences of his action, he deliberately closed down the parliament and we saw this very important piece of legislation lost into a state of oblivibut on. That is why the government is moving this motion today-to have it reinstated. I can only assume that it was also the intention of the Chief Government Whip that this tactic would stifle the adjournment debate and prevent our members from having their opportunity to speak on any matter of their own choosing. That again is no surprise to us, but the Chief Government Whip and the government got their just desserts on that. They were attempting to stifle the opposition from speaking, but they ended up removing this very important piece of legislation from the Notice Paper. Yesterday was a day of shame because of the way the government behaved in the parliament. The motion that was moved in the morning to condemn an opposition member was an absolute disgrace. If you look at the House of Representatives Practice, you will see that censure motions against members of the opposition are bad precedent-and I use those words advisedly; they are the words of the House of Representatives Practice. They are bad precedent. The case that was put against the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) yesterday was nothing but a trumped up charge. Mr Truss-Pathetic.",20
18,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"It was a pathetic charge-the member for Wide Bay is quite right to say that. It was typical of a government which is on the defensive over the Carmen Lawrence matter. In the last few days, we have had two incredibly low tactics from them. The first one was to attack counsel assisting the royal commission in Western Australia simply on the basis that she was related by marriage to a member of the coalition. According to this government standard, women who hold important positions in our community will not in future be able to undertake their professional careers if they are married to a person who has political interests or if they are related by marriage to a person with the same name who has political interests. I must say that we often get debates about what is fair political conduct. Earlier in the year we had a debate about push polling, and the government carried on a treat about that, this really is low. There are a lot of Australian women who want to have the opportunity to work. Government members are full of themselves about how important it is that women's rights be observed but, when it comes to defending Carmen Lawrence, other people's rights go out the window. In this case, it was not just one person's rightsthe rights of the senior counsel appearing in Western Australia-which were affected but the rights of all women to be able to undertake their own professional careers. We have never attacked, for example, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), and her husband is a High Court judge. Mr MCGauran-We've never attacked Hilary MCPhee.",21
19,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Yes, she is another one. Let us take some of the well-known journalists in the gallery. Christine Wallace is married to a high ranking public servant. Have we ever attacked Christine Wallace because her husband worksMr MCGauran-The Prime Minister attacked Niki Savva.",22
20,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"He did as a matter of fact. But have we ever attacked Christine Wallace because her husband happens to work for the government as a leading member of the Public Service? No, of course we have not because we respect people's basic rights. It is sickening how you defend Carmen Lawrence, who is supposed to be the great defender of women's rights. In doing so, you hypocritically trample over the rights of literally hundred of thousands of Australian women. Yesterday we had another example of the shambles of the administration in this House. I refer to the matter of privilege which was raised by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). As you will remember from yesterday-it is very fresh in my memory-the Speaker's view on a matter of privilege raised by a member which went to the functions and operations of the Speaker's office was that he should not be the judge of the matter; he should send it off to the special committee which considers matters of privilege. We have a special committee for very good reason. As a general rule, matters of privilege are so important that they should not be debated in the to-and-fro political argyto bargy that goes on in the House. It is much better for the institution of parliament if matters of privilege are sent off to a room so that behind closed doors members of parliament, regardless of parties, can sit down and have a sensible discussion about what properly should be done. Yesterday that principle was thrown out the window twice. It was thrown out the window when we had a motion before the chair in respect of the member for Chisholm and it was thrown out the window by the government when it came to whether or not the House should accept the proposition of the Speaker-would you believe-that the matters referred by the right honourable member for New England should be sent to a committee. This is contempt for this parliament-not in the legal, technical definition of the word 'contempt', but in the common sense definition of the word 'contempt'. This is contempt of the proceedings of this parliament. It is no surprise to me that we had a complete shambles in the House yesterday. This is not the first time that this has happened, particularly under this whip. In February this year, the government failed to meet its responsibility to muster the numbers for a quorum. Earlier on the same day the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) was forced to apologise to the House for the bungling of an income tax bill. At least he was prepared to apologise for what happened. Minister, you have been silent; you have not even been prepared to do the courteous thing and advise the House of the circumstances surrounding the motion. Mr Truss-Leo will get up and apologise now. Mr Leo MCLeay-Don't hold your breath.",22
21,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,Don't hold your breath for Leo to apologise for his own failures.,22
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their correct title.,22
23,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"One of his many failures is his inability to apologise for those failures. On that occasion of the bungling of an income tax bill, the Assistant Treasurer failed attend the House to oversee the passage of legislation for which he is responsible. As a result, government amendments which should have been moved were overlooked. The next day the government had to scramble to resurrect its bill. On that same day in February, the government's mismanagement was reflected in the Main Committee, which was unable to commence proceedings due to the absence of government members. That was only six months ago. You could not start the Main Committee because you could not get your blokes out of bed earlier enough to get down to the Main Committee to do what they should be doing and what they are paid to do by 10 o'clock in the morning. So, whichever way you look at it, it is a shambles. I think it is a symbol of a wider problem within the government. If they cannot run the parliament, if they cannot even get their men and women to turn up when they are supposed to, when the bells ring, how can they fix the country's debt? The country's debt is $180 billion as of yesterday, an all-time Australian record. What do we find during question time? These guys have just forked out $816,000 to Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull so that they can preside over, in the last 12 months, the loss ofMr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",22
24,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Here is an abuse of a point of order, with a spurious point of order.",23
25,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"The honourable member for Watson will get the call from his seat. If he rises in his place in the chamber, Adams, D. I will give him the call.",23
26,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your protection. Mr MCGauran-He does not understand the rules.",23
27,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"He treats this parliament basically as a joke and that is why this thing Elliott, R. P. is a shambles. That is why we have had this unprecedented motion. I hope people appreciate the depths to which this government has fallen. (Time expired) Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",23
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,"If the honourable member for Watson rises in his place, he will get the call. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am rising as the Chief Government Whip.",23
29,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,The honourable member does not have carriage of the measure; the minister does. The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,23
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS,I refuse to recognise the honourable member for Watson. The question is that the motion be agreed to. I call the honourable member for Gippsland.,23
31,Mr MCGAURAN,BUSINESS," Mr Deputy Speaker, the behaviour of the Chief Government Whip, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), in the last 60 seconds or so again highlights his total failure to understand the rules and workings of this place and at the same time reveals his ongoing contempt for the parliament's proper workings.

NA NA BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 August, on motion by Mr Johns: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Reith moved by way of amendment: AYES ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the provisions of the bill NOES and whilst recognising that this bill provides some improvement to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, the House is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act remain a disincentive to job creation, that they impose a heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and that they were enacted without proper prior consultation"".",23
32,Mr SWAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I would like to continue with the points I was making before I was so rudely interrupted last evening by the disruptive tactics of the opposition, which continued throughout yesterdaythrough important questions which they say go to the heart of the economic debate, when they did not bother to tum up for the MPI, when those opposite did not bother to tum up for debate on what they say are very important provisions in the industrial relations legislation.",24
33,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Mr Rocher)Order! I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member. The level of noise in the chamber is far too high. I ask honourable members to keep their conversation down.,24
34,Mr SWAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"As I was saying, before I was NA so rudely interrupted last evening by the cynical political tactics of those opposite, I was talking about remarks that had been made by the New South Wales President of the Metal Trades Industry of Australia. He said: Manufacturing is presently growing almost 50% faster than the overall economy ... As a consequence, the decline in the relative importance of manufacturing in Australia has been arrested with the sector's contribution to GDP in fact rising modestly from 15 to 16%. He was really saying that we have had some notable successes in manufacturing industry, and he went on to talk about the reasons why that was the case. Firstly, he made the point that we have become more enterprise focused, recognising that competitiveness is built and tested at the level of the firm. He went on to make the point that we have built new relationships in the workplace, encouraging management and employees to share a sense of citizenship of the business with enhanced cooperation and consultation being central to this new approach. He then went on to point out that we have established new markets with exports of higher value added manufactures growing by an average of 15 per cent over the past five years; that we have lifted our productivity performance, with manufacturing productivity growth being at least double for that of the economy as a whole; and that we have moved to reform our approach to and efforts in training in the workplace. I make these points because if you took the point of view of the opposition about the importance of this legislation you would come to believe that none of these things was true-that we were not having productivity growth and export success and that we were not more competitive. The fact is we are, and we have that point of view put by someone not from this side of the House but by the President of the MTIA of New South Wales. Those opposite would have us believe that this legislation would inhibit all those achievements that he spoke about. But it does not; the opposite is the case. We have a strongly growing economy with strong productivity growth, and an increasingly competitive economy which is delivering record jobs growth on the back of record investment and on the back of competitiveness. That was all confirmed yesterday in the national accounts. I would like to quote briefly from the BT Australia summary of yesterday'S national accounts, which said: When one looks at the National Accounts, the phrase ""This is a beautiful set of numbers"" comes readily to mind. That is not a quote from anyone on this side of the House but from BT Australia-'a beautiful set of numbers'-and it is entirely correct. Of course, it is completely inconsistent with the analysis of the economy from those opposite. The BT Australia analysis of the national accounts yesterday backs up what the Governor of the Reserve Bank has been saying for many months now. In a speech on 11 July, he said: Discerning listeners among you will know that, even allowing for some ""catch-up"", five years of 3 to 4 per cent growth has a different ring to it-and certainly a truer ring-than hollow sounding throwaways, like ""five minutes of sunshine"". The national accounts of yesterday and the sentiments expressed by the MTIA of New South Wales blow away all of the doomsday predictions that have been put in this House by members of the Liberal and National parties. The Governor of the Reserve Bank went on to say: We would be in real trouble . . . if those responsible for monetary policy decisions allowed themselves to be persuaded to follow even a fraction of the short-term swings in sentiment we see in financial markets (and elsewhere). I should imagine that 'elsewhere' refers to many of those doomsdayers opposite. The economy is growing fast and it is growing fast on the back of sacrifices made by Australian workers who have recognised the need to make this economy competitive. It is growing on the back of the partnership between governments and the union movement which comes together in the Accord. The Accord is delivering great benefits to Australia. It is making us more competitive. It is creating the conditions necessary to underpin the export push over the last decade. It has been wage restraint on the union side during this period which has meant that there have actually been declines in real wages, not ones that have been particularly appreciated by the work force but ones which they have worn in the interests of overall economic recovery. What do we get in this House in this debate about this bilI? We get calls for further declines in real wages and the abolition of the industrial relations safety net and to give increased powers to employers to basically rip away the award system. As I said before, what the Accord has done for those on the shop floor has demanded not only responsibility but sacrifice. Over the past decade it would have been possible for unions in favourable conditions to have broken ranks and exploited situations to gain benefits for their members that would have undermined the economy. They did not do that. They do not do that in the interests of job creation and the long-term economic growth of this country. If the policies put forward by those opposite would come into play, you would blow the Accord away. When you blow the Accord away, you blow away any chance of a prolonged low inflationary, high growth economy. Those opposite will blow that away. (Quorum formed) The remarks I was making go to the heart of the wages policy of those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has supported two wage increases in 14 years of $16. That is $1.1 0 a week for 14 years. That is the attitude of the opposition to working people in this country-$1.10 a week. They support the bank fees and charges that many banks are unfairly putting on low income people in this country. If you are a low income person in this country, you would pay $24 a year if you had under $500 in an account. The Leader of the Opposition has supported wage increases of only $1.10 a week in 14 years. I have noticed those opposite have been getting a bit cocky lately. When this fact is put and reput out there right around the country, you can be sure that wages will be a central element of the next election campaign. Their attitude and opposition to the safety net increases that this government has continually supported will be noted amongst working people. How can opposition members claim to represent battlers? What a joke! They have supported wage increases of $1.10 a week for 14 years and claim to represent battlers! They do not. They have never supported wage increases, and they do not support the Accord. If they cannot support the Accord, they cannot deliver on growth because they cannot deliver on low inflation, and then they cannot deliver on jobs. That is the central element of the debate running up to the next election campaign. When we look at what has occurred in other parts of the country, we really get down to the nitty-gritty of the attitude of opposition members to industrial relations. They support Jeff Kennett's minimum wage in Victoria of $8.60 an hour. (Time expired)",24
35,Mr COBB,PAIRS,"The main purpose of the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill is to change the totally unworkable unfair dismissal laws in this country which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) originally brought in under the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. They became operable on 30 March 1994. Since then, there have been numerous changes to those laws. They were changed under the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No.2), becoming operable in June 1994. They were refined again when the regulations made under the Industrial Relations Act were changed, especially section 30B, relating to exclusion of certain employees. Today we are debating the third change to these laws, and the minister still has not got it right. The coalition has pointed out to the government time and again what is wrong with these laws so that the laws could be changed. The minister refused in every case to accept that, but with the passage of time he has had to keep changing the laws. Of course, the reason the government are making these changes now is that it has become so embarrassing to them that they want to clear the slate before the next election so that they do not get any further flak from this area. But it is not going to work. We have had in excess of 10,000 cases filed for hearing before the Industrial Relations Court in the short 15-odd months that this legislation has been operable. If the minister would only look at the heartache and strain it has put on family businesses, the cost to these businesses and the sheer utter waste of money spent fighting these ridiculous cases. Above all else, the legislation is inhibithg employment. Tens of thousands of workers have not been put on in jobs because of this legislation. I hear some rumblings from the other side. Even Bob Carr, who is now Premier of New South Wales, said about this legislation on 30 April: There are kids going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provision works in the Federal law. He went on to say: The Federal provisions are a handbrake on employment growth ... I want to revise the Federal law. If we can, there are going to be more employers taking on young people who would otherwise be unemployed. The Premier of New South Wales clearly recognises the deficiencies in this legislation. It has been strongly loaded towards the employee. Bureaucracy has overruled the merits of the case that are to be heard and there has been no regard whatsoever for the people who create the jobs, namely, the employers. That is epitomised by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he made comments such as, 'Small business operators who can't make the grade should give up and get ajob.' Mr Hicks-Shameful.",26
36,Mr COBB,PAIRS,"Shameful, indeed, as the honourable member for Riverina says. The Prime Minister also went on to say, 'This is as good as it ever gets.' If he is truthful in that statement-which would perhaps be a little unusual for him-it is time this government went. That is the only conclusion you can come to. I would like to highlight four examples of how ridiculous these laws have been. I take one example in New South Wales from journalist Anna Obrart of the Australian Financial Review. She is head of employment law at Townsend Partners Solicitors. She writes: ... the driver of an LPG tanker was not accurate in filling out his employment application form. He forgot to report that he had previously rolled a truck, an accident which may have barred him from being employed as an LPG tanker driver. After he was employed, he broke the speed limit on an interstate run. He cheated by fiddling his hours. In clear breach of company policy, he did not provide his name to another driver after he had damaged the other driver's car in an accident which he had caused. He failed to turn up to a disciplinary meeting. A second meeting was scheduled. He failed to provide an excuse for not turning up at second meeting. When he finally did turn up, he was rude and abusive to the employer. Guess what? The employer dismissed him. But what did this fellow do under this legislation? He had heard about what a lurk it was. He immediately lodged an application before the Industrial Relations Court. What did the court find? She goes on to write: The court acknowledged that the employee had lied about the hours worked and noted that the employee's attitude to work left a lot to be desired. So far so good. It goes on: Yet, despite the many acknowledged breaches on the part of the employeethe court found that it was the employer who was in breachbecause of procedural technicalities, for heaven's sake. It appears that the merit of the case had nothing to do with it whatsoever. So the employee had to be reinstated to his former position despite this track record. The court has put someone out there who is an unsafe driver. The court also ordered that he had to be treated as if he had been in continuous employment when he had been sacked; therefore, he was awarded compensation in excess of $20,000. Mr Hicks-Unbelievable.",27
37,Mr COBB,PAIRS,"Unbelievable, indeed, as the honourable member says. Let me give an example from Western Australia. A fellow working in a funeral parlour actually mixed two corpses up. One was to be buried and one was to be cremated. He mixed them up and the wrong body was cremated. The fellow was sacked. He had also heard about what a lurk these ridiculous industrial relations unfair dismissal laws were. He took it to the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. They found that he had done the wrong thing, but the company had to pay $8,000 compensation to this employee. It is worth reading out the note on it. It states: An assistant at a Perth funeral parlour who was dismissed after two corpses were mixed up and the wrong one cremated has won $8,000 compensation in the IR Court of Aust. The Court heard that the cremated body was supposed to have been buried the next day, but was put in the wrong coffin. At the the time the case was being heard, relatives of the two dead men were considering taking action against the company . . . for grief suffered as a result of the mix up. The company claimed the dismissed man's failure to check the identification tag on the body before both preparing it for the funeral and placing it into the coffin amounted to gross misconduct. What do you tell the relatives who tum up'I'm sorry, you've been to the wrong funeral'? They dismiss this person, and he wins $8,000 compensation under this federal legislation. That is incredible indeed. There are two cases in my electorate that I want to dwell on. They are mundane cases in some ways, not spectacular, but this is the sort of thing that is going on. A person who runs-I will not identify the name-a small family manufacturing and engineering business in one of the larger towns in my electorate contacted me about a fellow whom he had dismissed. The fellow had a bad record of not turning up when he was needed, particularly for overtime, as is required in the state award that he was working under. The fellow was rude-I will not use the words he used-to his employer. Eventually, after a number of warnings, he was dismissed. The employer contacted me about it because the employee claimed compensation under the industrial relations unfair dismissal laws. I received this letter, dated 23 January this year, back from the Senior Adviser, Ashley Mason, of the office of the Minister for Industrial Relations: Since your letter was written, the Industrial Relaout tions Court of Australia has found that your company acted within the law in dismissingthis fellow. He continued: I hope that this decision lays to rest many of the concerns which were expressed in your letter. So far so good. He then went on to say: The provisions do not prevent an employer from dismissing an employee, as I believe your case demonstrates. Instead, the IR Act simplyand I stress the word 'simply'requires an employer to have a valid reason for a dismissalas the court found that this fellow had. Following this letter, this fellow appealed again. This company had to go back to court-and they do not get their legal costs even when they win the case-and fight it all again. In his last letter to me, he said: . . . the costs will run into tens of thousands of dollars ... as we are suffering financially, mentally. In the appeal the court found that, while they had adhered to the state law, there was a transgression of the federal law, which overrides the state law in this case, and they had to shell out on top of this another $1,300 compensation to this employee. It is madness indeed. This business is at its wits' end. All that pales into insignificance compared with another case in a major town in my electorate, and again I will not mention names because I do not want to distress the people there. This business, which is a carpet and curtain cleaning business, is run by a family. There are three members in the family-a husband, a wife and a son-and they employ a full-time person plus an office girl, who works almost full time. It is a little family business, which has been in business for some decades. The business is struggling to do the right thing. It is trying to keep its head above water in the recession, because when a recession comes in the first thing you cut out is getting your carpets cleaned. They wrote this long letter to me about this person they put on. It states: Employment commenced on 24th November, 1994 ... related to us, and over the years had helped us casually on a few jobs, so he knew beforehand what type of work he would be doing and how our business operated. He did 7 working days intensive training, to learn how to use the machinery properly and the cleaning procedure we followed, he was then carefully watched and instructed further on what we expected each day, each job he was given was explained, he was constantly instructed regarding care of customers property and our property . . . we could keep close contact with him and be on hand for anything he was not sure of (our other van did all the more complicated jobs and most of the travelling.) he was very confident, and although we constantly revised him and reinstructed him on procedure and he was going quite well. We randomly rang customers to see if they were happy with their jobs he did, and they were. One month after that, they said: Our first major problem happened on 22nd Dec, 1994 when he was sent to clean a lounge suite and some carpet, he didn't put plastic coasters under the timber table and caused a permanent furniture stain on the carpet, so we had to claim insurance to replace the carpet. When questioned about this he said ""yes, I thought about that but thought I'd take physically and the chance"". He was cautioned on his negligence, and told to lift his effort in all aspects, as we had also found that he had started to tell lies about his jobs, times he was at the jobs etc. The second major problem was on 1st February, when he was sent to a customer's house to clean a lounge suite (we had cleaned it regularly before without problems). The customer rang us with a major complaint saying he had used his floor presprayer on the lounge suite, it was covered in watermarks and had taken two days to dry-had never been cleaned this way before. She also had to wash her curtains and window, as he did not move the lounge away from them and they were badly watermarked. The lounge had to be put through insurance as he had permanently ruined the material and the customer fixed the curtains. (we use a small hand held spray bottle to pre-spray lounges and this was how he was trained.) When questioned about this job he had no excuse, he had been fully trained and had cleaned quite a few lounge suites before, using the right procedure. He was given a second warning regarding his job, and although he settled down again, he still continued to lie about what he had done and we constantly had to check up on him. Including changing his equipment out of the new van into an older van as he was bumping into things and not looking after the new one no matter how much we requested him to take more care, and it was not 12 months old. I know this is tedious detail for some, but it is the sort of care that small businessmen have to takeMr Hicks-To survive.",27
38,Mr COBB,PAIRS,"To survive, as the member says. The employee took some time off at this stage and, when he came back, they say: ... the employee's first 5 jobs after that resulted in 3 of them being call backs for bad workmanship. One of them for once again overspraying a lounge and marking the wall. We warned him againthis is the third major warningabout his work performance, but he did not seem to care ... We felt he wanted us to dismiss him, and was pushing for this ... They go on to say: Our third major problem came when we received a complaint from a customer from where he had cleaned a lounge suite on 3rd May. It took a while for her to let us know as it was her parents' house, and they were away, we tried to fix the problem but the facts are, he once again used the floor pre spray (in blatant defiance to instructions) on her parents' lounge suite, he didn't wall, he didn't wipe over the wet timbers immediately, but left it to the customer, when it was his job to do it, and completely disregarded every instruction he had been given repeating the same mistakes he made 1.2.95 only worse. We could not put this one through insurance (we felt they would wipe us if we did as it was the same operator, for the third claim-and an actual repeat of the same error from the second claim-we have only had one claim in 11 years before this, and that was for all a mat that went out of shape and was disregarded as a carpet manufacturers fault not ours when it was settled.) The wall has to be repainted (had just been painted that week) the lounge timbers have to be sanded back and restained and part of the lounge replaced. And the lounge recleaned as he didn't even pull it away from the wall and clean the back. All up it is going to cost us over $1,000that is, for that job. They talk about another instance: On the same day, 25th May, when he was asked to talk to one of us about the situation one last time he just said ""cut the crap, I'm leaving any rate, I'm not happy with the job and I haven't been happy for months."" We also discussed that he hadn't been doing his jobs properly or looking after his van & equipment properly. It was mutually decided he would leave in a week. There were many more complaints and incidents involved but I have TRIED to cut it to the quick. They then go on to talk about the new operator who started up the next day when it was: · . . discovered that the machine had been overfilled with oil, and if this hadn't been found out it was very probable that it would have blown the oil seals on our new machine and ruined the motor. · .. we had a meeting and decided even though the employee only had 3 more days with us, we felt he couldn't be trusted, he could do untold damage to our equipment with a flick of the wrist. Or in helping on a job with the new employee he could damage some other customer's property. We rang the Department of Industrial Relations award advisory service, explained the circumstances and asked if we were in our rights to dismiss him immediately, we were advised we had the right to dismiss him immediatelywhich they did. But they then go on to say: · .. his brother works in this field for Telecom in Sydney and is well versed in the law regarding dismissal rights and we felt that every actionthat he has takenhas been calculated so he could bring this claim pull it out from the against us ... which he has done. I will not go on about the other things but they say they could list further misdemeanours and other things that he had done wrong. They say: We are a small business, in the country and our business is reeling under the recession set back and now the drought. We are not whingeing about this, but coping and trying to improve our business and fighting back. But, when this type of thing happens, some questions need to be asked. Where are our rights as Employers and owners of our business to protect our livelihood and what we have worked for all our lives. If he wins his awarded any amount of money, it will be the ""proverbial straw that broke the camels back"" and a family business that has been built up over a period of 11 years will no doubt demise. We are only just holding our head above water now. It has been to reconciliation. They tried to steer him in the right direction there, but he would not settle. He wants six months compensation pay for his dismissal. It now has to go to the Industrial Relations Court. This little company which now has a $30,000 overdraft against the bank-I rang them yesterday to check where it was up tohas run up thousands of dollars of bills. They are at wit's end. They have to hire solicitors to fight this case. They have to bring customers into give evidence before the court to show that they were correct. It has already cost them $15,000 and it still has not gone to court. They are distraught beyond belief because of this minister's legislation. For what he has done in causing hardship to this family, because of the ridiculous laws he has in place, he ought to be ashamed forever more. I know it is a mundane case. It may seem almost trivial to some, but it epitomises the thousands of cases that are out there. I know there are changes being proposed here today at last but by no stretch of the imagination do they go far enough. The Industrial Relations Court was only set up in 1994. There are 10 judges on it already. Its full-time staff is already swelling from 52 to 86 staff this year. It is costing $12 million to run. We have never had an explanation of why we need a specialised Industrial Relations Court as opposed to a real court. There is a lot wrong with this legislation yet. (Time expired)",29
39,Mr TANNER,PAIRS,"Melbourne) (11.12 a.m.)The Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill amends the Industrial Relations Reform Act in four specific ways. They are as follows: first, an application with respect to alleged unfair dismissal has to commence now in the Industrial Relations Commission rather than the Industrial Relations Court with the obvious intention of ensuring that a number of cases are resolved by amicable agreement at an early stage and therefore minimal cost to both parties is claim against us and is ensured. Secondly, it is now specified that the Industrial Relations Commission can by agreement between the parties have binding arbitration in a particular case. In other words, the parties have the capacity to minimise their costs by having a decision made, which is binding on both by their agreement, by the commission rather than the court. Thirdly, amendments are being made to ensure that the legislation does not apply in state jurisdictions where the state laws have adequate remedies for employees who have alleged unfair dismissal. Finally, in dealing with the matter the Industrial Relations Court has to consider all of the circumstances of the case both procedural and substantive. I found it ironic that the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) in his contribution was referring to a case in which clearly the predominance of procedural considerations was the basis on which the court made its decision-that is, the truck driver case. That is the very problem one of these amendments is designed to cure. With the legislation, as it will now stand, where you do have some degree of procedural failure or procedural unfairness on the part of the employer, it will not be sufficient by itself to found an unfair dismissal case. The question of the substance of the issues involved, what the employee has done and whether they have come up to scratch will still be considered. I think that is a very important and worthwhile change. The issues in this legislation and the amendments ultimately go to the core of the question of power in our society and to the issue of whether the employment contract is to be deemed in our society to be just another contract or whether it is to be seen for what it is; namely, one of the foundation stones of the social structure. There is a long line of both common law judicial interpretation and statute law in English speaking countries on the question of the rights of employees in respect of their work and on the questions of unfair dismissal and remedies that employees who have been arbitrarily or capriciously dismissed by an employer have. The first major case, which established the common law position with respect to unfair dismissal, was the Adami case in 1909 in England. From memory, that was a case determined by the House of Lords. It was held that the maximum damages an employee can obtain for unfair dismissal is the term of the contract. In other words, if you are hired on a weekly basis, if you are paid weekly, then if you are dismissed by your employer unfairly the best you can obtain at common law in damages is one week's pay. At contract law in common law, there are two remedies historically: damages and specific performance. It was also held in this case and other cases that specific performance of an employment contract is not going to be awarded by a court. These are decisions that have very heavily influenced the common law in this area in Australia. The reason given-I think this illustrates the flaw in the traditional common law position with respect to employment-is that to have anything else could ultimately lead to a quasi slavery position. In other words, if you have an employment contract that the employee wants to get out of by resignation or whatever, and the employer wants to continue, to allow the employer to specifically enforce the contract against the will of the employee would effectively be slavery. The employee does not wish to work for that employer any more, but the employer would be able to force that employee to do so. The reality of that, of course, is that such a situation is fairly unlikely to arise. The reverse situation, that of an employee who wants to continue to work for an employer and the employer who wants to get rid of them, of course is infinitely more common. This illustrates the basic weakness in the common law position, which is ultimately the reason you have to have legislation with relation to unfair dismissal. Implicit in the common law position, as one would expect, with its origins in 19th century British liberalism, is the notion that the parties to an employment contract are equal, that in reality, in the practical real world that we live in, the employee and the employer are equal. There are some instances where that is true, but they are, in real terms, a relatively small minority. In the vast majority of cases in employment contract situations, the power is predominantly with the employer. If any members of the House would like to discover the reality of that, then they should just go out, as I have done as a union official, and start representing them because you learn very quickly that the real power in the employment relationship is almost always with the employer. If you have a situation where the law treats the two as nominally equal when in fact they are not, the end result is that the law does not mean very much and the protection it offers to employees is minimal. That was the case with British and Australian common law for many years. Attempts to restrict the employer's untrammelled right to hire and fire have been at the centre of the battle between labour and capital since the industrial revolution. It is notable recently that we have seen an American entrepreneur, Jack Simplot, take over some Australian companies and make statements with respect to his desire not to employ anybody who was a cigarette smoker. It was interesting to see him on TV the other day saying, 'I'll hire who I like.' In other words, there is no possibility for anybody else-the society at large, the labour movement, the government-to say, 'No, there are certain rules about how you hire, when you hire, who you hire and the like.' That reveals the real bottom line position of employees generally; that is, the employer does not want any restriction at all on their power to decide who will be working for them and who will not be working for them. Employers basically oppose any form of unfair dismissal protection for employees. The great difficulty in this matter, in reaching some sort of sensible and balanced unfair dismissal legislation, is that the government and the labour movement are negotiating with forces in our society that do not acknowledge that there should be any unfair dismissal protection at alI. That is the big problem. It is very hard to have dialogue on an issue with a force that does not even accept that what you are talking about should exist. If you want an ilIustration of this, just look at Victoria. 1983 there was no unfair dismissal protection at all in Victoria. The federal system was hopeless because of the former Liberal Attorney-General, and subsequently Chief Justice, Sir Garfield Barwick, and some of his more legally creative interpretations. For example, it was deemed that there was no right of a federal award employee to take an unfair dismissal case, because, after that person had been sacked, he or she was no longer an employee and the employer was no longer the employer-they were an ex-employee and an ex-employer. Because, under section 51 (xxxv) of the constitution, an industrial dispute had to involve an employee and an employer, there was no longer any industrial dispute because it was now a dispute between an ex-employee and an exemployer. That is a classic example of conservative sophistry designed to produce a particular outcome-namely, no rights for workers. The Victorian system that was introduced by the Labor government was not flash. It had substantial weaknesses. For example, I was involved in a case brought in July 1991 by five employees of Coles New World who were sacked essentially for union activities, for standing up for their rights. That case was taken on behalf of them by their union-by me-to the Victorian Industrial Relations Commission. Now, four years later, we are still waiting for a decision. I could cite examples of matters which I litigated in the Victorian commission in 1987-when I was first a union official-which had still not been decided when I left the clerks union in 1993. The vast majority of cases in that jurisdiction were settled between the parties for very small sums-a week's pay, two weeks pay, changing the dismissal to a resignation and the like: things that, in the vast majority of instances, were a minor fleabite to the employer, with very little reward for the dismissed employee. Since the election of the Kennett government, that admittedly inadequate system has virtually been gutted. That is the reason why we need federal legislation. This act was introduced to ensure that alI workers in Australia have the ability to seek Until justice if they are arbitrarily or unfairly dismissed. This is the second time that the legislation has been amended. We have heard alI sorts of wild rhetoric about backflips and things like that when in reality what is happening is finetuning based on experience. Experience has demonstrated that, yes, procedural matters have let cases succeed when, on the merits, they probably should not have succeeded. Therefore, there is a need for amendment-surely a sign that the government is closely monitoring the legislation to ensure that the balance is kept at an appropriate level. At 9 June of this year approximately 10,000 applications had been issued, of which 7,300 had been concluded. Ninety per cent of those had been settled by agreement between the parties. If my experience in earlier unfair dismissal matters is any guide, the vast bulk of those will have been settled for pretty small sums of money-some of them for no money at all but for things like changing the dismissal to a resignation. Of those that have been contested, the worker has won 276, the employer has won 217 and in a further 194 cases the employee has withdrawn the case. It is probably true to say that there have been a few isolated decisions that have been rather peculiar, but I caution members to be very careful about listening to one side of the argument. We had from the honourable member for Parkes a very evocative and interesting account of a couple of cases, and at first blush some of those things can sound a bit disturbing. But you should always be very wary of judging any matter until you have heard both sides of the argument. For example, in the case of the funeral parlour employee, questions come into my mind about procedures, training and a variety of other possible issues which could explain the events that occurred. Obviously what happened is very shocking, but just to assume that it was his fault, without having heard anything on his behalf, would be a grave mistake. It is very easy to scare people about these issues but we should be very careful about making judgments about any individual case without having actually heard the alternative point of view-as presumably the court or the commission did. The core issue in this is the nature of the work and employment relationship in our society. In my view and in the view of people on this side of the House, workers have some form of equity in their jobs. They determine in most cases where they live, their living standards, their social relationships, their esteem and their standing in the community. They are the dominant part of people's lives. For most people, the employment contract is, after the family, the most important part of the social framework in their existence. So it is natural that they want to struggle to assert some degree of power or some form of control over that relationship and to preclude the other party in that relationship from having completely un trammelled arbitrary power to just dismiss them at a whim for no valid reason whatsoever. The employment contract, in the view of people in the Labor Party, is different from a contract to buy a loaf of bread. That is the difference between the two parties. The Liberal Party's view is that ultimately they are the same thing; it does not mattef. They believe that it is a contract between two equal parties but, if there is unequal economic power, so what! The consequences for an individual worker of an arbitrary dismissal can be extreme. They can receive a black mark against their name for having been sacked. In some cases, workers because of age may find it difficult or impossible to get another job. They can experience separation from their friends in the workplace and the social network that is usually built up around work. There will obviously be a loss of income and potential unemployment for a serious length of time. Why should an employer, without any form of recourse to an independent umpire or a proper decision making authority as to whether or not the dismissal was done fairly and properly, have the arbitrary power to remove these entitlements from an employee? We need to look at the line that we get on these issues from the coalition. Ultimately, this issue demonstrates that the coalition is a class based party: it is a party of employers; it is a party of the better off; it is a party of the wealthier elements in our society. Also, this issue demonstrates that the coalition's claims to represent battlers in our community are hollow and hypocritical. We have not heard in this debate what form of unfair dismissal regime the coalition would support. It is fairly easy to criticise and say, self- 'Yes, you got it wrong here and there,' but have they come out and said, 'Look, here's the unfair dismissal system that we would propose; here's the system that we would operate under; these are the rights we think workers should have'? No, they have not. Why haven't they done that? Basically, they and the people who support them do not agree that workers should have any unfair dismissal rights at all. Political pragmatism at both state and federal level will probably mean, as it has with the Kennett government in Victoria, that those opposite cannot absolutely and totally destroy an unfair dismissal regime, but they will try to gut it from within; they will try to leave a sham, a shell, a facade, which gives the appearance of some rights but which in reality removes most of the them. It has been said-apparently the New South Wales Premier has concurred with this-that the unfair dismissal legislation has impacted on employment. These sorts of claims are very hard to test. If you look at the critical test of what sort of employment growth we have had since the act has been in force, you would have to question those claims. Clearly, we have had very high employment growth since the unfair dismissal legislation has been in force. So there is not much evidence, apart from anecdotal evidence, of the unfair dismissal legislation restricting employment. I am happy to concede that there probably are instances where individual employers have not employed somebody because they are frightened about potential unfair dismissal cases. But, in those cases where it has happen ed, is it because of the content of the legislation or is it because of the hysterical scare campaign that has been run by some employer organisations and the coalition on these issues? What you have had is a gross monumental beat-up of the threats to small employers, medium sized employers and the like in respect of this legislation to the point where, if any decision has been taken by individual employers not to employ because of the legislation, I would suggest that it is not because of the substance of the legislation; it is because of the scare campaign that has been run by the conservative forces. If you are arbitrarily dismissed, why shouldn't you have the right to have some form of umpire's decision about whether you have unfairly had removed your livelihoodyour social network, your self-esteem and your capacity for future employment? In the vast majority of cases, the workers do not get their job back and they often get very limited compensation. These issues are, in a sense, a broader window into the industrial relations policies of the coalition. In an era when massive international change is occurring, the profit share in the economy is back to the highest levels on record and wages have been restrained, they want more power for the employers. They do not just want the employers to get what they are getting now and workers' power in society to be what it is now; they want the shift to occur even further. Change is happening in a variety of ways in industrial relations. Enterprise bargaining has emerged because of changes in the structure of production in the workplace. In the past, awards that covered thousands and thousands of people were appropriate vehicles to deal with contract of employment issues across a very wide range of people, workplaces and the like. But diversity in the workplace and the production process means that those issues often now have to be dealt with at a more micro level. That is why that change is occurring. This government is managing that change, ensuring that reasonable rights for workers are retained, that the imbalance in power between employees and employers is not exacerbated, and that there is a safety net which ensures that basic social protections are provided for people who are economically and industrially weaker. That is evolutionary change. It involves ensuring that those who are weaker are protected. The Liberals want to tear away the safety net. They want to make sure that employers have untrammelled power, economically and managerially, and unfair dismissals are the sharp end of their position. Finally, with regard to the suggestion that unemployment is higher in Australia because of the regulated labour market, we need only have a comparison with the United Kingdom, where there is a totally deregulated labour market, bodgied unemployment figures to minimise the number of people who are unemployed, and unemployment levels that are roughly the same as Australia's. The comparison with New Zealand that is often made by the coalition misses one critical point-that in the last few years in New Zealand, starting under the Labor government and subsequently under the National government, the real incomes of different levels of society have diverged enormously. They carry on about the gap between rich and poor in Australia. If they want to see a real problem on that front, they should look at New Zealand. The key thing that has been brought about by the sorts of policies they support in New Zealand has been a massive increase in the gap between lower paid workers and people who get a better reward for their labours. I commend the legislation to the House. (Time expired)",30
40,Mr TUCKEY,PAIRS,"O'Connor) (11.32 a.m.)Speeches made by such persons as the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), who was, of course, a career trade unionist prior to becoming a career politician, are always made with a very limited understanding of the genuine problems and, for that matter, aspirations of working people, which many small business owners get to understand in a very interesting way. These people do not have academic backgrounds. They are not lawyers. They are just ordinary people who have frequently started in a job with other workers and, through their energy and savings, have advanced to owning their own small business. Mr Deputy Speaker, I remind you-it is a pity the member for Melbourne did not hang around for a minute-of the remarks of one of the most respected Labor politicians in recent years, Kim Beazley Sr. He said that when he joined the Labor Party it represented the cream of the working class, and when he left it it represented the dregs of the middle class. They are not my words; they are the words of one of your more respected and long serving members in this parliament and, of course, a minister in his time. The simple facts are that people who run small businesses in particular, and people who are really suffering from the impact of this foolish legislation, are people who were working people, who were wage and salary earners and who earned it at the coalface-not as school teachers, not as university lecturers, not as professional trade unionists. Of course, something like 14 of the last 18 Labor members to come into this House came from that sector. That is no doubt the reason that Kim Beazley Sr felt inclined to make those remarks on his retirement. Those ordinary working people who have elevated themselves to this dreadfulaccording to the member for Melbournecategory of employer have a very good understanding of the aspirations of their work force. They also are keen to employ and retain them. There is no class distinction; there is no boss-worker attitude there. In fact, I would defy the few present here today to walk into the average small business and instantly identify the boss. He or she frequently looks very similar to, dresses very similarly to and works at the same rate and in the same work and safety conditions as everybody else employed there. If you spot someone in long socks and neat grey shorts, you can bet that he is not the boss but the visiting salesman. You create this farrago that the boss always hates you. The simple fact is that, while you can convince workers of that, you, the trade union official, have a job and you stay in the job. It is not like that in the workplace. In so many small businesses I know, it is a fact that the employers go down to the pub for a drink with their blokes after work. I have served beer in that situation over 20 or 30 years. Unlike your legally qualified previous speaker, the member for Melbourne, I as a hotel keeper used to spend most of my time mixing with them. I know how they think and I understand their needs. Let me tell you this: when those sorts of people move from being a worker to an employer, they have learnt one thing very clearly-good workers arc still hard to find. Good, reliable staff who can go and do a job on their own are hard to find. When those people are found, employers stick to them like glue. The great tragedy in any small business is the day one of those people tells you they are leaving. An interesting thing in this argument about people's rights to compensation is that nobody-bar me-has ever stood up in this place and said, 'What about the boss?' A boss takes on someone, who frequently has limited skills, and trains the person in the business. During that period, the boss may not get the level of production that warrants the salary that the arbitration system dictates, but does it and eventually builds these people up to the point where someone else recognises their value and takes them away. I cannot blame individual employees for improving themselves. That is what the Liberal Party is all about. But it is amazing that when the boss walks up to someone and says, 'I have got to let you go' - maybe because the bank manager rang him that morning and said, 'If you don't reduce your payroll, I will bounce your cheques' - he is a villain and he should pay compensation. Take a look at the reverse procedure where a valued employee wanders in one day and says, 'I am leaving.' From my experience of years ago employees have said, 'I'm going up to the next town 600 miles up the track; I think I have had enough of working for you.' You say, 'But there is no work up there,' and they say, 'We know that, but we have saved a bit and we can get on the dole when we get there.' Why is it that in that circumstance, if this principle properly applies, there is no compensation for the boss? You laugh at that prospect because bosses are nasty; they are dreadful people-notwithstanding the fact, as I have pointed out, that half of them started as employees and took that giant step, usually mortgaging their houses and their families' future. Very few people start their business the day they tum 18. They simply start in a job. Employers are never compensated when their valued employees leave. The simple point I want to make is that there is not a boss in existence who comes to work in the morning with a sneer on his face thinking to himself, 'Who can I sack today?' and who does not have grave concerns for his employees. That is the other problem-the member for Melbourne has probably never had to sack anyone in his life. It is a very difficult thing to do. The joke is that there was a rule that employers had to confront the individual personally-it was a convention-and tell them they were leaving. It was considered totally improper to send them a letter through the mail saying, 'Don't come Monday.' In small business that was an absolute no-no, but these laws make it obligatory. That is outrageous. Everything in these laws is designed to widen the gap between employer and employee. Let me give you an example that occurred in the last couple of months in a business run by my son and elder daughter. This bloke was actually promoted. It was the worse thing we could have done for him. I say 'we' because I talk to my kids and they tell me what is going on. Within a short period of time in his new position, and contrary to written standing orders, this bloke left a cash register in a very exposed position, with the key in it, and, around the comer in a rather exposed office, he left the lid off the floor safe. Both were unattended. He had obviously done it before because the guys that came in and scooped the money out of both of them-about $3,000-did not waste any time. We possibly could have made the allegation that he was involved. Was he sacked for that? No, he was not. He was counselled. Then, in another aspect of his responsibilities, he allowed people conducting retail outlets associated with the business to purchase goods that were in stock in the wholesale establishment. He knew about it because that is where he was. It hit the cash flow of that business to the tune of about $150,000. Was he sacked for that? No, he was not. But it became obvious-this is the new rule-that it was time to write him a letter and ask him to lift his game, and that is what they did. They put down in writing the matters about which he had been counselled. His performance did not improve in a general sense and, 10 and behold, through his negligence, a brand new lawnmower was stolen out of the place that was under his control. That was the last straw. They dismissed him. They took advice. They had followed due process. They got to the arbitration commission, where the commissioner said, 'You have the opportunity to go on to the court but let me advise you that you will lose. Count yourself lucky and just pay this person.' The previous speaker made the comment that these payments are always small amounts. This was a month's wages, some thousands of dollars, and that is not small bickies in a small business, particularly when you have not got it. The commissioner advised that this matter be settled after he put this question to my two children: 'In the process of giving him all these verbal warnings, did you threaten him with the sack?' They said, 'No, we just consistently drew his attention to the fact that he wasn't doing the job he had been employed for.' They gave him evidence of some pretty serious breaches but he said, 'If you didn't threaten him with the sack each time, by due process you have lost.' Imagine the typical small business person, walking around their establishment with two or three employees and seeing them doing something wrong-they might just be breaching their own safety rules. It would be no good him saying, 'Johnny, don't do that again. Please lift your game. Please be more careful.' He has to add, 'If you don't, I'm going to sack you.' What would the atmosphere be in that sort of workplace? What decent employer would want to conduct themselves in that fashion? It is outrageous. Here we are with a piece of law that says, 'Don't communicate verbally with anyone; don't just quietly sit them down and tell them that you think they need to improve their effort this way and that way. Write them a letter and threaten them with the sack.' That is your legislation, not ours. I find that outrageous. We go from the outrageous to the stupid. I got a phone call the other day from a constituent who runs a roadhouse. That person employed a female casual operative on weekends. She rang up during the week and said 'Listen, boss, I can't come on the weekend: I'm otherwise engaged.' He said, 'Okay: you're a casual; thanks for giving me a couple of days notice. I'll get somebody else.' And he did. The following week she rang again and said, 'I can't come this weekend either.' He said, 'Okay, I'll get the girl I got last weekend.' Then she rang the third consecutive week with the same message. He said, 'Thanks very much for ringing again. The other girl's doing a good job. You're a casual. I think the easiest way is to discontinue our arrangement. I'll keep the other girl on.' Job for job, I might add. This woman took him for unfair dismissal - nd won, and he had to pay her compensatIon. As he handed her the money, she said, 'Thanks very much, I won't be coming back.' She never had any intention of coming back when she rang the first time of three. This bloke was not an ogre; he did not have horns and a tail. He is just a battling service station proprietor in a small country town and he wanted to give someone a job over the weekend to assist him. How stupid can the system be when that guy has to payout? .1 was confronted in Katherine the other day With a felJow who dismissed a person-that person is currently in court for substantial embezzlement-and he has had to pay him $30,000 for unfair dismissal, notwithstanding that the other case is not even concluded yet. You would think that the processes would allow for the matter of theft and embezzlement to be established in the court before another case could find there was an unfair dismissal. It is just ridiculous. It is creating atmosphere in the workplace that is outrageous. The honourable member for Melbourne also quoted the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, who said publicly, 'This legislation is impacting on employment.' The honourable member for Melbourne does not really want to know about that, so he queries the statistics. Let me give an example that was brought to my attention of how that works in terms of people in employment. If you get a group of people working at a part-cular job, you might have a problem with one of them, !llaybe the most senior. You go and take adVice and they say, 'There is no way that you can sack that person; they would take you to the cleaners under the existing unfair dismissal law. Let me tell you how to get out of it. Sack everybody in the department and outsource the operation. That then becomes a restructuring. You are entitled to do that. You can restructure and out source in a fashion that is entirely different from what you have now and you achieve whatever efficiencies you want and you get rid of this person or persons.' But that might mean six people lose their jobs when the target is only one. That too comes under the category of the stupidity of this legislation, and that is what is now happening. Can you remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, how many years ago the word 'outsourcing' had never been heard of and never mentioned in this parliament? Why do you think it has happened? It has happened because of the government's legislation. Outsourcing was not - word of the Fraser government; outsourcing IS a word. that was always in the dictionary but to which you people have given a special meaning. This proves another point. In the end, whatever your tax laws, whatever anything else that is unfair and wrong, people will find a way around that. We will be back in here soon wanting to pass legislation that says that you are to outsource only half your business or some other rubbish, because outsourcing is also not very smart from the point of view of trade union bureaucrats. Very few outsourced staff join a union. They are killing their own business, but they have been doing a very an good job of that for a long time. You only have to look at the figures. The public sector has 67 per cent union membership, and what is it down to in the private sector, where people have a little more choice? Twentyseven per cent. Unions are starting to offer overseas holidays to people who join. They are saying, 'Come join us. Have an overseas holiday.' Is that why you join a trade union? You would think they were Coles. But workers will not be had. I think Deakin University recently did quite a comprehensive survey of workers and their attitude to trade unions. Forty-seven per cent of them said, 'We are in a trade union because that is the only way we could get the job. We have no faith in the officials. We do not want their help, but we had to buy our job.' This is Australia-the country, as noted this year in Australia Remembers, which was fought bitterly for by the now older people in our community. We fought not only to defend this bit of real estate; we fought to defend a few values. I always thought one of those was that, if you wanted a job and someone was prepared to give it to you, you ought to be able to have it without some restriction, like paying up to get through the front gate. It is about as un-Australian as bowling underarm. The simple facts are that this legislation will improve things a little bit but, with the examples I have given you, I can assure you it is reducing people's opportunities to get jobs, it will reduce trade union membership and it is very foolish. Let me say in closingthis has been referred to-of course people should have access to an independent umpire if action is brutal and unfair, but it has also got to be fair to both sides. In the examples I have given, clearly the employer had a right and in fact the employer should have been able to go. (Time expired)",34
41,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PAIRS,"I am pleased to support the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 and the proposition that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. The words that are proposed to be omitted by the opposition are all words after 'That'. That means the entire legislation. That does not make a great deal of sense to me. The four members of the opposition who so far have spoken in this debate have recognised, rather belatedly I think, that this legisthat lation represents improvements to the industrial relations legislation as a whole. While this bill will amend six acts, some of those amendments represent purely technical changes. Some of them are of moderate importance. Perhaps the most important are those amendments which concern unfair dismissal. If I have time. I also want to say something about one provision of this legislation about which I am concerned, and that is the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal. I listened as much as I could to the contributions made by the four members of the opposition who have so far spoken in this debate: the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). I am not going to say, even though on some occasions in relation to some of the observations and comments they made. I may have been tempted to, that they sounded like rednecks in connection with industrial relations and their attitude towards employees. I stop short of saying that. Let me say that on occasions some rednecked sentiments were expressed. No-one denies the fact that there are difficulties in the whole area of industrial relations of one kind or another. The very fact that governments enact legislation in an attempt to deal with some of those questions indicates that there are problems and inadequacies. Legislators and governments have a responsibility to review those inadequacies and attempt to do something about them--especially when one of the fundamental issues involved is one of equity, is one of civilised behaviour, is one of mutual respect and is one about the way in which human relationships and humane relationships should exist between people. I and others could have been forgiven, in connection with some of those comments made, for believing or thinking that Australia still remained in the period when we had masters and servants. We no longer live in an era when we talk about masters and servants, thank you very much. One of the fundamental principles by which the International Labour Organisation carries out its responsibilities is labour is not a commodity. No, labour is not a commodity. Let me assure members of the opposition and the wider community that, while democratic socialist parties like the ALP are in government, those governments will not tolerate any arrangements which may view labour as a commodity. A lot has been made about the fact that there have been 10,000 of these unfair dismissal examples brought to the industrial relations process-l0,000 out of a total employment of wage and salary earners in Australia of 8Y2 million. So you can throw off a figure such as 10,000. The implication of that is that most of them are vexatious, unreasonable or fraudulent. Let me indicate what those 10,000 matters represent. Over 10,000 matters under the unlawful termination provisions of the IR Act had been filed with the court by 9 June this year. Approximately 7,300 had been finalised. Only seven per cent of the applications, however, were dealt with by the court. These figures contrast with a total of 452 other matters-matters not related to unfair dismissals-that were lodged with the industrial court by 29 May this year. Of the approximately 7,300 matters concluded, over 90 per cent of them were either settled or discontinued. Of the contested matters determined by the industrial court, 276 have been decided in favour of the employee and 217 have been decided in favour of the employer-that is about 500 out of the 10,000 matters we have heard so much about. In terms of settlement, they have been evenly divided between employers and employees. It does not take me a great deal of intelligence to try to assess what message members of the opposition are trying to convey. I will say something more about that almost immediately. In 86 cases the employee abandoned his or her application and in 108 cases the employee simply failed to appear. I said that I would deal almost immediately with some of the attempts that have been made to convey certain attitudes towards this legislation. I said there were redneck attitudes towards employees. Yes, there were. But members of the opposition attempted to give the impression that they were being so calm, so dispassionate, so objective and so fair. Were they indeed? Of those 10,000 cases, we have heard examples from members of the opposition of what they consider to be, I suppose in a sense, aberrations in the whole area of industrial relations. There cannot be too many of them. Let anyone go through the Hansard. There cannot be too many cases, because most of the speakers repeated the same cases. What did they refer to? They referred to examples of theft. They referred to examples of lies. They referred to examples of sloth. They referred to examples of dishonesty, of misrepresentation, of abuse, of absenteeism, of assault and of sexual harassment. That is fairly clever. If you want to discredit something which is designed to protect the nature of the relationship between employer and employee, pick out a few particular cases that you think can be used to misrepresent that legislation and to discredit it. How better to discredit legislation than to say, 'Now, here is a person who thieved from his or her employer and had to be reinstated.' There were 10,000 cases-and I have indicated what happened with those 10,000 cases-out of 8V2 million wage and salary earners in Australia. If the implication of the comments and the contributions that have been made is that workers in Australia are thieve< and liars and are slothful, dishonest people who misrepresent and abuse their employers, who are deliberately absent, who molest others, who sexually harass and who assault, I reject it absolutely. It has been mentioned as well by othersthese are those same people who have been drawing our attention to some of those particular cases where, in order to amass sufficient information to fill a speech of 20 minutes, they had to repeat examples which were given by some of their colleagues-that during the last 14 years, and this better than perhaps anything else indicates their attitude towards the welfare of employees in Australia, they have-that is, members of the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)supported only two wage increases for employees in Australia. Those wage increases represent $1.10 per week. That means that, if the opposition had had its way over those 14 years, the wages and salaries of wage and salary earners in Australia now would be $1.10 higher than they were 14 years ago. We have heard the comments being made about the battlers. We have heard members of the opposition talking in passionate, concerned tones about the battlers. Let me make it perfectly clear, if it needs to be made clear: there is one political party in Australia in a position of political responsibility which shows any continuing concern for the battlers, which has put into place whole structures of legislation and arrangements to make sure that this country we live in is a civilised country, with civilised relationships, civilised rights and civilised entitlements, as well as civilised responsibilities. That is the Australian Labor Party, and no other. I do not try to convey the impression that Australian workers are thieves and liars, that they are slothful and dishonest, that they misrepresent and abuse their employers, that they are regularly absent from their workplace, that they molest and assault others and that they sexually harass their workmates or subordinates. I do not try to create that impression at all, because it is not true. Those who want to discredit this legislation, of course, have tried to convey that impressionbut I do not think they have done so very successfully. One member of the opposition also expressed concern that technical inadequacies in the procedures adopted by an employer to terminate the employment of an employee had brought about the reinstatement of the employee. In some sense, members of the opposition have suggested that technical inadequacies which bring that about are a fault of the law. We are presumed to know the law. We are required to know the law and act according to it. But when it comes to a question of the law which relates to unfair dismissal, members of the opposition see the fault as lying not with those people who are presumed and expected to know the law but with the law itself. So you discredit the law because there was some technical inadequacy in the preparation of the dismissal case by the employer. Murderers and rapists have been released from custody, dismissed by the court as a result of technical inadequacies in the law. Workers deserve no less. Who would suggest that, if there were technical inadequacies in a case brought against an accused murderer or rapist, he should be locked up anyway? That is not the way we operate-nor should we. That is not the basis of our criminal law-and it is not going to be the basis of our industrial law either. Criticism has been made also of the fact that there have been three occasions now since 1993, when the initial Industrial Relations Reform Act was enacted, on which the act has been amended. So what? We review legislation, we review the adequacy of the legislation, we look for deficiencies, we seek to find improvements and, when we identify and find them, we enact amending legislation to correct it and make it better. To my mind, that concept of unfair dismissal is completely unexceptional. Of course there are examples of unfair dismissal. As the legislation makes clear, if a dismissal is harsh, unreasonable or unjust, it is unfair. If that has the effect then of depriving a person of his or her livelihood, they are entitled to some redress; there should be remedies available. If a person has been unfairly dismissed, what are the remedies which might be available? The first remedy is reinstatement. If that is not possible or practical, then the second remedy is compensation. Would members of the opposition prefer that we fine, flay or incarcerate the employer responsible for that unfair dismissal; is that your preference? So far, members of the opposition have made a lot of reinstatement or compensation. What are the alternatives? They are the only alternatives available to an employee who has been unfairly dismissed. Perhaps we should look at the employer who carried out the unfair dismissal. Perhaps instead of providing some sort of compensation or reinstatement for the employee we can provide a penalty against the employer. Oh, no--God forbid! No such suggestion has been made by members of the opposition, nor would I make such a suggestion. The sensible solution to circumstances of that kind is to provide either for the reinstatement of the employee who was unfairly dismissed or appropriate compensation. When industrial relations is enacted people who are involved in the industrial relations area have a responsibility as well to make sure they know the law. Despite those criticisms by members of the opposition about the legislation, let me cite what some other responsible authorities and organisations have said. Ian Spicer, for example, from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, 'ACCI welcomes this bill.' This is the bill from which the members of the opposition want to delete everything after the word 'that'. Ian Spicer said: ACCI welcomes this bill which implements the federal government's recent commitment to amend procedural fairness laws to specifically recognise voluntary arbitration by the Industrial Relations Commission in the act to provide that applications are made to the commission, not the court, and to preserve the operations of the more realistic systems. The government has demonstrated its bona fides. Ian Spicer, not Martin Ferguson, not Barry Jones, said that the government has demonstrated its bona fides by introducing this bill. The AceI believes the bill should establish a more realistic federal framework for dealing with unfair dismissals. He also said, 'The federal government has taken account of the ACCI views.' Yes, we have. We consulted. The ACTU supports it. Bert Evans from the metal trades industry said the amendments are consistent with proposals put forward by them. The Chamber of Manufactures said that improvements need to be made now in the handling of unfair dismissal applications. That is the nature of this legislation. It is good legislation which is based on civilised concepts about the social nature of the productive process which involves employers and employees. (Time expired)",38
42,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"I rise to speak on the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill. We ought to pick up where this bill was being debated last night and indicate the government's interest in this legislation. They were not even prepared to keep the House sitting last night, would not even keep the numbers of the House here so we could debate this legislation. That shows just how at this stage in the period of this parliament the government has lost its direction as to the real purpose of even having parliament. The Chief Government Whip (Mr Leo Mcleay) obviously decided it was a great tactic for the parliament to end early last night so that opposition members could not get up and speak on the adjournment. Mr Robert Brown-Never, Chris!",41
43,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"No, never. I notice the sense of interest and enjoyment by the member in my comment. Then we wasted so much time this morning debating procedures of the House. But it really illustrates the fact that the government is not interested in legislation any longer. They are backing and filling to keep the opposition off the air waves. I would like to just pick up on a few comments of the previous speaker, the memstate ber for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). He talked about the ACCI and gave the impression that it was all in favour of this. The ACCI has made some positive comments about it. They were the initial welcoming comments about the changes. That is what the previous member talked abol't-the initial welcoming of the changes. We welcome the changes, but there are still some problems with the legislation. The latest comments by the ACCI are that it has reservations about the following things: onus of proof, lack of a filing fee and a filtering mechanism, the inclusion in the act of the ILO recommendation, costs, the provision concerning absence or sickness, and the lack of power of the commission to determine applications other than on a voluntary basis. I do not know whether it is amnesia or selective quoting or what, but in this place we have people who want to put different points of view. Just to balance it up, I thought I should say what ACCI is now saying so that we have at least a true reflection of ACCI's position. In many respects, I come to this legislation and say, 'It is about balance.' There was a quote earlier from one of the government members. I think it was the member for Lilley (Mr Swan)-about a sense of citizenship at the enterprise place. The people that have really encouraged a sense of citizenship at the enterprise place for over a decade now, where the employer and the employee work together for common goals to benefit the employee and the employer and the community generally, are those in the Liberal and National parties. The Liberal and National parties are the ones who started this debate off in the late 1970s by saying that it is at the enterprise level where men and women, whether they be employers or employees-it does not really matter-have to put their shoulders to the wheel and work together in harmony for everybody to benefit. It was the Liberal and National parties which really started that whole debate off, to refocus away from the confrontational position which particularly the ACTU had built up in this country of ours since, I guess, 1969 in the O'Shea case. After that, the union movement was put above the law of the country, so there was this confrontational period in Australia. I think all of us are glad that a lot of that is now behind us. Certainly in relation to the philosophical and intellectual debate about how we can manage our enterprises better and how we can improve interpersonal relationships between employer and employee, we are glad that is behind us. It has been the coalition that has argued that debate for a long time. Even though the enterprise situation is not fully developed in this country, at least we are moving to that point. I affirm very strongly that the coalition is about having a sense of citizenship at the enterprise level, where there is that sense of cooperation and a sense of working together for everybody's benefit. I think there has to be a large degree of trust. Looking back on the way in which industrial relations legislation has developed in this country, we had it from 1904 up to 1988. The then Minister for Industrial Relations, Minister Willis, said when introducing the bill, which we are amending today: This is the most substantial revision of Australia's federal lR system undertaken since the system was established in 1904. That was a very substantial bill. One would think that if they were going to take on a huge change-he said it was the most substantial revision in 84 years-they would have really got this balance right in the mood in which Australia was then moving. But they didn't. That is why we are here today. The government has to keep on correcting the legislation which they brought in. There has to be a delicate balance. The previous speaker for the government, the member for Charlton, said that we are arguing over minor things. He went through a whole list. I think he included things like absenteeism, lies, sexual harassment, resignations on own volition, abuse, molestation and assault. I got the impression from the previous speaker that these are only minor things and that you could do these at the job site. Mr Robert Brown-No. What I was saying was that they misrepresented the general nature of it.",41
44,Mr MILES,PAIRS,"I got the distinct impression that he thought these things could go on in the workplace. 1 say that they cannot. He gave the impression there are only 10,000, or even less, and that it does not matter if these things go on. Being honest about it, what we are really on about is that we ought to have legislation in place that makes these certain types of actions which have occurred very clear, legislation which certainly rectifies that and gives a clear message that things like, say, 2Y2 years of absenteeism are not legitimate grounds for you to be able to come back and say that the employer has to pay compensation for that. I think we are coming to that point. We ought to have legislation in place-that is what this debate is really about-but we need to use our common sense. We are trying to sort this out so that these ridiculous applications do not blot the system and cause great delays and expenditure. To some people, that expenditure might be minor but other people, to whom it might be a substantial amountwhether it be $2,000 or $1O,OOO-might just say, 'We'll pay compensation and get it off the agenda. We don't want to get into a court case. We don't want to argue it.' That is what a number of employers are doing, and a number of the actions that are now being taken should be able to be precluded by the legislation. Nobody in the coalition wants to see employees ground into the dirt, but that is the impression given by the government. That is definitely not so. Our view is that getting over this huge overseas debt is dependent on Australian men and women, employers and employees, working together. That is the goal of the coalition. There is no way in which this country can survive given the huge increase in debt caused by the Hawke and Keating governments. They have dug a hole for our future generations of Australians. There is no way out of it if we do not have good relationships at the enterprise level. That is what we are about as a coalition-making sure that the type of legislation which comes into this House gives a genuine balance. There is a great need for that balance. I would be the first one to say that there circumstances in which employers do the wrong thing by their employees. Some employers do that, but this legislation is trying to give a balance. The legislation has gone too far one way and has allowed certain applications to come into the industrial courts which really are not legitimate. That is what we are saying-and both sides of the House, I think, would agree. The difference is that government members want to maintain credibility with the union movement. They want a harsher position on employers so that they can go out at election time, beat their drum and say, 'We're fighting for you.' But the consequence for this country is that people have been kept out of jobs, and there is no doubt about that. If you talk to employers-large, small or medium-they will always say, 'Why take on the risk if you are going to have these problems?' This is just one of the illustrations they give. Other on-cost items are involved, but the employers come back and say, 'One of the problems now is the very complex procedures which we have to go through if we want to dismiss somebody who, on anybody's evidence, has clearly broken the rules and is not acting in good faith in his employment.' We have a situation today in Australia where our net foreign debt is $180 billion, having gone up by more than seven times in 13 years. There has been a remarkable explosion of debt. More than eight per cent of people are unemployed, yet there are niche markets in the world which many small business people and companies are operating in and could get more involved in. One of the real retardations for small businesses in this country is the industrial relations situation. That is only part of the problem, but it is still a part. Very few people on the government side have been employers but, if they were to go out there and speak to the 80 per cent of Australians who are employed in small business about the hindrances associated with employing a 16-year-old, a 25-year-old or a 45-year-old, they would be told, 'Look, I agree that there should be a fair procedure, but I've read in the papers that people who have blatantly lied and who have are stolen from a company have been reinstated. If I employ someone like that and go to the arbitration courts or the industrial courts, what will happen? They will be reinstated, otherwise I might have to pay $5,000 or $6,000. It's not fair. The best thing our family can do is to work an extra three or hur hours each and not employ anyone else. We don't want to have that lifestyle, but we're not going to employ anyone while the legislation allows for these vexatious claims to be made.' It also costs the government money to have the courts, the commissions and industrial commissioners held up with these types of claims. The opposition is reaffirming very strongly the fact that we want at the enterprise level a harmonious, energetic and positive relationship between employers and employees. It has to be on a fair basis. There is no doubt about that. There should be procedures through which employers should have to go if they are going to dismiss an employee, but the legislation in this parliament-this is what we are complaining about-leaves open these opportunities for people who were not unfairly dismissed to claim that they were unfairly dismissed. That is what we are saying. I am amused by this government's line that we have a master-servant attitude. Obviously, the polls are saying that the Labor Party has to smear the coalition as having this attitude of master and servant. Let us reflect on the decision by the Labor Party to put Martin Ferguson into the seat of Batman. Was that a master-servant attitude? The masters of the Labor Party determined who would represent the people of Batman. It is the best public example of the master-servant approach in Australia today. Who administers this attitude? The Labor government, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the whole Labor Party machine. The people who talk about masterservant attitudes are the old socialists who are still around, but they are still active. Here we have a classic example. The members of the community should have been able to select from the grassroots of their community a person to represent them. But the masters brought in the bigwigs. They rolled them into town, placed them in a house and said, 'This person will represent you up in Canberra.' Isn't it marvellous to be in a debate in which this concept of master-servant is portrayed? The coalition moved away from the masterservant attitude a number of years ago, but the Labor Party is still in it up to their eyeballs. The old socialists are still working away at it. But it does clarify the Australian people's image of the difference between the parties. The coalition is about cooperation, understanding and working things out. In the great enterprises of Australia today, you will find that the manager talks with the employers, has a good relationship with them and encourages them to give ideas about the whole business structure. I think it would be great to have more employees involved in share ownership of the companies within which they work so that they can feel part of it and contribute to the management ideas which develop. A lot of good companies are doing that. But it is very frustrating for some companies and small business people to know they can have these vexatious type claims brought against them. For many starting out in small businesses, it is a deterrent to providing employment. We are debating these issues so that we can have better legislation, so that this country can hum along much more effectively. Obviously, it is not humming along too well, otherwise we would not have this huge overseas debt or high unemployment. The reality is that we must have good workplaces. We must have a sense of balance, with fairness on both sides. There must be structures in place so that both sides-employer and employee--can go through those processes and make sure that people get a fair deal. At the moment it is very clear that the system is still biased. I have no doubt that in another two or three years, or even less, we will be back here considering this legislation again. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) contributed to the debate on the legislation on 23 May 1988. He mentioned some of the problems with the legislation. The first point he mentioned was that the compliance provisions for unfair dismissal were unequal. We have gone on for seven years, even though the government was alerted to the fact, and now they are moving to change it slightly. But the government was warned and during this period of seven years businesses have suffered-and individual employees have suffered and have been led up a garden path, quite frankly, because their claims were vexatious and ultimately they lost out, anyway. Even though they may have been compensated, they lost their credibility and so on. The coalition is saying: let us get some balance in this. Let us get it right and let us make sure that at the enterprise level there is a sense of citizenship and of working together for the common good.",42
45,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"I am pleased to speak on the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. This bill will do a number of things. It will ensure that all unfair dismissal applications commence in the Industrial Relations Commission rather than in the Industrial Relations Court of Australia. It will allow voluntarily binding arbitration of claims by the AIRC to encourage non-legalistic solutions. It will allow any state system to operate which provides an alternative, adequate remedy which generally conforms with ILO convention No. 158, and it will require the court to consider all the circumstances of an unfair dismissal case in deciding whether a dismissal is justified and what remedy should be given if it is not. It goes to some other issues and I will certainly be canvassing some of those during my remarks. The legislation amends the Industrial Relaindustrial tions Act 1988 to clarify that the Industrial Relations Court of Australia can have jurisdicto tion to enforce coal industry awards made the Australian Industrial Relations Commisthe sion in the combined exercise of Commonemployer wealth and state powers. This amendment complements the amendments made by the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment· Act (No.2) 1994 to integrate into the maintrial stream industrial relations jurisdiction jurisdiction previously exercised by the Coal Industry Tribunal. It also makes some minor amendments the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the Defence Act 1903 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The Industrial the Relations Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1994 is amended to remove a provision that would have used the constitutional trade and commerce power to give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission a wider jurisdiction in coal industry matters because of the integration that has been achieved. I was interested to hear the remarks of the member for Braddon (Mr Miles). I note that he is now on the back bench. Unfortunately, the thinking that he was pursuing is very to reflective of the front-bench. His mathematics be. do seem to be rather poor. Some 10,000 cases have been brought before the court, but he fails to mention that we have actually created 670,000 new jobs in the lifetime of this government. Indeed, the government's period in office has been marked by the lowest industrial disputation in a very long time. We are also looking, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said yesterday, at the longest sustainable inflation growth this country has experienced since the late sixties, early seventies. course, it suits the opposition to talk about foreign debt and to make all sorts of scurrifor lous and mischievous imputations about it. We can only reflect on the nature of truth, which has been a great issue in recent days in this parliament and in the media. The fact is that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has been consulting with all the players in a time of very rapid change. You actually have to have amendments to legislation because you want make Sl-re that the mechanisms you put in by place will work. We have consulted with all players-state jurisdictions, the unions, organisations-and, therefore, have brought in a number of amendments that will seek to improve the situation. At the bottom of it, we will not put in place a set of induspractices that effectively say to employ the ees, 'Take the contract or take the sack.' All this pie in the sky we have heard from the member for Braddon-all this new, to wonderful, born-again goodwill between employers and employees and how it is all going to be wonderful-is not the policy that opposition brought to us at the last election. Two and a half years down the track, I do not know what the opposition's policy is. I do not think it has one. We have heard all sorts bf warm, fuzzy noises from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the industrial relations spokesperson, the member for Flinders (Mr Reith), but I am not reassured, and I do not believe the people of Australia will be reassured, by an alternative government of this country that is not prepared to have the courage of its convictions say what its industrial relations policy will Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that the coal mining communities of Central Queensland which form my constituency remember Blackwater and what the current Leader of the Opposition tried to do. No amount of posturing from the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott)-who mentioned the meatworkers in the course of an aside across the chamber, which I will refer to low somewhat later in my remarks-can change the fact that this opposition is trying to Of minimise itself as a target for any sort of the sustained analysis of what it actually stands and is hoping to slide in at the next election on a platform of no policies and warm, fuzzy noises. It simply will not work. The opposition have said-and I am sure I will be corrected subsequently if I am wrong-that they will certainly not accept any Accord arrangements with the ACTU. That is a very marked difference between the government and the opposition. I want to comment on the key objectives of Accord Mark VIII, which has just been signed off in recent months with the ACTU. One of the reasons we now have at the end of the 1990s a fair, inclusive and socially just society that we can be very proud of is the role that the trade union movement has played in this country, both in its industrial wing and its political wing, in making sure that the rights of working families have figured in the discussions and the decisions that have been made to the benefit of this country. Historically, the political wing of the union movement-the Australian Labor Party-has been prepared to live up to our commitments, under the ILO conventions, to make sure that the work and family related responsibilities of working people are respected. Slowly, employers-in some cases kicking and screaming-have agreed that there is some justice in the claims that we have made. A great deal has been achieved in the lifetime of this government in this area. It is therefore very disappointing to see some employer organisations steeped in industrial archaeology, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said. It is the sort of thinking that comes from the other side. Let me remind members of the key objectives of the Accord Mark VIII. This is the commitment from the peak employee representatives: sustainable economic growth and substantial reduction in unemployment; a lower inflation rate to ensure continued economic prosperity; enhanced national savings; a better retirement income for all workers; and maintenance and improvement of living standards. They are the key features of Accord Mark VIII which the government and the ACTU have been able to develop. That is the sort of responsible attitude that our trade union movement has taken to important national issues. It is not the sort thing that the opposition would ever be able to negotiate because they are coming from a completely different standpoint. I fear that in the, thankfully, unlikely event of the opposition sliding into power on the basis of no policies at all the Accord will be out the window-ideologically, the opposition could not handle such a sophisticated negotiationand we will revert to industrial disputation. Workers, quite understandably, will seek to improve their position at the cost of a wages push that will affect inflation. One of the most important things that we have been able to achieve, with the cooperation and support of the trade union movement, has been to break the back of inflation. That is what will improve the outlook for the country . We have also been able to get trade union commitment to the importance of a national savings plan-something that the trade opposition has never been able to come to grips with. When the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer and was advised that such a plan was necessary, he said that it was all too hard. It has always been too hard for the opposition to bite the bullet on the important issues that would make a difference to our prosperity. The opposition sit on their hands, as they have always done in government, and it has been left to a Labor government to pick up the pieces.",44
46,Mr SLIPPER,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, a point of order: I think the honourable member has forgotten that we are addressing the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill. She has taken us on a somewhat convoluted tour through the Accord. I am just wondering whether you are going to ask her to come back to the matters before the House.",46
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Vaile)Order! There is no point of order. Since I have been in the chair listening to the debate it has been fairly wide ranging from members on both sides.,46
48,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am very keen to speak on these issues. The other important thing to say about the unfair dismissal laws is that the amend of ments we are looking at will go a long way towards expediting getting through the log jam of cases. But nothing will change the fact that there are two parties involved in making sure that such matters do not get to the courts. There is a huge responsibility on employers to make sure that, as part of their enterprise agreements, they have effective ways of dealing with issues when employees are not measuring up to their responsibilities. There will be no difficulty with the unions when there are fair and reasonable provisions in place. I am sure we will see support for these amendments from the trade union movement. I want to go to the changes that we have put in place, particularly in relation to the coal industry, which is part of the changes that we are making in these amendments. It is fair to say that many of my constituents, who are members of the CFMEU mining division, expressed great concern about the incorporation of the Coal Industry Tribunal into the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Although I am sure there is still concern at the coalface-indeed, there are currently a number of disputes, subsequent to the incorporation on 1 July, happening in both New South Wales and Queensland-I am pleased to say that at the national conference, which was held six weeks after the incorporation, the general vice-president, Tony Maher, had some very positive comments to make. Justice Deirdre O'Connor was also reported at that meeting. I will quote from the September 1995 issue of Common Cause. Tony Maher was talking about the first six weeks experience, indicating that perhaps employers may have overestimated the benefits of the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal. He said the important thing that we can see is that it has enabled the union to 'legitimately pursue protected industrial action in pursuit of enterprise bargaining agreements'. He is quoting an issue at CRA's Vickery mine. He continues: Vickery employees are the first in the history coal industry to have a legal strike. The reaction the Commission has been cautious and constructive-it will conciliate the differences rather than penalise the workers. The other thing that I think there was a great deal of concern about among members of the CFMEU mining division was that the former chairman of the Coal Industry Tribunal, Deputy President Duncan, would not be available to do all of the decisions. A number of commissioners and cross-jurisdictions from both Queensland and New South Wales are involved. This process was apparently working quite well. The article continues: This is consistent with advice given to the union prior to the abolition of the Tribunal, that the AIRC . is first and foremost a facilitator rather than a arbitrator. In a dispute concerning the failure to implement the underground work model, Deputy President Duncan agreed to a union suggestion to attempt to conciliate the differences between the parties. It is very promising to see that at an early stage at least the union was quite positive. I quote once again: It will probably be at least 12 months before we can say for certain how workers will fare under the new system. The union remains extremely cautious about the system and has ensured maximum coordination between the national office and district officials in these early days. I am very reassured to see that, in spite of a lot of reservations, the national body of the union is taking a very constructive approach to this new era in the incorporation of the CIT into the national group. At the same time, it is the responsibility of union officials and IR people at different sites to make sure that there is a constructive enterprise model, and they must educate both management and workers. In the few minutes that are left to me I want to make reference to the meat processing industry, which the member for Maranoa made an aside to. Here is an example of great concern to my constituents in Rockhampton and an example of how, under a coalition government, we would see the law of the jungle take over. What we have seen from AMH over a long period is an attempt to rip apart any kind of reasonable industrial posiof the tion for the meat workers. Members of that of work force-and, indeed, other members of the union-were very concerned about whether our industrial relations legislation was going to work to protect and support them. I personally attended hearings into the AMH dispute in Brisbane because I was very concerned to make sure that our legislation did work to protect the rights of both parties. I was reassured by the full bench",46
49,Mr KERR,PAIRS,You expressed that concern to me very strongly.,48
50,Ms HENZELL,PAIRS,"I did indeed-and, I might say, to a number of other ministers, from the Prime Minister down. I am pleased to see the minister at the table is able to support that. The people that we represent, the battlers of this country-it is the Labor Party that represents the battlers of this countrymust have confidence that our industrial relations legislation is working to protect concerns. The full bench decision that the commission handed down in Brisbane certainly picked up, in addition to having the trial in place, on the concerns of the union. A commissioner has been delegated to oversee that trial and the negotiations on a new enterprise bargain. I commend the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union, which have put a great deal of time and effort into representations to the commission on behalf of their workers in Rockhampton. I want to make sure that at the end of the day we have a positive enterprise bargain in place that takes into account the concerns of the employees, the concerns of AMH and other meat processing employers and, indeed, the need of primary producers to get their cattle to market. Everybody is in there, and it has to be a win-win situation. The only way you will get that sort of win-win situation is if you have responsible industrial relations legislation in place that protects the right of employers from unfair dismissal. I am sure that AMH would love the policies of the opposition, because they would be able to rip and tear into people and give them the contract or the sack. I do not believe that would be in the interests of the meat industry, primary producers, the cattle industry, our exports or the balance of payments, which the member for Braddon referred to. I support the legislation that the minister has brought before the House. I am sure it will continue the improvement in industrial relations in this country. It is the Labor government that has a proud record of the lowest industrial relations disputation in 30 years in this country. I pay tribute to the ACTU, which is forwarding a very important national agenda for this country to deal with the issues the opposition says it is worried about. We have not seen any policies from the opposition. I challenge it to start putting a few policies forward so that the Australian public can make a judgment about whether it has anything to offer.",48
51,Mr SLIPPER,PAIRS,"Like those people listening to the debate on the radio today, I am sick and tired of hearing their Labor members trot out the same old classwarfare lines, outdated lines from the 1890s. I was also very curious to hear the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) claimI hope I am accurately quoting her-that Labor had created 'a fair, just and socially inclusive society'. This is an amazing statement, a hypocritical statement, given it is being made at a time when the gap between rich and poor in this country has never been wider. The result of 12 years of Labor government has been that we now have close to a million people out of work and numbers of families who have been unable to find jobs for their breadwinners for several generations. Indeed, Australia is at a very difficult stage. The Labor Party has been an absolute disaster. The disaster that the Labor Party has been for this country is proven when one looks at the sad and sorry history of the industrial relations legislation and particularly at the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which is now before the House. This bill seeks to amend a number of acts, including the Defence Act, the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act and the Industrial Relations Amendment Act (No.2) 1994. A large number of those changes are quite minor, but the major changes relate to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 as subsequently amended and most particularly concern the unfair dismissal provisions. As was indicated by the shadow minister, the coalition does not oppose the changes which are being made. But we have a major concern that what the government is seeking to achieve through these amendments certainly does not go anywhere near far enough. The unfair dismissal provisions were introduced as part of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. I must say that the government has rolled over already on a couple of occasions. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) claims that the unfair dismissal provisions were very important and would work, yet this is the third occasion on which major alterations have been made to what were the government's original proposals. It is fairly obvious, from what previous speakers have said, that the unfair dismissal provisions did not get the balance right. They simply have been unfair and they have acted as a brake on employment and as a disincentive to employers to take the risk of putting on an extra person. So we have a situation where the government is indeed having to back down yet again. It is really a wonder why the government leaves the minister in charge of his portfolio, given the fact that he has indicated such gross incompetence in the area of industrial relations during the time of his incumbency. Originally, when the government was introducing the unfair dismissal provisions, it had to resort to the external affairs power because of the limitations under the constitution on the Commonwealth in the area of industrial relations. It resorted to International Labour Organisation convention No. 158. The government claimed therefore that, if Australia was to implement ILO convention No. 158, the unfair dismissal provisions which were included in the original legislation were necessary. The government, I believe, did not properly read the ILO convention and the government took only one of two alternatives open to it. The one alternative the government accepted was the one that, in effect, I believe, destroyed the balance which ought to exist in any fair industrial relations system. The convention said, referring to termination, that: (a) the burden of proving the existence of a valid reason shall rest on the employer, and/or (b) the competent bodies shall be empowered to reach a conclusion having regard to the evidence provided by the parties and according to the procedures provided for by law and practice. The government adopted the first of these two alternatives and, of course, that means that the fragile balance which exists in any industrial relations system was tipped very much in favour of the employee. We do not support the principle that there ought to be, shall we say, all authority residing in either the employers or the employees. It is clear that we support a fair balance between employers and employees. But the government has, up until this time, supported the rights of employees at the expense of employment and at the expense of employers. So the government is now seeking for a third time to amend the law. Hopefully the government's actions in bringing these amendments into law will improve the situation. But, as I said earlier, the coalition is concerned that the government is not doing enough and that what it is doing is too late. We see major ongoing problems in two areas. Firstly, as I said, the government's amendments still will not fix up the legislation. Secondly, we are opposed to the use of the external affairs power to intrude on states rights and to intrude on what has hitherto been the constitutional balance. The Commonwealth had to rely on the external affairs power to implement the unfair dismissals provision. Section 51 (xxix) came to the rescue of the Commonwealth. Section 51 states: The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toa whole range of matters. Included among those matters is (xxix), external affairs. As we all know, the High Court over the years has constantly widened the interpretation of the external affairs power and now, of course, the Commonwealth can in effect tear up the Australian constitution by entering into any treaty with any tin-pot country anywhere in relation to any matter. Then the Commonwealth acquires the legislative competence to implement that treaty regardless of what was previously the domestic situation in Australia. The minister really ought to be ashamed of himself because he is someone who ought to understand that in our democracy there ought to be a division of power between the Commonwealth and the states. The founding fathers of this nation, when they drew up the constitution, brought down what was a very well worded document. Unfortunately, the intention of the founding fathers has been tom up through successive constitutional cases, with the result that the Commonwealth at the present time can acquire legislative competence in relation to any matter simply by entering into a treaty concerning that matter. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware that the coalition has quite a different approach to treaty making. Of course, under a coalition government we would not have found ourselves in the position the government currently finds itself in in relation to this particular legislation. I think it is probably helpful if I outline the House what we will do to indicate that we will not abuse the treaty making power as the Commonwealth Labor Government has done in recent years. As a coalition we will ensure that the Australian parliament, the states and the wider community are given proper and timely involvement in international law making by Australian governments, including, where appropriate, cost-benefit analyses in terms of Australia's national interest prior to any ratification. We will also legislate to require that treaties be tabled with provision for debate in the federal parliament prior to ratification. We will also establish a treaties council as part of the Council of Australian Governments, and this initiative will be associated with a general strengthening of the consultative procedures. We will work with the states to ensure that, where possible, domestic legislation is in place prior to the ratification of treaties and we will also establish a joint house treaties committee to provide a detailed analysis of the implications of the prospective signing or ratification of an international treaty by Australia. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) has also pledged that we will refer to our people's convention the question of the external affairs power and whether that ought to be amended so that the original intention of the constitution could once again take effect. The situation is that the Commonwealth Labor government has had an entirely different approach. It has entered into ILO convention No. 158, pursuant to the wide interpretation of the external affairs power given to it as a gift from the High Court. If the federal Labor government had not taken this course of action, if the High Court had not interpreted the external affairs power as widely as it had, the Commonwealth parliament would never have had the legislative competence to carry the industrial relations legislation introduced to this place some time ago by the minister, and as a result we would not have been debating the unfair dismissal provisions that we are today. So we have a situation where the federal Labor government stands condemned. It has not respected our constituto tion and it brings in legislation which patently has been proven to have failed. The whole idea of unfair dismissal legislation is to provide a fair go for the worker and a fair go for the employer. But one is well aware of the very many cases which have occurred in recent times which indicate that the legislation to date has failed monumentally. A couple of cases members may well be aware of really ought to be outlined again, because you cannot outline enough these particular cases. They indicate just how unfair, just how crazy, just how ridiculous the unfair dismissal provisions are as brought into the parliament by the Labor Party. There was a case involving Qantas. A ill'.Ie employee there obtained access to the computer booking records of Qantas to obtain the name of a female passenger. He rang this female passenger and made certain propositions to her. The management of Qantas, naturally being quite upset about this, called the gentleman in and pointed out that his access to the computer records was not for that purpose, and gave him a warning. Most people in society would believe that that kind of conduct should have been subjected to immediate dismissal, but that did not occur and this fellow was given a second chance. Within a few months, once again he was delving into the records-not this time of passengers, but of Qantas employees who were of the female gender. These were ladies who had applied for overtime. This male employee harassed Qantas staff and, of course, they got him in, they sacked him, and one would have thought that that would be the end of the matter. But, under the Labor government's unfair dismissals provision, a claim for unfair dismissal was lodged by this employee, he was reinstated and received a handout of $17,000. I wonder how the honourable member for Capricornia could possibly justify a situation where someone unlawfully gained access to computer records-firstly, of passengers, and secondly, of female staff members-harassed those passengers and staff members, was sacked, and was then reinstated and given a gift of $17,000. Clearly, no reasonable person could support that situation and the minister stands condemned for having brought into this parliament legislation which would permit such a crazy situation to occur. Mr O'Connor-Are you saying that the judge is unreasonable? Is that what you are saying?",48
52,Mr SLIPPER,PAIRS,"What I am saying is that the law the government has brought in has given rise to a situation where a person is given a $17,000 reward for harassing female passengers and female staff members. I do not think the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) could possibly defend the actions of that person. I think this crazy law we have in Australia, compliments of the Minister for Industrial Relations, is pathetic and that is why we are so totally opposed to what the Labor Party has legislated onto the statute books. When the minister came in here, when Labor members opposite spo-e in this place in relation to this legislation, we pointed out that it was unfair. We pointed out that, really, it was quite inappropriate. But the government used its numbers to treat this parliament like a sausage machine. The legislation passed through the parliament, it became law and we find crazy cases occurring, such as the one that I have outlined. There was another one, involving a guy at the University of Queensland. He was a lecturer. Many students went to his lectures, and students, of course, want to pass their examinations. This university lecturer actually sought to exploit female students. What he effectively was doing was suggesting to the female students that if they gave him certain favours he would return the favours by giving them better marks. What happened was that this guy was sacked. I believe that he should have remained sacked but, unfortunately, he was reinstated. How on earth could anyone defend the reinstatement of a university lecturer who abused his position in this way by seeking sexual favours from female students? The result of those sexual favours, of course, would have been that he would have given them very high marks. No-one in any reasonable society could defend this kind of action. Yet this situation has occurred under the legislation introduced to this parliament by the Minister for Industrial Relations. We have had other cases where people who have had 35 days of absence over two years without producing a medical certificate have been allowed to be reinstated. What is more, compensation has been paid when an employer sacked someone who was away for 35 days without a medical certificate. In my own electorate I have had complaints from people who have put on staff members for a short term and, in some cases, the person has proven not to be the right person for the job. The employer has sought to remedy the problem, with the result that he has been hit with a major claim for unfair dismissal. One of the problems that employers have today is that legal costs are very expensive and we find that, in many cases, employees are virtually able to blackmail their employers into keeping them on staff or, rather, into encouraging the employers to make some kind of ex gratia payment to them. The result, of course, is that many employers in society these days are simply not prepared to put on staff. At a time when we have close to a million people out of work it is a criminal tragedy that the industrial relations legislation of Australia acts, in effect, as a powerful disincentive as far as creating employment is concerned. Even Martin Ferguson has said that the industrial relations legislation is indefensible, yet the minister claims that the legislation we are now debating will make a good system even better. Martin Ferguson says the system is indefensible; the minister claims that it is a good system. Clearly, both of them cannot be right. So we have a situation where I believe the government stands absolutely condemned for bringing in legislation which has patently failed, legislation which is unbalanced, legislation which is not fair to the employer and to the employee. I get sick and tired of hearing government members opposite claim that we, on this side of the House, are going to take industrial relations back to the law of the jungle. I get sick and tired of suggestions from the Labor Party that we, as a coalition, do not have a balanced approach and we do not have a fair approach. What we seek to do is to create a situation of fairness between employers and employees. We want a balanced system. The government clearly has got the balance wrong. Bob Carr, a Labor Premier, on 13 April said: There are kids going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provision works in the federal law. There are kids with good training, good education, who are not being given employment because employers won't take them on if they know that down the track, whatever the circumstances, it is very difficult to effect a dismissal. European experience makes it very clear: if you make it complex for employers to vary their employment levels down the track, they won't take on the employment to start with. The federal provisions are a handbrake on employment growth ... I want to revise the federal law. If we can, there are going to be more employers taking on young people who would otherwise be unemployed. The Premier went on to say that he had made these remarks because his union colleagues in New South Wales agreed with him. The government's amendments do not go anywhere near far enough towards solving the problems outlined most accurately by the Premier of New South Wales. We believe, as a coalition, that workers should have access to a process of appeal against dismissal. We also believe that employers and employees who suffer from harassment and discrimination ought not to have to suffer. The principle of appealing against unfair dismissal should be based on a fair go all round and employers should have a right to act in a manner to protect their interests and custom and in a manner to reflect community values. The government has no idea of what to do in this situation. The government has the balance entirely wrong. The amendments before the House, the amendments of the government, are a step in the right direction. However, I am very pleased to support the amendment which is being proposed by the shadow minister for industrial relations. I hope that the government will accept that amendment and that the government will look very closely at its legislation to bring in further amendments which will reflect the sentiments of the coalition. (Time expired)",51
53,Mr OCONNOR,PAIRS,"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to rise in the House to support the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988. The amendments being proposed by the government in the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill are designed to improve federal legislation governing the workplace relationship between the owners of businesses and those who choose employment in them. I commend the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) for the way that he has engaged in widespread and extensive consulThe tations with all the constituencies that have an interest in this legislation-state governments, unions and employers. I would like to take up some issues that have been canvassed by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) over this legislation. I will point out to him that one of the reasons for this legislation in the first place was th- draconian industrial relations legislation brought into state jurisdictions by state Liberal governments. We know how workers in Victoria view the legislative frameworks that govern industrial relations. We have had a series of industrial relations reforms proposed by the Kennett government, and as a result workers have left that system in droves for the sanctuary of the federal industrial relations system. I contest what the honourable member for Fisher has had to say here today because these amendments do represent an appropriate balance in the competing interests between workers and employers. The hallmark of good government is its ability and willingness to continually refine complex legislation governing social and economic activity, and to deliver win-win outcomes for the competing constituencies in this very important area of activity. It is an appropriate time to reflect on some of the features of a good industrial relations system. The relationship between labour and capital in our economy is extremely complex and sensitive. We, as legislators, must strive for the most appropriate balance between the competing interests, and it is not easy to achieve that particular balance in every situation. One very important element of a good industrial relations policy is the way it extracts conflict from an inherently complex and conflict-ridden relationship. Another very important feature of a good industrial relations policy is the way that it stimulates changes in the workplace culture and allows both interests to change and grow in an increasing climate of trust and cooperation. A good industrial relations policy contributes to efficiency and productivity, both in enterprises and in the national economy. If we look at the record of this government since it came to power in 1983, we see some very powerful evidence of the good features of an industrial relations system. We have extracted conflict, as much as we can, from industrial relations. If we go back to the Liberal year of 1982 when the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was Treasurer of this country and had his hand on the levers of economic policy-I might add that the coalition has never had a sustainable incomes policy in this country-the working days lost per 1,000 employees was 783. What is it now in 1994-95 under the Labor government? It is 85 working days lost per 1,000 employees. That is a significant economic achievement, but it is also a very important social achievement. The Labor government has been able to bring an era of unparalleled peace to the industrial landscape. Since 1983, the government has enabled the culture of workplaces to subtly change, from one of conflict to one of cooperation. I would like to outline for the House a very important event which took place in my electorate in the past month. It involved a function at M.e. Herd, an abattoir in the Geelong region and a very important employer. M.e. Herd recently obtained its ISO 9002 accreditation, and is the first abattoir in Australia to achieve this particular accreditation. It is a magnificent achievement, not only for the company but for the meat industry, which, historically, in Victoria has been racked with division, corruption and industrial conflict. To hear the management get up and speak about the way in which they have approached the obtaining of this ISO 9002 quality accreditation warms the heart; and to that hear the union representatives get up and speak about their participation in this process and their pride in the company's achievement says it all as far as changing the culture of workplaces is concerned. It is a magnificent achievement by this company, but it has been achieved within the framework that has been set by a Labor government; it has been achieved with the cooperation of management and their union representatives. M.e. Herd has achieved something that no other abattoir in Victoria or, indeed, Australia has been able to achieve. That demonstrates the point that I am making. Labor in power has managed to extract conflict from industrial relations and has replaced it with cooperation. Such developments impact on the general economy. It has made a significant contribution to improving efficiency and improving national productivity. Australia's competitiveness has improved by some 40 per cent and our economy has made very substantial productivity increases. Those increases have been due in no small part to the cooperation that we have been able to engender in the workplace between the owners of capital and those who sell their labour to the enterprises. The legislation before the House has been proposed after extensive consultation with employers, state governments and unions. Its primary purpose is to streamline the process of resolving conflicts between employers and employees over unfair dismissals. It does this by providing for greater conciliation. It establishes processes for greater consent arbitration. For example, all applications must now be lodged with the Industrial Relations Commission, which will attempt to settle the matter by conciliation. We are simplifying the process-getting it away from the courts and into a room where parties can sit around a table and conciliate their differences. I am sure that development would be welcomed by members on both sides of this House. As I mentioned, the legislation also provides for consent arbitration. That is an optional procedure, as either party can still elect to have the matter determined by the court if it so wishes. As far as state laws and the adequate alternative remedy test are concerned, this particular legislation provides that state laws can be tested against international standards and the federal act to ensure that they comply with the provisions of those conventions and the federal act. Overall, the amendments will ensure that workers will continue to be protected by laws which meet international standards. For employees, this legislation maintains their fundamental protection. For employers, this legislation makes processing claims of unfair dismissal simpler and less legalistic. Thus it is not surprising that these amendments have been warmly welcomed, not only by the union movement but also by employer groups throughout the length and breadth of this country. For example, on 21 June, the ACTU issued a media release which said: The ACTU today said proposed changes to the unfair dismissal provisions in the Industrial tions Reform Act will inject greater faimess into the system, simplify the process and strengthen role of the Industrial Relations Commission as the arbiter of employers and employees. That is a warm endorsement by the workers of this nation of these particular amendments. However, it does not end there. The MTIA issued a press statement on 21 June 1995 which said: The MTIA's Chief Executive, Bert Evans, today welcomed the announcement by the Government that it will amend the unfair dismissal laws to make them simpler, more effective and less legalistic. That was echoed by other employer groups, including the Chamber of Manufactures and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which have supported the amendments to this legislation which is before the House. In no other area of public policy and government legislation are the differences between the government and the opposition so stark. In the Geelong region, which I represent in this parliament, the Barwon River divides the opinion of Geelong workers on industrial relations. On one side of the river is the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) who, in a recent letter to the editor of the Geelong Advertiser, continued to perpetrate the coalition's deceptions on industrial relations to Geelong workers. On the other side of the river, in the electorate of Corio, the workers of Geelong are represented by somebody who will defend their interests, protect their awards and conditions and ensure that they are given adequate access to unfair dismissal procedures. That person-and I can say this with a degree of modesty-is, of course, me. Geelong workers all know where the member for Corangamite is coming from. He has been a Howard supporter for a long time. We know that can be a kiss of death in the political sense because, as the WA Liberals know, if you support John Howard you end up on the back bench. Be that as it may, we also know that the honourable member for Corangamite is an enthusiastic supporter of Jobsback. He has never once on the public record repudiated the 'take the contract or the sack' model of industrial relations that has Relabeen introduced into Victoria by the Kennett the government. In the Geelong region, he has always been one of the coalition's great union bashers and, in his recent letter to the editor, he ridiculed the Accord that has been struck between the government and the workers and their representatives in the ACTU. Let me dwell for a minute on the Accord. It is an example of the government's use of incomes policy and it has delivered great benefits to the national and regional economy. It has laid the basis for sustained growth and job creation and it has reduced industrial disputation to historic low levels. The benefits to Geelong workers have been significant and far reaching. This Accord has underpinned economic policy and reduced inflation which, in the Liberal years, ate into their wages. It has preserved their basic award entitlements in an era of workplace bargaining. For Geelong workers, the Accord has created a safer working environment and has given them access to superannuation for the first time. Remember that, if we go back to the early 1980s, only about 40 per cent of Geelong workers had that superannuation, but now that figure is up around 80 per cent. It has given workers a better deal through lower taxes, Medicare, increased family assistance and increased spending on child care, education and housing. And, of course, it has brought industrial peace to the Geelong landscape. We know in Accord Mark VIII that the interests of Geelong workers will be further advanced. Central to the Accord is the preservation of the award system. Nowhere is the contrast between people on this side of the House and the opposition more stark. The government supports safety net increases, as outlined in the historic Accord Mark VIII which was recently struck. The opposition only gives vague promises in relation to safety net increases. As far as the award system is concerned, the government provides a comprehensive award safety net, including important conditions. The coalition stripped those award conditions back to four basic conditions. As for unfair dismissal, the government protects workers against unfair dismissal but, of course, the coalition wants to abolish it. You would have heard, Mr Deputy Speaker, that recently Ford invested $1 billion in its Australian operation over a period of five years, and it gained a lot of headlines. What honourable members might not appreciate is that the company recently struck a very good enterprise deal with its work force. That particular enterprise agreement-an enterprise agreement, not an individual contract for each individual employee agreement-delivered a wage rise of 12 per cent over two years for the workers and delivered improvements in conditions, sickness benefits, and bereavement and family leave. It also improved leave assistance for emergency service volunteers, gave better training support, better superannuation and $25,000 a year for child-care support. Under the Howard-Kennett industrial relations system, most of these conditions would be stripped away. The award conditions of Ford workers-some 2,500 of them in Geelong-would be stripped away by John Howard, Stewart MCArthur and the Liberal candidate for the seat of Corio. That system has never been repudiated by the honourable member for Corangamite and I can only assume that he agrees with that system. He agrees with stripping away the wages and the conditions of Ford workers and workers in the textile industry. The honourable member for Corangamite continues to try to perpetrate on Geelong workers the great deception that he is interested in their welfare and that he will stick up for their interests. What has been the reaction of Geelong workers to the Kennett industrial relations system? If it was so good, why have they fled in droves from it? That is the acid test. The acid test is whether the workers are satisfied with staying under that system or whether they have moved out of it. Teachers, electricians, hotel and hospitality workers, shop assistants, metal industry workers, clerical workers, public servants, professional engineers, nurses, firemen-the list goes on and on-are the people that have gone out of the state system, the Kennett-Howard industrial relations system, and sought the protection of the federal award system. I ask this question of honourable members opposite: if the state system is so good, why are the workers leaving it in droves? That is the acid test that we must apply to this industrial relations system. The simple fact is that the Kennett Employee Relations Act of 1992 will set only minimal conditions and it will remove from protection the workers' penalty rates, overtime payments, meal breaks, accumulated sick leave, bereavement leave, travel allowance, redundancy payments, shift premiums and paid maternity leave. More significantly, what Jeff Kennett has done is reintroduce a climate of fear and intimidation to the workplaces of Geelong. This is what John Howard says about workplace contracts. On 12 July he said: I have always been a passionate advocate of workplace contracts. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Vaile) adjourned. NA Non-Government Development Organisations: Code of Conduct",52
54,Mr BILNEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Kingston-Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs)-by leave-Non-government organisations working in overseas development and relief, NGDOs, playa very important part in Australia's overall aid effort. NGDOs not only channel donations from members of the public who wish to contribute directly to the alleviation of poverty and distress in poorer countries, but they are also a valued partner of the government in the development assistance program. As well, for many Australians NGDOs provide a chance to involve themselves personally in our aid work abroad. Indeed, in many cases NGDOs become the public face of Australia's aid in countries facing desperate emergencies, and an earnest of the wish of Australians to help directly in situations which tug at the hearts of all of us. A recent review undertaken by AusAID of the effectiveness of its NGDO programs shows that non-government agencies do their often difficult work very effectively. The review found strong evidence that 90 per cent of NGDO projects supported by government funds are satisfactory or better in the achievement of project objectives. This confirms the confidence the government has had in NGDOs, a confidence reflected in the increase in the NGDO share of the official aid budget, which has gone from around two per cent to six per cent over the last decade. Members will be aware that the Industry Commission has just conducted an extensive inquiry into charitable organisations in Australia, including NGDOs. In September 1994, I wrote to the Industry Commission requesting that its inquiry examine the issue of NGDO accountability for public donations. I did this not because I believed there was a crisis of confidence or trust in NGDOs, but in order to reinforce the trust which already exists. I was pleased to see the comprehensive coverage of the accountability issue in the commission's subsequent draft report. In February this year I again wrote to the commission expressing a concern that the process of implementing its recommendations could be a long one, and seeking its views on the desirability of expediting interim accountability standards for NGDOs as a discrete group. I suggested to the commission that I might establish an advisory committee whose main task would be to advance the work on NGDO accountability prior to the introduction of the long-term, more formal and legal arrangements likely to result from the commission's work. I assured the chairman that my action in establishing that committee would in no way pre-empt his deliberations. He agreed that my suggestion could be a useful way forward. On 31 May this year, I confirmed in the House that I had established an NGDO Code of Practice Advisory Committee-COPAC, as it became known-to advise on possible interim measures. I asked that committee to report back by the end of August. I am pleased to announce that this morning the committee presented me with its report. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the members of COPAC, and in particular to its chairman Mr Jim Ingram, for their work over the last three months. I thank first my two colleagues, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), for their valuable contributions to the committee's work. I thank too the Australian Consumers Association and the Australian Accounting Research Foundation for making available such high quality staff officers to contribute their expertise. Special thanks go to members of the NGDO community, and the sector's peak body, the Australian Council for Overseas Aid (ACFOA), for their support and cooperation with COPAC in achieving its objectives. I welcome COPAC's recommendations, and among them most notably that a code of conduct committee be established by October 1995. This committee would be established and financed by ACFOA, and would include representatives of ACFOA member NGDOs, end. other NGDOs, donors and the accountancy profession. It would be chaired by an eminent person from outside the NGDO sector, aptinues pointed in consultation with me. The NGDO sector already has a relatively strong self-regulatory regime, centred on a code of ethics which has been mandatory for August 1995, ACFOA members since 1989. The new arrangements will build on this foundation by and move: establishing an entity representative of the whole sector, and to include sufficient representation from outside the sector to assure objectivity. The first task of the code of conduct mittee will be to develop a comprehensive code of conduct, taking account of an illustraBilney) tive code developed by COPAC, which I includes detailed draft financial reporting standards, the ACFOA code of ethics and who similar codes in place overseas. This commitI tee will then monitor compliance with code and receive and examine complaints relating to the sector. It will be the first time that a comprehen- tariat. sive code of conduct, covering ethical princi- of ples, practical arrangements and detailed financial reporting standards, has been devel- very oped for the sector. That is an unambiguously good outcome, one which I know will be welcomed by NGDOs and their many supfrom porters alike. The committee will develop code of conduct in time for its implementainvolved. tion prior to the next financial year. The government will consider whether or not adherence to the code will be a condition of NGDOs receiving or retaining the tax deductibility concession for donations made in 1996-97. In conclusion, may I stress again that NGDOs are an important expression of the commitment of the Australian public to assist the poor and the needy in the developing world. NGDOs give tangible expression to this commitment by supporting projects which make a real difference to the lives of so many of those who live in poverty. It is crucial that this work continue and that the public commitment which underlies it is strengthened. I believe that the recommendations contained in the COPAC report will contribute to this The process COPAC identifies will result in enhanced NGDO accountability for public funds and thus ensure that the public conto have confidence, as I do, in the vital work of these organisations. I present the following paper: Code of Conduct for Non-Government Development Organisations-Ministerial statement, 31 That the House take note of the paper.",56
55,Mr NUGENT,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"On behalf of the coalition may I say that we also welcome the COPAC report and also the comspeed of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr in agreeing to its recommendations. would like to acknowledge the work of the chairman of the committee, Mr Jim Ingram, at times had a very delicate path to tread. would like to thank too the other members the of the committee and my colleague the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick). And, in particular, I wish to thank the secreI would like to make special mention Dr Kieran Donaghue who laboured long and hard in support of the committee in a difficult time scale. The committee operated in a short time frame and it took a number of submissions the public and the aid sector. It held a the number of face-to-face meetings with those It also employed an accounting firm to look at, in a detailed way, the way that accounts can be presented. As the minister has - aid, the committee has reported on time, although the committee would have liked to have had a little more time if it had been possible. . It is important that the public understand a bit more about the NGDO sector. I learned a lot, and I thought I knew a bit about it before we started. The differing standards of accounting and reporting, the different sizes of the organisations and the different activities that are undertaken are complex and varied. Therefore, coming up with any recommendations that are relevant becomes quite an interesting challenge to any committee. The NGDO sector is also taking an increasing amount of government funding in the aid area. It is a growing requirement that the sector functions effectively, which I think by and large it does, and we are obviously keen to make sure that continues. One would be less than honest if one did not say that, although it was not the prime cause of the committee being set up, we were all conscious of the recent publicity associated with CARE Australia and the prominence that the sector was receiving as a result of that licity. ACFOA, which is the industry body, has 75 per cent membership of those NGDOs involved but in income terms and expenditure terms it has about 90 per cent of the sector. It has its own ethics committee, but we have heard evidence that very few complaints have been lodged with it over the years, although my view was that that was probably because not many people knew that ACFOA existed or that it had an ethics committee. It has been working on a code of conduct for about seven years and it has been working on standardising NGDO accounting standards for some time. However, there was a general acknowledgment in the industry, as well as outside, that the code could be improved, particularly in the area of governance. To end, COPAC produced a sample code which I am sure will be helpful in the development of the full code when it eventually arrives. We had the executive director of ACFOA as a member of the committee, as well as the chief executive of World Vision. World Vision is the largest of the NGDOs in the country by a long way. I have to say that both of those people are to be commended for the constructive way in which they contributed to the final report and its recommendations. There was no question that the industry was very keen to maintain self-regulation but I believe there is a need to be seen to have outside accountability, and that was a view shared by the committee. Put simply, you cannot be both the advocate and the regulator. There is a need to maintain public confidence and to have that degree of independence. We have heard from Minister Bilney about the Industry Commission activity and, of course, the results of that are going to be excellent, I am sure, but they are going to be a long way down the track. So there was a need for action now. In that sense, of course, the government already has at its disposal mechanisms in respect of direct taxation grants and aid. It has, but perhaps does not always use, its powers in respect of tax deductibility status for charitable organisations, NGDOs and so on. There was a need for maintaining ongoing public confidence, pub- and it seems to me that transparency and independence are key criteria for this. I believe that the COPAC recommendations are a reasonable compromise between the desire for self-regulation and objective transparency. We have suggested a code of conduct committee. The industry has the numbers, if you like, on that committee: out of the seven people who will be appointed, three come from ACFOA and one comes from the non-ACFOA members of the industry, so they have the majority on that new body. ACFOA has the secretariat and the administration. Of the three independents, one comes from the accounting sector and one from the consumer sector, and there is an independent chair. Of course, ACFOA will appoint the chairman, but with the agreement of the minister, and it that is important that we recognise that the minister ultimately has much responsibility in this area of activity. The time scales that have been recommended are very important, as well. This is the sort of area where trying to get agreement on a code of conduct or a code of practice from hundreds of organisations could, frankly, drag on for ever. So it is important to set some stakes in the ground, if you like, to aim at. The suggestion is excellent that the code of conduct body should be set up by 1 October this year, a month away, and the fact that ACFOA has agreed to that is to be commended. Having the start of the next financial year, the middle of 1996, as the deadline for that code of practice-including the accounting standards-to be in place, is also an important milestone. I suspect that, if we have the code of practice and the reporting standards in place, a number of the larger organisations will actually put them into practice for the following 12 months to test drive them, if you like, and that some valuable experience will be gained in terms of what the Industry Commission may then subsequently come up with. Then, perhaps 12 months later, those standards might be something which everybody should adopt. There is need for publicity for the code and for the new body itself. The government, as time goes by, must review the effectiveness of what has been put in place. In my view, we need ultimately to look at acceptance of the code of practice by the industry as a key criterion for tax deductibility status. I am aware of our time constraints, so I will conclude by saying that this is an important area of endeavour in our community. It is an endeavour that is supported by many people in the Australian public. Overseas, Australian aid is respected and well thought of and, therefore, this report and the implementation of its recommendations are an important step for many people in our community, as well as for the sector itself. I have confidence in the future of the sector, as I am sure all Australians do, and I commend the report to the House.",57
56,Mr QUICK,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly to the ministerial report on the code of conduct for non-government development organisations. Along with the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), I was lucky enough to be a member of the Code of Practice Advisory Committee. As a backbencher, one does not get too many opportunities in this House to participate in something as important as this report. As a long-time supporter of, and worker for, many non-government development organisations, I welcomed the opportunity presented to me to take part in this committee's hearings and, for that, I thank Minister Bilney. The opportunity to meet with representatives from so many organisations under the ACFOA umbrella as we conducted our consultations throughout Australia, and to renew so many friendships, was one I really welcomed. As the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) has stated, the NGDO sector has a relatively strong self-regulatory mechanism based on its current code of ethics. These new arrall c ments will build on this already strong foundation and strengthen it even further by the establishment of the new code of conduct committee. This committee will include representatives of ACFOA members, of NGDOs which are not members of ACFOA, of donors and also of the accounting professing. A chairperson from outside the sector would be appointed, in consultation with the minister, to ensure that all complaints are dealt with fairly, and this chairperson would have ready access to the minister. The committee's role would be to draft a code of conduct, monitor compliance with the code, and receive and examine complaints in relation to the sector. I think there needs to be wide publicity given by ACFOA and nonACFOA members to the establishment of this committee and the pivotal and vital role it will play in the future in this valuable sector. As stated in our recommendations, we defined the code of conduct as an integral document articulating ethical principles, practical arrangements such as institutional governance and, in relation to financial accountability, detailed reporting standards. It would be remiss of me not to seize this opportunity to express my deep admiration for the many NGDOs operating both within and outside Australia and for their invaluable role in assisting in so many ways those people from so many countries in the developing world. I salute you! My thanks to the other members of the committee, led superbly by Mr Jim Ingram AO, Chris Franks from the Australian Consumers Association, Janet Hunt of ACFOA, Phillip Hunt from World Vision, Colin Lonergan from AusAID and Paul Sutcliffe from the Australian Accounting Research Foundation. As the honourable member for Aston said, we also appreciated the invaluable work from those committee members who supported us from Au sAIDKieran Donaghue, Salale Salale and Richard Graves-for their fantastic support. Finally, I would urge as many Australians as possible, especially those many generous Australians who support the NGDOs, to read our report and follow the implementation its recommendations. I thank the House. Debate (on motion by Mrs Moylan) adthat journed. Home and Community Care Program",59
57,Dr LAWRENCE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leaveHACC has been a most successful program and is central to the success ment's aged care reform strategy. Since inception in 1985, it has grown some cent, resulting in a large increase in the number and range of services available to Australian community. However, there is room for improvement, and the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs has played an importfuture ant role in identifying issues to be resolved and providing recommendations for the future of the program. At this time, I wish to thank the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) the members of the standing committee for the wide ranging inquiry they conducted the HACC program. They have heard the concerns of the Australian community with regard to the program and proposed options for change. The standing committee's inquiry, along with the joint Commonwealth-state efficiency and effectiveness review of the HACC program conducted over a similar time frame as the inquiry, have proven to be complementary processes which address the needs of consumers, service administration and government responsibility. The findings of the two processes have come together in a way which enables the Commonwealth, in conjunction with territory governments, to establish a blueprint for improvements in community care. This partnership was exemplified by the agreement at the joint meeting of health and community services ministers to develop an implementaindependent tion plan for the reform of the HACC program from 1 July 1996. I would also note that the Council of Australian Governments-COAG-is looking at reforms across the health and community services sector more broadly. Improvements of in individual programs such as HACC can only help the wider process. The work that has been done to date on HACC will mean the work of the broader reform can start from a higher base than would otherwise be possible. Concerns raised by the two reviews includ· the need for improved assessment for and of the governtargeting of services; its · the need for greater flexibility and co440 per ordination of services; and · differences in the distribution of services the between and within states and territories. In response to these issues, the reviews have proposed a range of options for the structure and operation of the program. Today, I am tabling the government's response to the 81 recommendations of the standing committee's report, Home but not alone. I will also take this opportunity to comment briefly on some of the major themes and of the reviews and the reforms endorsed recently at the meeting of health and cominto munity services ministers. Consumers I will tum first to consumers. The importance of focusing on consumers cannot be questioned. This emphasis on consumers and their needs is behind the move away from the funding of service inputs towards a focus on outputs and outcomes for consumers. Such an approach will allow service providers, who are in touch with the needs of their local community, to devise and deliver services to meet an individual's needs, rather than to deliver services to some preset formula. state and Improved assessment processes The inquiry acknowledged the need to improve the assessment process currently undertaken in HACC and work has commenced on developing suitable options for assessment of consumers. Regionalisation The inquiry also places great emphasis on the development of an effective regional structure which is responsive to the needs of consumers and ensures that, no matter what region you live in throughout Australia, you will have equitable access to HACC services. Officers have been asked to develop mechanisms to improve regional planning and accountability processes. The program will move away from joint Commonwealth-state approval of individual projects to joint approval of the HACC program funds available to each region. It is proposed that program performance will be monitored by region and that these reports will be made public. Clarification of the interface between health and community care The issue of continuity between health and community services has also received a great deal of attention, with a number of proposals to be considered. One option is that the funding and provision of basic maintenance and support service for people with a moderate or severe functional disability in need of post-acute care be the responsibility of the HACC program. The health sector would then be responsible for the provision of other post-acute care including any specialised services and all post-acute support for people not in the HACC target group. To develop this issue further, the Commonwealth and state and territory ministers have asked Health and HACC officers to make a joint submission on the funding and provision of post-acute services. Further directions In agreeing to reform the HACC program, I have asked that the community be further consulted on how the changes will be implemented. To that end, consultations will be held with consumers, service providers and other stakeholders in the program. My department has already written to the national peak organisations to invite them to a round of initial consultations on 8 and 15 September. In conclusion, let me again thank the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs for their efforts and input into the reform process for the HACC program. I commend their report to the House. I present the following paper: Response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into the home and community care program-Ministerial statement, 31 August 1995 and move: That the House take note of the paper.",60
58,Ms WORTH,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The shadow minister is unable to be here at this time today and therefore I am pleased, as deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, to respond on behalf of the coalition. We welcome the government's response to the recommendations of Home but not alone, but we do believe that notwithstanding this response the parallel Commonwealth-state review of HACC should have been delivered somewhat sooner. After all, the report itself was tabled over a year ago, and the take note debate took place exactly one year ago today. In a nutshell, the key concerns of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs were that HACC is a very worthwhile program, but is severely impeded by its lack of clear objectives and clarity of overall purpose; uncertainty about its priority client groups or subgroups; uncertainty about allocations of interest and responsibility between Commonwealth, state and local governments, and between governments as program managers and service providers. There is also a lack of effective strategic planning and outcomes standards, and a lack of information and advice regarding services which are available to consumers. The statement by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) also responded to the findings of the Commonwealth-state efficiency and effectiveness review of HACC, which finally reported in June 1995. It would be good if this report could be widely disseminated to assist public debate on some of the vital issues. Accompanying the minister's statement is the official government response to the standing committee's 81 recommendations. I welcome the fact that the government appears to have treated the committee's report seriously, and that it has agreed to implement many of the recommendations and look at others. But we would also be greatly concerned if undertakings are not acted upon, as so often happens under this government. I should also add that I am, as always, a little sceptical when government responses to reports such as Home but not alone frequently emphasise that what is recommended is being acted upon. We found in the inquiry, when we heard from the bureaucratic experts, that often what was said was happening was not, in fact, happening in the field. If this were case, there would have been no need to make recommendations in the first place. The coalition has, only an hour or so ago, received a copy of the government's response to Home but not alone, and we will be studying it closely. I should add that the shadow minister for health and human resources, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), will be discussing the recommendations with his state colleagues. We will also be studying the report of the Commonwealth-state review-a copy of which the government did not do us the courtesy of passing to the shadow minister, even though it is partly the subject of the minister's statement. We would like to see what message it holds for Commonwealth and state governments and for shaping coalition policy. HACC is really only a funding mechanism, and there is a lack of understanding in the community about what services are available. People may know about Meals on Wheels, domiciliary care and district or home nursing, but they do not see them as part of the HACC program, and they do not see them as integrated services, which is what the committee found. Our recommendations are strongly that these services must be integrated because they are being provided to the same client group. Carers in particular need to know about the services that are available, because carers are also consumers. One of the single greatest reasons for the frail or disabled being admitted to institutions is carer fatigue. This crisis needs to be avoided; hence the committee's recommendations about focus and targeting. The coalition believes, as I have said, that the home and community care program has proved to be a very useful mechanism for managing the funding and provision of invaluable services to the frail and vulnerable members of the Australian community. This is what the member for Chisholm said in his speech in the take note debate on the Home but not alone report on 31 August 1994: the . . . the goal of allowing as many as possible elderly and functionally disabled people to remain in their homes and in their communities, is not questioned by me or the coalition. We are concerned, though, to ensure that the maximum quantity of resources, in the form of a diversity of high quality services, is delivered effectively to the people needing them-the frail aged, people with disabilities, people requiring post-acute and palliative care and, of course, their carers. The big question is whether the response tabled today goes far enough to move realistically towards this objective. Debate (on motion by Mrs Crosio) adjourned.

59,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (2.04 p.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments relate to repeat applications which were originally introduced as part of our Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1995. Their purpose is to prevent a non-citizen from making further applications for a protection visa when they have already made an application, whether or not the prior application has been fully determined. Australia operates one of the most thorough, efficient and equitable refugee determination systems in the world. A person's claim is assessed against the definition of 'refugee' in the refugees convention. Repeat applications serve to delay the removal of the applicant from Australia, and their use is increasing. Australia's refugee determination system is fair and contains the right of appeal. There will be circumstances in which a repeat application may merit consideration. The minister will therefore retain a discretion to allow particular repeat applications to be assessed. Guidelines will ensure that all such cases are brought to the minister's attention.",64
60,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Berowra) (2.05 p.m.)These amendments ought not go without passing comment, although it is not opposed by the opposition. The situation is, as was briefly stated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), that the bill proposes to amend this act so as to stop the use of repeat applications for protection visas by non-citizens to delay their removal from Australia. The bill also will effectively stop a person from making a repeat offshore application for the same protection visa whilst here, and that, nevertheless, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will retain the power to exercise a non-compellable discretion in favour of allowing a particular applicant to lodge repeat applications, if the minister thinks it is in the public interest. But, in terms of our support, this material is not altogether novel. It was previously contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1995, a bill that the government is now not proceeding to enact. As it does appear that the government will not be pursuing this bill, it obviously needed to find another basis on which these provisions, which were part of that bill, could be enacted. So they are being tacked on here, as I understand it. That is very convenient, but it belies the fact that the government has been endeavouring to legislate in areas relating to tribunal decisions, and that legislation was brought forward. It was very poorly drafted in other respects, and did meet with some opposition from ourselves, other parts of the community and representative bodies-and it was a difficult area in which to legislate. The government seems to be bolstered, as I understand it, by results of further appeals that it has pursued and, therefore, no longer needs to press the balance of Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4). Thus, we are faced with this situation where we are now tacking on to Migration Amendment Bill (No.3) 1994 the particular provisions that were worthy of support. Our support was there previously for this measure; that support has not changed. We are of the belief that applicants who have been unsuccessful in their application for a protection visa should abide by the umpire's decision and depart. We do not support unlimited access to our onshore protection visa processing facilities. Such unfettered access would be a misuse of a very important and expensive refugee determination program. We do not support the ensuing time wasting and stalling action that unfettered access to provisions and applications might result in. All applicants should be processed in accordance with the act and regulations, and their applications should be put at the first available opportunity. We are of the view that abuse of our regulations in the form of repeat applications is something that should be dealt with firmly, and we would not want to be a party to delaying provisions that might ensure that that be dealt with. At the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee public hearings on the original bill, several groups did express concern that this would only lead to limiting access to Australia's processing system to applicants with genuine concerns. In such cases, the minister has the ability to grant consent to repeat applications, if he believes it to be in the public interest. We are of the view that this is an adequate safety net to ensure that the applications of those applicants whose situations clearly have changed or where there is fresh evidence can be addressed. It would be reassuring if the Parliamentary Secretary, in addition to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) in another place, were to state what she believes is the relevant criteria with the initiation of these powers. Such clarification would be welcomed by both the coalition and those who have consistently voiced concern about the practical use or lack thereof of such discretionary powers. I do not know whether the parliamentary secretary is in a position to offer som- advice on that matter. Obviously, if she were, it would be of some assistance to those who are anxious to know what perhaps is the public interest that might be considered and what relevant factors might be pertinent to the exercise by the minister of the noncompellable discretion that he has.",64
61,Mrs CROSIO,MIGRATION LEGISLATION,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (2.10 p.m.)-I appreciate the support given by the opposition to the amendments that are now before the House. It has been a long and lengthy debate on this bill when we first introduced it into the House and then when it went to the Senate. I would say to the coalition and to the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) that one of the delays was not a delay of the government's making; it was a delay of the Senate. In the other place they set up a committee of inquiry and we believe the taking of evidence and looking at the explanation of the bill was very involved. If one reads the Hansard of the Senate, which I have already done, one will find a long debate also went forward from there. Questions were raised. In fact, some of the things that are now being repeated in this House by the honourable member for Berowra are almost direct quotes of what was stated by his colleagues in the Senate to which the minister got up in his explanation and gave a very forthright answer. It is not always the government's case that we wish to tack pieces of legislation onto another bill. But, as the opposition knows, and the member for Berowra has been fully briefed on it, the reasons why it came about were very clear-cut. I appreciate the concerns expressed by the coalition on what the discretion of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is. I have full confidence both in the government and the minister that discretion will be used and exercised wisely and well. If there are any concerns over any steps that he may take in that direction, I certainly believe those answers will always be given in briefings to the coalition, especially to the member for Berowra. Again, I appreciate the support given to the amendments in this House. NA NA BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed.",65
62,Mr VAILE,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I have been a little while waiting for my tum to make my contribution on the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. We will all recall that the original bill was introduced into the parliament on 28 October 1993 by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). You will recall that was at the end of the election year-the election took place in March 1993. The opposition labelled that bill then the industrial relations payback bill, which in fact it was. It was a payback for the support the ACTU provided the Labor Party to win office in March 1993, and it still goes on. I think this is about the third amending bill the government has put forward in this place to try to fix up some of the inadequacies that were certainly in the first payback bill. The express purpose of the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 is to provide for applications for relief under the unfair dismissal provisions to be heard first by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission rather than by the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, as is presently the case. The second purpose is to allow the AIRC to undertake consent arbitration in relation to termination of employment matters with the agreement of the parties. The third purpose is to make it plain that the industrial court must decline to deal with an unfair dismissal claim where the former employee has access to an alternative remedy under the Commonwealth, state or territory law which satisfies the requirements of the International Labour Organisation's convention No. 158. It bears noting at this point that that is where this whole bill has got its genesis from-the International Labour Organisation convention No. 158 on the termination of employment. It is interesting to note that earlier this year the minister was in Geneva making statements to the International Labour Organisation. At the ILO convention he said: In Australia some commentators have argued that the employment protections provided in our national industrial relations legislation would discourage employers from taking on new staff and result in higher unemployment. We believe we have achieved the right balance between employment creation and ensuring workers have a fair safety net to protect wages and conditions. Notwithstanding these comments, on 21 June of this year the government announced several changes to the employment protections, thereby acknowledging the serious deficiencies in the unfair dismissal provisions. Here we are at the end of August and he has introduced this amending legislation to address inadequacies and deficiencies that have certainly been highlighted on numerous occasions by different commentators right around Australia. These inadequacies and deficiencies have arisen out of the introduction of this industrial relations payback package. We saw that take place at the end of 1993. It has been acknowledged in this debate by the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) that the government in this place is the political wing of the trade union movement of Australia. The member for Capricornia said that in this debate today. She is admitting that connection. The government of the day had to make a payback for the support it received from the ACTO during the March 1993 election; that was, the bill introduced in October 1993. That legislation has been amended three times since. The further payback is that the government of the day, the Prime Minister of the day, has imposed the President of the ACTO, Martin Ferguson, on the people of Batman. That is the linkage that continues to be made in Australia today. I think the people of Australia should rightly be very cynical about the way this government conducts itself in Australia. To the bill introduced the spokesman for industrial relations matters on our side, the member for Flinders, (Mr Reith) has moved the following amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the provisions of the bill and whilst recognising that this bill provides some improvement to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, the House is of the opinion that, even as amended, the unfair dismissal provisions of the Industrial Relations Act remain a disincentive to job creation, that they impose a heavy burden on business, particularly on small business, and that they were enacted without proper prior consultation"". I add: without proper prior consultation with that very important sector of the economy, being the small business community. That has been borne out now. We have had a lot of criticism in this debate from government members that members of the opposition in their contributions have been relying too heavily on a lot of the 10,000 cases that have gone before the courts since this legislation was enacted in late 1993. Why would members of the opposition not highlight some of those cases when the results of those cases are absolutely outrageous? The results of those cases are being enunciated in the press on a daily basis in Australia and frightening the living daylights out of small business people around Australia regarding creating any more employment. We had the member for Capricornia here earlier in the debate crowing about how much extra employment has been generated by this government since its return to office in 1993, but she failed to point out that a large percentage of the jobs that have been created in that time are part-time and casual jobs. Why are we seeing that conundrum in Australia? It is because after the first amending piece of legislation, which took place probably 12 months ago, to exclude from the provisions of the original bill people who are gaining employment under some of the labour market programs which the government has in place, those people are excluded from the unfair dismissal provisions of the bill. The only relief that employers, and particularly small business employers, will have is to put staff on not on a permanent basis but on a part-time basis. We have seen a proliferation of part-time employment, but that proliferation of part-time employment is still taken into account in the statistics today in the 600,000-odd jobs that the government anc government members crow about having created in Australia since coming to power in 1993. I support the amendment that has been moved by the member for Flinders as being very important in highlighting to the people of Australia what the original bill, as amended on a number of occasions, means. Even this amended bill, as it will no doubt pass through the House today, will have an effect on the business community and ultimately on the employment prospects of a lot of unemployed people in Australia today. Earlier this year that fact was reinforced by a public view that was expressed by Bob Carr, who was the then Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales and is now the Labor Premier of New South Wales. This is not a Liberal Party apparatchik criticising this Labor government's legislation; this is the Labor Premier of New South Wales. Bob Carr, then the Leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales and now Premier of New South Wales, made this point on 13 April 1995: There are kids going without jobs because of the way the unfair dismissal provision works in the Federal law. There are kids with good training, good education, who are not being given employment because employers won't take them on if they know that, down the track, whatever the circumstances, it is very difficult to effect a dismissal. The European experience makes it very clear: if you make it complex for employers to vary their employment levels down the track, they won't take on employment to start with. The Federal provisions are a handbrake on employment growth ... I want to revise the Federal law. If we can, there are going to be more employers taking on young people who would otherwise be unemployed. That is Bob Carr, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, criticising this federal Labor government's industrial relations law with regard to unfair dismissal. That view-that employers, because of this legislation, are reluctant to take on new employees on a full time basis-has been reinforced by a survey that was undertaken by Recruitment Solutions. It was published in the Financial Review in in Australia May where it was reported: Employer fears over the Federal Government's unlawful dismissal rules have been reinforced by a new survey which shows companies are already altering their recruitment strategies. The Recruitment Solutions' survey of more than 600 employers of accounting staff found that 12 per cent of companies put on fewer permanent staff last year due to the legislationdue directly to this legislation. The report continued: Many companies are worried about unfair dismissal actions being taken against them by sackedor retrenchedemployees, and are increasingly using temporary and contract staff. That was a survey of 600 companies carried out by Recruitment Solutions. Incredibly, as at 9 June 1995, under the unlawful termination provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, over 10,000 matters had been filed with the court, of which approximately 7,300 had been finalised. Only seven per cent of applications, however, were dealt with by the court. These figures contrast with the total of 452 other matters-matters not related to unfair dismissals-that had been lodged with the Industrial Relations Court by 29 May 1995. Does that not highlight what is going on as a result of the industrial relations legislation that has been introduced by this government-l0,000 matters directly related to unfair dismissal whilst at the same time only 452 other matters were lodged with the court. That is an absolutely unbelievable set of circumstances. Little wonder that we continuously, day in and day out, read about some of the outrageous findings of the court in relation to unfair dismissal cases and how the employers of people who have been dismissed are being forced to reinstate them and pay them lump sum compensation payments. Little wonder there is so much for the media across Australia to report. There were 10,000 cases as at 9 June 1995. The legislation came before this parliament only in October 1993. That is hardly 18 months ago. There were only 452 other matters registered with the court in the same period. That is absolutely unbelievable. What are some of the criticisms that are being levelled at this legislation from different sections of the community? The criticism is not just coming from the opposition benches, and bear in mind that we support the government's proposed amendments to this legislation. We are saying that the legislation is not going far enough to provide fair and equitable unfair dismissal provisions for everybody concerned in the employment situation-employer and employee alike. There have been three strands of criticism of the 1993-94 unfair dismissal provisions. Firstly, it is argued that the institutional machinery for dealing with such claims is unduly bureaucratic. It is said that there was little reason to create the Industrial Court and that, even if such a body could be justified, the act should have provided that proceedings be initiated in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission by way of some form of conciliation-not in the court. Secondly, it is claimed that the post-1993 act is loaded against the employer and would lead to both unfair results and a loss of employment. I refer to the judgment of Justice Gray of the Industrial Court in the case of Fryar v. Systems Services Proprietary Ltd of May 1995 cited in the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's June newsletter. It reads: The former State [South Australian] Act and the present State Act, like their counterpart in New South Wales, operate in the realm of the 'fair go all round'. This is not a realm that this Court inhabits. The provisions of Division 3 ... of the federal Act are not directed at achieving some balance between the interests of employers and employees in particular cases. They constitute a charter of rights for employees. They are directed towards the protection of the existing jobs of employees. Thirdly, a number of specific provisions of the Industrial Court have been attacked, in essence, for placing too much weight on procedural issues and not enough weight on the merits of the case. A common complaint has been that some ex-employees have been rewarded relief, although there was a good reason for their being dismissed-merely because the employer did not adopt proper procedures in bringing the contract to an end. They are just some of the criticisms that have been levelled at this legislation which was enacted in 1993 and which has been amended on a number of occasions since then. All the coalition is asking for is a fair go all round. It is interesting to read some of the headlines in the newspapers. Stories are constantly being written in the media about this piece of legislation. As it was and as it is going to be amended, it is still unfair. One headline reads, 'Unfair dismissal laws must provide a fair go all round.' Isn't that what Australia is all about? Isn't Australia all about a fair go for all concerned? Can the government tell the people of Australia that having 10,000 cases before the courts regarding unfair dismissals in 18 months-in a large percentage of those cases, employers are being bound by the decisions of the court to make lump sum payments to people that have been dismissed as well as to reinstate those people-is providing a fair go all round? Another headline reads, 'Woman tells boss to shove job.' So what happens? The court tells the boss to put the woman back on and pay her $5,120 in compensation. It is unbelievable. I will guarantee that, if any government members were put in that circumstance, they would absolutely scream blue murder. Another headline reads, 'Sacked public servant wins appeal.' Another headline reads, 'IRC finds dismissal of pot smoker unjust.' In that particular case, the person was operating within the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, which trades as Pacific Power. That was under the New South Wales legislation. But they still find relief under the provisions of the Commonwealth act. That person was endangering his follow workers. Another headline reads, 'Sex case lecturer reinstated. ' I will close by referring to an article in the Australian headed 'Why unfair dismissal laws are still unfair to the bosses'. I have read out the first part of it, which reports the speech by the Minister for Industrial Relations to the ILO in Geneva this year. He said the legislation was not having a detrimental effect on employment in Australia. There are an interesting couple of paragraphs in this article by Professor Judith Sloan. She said: The Government claims that the strong growth in employment since 1994 refutes the proposition that employers have been deterred from filling jobs because of the new provisions. But on recent labour force figures, the increase in part-time employment has been more than double the increase in full-time employment. Moreover, about three-quarters of all part-time are casual. The suspicion is that the laws have skewed the nature of new jobs. And that is an absolute fact. The research that I have done shows that some manufacturing industries in my electorate are getting a bit of a kick along at the moment. I will be the first to acknowledge that. Lansdowne Engineering, part of the Goninan's company, has picked up some large contracts from the National Rail Corporation. Some other smaller manufacturers in Port Macquarie are picking up contracts. But the anecdotal evidence that is coming to me is that they are not putting on any more permanent employees. Small business is not putting on any more permanent employees. Why? They cite one, and only one, reason: the unfair dismissal provisions of the Labor government's industrial relations legislation. The amendments that are being debated in this bill today are not going to make any difference to them. All they are doing is putting on part-time employees so that they can circumvent the provisions, via the amendment to the act that the government made some time last year because of the effect the legislation was going to have on part-time workers employed under labour market programs. Small business people today are only employing people on a part-time basis because they do not want to be exposed to some of the decisions that are being made in the courts-those 10,000 cases that have been before the courts. Not only do they have to fork out for their legal defence, but also they have to fork out lump sum payments to the employees that have been dismissed. (Time expired)",65
63,Mr DUNCAN,OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak briefly in the debate this afternoon on the Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I, of course, support the government's legislation. In my opening remarks I want to say a few things about the history of legislation dealing with unfair dismissals. Until the 1970s it was the case that, by and large, there were no laws dealing with unfair dismissals in this country jobs and an employer's so-called rights were virtually unfettered. Then, some laws at the state level were introduced which had the effect of requiring employers to ensure that the way they acted in relation to their employees was with some degree of humanity and decency. If they were to dismiss an employee, it had to be on the basis that that dismissal, at least in South Australia and New South Wales, was not harsh, unfair or unjust. The introduction of those laws ameliorated what, prior to that, in the case of some employers, had been very harsh treatment of employees. Those laws in South Australia and New South Wales subsequently became the basis of the amendments which were made at the federal level and which became law across the nation. There have been a number of changes to those laws over a period of time, and this is a continuation of that. The basic situation, is mostly the case with employment contracts, is that employees are in a position of weakness compared with employers. In the next few moments, I want to deal with an aspect of the weakness of employees. In doing so, as Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table dealing with fees charged by banks on transactions. Leave granted.

64,Mr DUNCAN,TRANSACTION ACCOUNT COMPARISON TABLE,"As part of the arrangements made, not only under legislation but also in relation to employees' contracts of employment, it is often the case that, because of enterprise bargaining and the like, employees are not simply paid in cash but are required to be paid through bank accounts. My concern is that this, in effect, has put a burden on employees which was not there before. Many of my constituents have complained very bitterly to me that awards, agreements and enterprise bargaining have led to their having traded away their right to receive pay in cash. When they have received their first payment by way of bank debit, it has come as a tremendous shock to them to find that not only are they required to pay state government charges by way of so-called BAD and FID taxes-bank account debit and financial institution duty taxes-but they are also required to pay quite substantial amounts in bank charges. The document that I have incorporated indicates quite clearly how substantial and dramatic in dollar amounts in a 12-month period those charges, which are foist upon employees through the arrangements which have been made on their behalf through enterprise bargaining and the like, can be. That is not to say that arrangements entered into for the payment of employees through bank accounts and the like should be excluded by legislation. Good grief! I am not suggesting that for a moment. But I do think it would be desirable for the industrial laws of our country to provide that, where costs such as FID tax, BAD tax and other bank charges will be lumped onto employees, people ought to be made clearly aware of that at the time when enterprise bargaining or award negotiations are under way. Frequently, that is not the case, and it lead to a situation where an employee could actually be worse off by maybe $100 per year as a result of state government taxes and charges on bank accounts, and charges that banks levy themselves. I think that issue needs to be aired at greater length. Certainly, with our responsibilities to our constituents we ought to ensure that employees know more about those charges before they enter into agreements or before they become subjected to awards that provide for payment through bank debit arrangements. I conclude my remarks by simply saying that this piece of legislation is a continuing part of the reform of the unfair dismissal cost laws. Whilst they have been criticised by some quarters, as has been pointed out by those opposite, overall they will lead to a position which, from everybody's point of view, is fairer. Some people have raised concerns about their whether this legislation will lead to the exclusion of the Commonwealth's jurisdiction in some states and whether that would be fair across the Commonwealth. Some people might be entitled to remedies in certain states that other citizens will not be entitled to because they live in other states. That is an issue which is yet to be determined. I am sure that the industrial commission and court will be acutely aware of those problems and I have no doubt that we will try to ensure that whatever decisions they make take account of the criticisms that have been made in that regard. With those few comments, I conclude my remarks. I commend the bill to the House.",73
65,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRANSACTION ACCOUNT COMPARISON TABLE,"I am very happy to enter this debate on the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. It is a very important part of the industrial relations process that we are seen to be amending legislation that should be amended. I would like to give some of my background because I have been interested to hear about the backgrounds of other people who have spoken on this bill. I left school at 16. I did an apprenticeship for four years and had a multitude of different can jobs-working on building sites, truck driving and a range of other things. I moved into corporate management and I now own my own companies. I have been exposed to some unscrupulous employers. From working on building sites, I can understand why the builders labourers union had to do its thing some 20-odd years ago. It was pretty tough, working on building sites. I can also say that, as an employer, I understand that employers have certain responsibilities to meet, and I have attempted to do that in running my own companies. I give that background so that I can say I can speak from both sides, as a union member and a company director. People commonly talk about rights. They talk about the right of all Australians to have a job. I guess there is that right, but along with rights come responsibilities and respect. We talk about the three Rs of educationreading, (w)riting and (a)rithmetic-but there are also the three Rs of communitarianism and employment. There are rights, but with those rights come responsibilities and also respect. The rights of employers bring responsibility for their employees and a respect for their employees. Employees have the right to work, but they also have a responsibility towards their employers and should have respect for their employers. We have been talking today about unfair dismissal. Employment, like politics or any other process within our community, is all about relationships. The relationship between employer and employee needs to be built on trust and faith in one another. But we have a situation here where, through legislation, we are forcing certain standards on that relationship. Standards do not come just through legislation; they come through relationships, through trust and faith in one another. A couple of years ago we introduced legislation relating to unfair dismissal. It created major havoc in the community. Some 10,000 cases have been submitted for hearing. It is quite unbelievable that 10,000 cases of unfair dismissal could be heard in that short a time. It is an increasing trend that when people lose their jobs, for whatever reason, they make an unfair dismissal claim. Even Martin Ferguson-the ALP candidate for the seat of Batman in Melbourne and the current President of the ACTU-conceded that the outcomes of some unfair dismissal cases have been, to use his word. 'indefensible'. That would indicate that there are some problems with the act and that is why we are amending it today. Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, was quoted recently as saying: There are kids with good training, good education, who are not being given employment because employers won't take them on if they know that, down the track, whatever the circumstances, it is very difficult to effect a dismissal. We have a very serious problem in Australia at the moment-that is, youth unemployment. We have employers, according to the Premier of New South Wales, not willing to put on young people these days because down the track they will find it difficult to manage their staff. Over the last couple of years we have had the Labor government proclaiming that 600,000 new jobs have been created over the last period. But we have to realise that most of that is casual and part-time work. It is not really suitable for those wanting to have an extended career in any sort of employmentin fact, for those not having any job security, through casual work. We must bring everything into the right context. My concern, like that of Bob Carr, is that we are not looking after our young people within Australia. Our greatest asset in Australia is not our mineral wealth, our agricultural industry or our manufacturing industry; our greatest asset in Australia is our young people. We should be looking after them. We should be looking after them before they go to school, with their child-care arrangements, looking after them through their schooling period, giving them opportunities and giving them work when they finish their schooling, has because they are our future. If we do not look after our future by looking after our assets now, what will our country be like in 30 or 40 years? Mr Ronaldson-Tomorrow's leaders.",73
66,Mr RICHARD EVANS,TRANSACTION ACCOUNT COMPARISON TABLE,"In fact, one of tomorrow's leaders was born to me two weeks ago, which was quite nice. I am concerned about my young son's future 30 or 40 years down the track. What will be available to him now if employers are not encouraged enough to employ young people? Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, recognised that the current act is unfair. I agree with him: it is unfair to young people because it is not giving them opportunities. Let us look at some of the examples that we have had of unfair dismissal cases. We had the case of a lecturer who was charged with sexual harassment of his students. There was no disputing the facts; he was sexually harassing his students. He was dismissed, he lodged an appeal and his appeal was granted. He was reinstated and compensated. Here he was sexually harassing his students and, apparently, you cannot be dismissed for that, according to the act. We also had a worker in a funeral parlour who was dismissed for cremating the wrong body. It is quite amazing that someone could mistakenly cremate an unfortunate dead Australian--cremate the wrong body. The employer took the unusual action of dismissing this particular person. He took the matter to the commission and was awarded $800,000 compensation. We had another case of a manager-they are not all employees-of a company. There was a downturn in the company and it was $300,000 in the red. The owners of the company said, 'We really can't have you around because there has been a downturn in business and we've got to let you go.' He took that to the commission and he was reinstated, although the business was $300,000 in the red. I would have thought that was an indication of a downturn in business. There was another case of stealing, where an employee was caught pilfering from his employer, which is a criminal offence in itself. He was dismissed, but later reinstated with compensation. There was also the case of a person who was swearing and abusing her employer, telling her in no uncertain terms what she thought about the employer and the company, and she resigned and left immediately. She was reinstated under unfair dismissal provisions and given $5,000 in compensation because the court found that it was not fair that she should not be able to abuse the employer. She got her job back. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said it agrees with the unfair dismissal arrangements in the legislation we are discussing today. The ACCI wants those arrangements in place to keep unscrupulous employers honest. It welcomes the amendments, but it says they do not go far enough, particularly in the areas of onus of proof, the lack of a filing fee and a filtering mechanism, the inclusion in the act of the ILO recommendation, the costs associated with providing these court cases, the provisions concerning absence on sickness, the lack of power for the commission to determine applications other than on a voluntary basis and so on. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is also very concerned about the amendments. So we have the President of the ACTU concerned about the legislation, we have the Premier of New South Wales concerned about the legislation and we have the peak Australian employment body concerned about the legislation and saying these amendments are not going far enough. I tend to agree with that, because I do not think they are going far enough. I will speak a bit later on about what those amendments could be doing. Why are we discussing this? The reason is that industrial relations in Australia, in my view, is a bit out of control at the moment. We have an industrial relations system primarily based upon the industrial age, which is quite normal. We have a union system in Australia based upon the English model. The union system, with their political arm in Australia being the ALP, are running the government at the moment. Members of the ALP talk about the number of disputations being down since they have been in government. Of course they would be-because the ACTU and the ALP are one and the same. If you doubt that, you only have to look at Martin Ferguson's recent endorsement as a candidate, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), former President of the ACTU, and of course Jennie George, the incoming President of the ACTU and former ALP candidate in the Senate. They are one and the same. The number of disputations go down when the ALP is in government because it is a natural course of action to happen. We cannot be confused about that. The problem with this is that we have a front-bench government which is run based on the English union model. This is particularly a problem because the industrial age is over and we are now in a period of transition between the industrial age and the information or technology age. I have listened to all the speakers from the government side, and I must admit that I have looked up their backgrounds. None of them have business experience and none of them have actually gone out to create a dollar. I doubt very few of them would have had dirt under their fingernails from any work they might have done. People on that side of the House are still industrial age thinkers. They do not understand that the new age, the information age, which is based upon technology, requires a different structure of industrial relations. New age thinking is where we empower workers, employees, to carry out decision making and get them to do things how they want them to be done and to take responsibility. We find the government still has an autocratic model. They still think in terms of an autocratic model based on pyramids, whereas the new models for the information age are based on separate working modules, requiring people to be empowered, requiring them to make their decisions and have their own choices. Yet we have an industrial relations system which is forcing employees to deal with unions, whom they do not particularly want to deal with. Now we have legislation in place which is forcing employers to have a confrontational attitude towards their employees. As Bob Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, has stated, it is not encouraging employers to employ young people. They are our greatest asset, and we should be considering that. We always hear about the Labor Party and what they believe in. They always use the words 'decency' and 'fairness' as if to say that people on this side of the House are not decent or fair. The Labor Party always talk about their values as being decency and fairness, but are they really? What they are working on is the award system. As we all know, the award system brings everybody down to the lowest common denominator. What I mean by that is that, if you are a good employee and you work hard, you cannot get any extra money under the award. You can get only the same amount of money as the poorest worker-the one who does not respect the employer or the company he or she works for and who does not want to take the responsibility of putting in any effort. That person gets the award and the best worker gets the award. So the award system does not reward those who put in and take that responsibility; it awards those people who have the slow screwdrivers and so on by dragging everyone back down to their level. Mr O'Keefe-Haven't you heard of enterprise bargaining? You're a bit behind the times. Mr RICHARD EV ANS-I agree with the interjection that there is enterprise bargaining. But the union movement is not allowing enterprise by enterprise bargaining; they are more interested in industry bargaining. They do not ask for individuals to have their own agreements within their workplace. Mr O'Keefe-That's what you're really on about.",74
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRANSACTION ACCOUNT COMPARISON TABLE,"Mr Vaile)Order! The member for Cowan has the call. The parliamentary secretary will stop interjecting. Mr RICHARD EV ANS-I am not even interested in responding to that. The point is that an individual who does put an effort in cannot get rewarded under the Labor Party scheme. The Labor Party has dehumanised the IR system. More than anything else, they have turned workers into economic figures. More and more now, as I said before about relationships, employers are seeking to see what their bottom line is, what their budgets are, and they are dehumanising their entire company structure. The government is more concerned about figures than about human relationships. This is what the Labor Party has forced us into. They always speak of these rights-the right to this and the right to that-but where is the responsibility and respect in these areas? They are still in this industrial age thinking process. They are not really into the information or technology age. The Liberal Party believes in supporting relationships. The Liberal Party likes supporting families in Australia. We also like suptalking porting the relationships that small business has with the community, unlike the Labor Party. We like supporting relationships in enterprises and encouraging employers and employees to have a very good, effective, responsible and respectful relationship with one another. If we were in control of the legislation, would like to see seven points drawn up. We would like to meet our international obligathe tions. That is in due course. We would like have employees have access to appeal. I not think anyone disagrees with that. If dismissals are unfair, people should have access to appeal. But the system should be sumed. fair and just for both sides, not just fair for one side. It should have a minimum legal cost associated with it. We should discourage frivolous claims. Too many frivolous claims are being made and clogging up the system. Community standards should be met. In other words, stealing is a criminal offence we should be taking action. Therefore, if are caught stealing, you should be dismissed. We should be meeting those community written standards. The system should be user friendly. Currently the system is not user friendly, and we should be working towards making it user friendly. In conclusion, the Labor Party really dehumanised industrial relations. They are looking at it in a personal, humanised sense. They talk about all their efforts and decency and fairness. They talk about the 600,000 jobs, when in fact most of them are jobs for casual employees. They talk about the unemfailure, ployed, but they do not talk much about the youth unemployed in Australia. Youth are our greatest asset and we should be addressing next election? youth unemployment. We are not really addressing it in a very serious way as a nation at the moment. The government should take some responsiopposition bility in showing some leadership in these issues. They are talking about leadership the industrial age, but they have not really addressed themselves to the information age and new technology. They are not talking about empowering employees; they are all talking about demanding things. They are not about effective decision making; they are talking about forcing decisions upon employees. The sooner there is an election, the better it will be for our great country. I think you will find that the Australian people will choose the Liberal Party because we are the party that deals in relationships and we are the party that will respond with positive we industrial relations policy.",76

If you had been filling in the boxes, would you have in a record quarterly current account deficit of 6.6 per cent of GDP? Would you have written in a record $3.1 billion for the May current account? Would you have written in $180 billion in net foreign debt? Would has you have written in 27 per cent for youth not unemployment? Would you have written in 10.5 per cent for variable mortgage rates? Given that over the last 12 years your promised solutions on the current account and foreign debt have been met with nothing but that you have jacked up interest rates three times in the last year, why shouldn't the Australian people cross out your box at the",77
70,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad he did not throw anything at me: I was waiting for a missile to come over. I have often heard the in here quote Bankers Trust economics. Let me quote it back to him on those in questions. 'When one looks at the national accounts,' says Bankers Trust, 'the phrase ""this is a beautiful set of numbers"" comes readily to mind,' and it goes on to talk about of the various aspects, including the debt. It says, 'The ongoing low level of the debt servicing ratio suggests that foreign debt less of a problem than many people think.' Mr Costello-That's brilliant.",77

72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy pers. Leader of the Opposition will not engage in conversation.,78
73,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the Dollar Sweets case and a bit of industrial chicanery. Bankers Trust know about these things, I know! Can I dwell upon the key point, that is that the government sought to bring economy back to a sustainable level of growth, and that has happened. We are back now to 3.7 per cent for the year, from six the year to September last year. The opposition was hoping that the these government's attempts to use monetary and fiscal policy to bring it back would see a into the ground and we would be back to low growth economy; and this news, as I said the other day in the House, of 3.7 per would have been greeted by the opposition like sucking on a lemon. What has happened is that it has come off from six and growth has basically steadied and started to accelerate again to between 3Y2 and four per cent. In other words, as I said yesterday, it is going at a good clip but, at the same element of the accounts, the broadest measure of inflation, the non-farm GDP deflator, is 2.1 per cent. Could you imagine, had the coalition been able to break the back of Australian inflation, the noise and the constant claims we would have heard about the inflation rate? Here it is again, quarter after quarter, at 2.1 per cent on the broadest measure of inflation. Again, has been very strong business investmenthad 7.9 per cent growth. As you go through the various the accounts, there is moderate wages growth and productivity numbers in the market sector-1.6 per cent for productivity. In the non-farm market sector, it is 2.3 per cent. The that. is equivalent number in New Zealand has been about one per cent. So, wherever you look through these accounts, I think you will find that we have succeeded in slowing the econto a sustainable path. We have had, of course, enormous employment growth. Let me go back to the 1993 election. What was we the government's commitment? It was to a recesrestart growth and employment. Mr Moore-When you told a few whopMr Ruddock-L-a-w, law.",78

Since the election-680,000 jobs, a strong economy now brought back to being in a sustainable economy, with low inflation and wages growth which are harmonious with numbers. These figures should give a lot of confidence to Australians because this dive quarter is the 16th consecutive quarter of a growth, four years of straight economic growth. The last time we had a phase like that cent was 24 years ago. Yet we have had the Leader of the Opposition wandering around with his pathetic little lie about five minutes the of economic sunshine where, in fact",78

82,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, absolutely, Mr Speaker. Line makes a much better phrase; 'that pathetic little line' is a far more telling put down. But what does he say now about four years--48 months-of consistent growth; 16 quarters? What does he say when he goes on radio stations with this pathetic line about five minutes of sunshine? In the end the public are getting him in their sights. The binoculars might have been a bit blurred at the start, but as they tum the button, as they get the news, he is coming right up-and what is there, in sharp focus? It is the same old moribund character from the 1970s and the 1980s. It is the same old moribund character out there telling contrived fibs, out there telling contorted and tortuous fibs, that the opposition now knows are completely untrue, about an economy where we have had confirmation again in the national accounts. When good news comes of the economy, it is always such sad news for the oppositionthe sad sacks over there. Look at them now; they are looking sad already. Perhaps it is not a bad measure; it is not a bad inverse curve: the sadness of the opposition is better times for the Australian community. This is the case: that we are seeing this extended period of growth with low inflation. So I do say again, I repeat to the Australian people, that these figures yesterday are confirmation that they have a long-run sustainable growth economy on their hands-a sustainable growth low inflation economy on their hands; the very thing that this government sought to put there. I am very happy to say that yesterday's national accounts give very confirming evidence of it. Industrial Relations",79
83,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Will the government reject at the federal level the Western Australian model, outlined by Mr Kierath on 26 May 1995, which provides in part for the threat of criminal sanctions for industrial action, even in the case of a refusal to work for health and safety reasons? If so, will the minister advise the House of the reasons for rejecting this approach to industrial relations?",79
84,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure the House that our government unequivocally rejects this approach-an approach which is in breach of every principle of freedom of association.

87,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"these proposals are. As the member for Banks has said, this second wave legislation actually contains the threat of criminal sanctions for industrial action in the case of a worker who refuses to work for health and safety reasons. Just imagine that; could you imagine anything more disgraceful than that? We have seen in the last few days, last week actually, a very belated attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to say that this is not his idea, that he does not associate himself with it. He said: I have never associated the federal coalition with any so-called new or second wave industrial laws in Western Australia. He supported the laws that had already been enacted in Western Australia. It does not ring terribly true, does it, when you have a look at the headlines 'Howard: WA is our model.' Dated when? Dated 29 July 1995-barely a month ago. There he is saying he is going to use that model as his very template and here in the House he is saying, 'Oh, no, no' - that he has never associated himself with it. He would like the House to believe that he is only associated with the first wave of Graham Kierath. That was the wave that gave us 14 per cent of employees in enterprise bargains, whereas the federal system has 60 per cent. He would have us believe that he is committed only to that Western Australian system that has 50,000 people covered in the whole of Western Australia under enterprise agreements in contrast with 1.5 million under our federal system. That is the system he would have us now believe he so much admires and identifies with, not the second wave. Last week here in the House he could not help himself. He told what could only be described as a huge porky when he made his personal explanation after question time last Wednesday. Let me demonstrate to the House why this is so. Mr Kierath tabled his second wave legislation on 26 May 1995, months ago. That is when he tabled it-on 26 May 1995. It was featured extensively with widespread media coverage right through June and July. Mr Reith-No, he didn't.",79
88,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, he did. He tabled it on 26 May 1995. It was distributed then and it has been the subject of wide press speculation. Two months he went over there and said it was his model. The fact is that, umMr Downer-Er, um--er.",80

I think the best way of putting to go to the very words of Graham Kierath, the architect of the second wave. In the West Australian on 17 August this month, Graham Kierath said-and he was saying this in the context of rejecting speculation that the federal coalition was pressuring him to delay or change his industrial plans-that he outlined his proposals to Mr Howard a few weeks ago and that Mr Howard had supported the plans wholeheartedly. Of course he does not like it. Of course he has his back turned to us. Of course he is turning away because he hates being confronted by the truth.",80

101,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the lie to this is the call. Relax!,80
102,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let's go to the fibs. It was not just on 17 August that Mr Kierath put the lie to what was asserted here in the House last week. On 20 August he repeated it. He said in the Sunday Times about the second wave legislation: The only discussions I have had are with John Howard and he seems very supportive of the principles. Let us have a look at all the evidence. There he is saying, and reported clearly, that he adopts it, confirmed by Graham Kierath, but here in the House denying it ever happened. Last week in this House and again this week, the Leader of the Opposition has been talking about telling the truth, but it is fair to say: does telling the truth apply to the opposition? Does it apply to the opposition front bench? Does it apply to the Leader of the Opposition himself? Certainly in the views of Graham Kierath it does not. Of course, it is not the first time the member for Bennelong has seen his public utterances vastly different from his private urgings-vastly different. You will all remember the APPM dispute. You have to go back a little bit, but it is not all that far back. In 1992 the member for Bennelong said: I argued throughout this dispute that sometimes silence ... is golden ... Listen to these great words. He went on: I believe we will have better industrial relations in Australia if, on occasions when industrial disputes arise, parliamentarians on both sides ... stay out of these disputes. Yet on 2 June, shortly after that, the news reports revealed him admitting that he had had a meeting with Mr Wade, the managing director of North Broken Hill Peko, the parent company of APPM, to discuss the dispute and he had done so on 14 May. He also admitted that he had had separate meetings with APPM executive and his other executives. On the APPM dispute his public comments were, 'Leave the parties alone to sort out the dispute,' but privately he was flat out urging the company to hop into the workers. That was about as disingenuous as his performance on this occasion. He is displaying the same sort of duplicity in respect of his expressed views here in the House about Graham Kierath's second wave. He is saying that he never endorsed it, while privately he is urging Graham Kierath to get on and do it. It is a case of total and absolute duplicity. Indonesia",80

114,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not say that this matter was not worth raising. I said that the agenda which I have with President Suharto will not be set by the media. I have said it before; I will keep on saying it. And it will not be. I do not preview discussions I have with the leaders of other countries in public and I do not give people indication of what matters need to be raised. Unlike the honourable gentleman opposite, on this side of the House we do not posture about claims of having raised human rights issues. When he said he raised them with the Vietnamese, they took the unlikely step of putting a statement out denying it. When Do Muoi was here two weeks ago, I raised specifically a number of human rights issues with him. I had a discussion with him for just on one hour about one human rights subject. That was outside a range of other subjects that I raised with him-straight at it and straight into it. The opposition was so keen to raise the human rights difficulties in Vietnam with Do Muoi that the shadow minister would not even see him-and neither would his opposition leader! They are very selective about all these things. The shadow minister did not mind going off on a parliamentary committee to Vietnam to look at human rights but, when he had a chance of putting the issue to the No. 1 person, he squibbed it. When the Vietnamese foreign minister was down here, the shadow minister said he would raise the issue, but the foreign minister put a statement out saying that he did not. We do not do that. I have raised often-at every meeting, I think, with President Suharto-human rights matters. In relation to the reported killings Timika, our embassy examined the reports and was in touch with the relevant Indonesian authorities in April-that was when the reports first appeared. The foreign minister has been in touch with his counterpart to convey the government's concerns since. As I indicated yesterday we are pleased the Indonesian human rights commission is investigating the reports. Nothing in what I said-and nothing can be drawn from anything I said-suggested that this matter was not worth raising. That was just a bit of gratuitous, parliamentary slop from the shadow minister.

119,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The last thing we will be doing is running to the drumbeat of the media-and, might I say on this, especially of the Sydney Morning Herald. Youth Unemployment",82
120,Mr QUICK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The minister will be aware of reports of significant community based discussions this week regarding the problem of youth unemployment. Can the minister inform at the House what the government is doing to create employment opportunities for Australian young people?",82
121,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. There was a very significant conference this week held in the member for Bonython's electorate which addressed this issue. It was a conference that I addressed and it was a conference that my counterpart also addressed. Clearly, the government does acknowledge the serious problem associated with youth unemployment, and that was behind a major part of the thrust of Working Nation. Working Nation is having a major impact in terms of getting the number of unemployed youth down. In the time that it has been operating, the number of unemployed youth has come down by 14 per cent. The number of long-term unemployed youth in the 15to 19-year-old category has come down by 20 per cent and, in the 20to 24-year-old category, by 30 per cent. I think this indicates the importance of targeted measures that go specifically to the particular problems affecting young people. We also recognised the importance of training and education. It is revealing to remind the House that the unemployment rate is twice as high for people who do not complete secondary school as it is for those who do complete post-secondary education. More importantly, if you look at the traineeship program that this government has introduced, you will see that 80 per cent of teenage trainees are still in work 12 months after the traineeship has been completed. That is why Working Nation was about expanding the opportunities available through traineeships and through education. The commitment that I have made is that the programs we have on offer will be more flexible and that we will develop a real connection between training and getting the job. I look forward to suggestions coming from that conference as to how we can work with youth and their representatives on implementing such proposals. As I said at the outset, the opposition was also at the conference. They were asked one thing by the young people in terms of their attendance at the conference: tell us what your policy is? But the shadow spokesman, the member for Goldstein, gave a 14-page speech avoiding just that question. He did not avoid the questions following the speech. In those questions he did get cornered. He got cornered on the question of youth wages and on work for the dole. What he has said effectively has been that they in office would be about cutting the training wage. He has admitted that it could be cut under their proposals and that, in the development of the rate, only employers would be consulted-not youth, the people who are going to get the wage rate, and not the unions that represent them. Only the employers would be consulted. Some wage rate! Some consideration! Dr Kemp-That's another lie.",82
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Goldstein will withdraw that comment. Dr Kemp-I withdraw.,83
123,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is the forerunner to taking us back to the $3 per hour youth rate. Let there be no mistake about that. On the question of voluntary and community work, he also raised the issue of using those groups in the community to provide useful activity. We do not disagree with that approach. In fact, we are doing it. Rut we arc doin? :L through the new work opportunities program which has attached to it a training wage-an award based rate of pay. But their agenda is not to support the continuation of the new work opportunities program, which pays that award based rate; it is to require people to undertake those activities for the dole-not for the wage rate or the award rate, but for the dole. He also did not refute at the conference the deputy leader's statement. When he was pressed on the question of where the savings in the fiscal strategy of them in office would come from-the deputy leader had said they would cut the Working Nation programs-the shadow minister did not refute what the deputy leader had said. So there you have it: a commitment from us to a program that is demonstrating it is working. We are one year into a four-year program which is making important progress, and we have a commitment to follow that up in the next three years. But their strategy is to cut youth wages, force people to work for the dole and provide no funds for the important labour market programs that are working. I am sure the youth of the country will be very interested to compare our policy, our commitment and our efforts with yours. Family Associations",83
124,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Prime Minister defended Senator Evans's absurd and dangerous argument about guilt by association.

184,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have come to the matter about Senator Vanstone. I will answer it by referring to a remark she made in the Senate on a Family Court matter on 9 March 1995. She said: It is important to distinguish between a finding of appearance of bias and actual bias. A finding of appearance of bias at law will overturn a decision on the basis that justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done. The threshold for overturning a decision is therefore the appearance of bias. The question of whether actual bias was displayed need not be addressed. Confidence in the judicial system will be lost if there is a public perception of bias in the courts. I say no more. Current Account Deficit",85
185,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. It refers to the balance of payments current account deficit. Has the Treasurer seen reports of alternative proposals for addressing the current account deficit? What is the government's response to those reports?,86
186,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. I have seen claims of a detailed plan having been announced to address the balance of payments current account deficit. At the time it was supposedly announced, I must have missed it. I think I was in the same position as everyone else: we did not realise that such a comprehensive plan had actually been announced-and that is basically because it wasn't. Nevertheless, the claim has been made that it was. The claim was made by the Leader of the Opposition when - e was talking to Pru Goward on ABC radIO last week. He was asked about the balance of payments. He said: . . . I have addressed that problem, I did it detail and it was widely responded to by economic commentators as a coherent plan to tackle the current account deficit. Where did he actually do that? He said: I laid down in my second headland speech, a clear plan to fix the current account deficit. Those of us who heard that speech or read that speech were all astonished to hear .that claim because, frankly, no-one regarded It as a speech which had any detail of any kind, let alone a detailed, comprehensive plan to tackle the current account problem. After he made that speech it was the general impression that he had not put in much detail. Perhaps the best evidence of that was at his first interview with Paul Barber on Radio 3AW. Paul Barber started off by saying: ... Now, your headland speech today, economic policy. I mean, let's be honest, it's one of the motherhood speeches of all time, isn't it? I mean, you didn't tell us anything? This is the speech that was supposed to give the detailed plan. Let me briefly take the House through what was involved in this detailed plan. Remember that the main item was the productivity commission. This was supposed to be the big new initiative. EPAC, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Industry Commission would be put together into one body called the productivity commission. What was it going to do? It was going to do the - hings which are already being done. It was gOIng to have a stocktake of progress on microeconomic reform; the Industry Commission does that now. It was going to benchmark micro-economic reform activities; the BIE does that now, and the Industry Commission does it for government business enterprises and the delivery of government services. It was going to identify international best practice by industry and disseminate the results; that is what AusIndustry does. So all these things that it is going to do are already being done. So much for that major new initiative! In relation to savings, he said that he was going to make significant public savings, but there were no details at all as to the extent of those savings or where they would be made . in great This is what he now claims is a clear plan which addresses the problem in great detailwith absolutely no detail whatever about the savings. On monetary policy, he said that he would not tell the Reserve Bank what to do. Well, we do not tell the Reserve Bank what to do. He said that he would encourage it to make detailed statements on monetary policy. That is what happens now. In fact, the Governor of the Reserve Bank made a detailed statement on economic and monetary policy yesterday in Los Angeles, and I recommend it to the opposition as something very much worth reading. He also endorsed the bank's and the government's inflation target. That was his monetary policy-his big new initiative on monetary policy-just doing what we are doing. In relation to APEC, he said he great endorsed our policy for development of an open trading system within the region. So big change there! No change. He endorses our policy. In relation to the commercialisation of Australian research, his big new initiative was to ask big business to give him some ideas about how he could commercialise research. So there is no detail there. He said he called for coordination of infrasavings structure policy at the Commonwealth-state level. Well, there is already substantial coordination. Look at things like the National Rail Corporation, the standard gauge rail, the development of a national electricity market, and the agreed policy between us and the states about free and fair trade in gas. There is a lot of coordination occurring already in that area. Finally, he trotted out again his labour market reform-the old policy of stripping away award protections from workers, plus some union bashing proposals-a policy which would lead to major industrial confrontation and spiralling wage claims. So no solutions to the balance of payments current account deficit there. What we had from the Leader of the Opposition's supposed detailed plan was just a mishmash of industrial confrontation, halfbaked ideas and endorsement of an array of government policies. So much for having a new, detailed plan. The only plan that is around to tackle the current account is the government's plan, and that is a comprehensive plan. Dr Kemp-And where is that plan?",86
187,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The budget is all about that!,87
188,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Goldstein!,87
189,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is all about improving savings, which you have tried to stop us doing. It is all about improving savings by getting back to a surplus which you, the opposition, are continually trying to stop us doing by knocking off various budget measures, or trying to, and there is an array of those that you have said you will try to tackle, as well as those which have already been knocked back. The policy of the government is to improve national savings by reducing public sector dissavings. The opposition, who says it is in favour of increased savings and increased public savings, is stopping those public savings from taking place. What hypocrites opposition members are. The other part of that plan, announced in the budget, was to improve superannuation in a very big and comprehensive way. As I have said previously, that will give us in the next few years a major improvement in savings and a considerable improvement in the current account outcome. Minister for Human Services and Health",87
190,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Now that he has failed to repudiate Senator Gareth Evans, I remind the Prime Minister that on the last day he was in this parliament, last Monday, he said Richard Court and the Liberal Party were the first to raise the Penny Easton and Family Court matters in the WA parliament. I quote: Just remember this: these people separated on 24 July 1986. On 31 July 1986-exactly seven days later-Richard Court is raising their affairs in the parliament in a five-page speech. Then on 25 November 1986, four months later, in a 14-page speech ... Richard Court raises the affairs of this family in breach of a Family Court order. I ask the Prime Minister: isn't it a fact that those speeches did not relate to Family Court matters? Did they in fact relate to Mr Easton's involvement in the Western Australian Exim Corporation, one of the WA Inc. issues. Furthermore, as formal Family Court proceedings did not commence until 1987, what is the Family Court order you so clearly identified as being breached by these two speeches? Prime Minister, apart from the fact that the WA parliament did not even sit on 31 July 1986, were you misled in the information you were given, or is your distortion of the facts calculated to get your minister off the hook and away to Beijing?",87

208,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for a Gippsland! I am not sure whether he is deaf, two but I did give a general warning.",88
209,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He saysMr MCGauran-The date?,88
210,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is last week. He No, you see, because between the time. I'd asked the first questions, a week prior to that, and on Tuesday 24 November, when I asked the second series of questions relating to the same SUbject, I had spoken to Penny Easton who reiterated that the information she had with respect to the $200,000 payment or thereabouts was, in fact, correct. So, that is why I put the questions againmake to him as a he says brazenlyAnd she was quite adamant about it. And I recall her being quite adamant, in her very gentle fashion, that the information she had received and passed on You see, I saw here a subject that had nothing to do with the Family Court, but more a subject that she put to me in had to do with WA Inc That is the same line we are hearing over here. Here is one of the main questioners on the Liberal side saying directly this week that Penny Easton asked him to raise the matters, and insisted he raise the matters. But that is not in the terms of reference of the royal commission. It is only when Brian Mahon Halden to present a petition that it is a national crime. Then we have three or four members of the opposition saying that beof that petition, at the behest-they are implying-of the Minister for Human Services and Health, Penny Easton committed suicide. Yet here is Lightfoot on radio in Perth this week saying that Penny Easton encouraged him, asked him and insisted that he continue to ask a series of questions. When the other half of the marriage came in-remember that Burke had already upbraided him and said that there were marital problems-the Speaker said that these questions should not be asked as there could be a breach of the Family Law Act and the Family Court. There are no terms of reference referring to that, although Commissioner Marks said yesterday that Richard Court may be called to explain why he introduced this material. The reporter says to Lightfoot: Did it concern you at the time that you were becoming embroiled, if you like, well, in that was before the Family Court, clearly, but also that it was obviously a very personally traumatic situation for both parties? Lightfoot said: No, it didn't worry me a jot ... The gall of them. This was what he was saying on radio. The Minister for Human Services and Health has been upbraided all around the country when they are admitting raising at Penny Easton's request these matters in the parliament and, when a journalist asked Lightfoot, 'Didn't it concern you a bit that you were in the middle of a traumatic thing,' he said, 'No, it didn't worry me a jot.' What do the Liberal Party think they are doing? I also want to get on the record that on the Friday the petition was tabled, the next day, Geof Parry of Channel 7 News, Perth, pursued Penny Easton from her house into her garage, and then she broke down into hysterics and had to be rescued from Parry by friends. Incidentally, Channel 7 News, Perth, destroyed the original videotape of the incident, I am told, on the day the Marks royal commission was called. Here is a journalist, with foot in the door journalism, running around pinning Penny Easton to the back of her garage, where she breaks down in hysterics, but you say, as the member for Chisholm says, the trigger for her death was the petition-not this person. Mr Costello-Why was he there?",88
211,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He was there because you decided to raise these matters from the start in the WA parliament. That is why. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145. I draw the Prime Minister's attention back to the thrust of the original question and the quote from Hansard.",89

218,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Any member is entitled to raise a point of order.,89
219,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party clearly asked a question which related to the Prime Minister's claim that the Court speeches in 1986 concerned the family law disputes of the Eastons when plainly when you read them they did not. All of the Prime Minister's answer has related to those matters and to the behaviour of a man, Lightfoot, who was not mentioned in the question. I do not know how and on what basis you can regard it as being relevant. It is absolutely irrelevant.",89
220,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is being relevant to the issue before the House.,89
221,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Burke says: I can't answer the question. I know Mr Easton is passing through some marital problems at the present time. I suppose that is another story but it may have something to do with that. I hesitate to say that because I do not know. I recall that the Speaker said, 'I refer members to certain questions without notice which were asked by the member for Murchison-Eyre on Tuesday of this week. It has been suggested that those questions were based on information concerning proceedings before the Family Court. The release of this information might well have been unlawful. The point that does concern me, however, is whether the privilege of freedom of speech in this House might be being used to circumvent an explicit order of a court or a written law of this country. Obviously, it makes a mockery of observing a sub judice convention if the House tolerates or encourages speeches or questions aimed at subverting an order or rule given in an appropriate court. Likewise, this parliament should not permit its privileges to be used to circumvent the written law of the Commonwealth aimed at preventing the personal privacy of citizens.'",89
222,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Carmen and Halden were sitting there.,90
223,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After those comments, these questions continued to be asked. The member for O'Connor interjects. Let me quote him from 15 March. An article states: Western Australian Liberal backbencher Wilson Tuckey said yesterday his personal attacks on Carmen Lawrence had been generally agreed by the coalition as being extremely legitimate. He said he intended to repeat the attacks he made in parliament in which he said Dr Lawrence had blood on her hands over the suicide. ""It has been generally agreed we had to expose Carmen's history during the campaign. The campaign team was delighted with the exposure they got from my speech,"" Mr Tuckey said. This is the state of the Liberal Party; yet we had these matters being raised, obviously at the behest of Penny Easton, by the members of the coalition in Western Australia. Two years later, Easton has had them raised by a 'petition he has had Halden produce which the 'WA upper house said 'breached no privilege,' and it is a conservative dominated upper house committee. Richard Court has drafted the terms of reference narrowly to cover only the presentation of the petition by the other side of the marriage and has exonerated himself. Liberal politicians are saying that Richard Court carefully drafted the terms of the petition so as to exclude himself from needing to give evidence. He would be very unhappy that Mr Marks yesterday said that maybe he might have to give evidence. That is why you are up here today with questions, doing your bidding for him. So this is, as I have said, a kangaroo court. There is a massive unfairness in all this. I think all members of the Australian public are coming to understand how massively unfair it is, what an abuse of executive power it is and how the coalition, in seeking to say, as it has explicitly, that Carmen Lawrence was responsible for Penny Easton's suicide, it stands condemned and will stand condemned further for the tactics which are now being employed by John Howard's coalition.

225,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do, and I will come to the reasons in the mockery which is going on before the WA royal commission. I want to quote some passages from the transcript of yesterday. Mr Gyles, representing her, had this to say: 'As a matter of natural justice, if there is a matter which the commission are investigating which we need to know about, we need to know about it.' Let me repeat this: 'As a matter of natural justice, if there is a matter which the commission are investigating which we need to know about, we need to know about it.'

228,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Marks says, 'You're the one making the complaint. You have never put what your answer is to the allegations.' Gyles says, 'The allegations? What allegations?' Marks says, 'The ones you regard as allegations.' Gyles says, 'Which allegations? That's the point.' 'Don't cross examine me, Mr Gyles,' says Mr Marks. It is like Fawlty Towers over there. Gyles says, 'Of course I don't. All I can ask you to do, Mr Commissioner, is that we know what allegations are put against us.' Marks says, 'If you don't know what the inquiry is about, I'm afraid I won't tell you.' But it gets worse. Gyles says, 'There is a widespread conception shared apparently by Mr CowanMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

231,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Gippsland might like to withdraw that reflection on the chair. Mr MCGauran-1 withdraw. Mr Reith-My point of order is simply to seek from you a ruling as to how far this will go. The Prime Minister is now attacking the judge ru:ming the royal commission and is reading from a transcript, which suggests there is absolutely no sub judice rule whatsoever. I simply ask for your ruling on the matter.",91
232,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I indicated, I think it might have been last week when questions on this specific matter were asked, that, if there were issues on the public record and if those matters were going to be raised in this parliament, there was no reason why those matters on the public record could not be gone to. As I understand what the Prime Minister has said, these are matters on the public record. He is responding to a question that was put to him and he is being entirely relevant. Mr Downer-It is the transcript. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I just want to clarify one point of your ruling as to what you mean by 'the public record'. Mr Horne-The honest public record.",91
233,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I warn the member for Paterson. Mr Costello-You said that matters that are on the public record can be referred to, and I want to clarify that. Do you regard the transcript of the commission as the public record",91

237,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Continue with your point of order. Mr Keating interjecting,91
238,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, Prime Minister, I will get out a response. Mr Costello-Or are you saying that it is only where the transcript is published in newspapers that the newspaper's reports can be relied on?",91
239,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would think that, if a transcript is something which has been published and is on the public record, that is part of it as well. Mr Costello-But that is exactly the point. Does it mean that you can now get a copy of the transcript from the commission and you can therefore quote whatever is in that transcript? Is that the ruling? I only seek your clarification.",91
240,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I understand that. Unfortunately, unlike you, I am not a lawyer. I am saying to you that if that matter has been published and if it is on the public record then it can be used. Mr Costello-So all transcripts are in? They are in?",91

It says this: There is a widespread conception shared apparently by Mr Cowan that this inquirythis is Gylesis about whether Carmen Lawrence told a lie in parliament. Now you have said this is not what the commission is about and you have said that on more than one occasion. Marks says: I can't be, but I understand that you are saying it could be that misconception. Listen to this, Mr Speaker. This is a key point. Gyles says this: The next position might be at the other end of the scale there is or might be an allegation the petition was, as it were, fomented by my client as it were. Mr Easton was procured to make his complaints at the suggestion of my client. In other words, that Carmen Lawrence got Easton to make the petition.",92

249,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I hear your ruling on the sub judice rule, but it concerns me that if before this parliament there is to be a repeat in debate of what is now happening-whether it be before a royal commission, a commission or a court-and in any way that debate prejudices the outcome, it puts this place into significant disrepute. While I respect the high politics involved, I am more concerned about the morality of this place and the consequences in any decision handed down in any court or any commission or royal commission. I would put to you that to repeat arguments here, no matter whether they are right or wrong, that are at the same time being pursued in a legal forum outside here is to do this place an ill justice and is to prejudice the conduct of an inquiry which is being conducted by a man who is a Supreme Court judge, for all at the moment he is a royal commissioner. I would suggest to you on that basis that the Prime Minister is presently out of order under the sub judice rule.",92
250,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The right honourable member has raised an issue which, during the past two weeks, I have to say, I have had some concerns about. However, during the last two weeks, all sorts of issues which have that been raised in the royal commission to which he refers have in fact been raised again in this place. There have been questions putMr Downer-That would not worry the Prime Minister.",92
251,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just a minute. There have been statements made; they have been attributed to issues which are on the public record. I have just said that to my knowledge that particular matter is on the public record by virtue of the fact that the transcript was published. You have raised the concern; it has been a grey area. If the Prime Minister had other material which should substantiate that information, that would probably clarify the issue. But I find that, in the circumstances of the question that was put, the Prime Minister is responding very much in a relevant sense and is in order.",92
252,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, further to the point of order raised by the right honourable member for New England: the Prime Minister is doing more than just quoting the transcript.

What you have said this afternoon is that the whole of the transcript of this royal commission is now available for quotation in this parliament. If you are going to allow the Prime Minister to do that, you invite us on this side of the House to do exactly the same thing. Do you understand what you have done?",93
261,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are also putting an inflection on the voice in the way you have addressed me. Can I say to you-as I have said to the right honourable member for New England, as I thought I said in clarification to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-that, as far as I am aware, the Prime Minister is quoting from a public document.",93

288,Mr SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! The member for Flinders has the call and will be heard.,94
289,Mr REITH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has clearly breached the rule which the Speaker established at the start of the week. It is a very simple rule but a rule which has not been abided by by his ruling-that is, both sides of this parliament ought to be treated on an equal basis. Quite frankly, we are sick to death of the uneven treatment that we have had, particularly in the last week. We had more than enough of the abuse of this parliament by this Prime Minister and by his government in the last fortnight. We are not prepared to put up with this biased, unreasonable treatment, as typified by your ruling on this particular matter. I barely need to go back and remind people of events earlier in this week. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) passed a speech across the table. He did it like thisruling by demonstration-across to the Prime Minister. As a result of that we had outrage from the other side and we had from the Speaker a ruling which required and saw the Deputy Leader of the Opposition removed from the House understanding order 304Aremoved into the sin-bin, as we colloquially refer to it. In our view, that was the order, that was the precedent set to which all others ought to be required to abide. In the events that have just transpired in the House, we saw exactly the same from the Prime Minister as he flicked his document acrossMr Costello-Threw it across the table.",94
290,Mr REITH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Threw it across to the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Speaker, you failed to mete out to the government, and in particular to the Prime Minister, the same treatment as was handed out to the opposition earlier this week. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), only on Monday, asked the Speaker: . . . after your action I assume that, if similar behaviour emanates from the other side, you will from. enforce a similar discipline. The Speaker said: In my comment about the enforcement of standing orders, that applies. The Speaker is damned, quite frankly, out of his own mouth. When the Leader of the Opposition specifically put this to the Speaker. I am not surprised he put it to you because, quite frankly, too many times we have had rough treatment handed out to this side of our House-our expectation was that when we get the same behaviour from the other side the same treatment will be meted out to them. The Leader of the Opposition, bringing his experience to the fore, specifically put that question to the Speaker only on Monday-if the same thing happens again, would you apply the same treatment? The Speaker said yes. When he is challenged, when the exact same circumstances are presented to him again, we get this failure and refusal to treat the Prime Minister as he ought to be treated. Quite frankly, I must also say that we find that this is not a single event isolated from others. Sadly, I must say that this particular of the Speaker reflects other rulings and other processes which the government has adopted in the last week. We had only yesterday an abuse of parliamentary process of a sort that, I must say, I have not previously seen in the parliament, and I have been here for 10 years. Yesterday a matter was raised by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). He raised a significant issue; it was a matter of privilege. The matter of privilege he raised went to the processes by which the Speaker ruled earlier in the day on another matter which had been before the chamber. The right honourable member for New England, in the matter of privilege which he put to the Speaker, suggested that he had concerns about the involvement of the Speaker and his office in the preparation of a motion which condemned the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). At that time, the Speaker came back into the House and, in an unprecedented way, made a statement to the House to the effect that, as the matter raised by the right honourable member for New England went to the Speaker's own functions and operations, in this particular case the matter would be best sent off to the Privileges Committee. That in itself was not an unfair statement. It is only a matter of common sense that where there are hot political issues in the House, as the Speaker in his statement suggested, then rather than having them adjudicated in the House they ought to go off to a committee-a fair point that any fair-minded person would agree with. Instead of having the matter go off to the Privileges Committee, as suggested by the Speaker, the government brutally used its numbers to overturn the clear advice and opinion of the Speaker and simply disregarded and overturned the motion moved by the right honourable member for New England that the matter be referred to the Privileges Committee. That is one instance. We had a second instance yesterday which, I must say, also did not reflect well on the chair. That was the matter concerning the member for Chisholm. In that case, we had a spurious matter raised earlier in the week by the Prime Minister, who claimed that the member for Chisholm had arguably been in breach of privilege. So spurious was itperhaps it was a premonition-that I raised the matter prior to the Speaker's response on the basis that the privilege claimed by the Prime Minister should be treated as equivalent to spurious points of or-r. It was so transparently a political tacti - a political tactic employed by the Prim Minister, in cahoots with other members of he government, so as to take the heat off t e Carmen Lawrence affair. Each and every elerent of this fracas is part and parcel of the d/!fence that the government has been running: to basically tough it out against the evidence, which has shown, virtually as conclusively as you can possibly get, that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) had misled the Western Australian parliament and that, subsequently, in an address to the National Press Club--the controversial speech which was passed across the table-she had also misled the Australian people. In that statement, in response to the matter of privilege raised by t- Prime Minister, the Speaker came to the nclusion that it was one of those issues tha could go either way. I must say that I was ve disappointed in that statement by the Speak r because this was a clear case. There was no way known that it was open to doubt. This was an open and shut case. There was no question of privilege whatsoever. Everybody in this House knows it. Everybody in the gallery who knows anything about these matters knows that the whole thing was spurious and should never have been put up, but we know the basis of it, the motivation of it. It was merely a tactic. Why did the government move for the thing to be immediately dealt with by the House rather than by the committee? I have my suspicions about that, but we do know that the Prime Minister's office, on the afternoon before the Speaker made his statement, were busy making their own inquiries as to who was on the Privileges Committee. The reason they were making inquiries as to who was on the Privileges Committee was that they wanted to see what argument there would be in the Privileges Committee if this spurious privileges claim ever got to the committee. The conclusion they reached is pretty obvious. It was that if the matter was sent to the Privileges Committee there would, at the very least, be a dissentient voice, a minority voice, and that that would tarnish and reveal the paucity of the claim being made. Mr Deputy Speaker, those two matters alone-though there are a number of others, in addition to the matter that has been raised today-unfortunately present a picture which, from the opposition's point of view, reveals the operation of the parliament not to be even-handed and fair but to be totally weighted against the interests of the opposition. I do not say that in the sense that any particular individual should be given any particular airplay, but I emphasise its importance by saying this. The parliament is the people's parliament. We are here as representatives of the people and it is our function stand and speak on behalf of our constituents. Sure, the party political system has its play. There are many factors at work. That is the essence of the democratic system. When, as in this current parliament, you have rulings which clearly fly in the face of the right of private members to raise matters, you are not denying us personally, as individuals, the right to speak, the right to be heard, the right to present the case and points of view of our constituents; you are denying the rights of our constituents to be heard. That is why we take this as a matter of very grave concern, Mr Deputy Speaker. When we get a bad ruling, a poor ruling, a ruling without precedent, of the sort we had today, we lodge our objections not just on behalf of those sitting in this place but on behalf of our constituents, who are entitled to have a parliament in which every voice is allowed to be heard in the proper form and in accordance with the standing orders. What that requires, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the impartiality which only the Speaker can bring to affairs of the chamber. Yes, this chamber can be a theatre. Yes, this chamber can be overcome by controversy. Yes, it can be overcome by the emotions of the moment. Yes, it can be overcome by ill-judgment from time to time. When it is so overcome, it is the responsibility of the Speaker to fairly adjudicate on the matters put to the Speaker. I would have to say that on this occasion there is no way known that this is fair treatment. This is about as blatant and clear a case of unfair treatment being meted out to this side as you could have. We are, I suppose-and I would say this is a sad reflection on a parliament-in a sense a bit immune to it, because, quite frankly, the way in which this parliament operates from day to day does not provide the high standards of fairness and equal treatment that we believe it ought to exhibit. Question time itself is a classic example. We ask simple, sensible questions and we get nothing but irrelevance and long, tedious answers. Most people listening as they sit in the gallery today would appreciate that we have asked a number of questions. What do to you get from the government? Do you get a fair answer, an answer which provides people with information on which they can judge an issue? What you get is political propaganda by the bucket load. The Prime Minister preens himself for hours in his office before question time practising his answersMr MCGauran-Rehearsing his lines.",94
291,Mr REITH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Rehearsing his lines, standing in front of the mirror-not so much to better inform the Australian public but just to tip a bucket on the opposition in the malevolent, vitriolic way he does day in, day out. Yes, we are in a sense immune to it, Mr Deputy Speaker, but in no way do we condone, accept or acquiesce with this constant downtreading of the standards of parliament. I met somebody not so long ago who worked in the Old Parliament House many years ago. They commented on the differences they saw between the high standards of the old chamber, particularly when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister, and the low standards that we now have from the current Prime Minister. I suppose many Australians would say to themselves, 'They're all as bad as each other.' That is a cynical view that many Australians have about politicians. I am not saying that we on this side are perfect in any way, but it is true that standards in this parliament have reached an all-time low. Mrs Crosio--Look in the mirror occasionally.",96
292,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Mr Jenkins)Order!,96
293,Mr REITH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The parliament is basically a shambles. Your people are so slack when it comes to this parliament that last night they would not come into the parliament to ensure that there was a quorum. The House had to be closed down. You then set another time for the House to resume and, on the ringing of the bells, your own people did not bother to tum up. These blokes are paid to be here. We were dealing with an important piece of legislation-the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill. That bill actually fell off the Notice Paper. That is a classic example of your incompetence and, worse still, it is a classic example of your disregard for the parliament and the contempt with which the parliament is treated by your people day in, day out; week in, week out; month in, month out. The matter I have raised today goes specifically to the operations of the parliament. It goes to the rights of members, particularly on this side of the House. We all know that the Labor Party's basic attitude is that if you have the numbers you should use them. They have a no holds barred approach to the operation of the parliament. I am sad to say that this is not the first occasion on which the Speaker's office has been brought into disrepute as a consequence of the rulings of the Speaker. Mr Downer-Where is the Speaker? Mr Costello-Why isn'the here?",97
294,Mr REITH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"It does say a lot that it was only a matter of a few weeks ago that the Prime Minister in the federal Labor Party parliamentary caucus was attacking the Speaker and bemoaning the fact that we have not had a Speaker as good as Sir Billy Snedden. Of course, Sir Billy Snedden was the last truly independent Speaker that we have had. Of course, he was a Liberal Speaker appointed by Malcolm Fraser. If we go back further, a lot of incidents have given people cause to reflect upon the way in which the House has been operated. In August 1993, the Australian reported: The new Speaker, Mr Stephen Martin, was forced to apologise yesterday after ""dumping on"" former Opposition leader Mr Andrew Peacock over a dredged-up, nine-year-old Liberal Party raffle seats in Parliament . . . That was not the only incident. In fact, there have been a number of incidents which, when looked at together, build up a picture whereby the operations of this parliament, rather than being treated on a fair and even-handed basis, have been used and abused for the political benefit of this government. That is what we take particular offence to. The truth of the matter is that the parliament is not for us individually; it is for our constituents. If our constituents are to be given a fair go, then the rules in this place by which people are entitled to speak and the rules by which people's behaviour is to be judged must be dispensed in an even-handed and impartial way. As we have seen in the parliament not only today but this week, the fact of the matter is that that cannot be said. We are very disappointed in this ruling. The truth of the matter is that at the very start of this week-on Monday, 28 August-we had an incident which, for all intents and purposes, was exactly the same. No fair-minded person could come to any other conclusion. Under those circumstances, the treatment to be meted out for that conduct should be exactly the same. For that reason, we do dissent from the ruling of the Speaker. It is a most unfair ruling, a most unreasonable ruling. We are not going to have the numbers. I know that these people will brutally use their numbers for their own political advantage. But, as I sit down, I know, and I have the conviction, that on this matter we are right and this motion ought to be carried. (Time expired)",97
295,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,OBJECTION TO RULING,Is the motion seconded?,97
296,Mr COSTELLO,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is a dissent motion which, on every basis of fairness and on the basis of the standing orders, ought to be passed by this House. As the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Reith) said, unquestionably, those who close their mind and follow the lead of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this debate will back him up, therefore back up his influence over the for Speaker and therefore try to ensure that the Speaker is not held to account for what should be the Speaker's prime responsibility in this chamber-to make sure that he enformake ces the standing orders on an even-handed and honest basis. But, as the Manager of Opposition Business also said, there is no question, regardless of how the people on that side are directed vote, what the outcome of this particular debate should be. This is a debate Speaker's ruling is patently wrong. It is the Speaker's ruling in relation to a point of order that was taken by the honourable member Bendigo (Mr Reid) understanding order 304A. The honourable member for Bendigo said that, in view of standing order 304A, Prime Minister had engaged in disorderly conduct. He drew the attention of the Speaker to that disorderly conduct and asked the doubt Speaker to operate and act under that rule. The Speaker's ruling was that there was no point of order. In the first place, he did not actually even try to take on the argument the member for Bendigo-and he should Opposition. have. But, in the second place, if he had it on, if he had applied the rule in relation disorderly conduct, he could have come to only one conclusion, namely, the suspension of the Prime Minister, and he could have come to only one conclusion because the words: Speaker had given a ruling on this very point I in these very circumstances in this very week. There was no question about that. It was vivid in everybody's mind. It should have been appropriate vivid in the Speaker's mind. That is why the opposition and the member for Bendigo quite rightly took it up. It is a matter of regret for us that the er is not in the chair during the conduct this debate. This is a very serious debate about the Speaker's ruling. The Speaker ought to be here. The Speaker ought to be listening to this. He ought to be taking on board the arguments that are made and the arguments relation to the standing orders. I want to make a few other points. One is that, in relation to the episode of events led up to the Prime Minister's conduct, both sides were on a general warning. There question about that. If you go through the Hansard when it is published, you will see that both sides were on a general warning. The Speaker had gone to great lengths to it clear to the government benches that there was a general warning in relation to them, as there was in relation to the opposition. I remember it well. It is so rarely done by the Speaker when he gives a general to warning that he makes sure that the general warning applies to that side of the parliament where the as well as to this side. A general warning meant that every single person in the chamber from the time of that for general warning was on notice that any disorderly conduct would result in a suspension. Anybody who had been here on Monthe day-and the Prime Minister had been here on Monday-was on notice as to what the Speaker regarded as disorderly. If there is any about it, it was actually clarified by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) at page 594 of Hansard as to why the suspension rule had been invoked against me on of Monday. It was taken up by the Leader of the The Speaker said that when leave taken was granted to me to table documents, the to documents were thrown across the chamber. What he meant, of course was that they were thrown across to the Prime Minister's desk. He said these words-and you focus on these do not believe that that is the !lPpropriate way in which members in this place should perform. If it was not appropriate for me, it is not for the Prime Minister. If it is not appropriate on this side of the parliament, it is not appropriate on that side of the parliament. The Speaker ought to be the person Speakwho ensures that the rules are upheld. You of cannot have an umpire in a football game who plays them in some circumstances to ,me team but will not play them to the other. This is a responsible position of Speaker. I say to this House that there can be no in confidence in the operation of this House whilst there is no confidence that the Speaker can independently enforce the standing orders. which We know why there can be no confidence in the Speaker to enforce those standing orders. is no As the Manager of Opposition Business indicated in his speech, it all goes back to his position-his position of beholdenness to the Prime Minister for his appointment. If there was any doubt about that, the Prime Minister, just to make sure the Speaker remembered it, gave him a whack-'a backhander', as it was described in the press-at the caucus meeting. As is reported in the press accounts of 29 March 1995: The Prime Minister has blamed the Speaker's inability to control the Parliament for his public image, further undermining the authority of his position. Mr Keating told Caucus yesterday that the failure of the Speaker, Mr Martin, and his deputy to quell the noise during Question Time had contributed to his image problems. I will tell you what contributes to the Prime Minister's image problem: the way in which he seeks to make the Speaker beholden to him. That is a much worse problem for his image. If this Prime Minister could sit and behave as Prime Ministers in the past have behaved, if he could accept independent rulings and if he could bring himself to abide by even-handed enforcement, he would not have that kind of image problem. The first error is that he will not accept that, and he compounds it with a second error. Because he will not accept independent rulings, he compounds it by making the Speaker beholden to him as well. The Sydney Morning Herald reported: MPs said they were surprised by the attack, describing it as a 'very clear backhander' to Mr Martin, who is in Madrid ... Let us make clear how all this comes about, why the Speaker finds himself in this impossible position and why it was that he was forced to make such a clear error in the enforcement of the standing orders earlier. This is occurring because this parliament is grinding to a halt over the Lawrence affair, because the Prime Minister will not enforce standards. That is what is happening in this parliament. Because the Prime Minister will not enforce standards against the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and because he will not stand the minister aside pending the outcome of the commission, this parliament is grinding to a halt. You are seeing it in the performance last night when the House lapsed, you are seeing it in the efforts of the Speaker, and you are seeing it in the Prime Minister's behaviour this afternoon-behaviour which, I would put to this House, has probably never been seen in this House before. The Prime Minister gets up and reads from the actual transcript of a commission which is still continuing, which is in progress, and gives, by the inflection of his voice and his flawed side comments, his opinion. The way in which he was giving his opinion could not be calculated to do anything other than to influence the commissioner in the discharge of his duties. There would be no other reason for the Prime Minister to be quoting the commissioner's decisions, no other reason to be quoting counsel and no other reason for the inflection, than to influence the outcome of that commission. Then we had a ruling by the Speakerwhich I believe the Speaker will, in due course, have to countermand himself-to allow the Prime Minister to proceed, that any issue which was a public matter could be relied upon in this House. When I questioned him on when it became a public matter, the essence of his decision was that it was a public matter if it was in the transcript. A commission alway[; produces a transcript. A superior court always produces a transcript. That ruling means that, in relation to any question in any court of law or in any commission, any member of this House who can get hold of that transcript can then say it is in the public domain, can then read it out and can then comment-presumably under absolute privilege, and presumably free from any attempt to enforce contempt laws. It is a new doctrine. Why was that new doctrine promulgated? It was promulgated to protect the Prime Minister who had gone wrong. Instead of pulling up the Prime Minister who goes wrong, the Speaker allows him to go, and the rulings become more bizarre by the minute. They became more bizarre by the minute in relation to the point of order that was taken by the member for Bendigo. That is the kind of trouble you get yourself into if you want to rip up the rule book. And in relation to conduct and ministerial standards, the rules get ripped up one after the other. Today it is Lawrence. Tomorrow it is the courts. Now it is enforcement of the standing orders. It is a morass into which this government is sinking because it cannot cut itself free. The only thing that will stop this House sinking into that morass is if the Speaker can stand up and pull it back. If we lose in this House the independence of the Speaker and the capacity of the Speaker to draw a line and say 'this far and no further' there will be no rules in this House. There will be new doctrines in this House. There will be changed attitudes to commissions, changed attitudes to ministerial standards and, I have to tell you, changed attitudes to question time. If this side of the House can have no confidence in the standing orders being enforced independently, we can have no confidence in question time. We can have no confidence in the fact that if we come in and perform our role we will, within the evenhanded and independent enforcement of standing orders, be entitled to do so. That is the morass that this Prime Minister is sucking this parliament into. And, oh, didn't we hear all about it on Monday when we sought to draw his attention to the speech and I stood here and passed it across to his side of the table. Didn't we hear all about it from the Prime Minister. He went into the caucus meeting and he instructed the caucus members that they had to kick up a fuss about it. Oh, yes, he did. He instructed them that they had to make as much mileage out of it as they possibly could. He attacked the Sydney Morning Herald because it would not publish photographs. I hope the Sydney Morning Herald is publishing photographs tomorrow, and I hope Michael Gordon is writing about it tomorrow with all the outrage he can muster. I hope the ABC, with all of the outrage they can muster, will be writing about the Prime Minister tonight. I hope that all of those media outlets that have been going on with their general moral outrage are concerned about the moral outrage today. But I will tell you that it is a double moral outrage. It is a double moral outrage because this is now no longer a question of throwing leaflets across a desk. This is a question as to way. whether standards are going to be enforced in an independent and even-handed way. And that is a much greater question. As I have said, the throwing of documents across this table has been done a lot of times in the past. I have done it. The Prime Minister has done it. The key point is this: on Monday, the Speaker said no-one else should do it on pain of suspension. Three days later, we find it was not a ruling that no-one should do it, on pain of suspension; it was a ruling that noone except the Prime Minister should do it, on pain of suspension. Or maybe it was a ruling that nobody except the Labor Party should do it, on pain of suspension. Or maybe it was a ruling that nobody on this side of the House should do it. Maybe the ruling was actually that a right-handed pass across is unacceptable and a left-handed pass back is acceptable. Maybe that was the ruling. But I tell you this: there is no logic, there is no defensibility-despite all the huffing and bluffing that Thomas the Tank Engine will now get up and show us at the dispatch boxand there is no basis at all on which there can be a distinguishment. Therefore, when you look at the merits, when you go to the record, when you go to the standing orders, and when you go to the transcript, there is no basis at all for this Prime Minister not being suspended today. There is no basis whatsoever other than that the Speaker failed in his duty. And, as the Speaker failed in his duty, this House should thoroughly and absolutely dissent from his ruling.",97
297,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"What absolutely hypocritical huffing and puffing! You could have picked anybody else on your back benches or your front bench to second this motion or move it. You chose to pick one of your most disruptive influences in parliament. He has sat here day in, day out, defying the Speaker's instructions to the point where he was quite legitimately suspended for tabling documents, obviously in the most inappropriate way. I will get on to that point in a minute. We will not take any of this hypocritical cant. Mr Costello-Keep the evidence, by the",100
298,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Give us the evidence. Mr Costello-No, I can't pass it across; I can't do that.",101
299,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"All right, he does not want to pass it across. That is a bit too bad for him. What a lot of hypocritical cant we heard from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) here today. Let me draw instantly and immediately the distinction between the behaviour in which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition engaged and the behaviour in which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) engaged, which members have frequently had recourse to in this parliament when members have asked to take a look at this or that document or, even if they have not asked to take a look at it, they have had it volunteered from the other side of the House. We in this chamber have sat here repeatedly over the years and seen instances where documents were tossed across one side of the House or the other. Generally speaking, they are documents of this description. Since he will not pass it back to me, I will use an equivalent piece of paper. The difference between these two propositions-the one in which the Prime Minister was involved when he tossed this piece of paper, or a piece of paper exactly the same, and when a bundle of documents was thrown across the table at him on Monday-was simply this: leave had been sought by the deputy leader to table those documents. Unusually, because the government does not normally give leave to table documents-we are not unique in that regard; that has been general practice in this Housewe gave him permission to table the documents. It was a large, thick, heavy transcript of materials from a press conference presentation by Carmen Lawrence. In giving permission for the deputy leader to table them, there is a distinct process. The process of tabling, for those who are at all interested in this debate, is that, when permisof sion to table is given, you pass it to the clerk or, in the case of the opposition, the deputy clerk. That is what normally happens when you table a document. That is the orderly process of tabling a document. What did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition do when invited to go through the normal processes of tabling a document? Rather than passing those documents to the clerk, which is the only appropriate way to table documents, having been given permission to do it, he lined up the Prime Minister, leaned across the table, and tossed them at him. That is precisely what he did. What the Prime Minister did, as far as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) was concerned, was not to table the document. He was not in the process of tabling a document. The Leader of the Opposition had asked him a question about where he was securing his material from. The Prime Minister said, 'All this material is in a newspaper,' and then he tossed that newspaper---one page of it-across the table to the Leader of the Opposition. It is over that which the opposition is in here expressing a bit of exceptional unction and hypocritical cant when it comes to behaviour in this parliament. Mr Ruddock-Absolute double standards.",101
300,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Double standards? Rubbish! That has absolutely nothing to do with double standards at all. They were two totally different circumstances. The first was where you asked for permission to table documents and had been granted permission to table documents. There is an appropriate process by which you table documents. The other is an instance in which the Leader of the Opposition was saying, 'What are you supposed to be quoting from? What materials have you got?' The Prime Minister then passed it across the table to him. They are two totally distinctive performances. What we find the opposition then did was pad out their concern in that regard. Their objection to that took all of about 30 seconds to get across-and it takes all of about 30 seconds to answer it, I might say. They then went on to a generalised rage about standards behaviour in this House. Let me say this about that: in my experience, an opposition has never been so generously treated by any Speaker in this chamber and has certainly been better treated than any other in the experience I ever had when I happened to be an opposition backbencher. A doctrine has developed in this place which gives enormous latitude in the asking of questions which any reading of the standing orders would see set aside. But the opposition front-bench generally and the opposition leader in particular are regularly given sion to ask questions along those lines in order to provide the maximum opportunity to open up those issues for discussion in this chamber. I can remember Bill Hayden being suspended from this parliament twice when he was Leader of the Opposition for getting up and making, I thought at the time, quite ordinary points. You get the Leader of the Opposition now being given virtually permanent licence to heckle, to interject, and it takes a great deal before a Speaker is prepared to call him to book. Leaders of the opposition have benefited enormously from the generous treatment by successive Labor Speakers in that regard as well. Nobody who has served in the chamber on both sides of the House, as I have, could say otherwise when they review their experience in that regard. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on one matter in what he had to say: the issues in this House have not been advanced by the existence of that royal commission in Western Australia. The House has not been advanced by that for one very specific reason: what we have seen emanate from the executive in Western Australia is the Star Chamber. What the opposition, which claims great parliamentary standards, seems to fail to remember is this: the entire process of parliamentary privilege, the entire process of the protection of parliamentary debate, stemmed from an unwillingness by the parliament of the day to contemplate the ability of the judiciary to extend effectively royal commission powers to its members. Indeed, it was Speaker Lenthall who got up and said a statement which I think all members of the House would be aware of: 'I have neither eyes to see, nor ears to hear, nor mouth to speak, except as the House of Commons dictates to me'. Who he said that to was the King's enforcers and who he was protecting were Messrs Pym and others in parliament at the time who were to be subject, for words they had said in parliament, to the attention of effectively a royal commission. What happened to them when they made those statements was they were locked up in the tower and then they were handed over to permis- commissioners in the Star Chamber to be interrogated without normal rules of evidence, without rights of defence-all of the things which persist in the creation of a royal commission. We on this side of the House do not accept the conspiracy-a conspiracy now described as 'liaison' - between the opposition front-bench and Mr Court to put in place a royal commission with completely unprecedented terms of reference, with terms of reference that, first, are highly political and, secondly, then proceed from being highly political to being grossly unfair in what can be examined. Let us not forget where all this comes from. This comes from a parliamentary answer by the Prime Minister to questioning from the other side of the House on precisely those unfair terms of reference. Those opposite stood up in this place and questioned the Prime Minister and criticised, effectively, via their questions, the Prime Minister for introducing the fact into this chamber that there were a series of representations made in parliament going to family law matters and others related to the issues that subsequently turned up in the royal commission as terms of reference but not included in those terms of reference. That was what the Prime Minister was dealing with here. He has been answering a persistent line of questioning on this royal commission from the opposition since this royal commission has been put in place. It is now just dawning on the general public and on the media who have been handling this that there are things afoul in this royal commission. It is just beginning to get through that the government has some sound reasons for wanting to stand this process up and for standing beside their minister. They are sound reasons that have probably been emphasised by the very dignified conduct of the former justice minister in WA, David Smith, before that royal commission when he said, 'No matter what might happen to me, though indeed I have been referred to the Attorney-General by the royal commissioner, I will stand by parliamentary privilege; I will stand by cabinet confidentiality; I will not permit myself to be questioned in a way that breaches my ministerial oath; and I will not dignify what is an attack on the fundamental democratic institutions which dictates these proceedings. ' As I said, I agree 100 per cent with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on this. This parliament has been degraded by the processes of that royal commission and its interests are not advanced by the debates that have taken place in this House on the processes of that royal commission. He is completely correct in that regard. But he is incorrect when he says that any substandard behaviour in this House emanates from that or that it is an example of that process. Extraordinary latitude-decently based, I might say, but extraordinary latitude-has been given to the opposition to create mayhem in this place. They know dam well too that they have from time to time conducted their tactic meetings to achieve precisely that effect. They know absolutely that that is what their intention has been in that regard. Having made those points, rejecting completely the opposition's assignation to the government of responsibility for standards in this place, let me return to the original point. There has been a great deal of latitude given in this debate in your absence, Mr Speaker, to the variety of issues that ought to be raised. Let me go back to the basic point of your ruling which started this dissent process. There is an absolute difference between a situation where permission is granted to a member of the opposition, or any other member for that matter, to formally table documents and what has been a general pattern of behaviour, not in throwing documents at people, but in tossing them either side of that desk, which has persistently been the case in this chamber. I do it every time. I get up and introduce a bill. I stand up and introduce a bill. I have an Abbott, A. 1. element of that bill which is usually the explanatory notes associated with it. When the bill is presented, I pick up the alternative notes, I toss them across the table to the opposition frontbencher sitting there and the opposition frontbencher receives that material. In this particular instance, the opposition leader was questioning the sources of the Prime Minister's quotes, questioning whether or not they had been public documents. The Prime Minister picked up a piece of paper this big and tossed it across the chamber to the Leader of the Opposition. There is an absolute difference between that and picking up a thick documentMr Ruddock-Half a dozen pages.",101
301,Mr BEAZLEY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"There were a dam sight more than half a dozen. Having been given permission to table it for the House, in which the normal process is to put it in the hands of the clerk-not give it to the Prime Minister or whatever-he chose not to put it in the hands of the clerk but to throw it at the Prime Minister. There is a complete difference between those two aspects of behaviour. It is always a problem for Speakers of the House when they deal with standing orders, because they have to deal with narrowly defined things and they have to make narrowly defined judgments. You cannot take a generalised view of any element of that; you must look to the precise detail of it. The precise details of it show that your rulings on both occasions, Mr Speaker, were entirely correct. Having finished, I move: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative.

324,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Now you are debating the point of order. I will just say this so that it is PAIRS perfectly understood: it is the discretion of the chair to adjudicate,106
325,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"Ah, discretion.",106
326,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,No. Hang on!,106
327,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,106
328,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"No. I have just been writing it here, as a matter of fact. All matters are at the discretion of the chair, particularly this one. As I understand it, sub judice hinges on the phrase that goes something like 'likely to prejudice deliberations'. Again, as I understand it, the material which the Prime Minister is quoting from is the transcript of proceedings in front of the royal commissioner himself. The chair therefore has difficulty in saying, 'How could the Prime Minister, by reading the transcript in this chamber, prejudice the commissioner when he has already heard it?' Mr Costello-It is a comment.",106
329,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,The Prime Minister said he was going to read from those comments. The Prime Minister is in order.,106
330,Mr KEATING,NOES,"Gyles says: There is or might be an allegation that the petition was, as it were, fomented by my client, that Mr Easton was procured to make his complaints at the suggestion of my client. In other words, Easton was arranged to do it. Gyles continues: Now, we would like to know if this is on the agenda or not? Marks says: I wouldn't think so. lf that is not on the agenda, what is on the agenda? Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on your ruling. You said you would allow the Prime Minister to quote from the transcript. What the Prime Minister has done twice in the last 20 seconds is not simply to quote from the transcript but to place constructions upon the words that were used in the royal commission.",106
331,Mr HOWARD,NOES,That is right.,107
332,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,I have ruled that the Prime Minister is in order in answering this question. We will hear the Prime Minister out. Mr Andrews-Will you hear me out? Why don't you hear me out?,107
333,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"You have made your point of order. Mr Andrews-I have not finished, Mr Speaker. The House of Representatives Practice contains a passage from Speaker Snedden on 30 May 1978. It was important enough to be quoted in the House of Representatives Practice. It reads: But I regard it as going beyond the bounds of our sub judice rules if the honourable gentleman any construction on the matter for the simple reason that if the Royal Commissioner in fact concluded in a way which was consistent with the honourable gentleman's construction it may appear order. that the Commissioner was influenced, whereas in fact he would not have been. So I ask the honourable gentleman not to put constructions on this matter. That is what we as members of this place",107
334,Unknown,NOES,Honourable members interjecting,107
335,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Order! Mr Andrews-Just wait a moment. That is what we as members of this place are being asked to abide by, and I ask you to rule accordingly.",107
336,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is not putting construction on evidence before the commission.,107
337,Unknown,NOES,Opposition members interjecting,107
338,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I want to hear the point of order.,107
339,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"The Prime Minister is pointing out what it is that is being investigated, what it is that the terms of reference cover, from the statements that are being made by the royal commissioner himself. He is not making findings as to anybody's guilt or innocence about a particular matter. The Prime Minister's remarks are going directly to the terms of reference of the royal commission. It is a set of passages, as you can hear from what the Prime Minister has read so far, that goes to his interpretation of what it is that he may investigate-not what conclusions he is going to reach. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on that point of order: I refer you particularly to the words read out by the Prime Minister when he referred to an exchange between counsel for the Minister for Human Services and Health and the royal commissioner. What the Prime Minister attempted to infer from that exchange was that the conduct of the commission was in some way inappropriate. Basically, he wants to say that it is a kangaroo court. There could be no clearer case of the Prime Minister using the transcript to then proceed to transgress the very passage which the member for Menzies has so very eloquentputs ly put to you. On that basis, Mr Speaker, you cannot possibly do other than uphold the point of order made by the member for Menzies and rule the Prime Minister out of",107
340,Mr BEAZLEY,NOES,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order again: the particular paragraphs which he was referring to went directly to a question from Gyles about what it is that he could cover. It then went to his response to Gyles's questions on what it was that he could cover. It was not what the honourable member for Flinders was talking about.",107
341,Mr KEATING,NOES,"On the same point of order, Mr Speaker: the Sydney Morning Herald today has a story headed 'Pressure eases on Lawrence as case is outlined'. It said: The chances of . . . Dr Lawrence ... improved sharply yesterday as her legal team sought to have the inquiry outline the case she would have to answer when giving evidence ... There is a whole lot of comment in here. What is the opposition arguing-that the Sydney Morning Herald can comment but not the parliament? Is that where we are down to? Is that the bankruptcy of the argument?",107
342,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"Very recently this afternoon I said that, in respect of all of these matters, the test is whether or not there is likely to be a prejudice on deliberations. What I have said is that, if it is a public document, if it is a transcript that is out in the public marketplace, that particular document can be quoted from, and I think everybody has accepted that.",107
343,Mr HOWARD,NOES,I accept that.,108
344,Mr SPEAKER,NOES,"The Leader of the Opposition is indicating that that is the case. Therefore, I would ask the Prime Minister",108
345,Mr HOWARD,NOES,"What we don't accept is your allowing people to put their own interpretations on the transcript. Mr Speaker, three-quarters of an hour ago I took a point of order. NA",108
346,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 5.30 p.m., understanding orders, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",108
347,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,I require that the question be put forthwith. Question resolved in the negative. NA Minister for Human Services and Health,108
348,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"About three-quarters of an hour ago, when the Prime Minister used the expression, 'What is this, Fawlty Towers?' to describe the remarks that had been made by the commissioner, I took the point of order that that transgressed the sub judice rule. You have made a ruling about the transcript. I think that is an extraordinarily expansive ruling and I think it has great implications for the future.",108
349,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, cut it out.",108
350,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It does-great implications. However, the ruling you have made in relation to qualitative comments on the proceedings, we cannot accept, because if you are going to allow a situation where somebody can quote from a transcript and then say, 'This means that such-and-such is the situation,' drawing a very strong subjective conclusion, that clearly breaches the sub judice rule about prejudicing the findings of the commission-nothing else could.",108
351,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not sure that it necessarily does that, but it certainly would give",108
352,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course. Mr Costello---They are continuing proceedings, you dill.",108
353,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! It would be an opinion being expressed by a member of this place. The Prime Minister has the call. I ask him to come to the substance of the answer.,108
354,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me go to the key question about the clerk who prepared the petition. Mr Marks says this: I have always envisaged it to be my province and only province and I intended to keep well away from anything that happened inside parliament, which includes the presentation of the petition. Gyles says: But the preparation of the petition is the crunch point so far as my client is concerned because that is her only possible involvement in what was the decision whether to table. To which the commissioner then says",108
355,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have lost it.,108
356,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I beg your pardon?,108
357,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is simply quoting from a document. He is in order.,108
358,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To which the commissioner says, 'That's right.' The commissioner says, 'I have always wanted to keep away from that which was inside parliament, which includes the presentation of the petition.' Gyles says, 'Well, hang on, as far as my client is concerned, that is the crunch point,' to which Marks then contradicts himself and says, 'That's right.' It is absurd, what is happening here. It is an unjust iniquity, what is happening here. It is out of control, what is happening here. Mr MCGauran-On a point of order: Mr Speaker, standing order 75 prevents any member of this House reflecting on the judiciary. The Prime Minister is launching an assault on Commissioner Marks. Mr Reith-A further point of order: Mr Speaker, you should require the Prime Minister to withdraw his last remarks.",108
359,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, get out. Mr Reith-That could not be a clearer case of a breach of the sub judice rule. Mr Speaker, if you are not prepared to require the Prime Minister to withdraw that, quite frankly, you might as well just tear up the sub judice rule. You have got a precedent here. You have a full statement and an explanation of the sub judice rule. There could be no clearer breach of it. My point of order is that, if the standing orders and the conventions of this House are to mean absolutely anything, you have no choice.",108
360,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I can say to the honourable member, because he has been here for the last two weeks when debate on this particular issue in a general sense has been on, that I think there have been worse things said and no points of order were taken, requests for withdrawal or whatever. The Prime Minister-and I am trying to get to the end of his answer-is quoting from a document. He is in order to do so. I invite the Prime Minister now to come to the answer and to bring it to a close.",109
361,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Gyles is seeking to know what matters he must defend. He is not even being told. What he is being told, when he asks whether it goes to the petition, is, 'No, it's not about that.' He asks, 'Does it go to whether my client procured the services of Easton?' He is told, 'No, it doesn't go to that.' Finally, he says, 'You see, I can't concentrate at all on the propriety'Mr Costello-What are you, opposing counsel?",109
362,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition! We are trying to get this concluded. He is not helping. Opposition members-Who?,109
363,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The House.,109
364,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is very inconvenient for you. I make this final point. The commissioner said: You see, I can't concentrate at all on the propriety of Halden presenting a petition. I have got to get away from that. It is the Halden petition which is the point at issue. The commissioner was saying, 'I have to get away from that.' Mr Gyles cannot even understand, upon questioning, whether or not the issues to putMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order",109
365,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am not going to be silenced by interminable points of order which are out of order. Mr Reith-You will sit down!,109
366,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Prime Minister will have the chance for his answer in a moment. I call the member for Flinders. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order, this time in respect of these new and fresh remarks of the Prime Minister which go to the impartiality and integrity of the royal commissioner. He has taken the words of the transcript. He has gone far further than anybody has gone in the last two weeks on this matter. The point of order is that he has now taken words off the transcript, has manipulated them for his own political purposes and, in doing so, he has transgressed the standing orders. I raise a further point of order; that is, I ask you to direct him to withdraw.",109
367,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is nothing to withdraw. The Prime Minister has quoted. He is responding to a question that was put to him. The Prime Minister is in order.,109
368,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will finish on this last point. Marks said: You see, I can't concentrate at all on the propriety of Halden presenting a petition. I have got to get away from that. It is the very presenting of the petition which is the issue, as the former issue was whether Carmen Lawrence was involved in having it presented. Then Gyles said: On a matter of natural justice, if there is a matter which the commission are investigating, we'd need to know about it. Mr Reith-Now you are telling the commissioner what he is saying.",109
369,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There can be no justice at all before this kangaroo court in Western Australia. None. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order, this time on the last remarks made by the Prime Minister. He described the royal commission as a 'kangaroo court'.",109
370,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is. Mr Reith-Furthermore, he is in breach the standing orders, because he has implied that the royal commissioner, in the conduct this royal commission, is not meeting the about this today. standards which would otherwise be required of a royal commission. That is clearly in breach, and it is calculated to affect the manner in which the report of the royal commission will be received. That is exactly what Speaker Snedden said you could not do. That is exactly what Speaker Snedden said was in breach of the standing orders. Once investigating. again, you ought to rule it out of order and require him to withdraw.",110
371,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the whole context of it goes to the terms of reference of the royal and what it is that they are capable of investigating. The description of it applies to that, exactly.",110
372,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the royal commissioner in Western Australia is a deputy of the executive. He is Australia. not a judge. Would they have as much respect for the Premier himself? Should we here the sort of sub judice respect to the Premier? If not, why to his deputy? What absolute nonsense. This is not a judge of a court. This is simply a cat's paw of a Premier.",110
373,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have said in response to an earlier point of order in this place, the sort of terminology which is being used at the moment has been used in this place in the course of this debate. I think that in accordance, therefore, with the fact that no-one in the past two weeks has sought objection to that, the matter is now closed. The Prime Minister is concluding his answer.",110
374,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude on this point: what Mr Gyles has sought is what the commissioner is investigating, and the commissioner has made it quite clear that he does not know. Mr Costello-Where is the questioner? Mr Reith-He has gone.",110
375,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,110
376,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Therefore, Carmen Lawrence will not only be caught up with narrow and corruptly defined terms of reference by Premier Court, but the commissioner himself of does not even know, upon questioning by Gyles, what he is actually investigating. That of is why we had no questions in parliament Mr Costello-You did! You did!",110
377,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That's why they dropped back. They know, as Hendy Cowan and Barnett told them, this thing is going to come back and bite Court because the commissioner does not understand what he is actually I finish on this point: you have all these points of order by the opposition, the same people who earlier in the week virtually said directly that Carmen Lawrence was the cause commission of this person's death.",110
378,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Rubbish! Rubbish!,110
379,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then they have the hide to get up with unctuous points of order about royal commissions when they are simply an arm of the executive government of Western Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be be giving placed on the Notice Paper. NA Marks Royal Commission",110
380,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, given the rulings that you have made over the past couple of hours, will you please confirm that when the House resumes it will be in order for any member of the opposition to directly refer to the evidence given to the royal commission. Will it be in order for us to put a construction on the evidence of former cabinet ministers of Carmen Lawrence? Will it be in order",110
381,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Of course it will; you have been doing it for two weeks.,110
382,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! Those on my right!,110
383,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Will it be in order for us to infer from that evidence that Carmen Lawrence is not telling the truth? Will it be in order for us to cast aspersions on her behaviour when she was Premier of Western Australia? In other words, will it be in order for us to try each and every incident of this before this parliament, even while the royal commission is going on?",110
384,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,On a point of order,111
385,Unknown,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Opposition members interjecting,111
386,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! The Prime Minister is entitled to a point of order.,111
387,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, this issue is raised with you because something unjustly and corruptly done has come back to bite all of us-all of the parliaments of this country. That is why there is this foment in the parliament, because something has been done unjustly with manipulative terms of reference-just as something was done in the Senate in 1975. That is why Mr Howard has his problems.",111
388,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,That is a comment. You are a disgrace. Mrs Crosio-And you are a hypocrite!,111
389,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Order! The honourable member for Prospect will withdraw that comment. Mrs Crosio-I withdraw, Mr Speaker.",111
390,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The Leader of the Opposition asked me a series of questions. I give to him the following response, which I gave earlier: if public documents are there, relevant to this issue and, in the opinion of the chair, under what I understand to be the procedures of this place, would not prejudice or be likely to prejudice an outcome of an individual-in this case, the royal commissioner-then they will be able to be quoted. I call the Leader of the House for presentation of papers. Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, on a point of order",111

Constructing and restructuring Australia's public infrastructure With the passage of time, this report has been overtaken by events. Most of the eleven recommendations have, in one way or another, been addressed or superseded in the normal course of Government business over the intervening seven years; in particular, through measures announced in One Nation, changed Loan Council and Government Business Enterprise monitoring arrangements, and other ongoing policy development processes. Given how dated the report has become, the Government considers that a response is no longer necessary.

The Prime Minister also went on to claim that the Vietnamese foreign minister had put out a press release subsequently saying that I had not raised that matter. The fact is that neither of those claims by the Prime Minister are remotely true. It is just another example of the incredible dishonesty of the Prime Minister, who is constantly lying.",116

410,Mr DOWNER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I will withdraw it. The fact is that neither of these things are true. What happened was that in the course of a discussion with the Vietnamese foreign minister-I have here the notes taken of that meeting-I said to the Vietnamese foreign minister that in our relationship we needed to be open and discuss difficulties that existed between our two countries. I then went on to tell him that we on our side of politics-that is the irony of this-joined with the government in sharing concerns about a range of different human rights issues in Vietnam. I thought that it was a sign of the maturity of our relationship-which I think is becoming an increasingly mature relationship-that we can raise these difficulties with each other. Subsequent to that, I released a press release saying, amongst a whole lot of other things, that I had raised the issue of human rights. The Vietnamese foreign minister did not, as the Prime Minister claimed, put out a press saying I had not raised the issue of human rights. He said that we had not discussed the issue of human rights. That is true, because the Vietnamese foreign minister made no response to the remarks I made about human rights.

426,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah) (5.52 p.m.)Members opposite have been stating constantly over the last couple of weeks that there is an absolute obligation on people who receive petitions to present them in parliament. They have been saying this ad nauseam: 'Petitions must be presented to parliament'. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) said: One thing is clear: once a petition is in the hands of a member, he is bound to present it to the parliament, whether he agrees with it or not. That has generally been the rule in all parliaments, including this parliament. Mr Halden, in Western Australia, said: It would have been a contempt of the parliament for the premier to attempt to alter or stop me presenting it. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) recently received a petition, signed by 528 citizens of the electorate of Warringah, stating: To The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of Harbord draws the attention to the House of the situation where Telecom has installed a mobile base station beside the Harbord kindergarten and Baby Health Centre. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House asks the Minister for Communications to reverse the approval of this facility in the heart of Harbord Village on the grounds of the community's concern for the health and welfare of its children. That petition was not tabled last week; it was not tabled this week. Mr Les Scott-Have you got it? Mr ABBOTTI have a copy of it. The petition was not given to the Bills and Papers Office yesterday. Why is the Minister for Report Communications and the Arts not tabling this petition? Why is he acting, according to Mr Halden, in contempt of the parliament? Why isn'the doing what Labor people have been saying all week he is obliged to do? Why is he not tabling this petition? If the henchman of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was obliged to do it, why is the Minister for Communications and the Arts not obliged to do it? Why is he not obliged to table this petition signed by 528 of my constituents on a perfectly legitimate subject, when Carmen Lawrence's henchman was obliged to do a grubby, sordid act on behalf of one of the constituents? I demand the Minister for Communications and the Arts table this petition immediately. At the very least he should go to the Bills and Papers Office and hand it over immediately. If he is not prepared to do it, he should immediately give it to someone who will. The member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) is appalled by the government's rules on telecommunications. Why doesn't the minister for communications have the guts to give it to the member for Dunkley if he is not prepared to do it himself?",117
427,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,Why don't you do it? Mr Wakelin-You are the local member.,118
428,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I will table the petition gladly. The fact is that I have only the photocopy. It was prepared by the state member for Manly and quite foolishly, as it seems, given to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. As it stands, by the failure of the Minister for Communications and the Arts to present this petition, he is suppressing the views of 528 citizens of my electorate and exposing as a sham this government's alleged commitment to the tabling of petitionssomething they have been harping on about all week. If John Halden-that paragon of virtue, that pillar of parliamentary practice-is to be believed, the Minister for Communications and the Arts is guilty of contempt of parliament. He must go to the Bills and Papers Office immediately and present that petition. Campbelltown",118
429,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Let me address a few matters in my electorate. The best possible thing that can happen for Campbelltown is the rejuvenation of the public housing estates. Putting so much public housing together in the city of Campbelltown was never going to work. Last year I approached the New South Wales Department of Housing with a plan to improve the appearance of the estates which will eventually see up to 70 per cent of the housing sold to private owners to ensure a better mix of public and private housing. Over the next five to 10 years the whole nature of Claymore, Airds, Minto and Glenquarie in my electorate will change. Noone will be forced from their homes and some people will even have the chance to buy their own property. This can only be a very good thing for people living in these estates and indeed for everyone living in the city of Campbelltown. During the current local government election campaign, this project has been put at risk through a scare campaign orchestrated by two Campbelltown council candidates: Walid Baba and Michael EI Khoury. They have distributed literature, authorised by Mr Ali Kammoun of 1 Woollybutt Place, Macquarie Fields, which claims: As a resident of the Department of Housing estate you will probably know that your area is about to undergo a major facelift. What you have not been told is that, after your homes are transformed when the estate becomes an attractive place to live, 70 per cent of you will either be moved out or added to someone's private rent roll. This is the same Mr Kammoun who ran against me at the Werriwa by-election last year under the campaign directorship of Liverpool's Liberal councillors, Tony Pascale and Tom Glavich. This leaflet is designed to scare public housing residents into believing that their homes will be snatched from them. What they do not seem to understand is that many residents are unhappy living in these this areas and are keen to move to better housing and be closer to transport, closer to jobs and closer to other services. What these candidates do not seem to understand is that there are substantial benefits to residents who will be able to buy their own home. They have not taken into account that between 1986 and 1991 in Australia more than 50 per cent of people moved house. The normal turnover in these areas is very high. These candidates do not care about the repercussions that inaccurate comments have on the community. They have not bothered to find out the facts or what residents of these estates actually require. In truth, the transition from public to private can be and should be seamless. Over a fiveto lO-year period it can be managed with major benefits to Campbelltown and benefits for each of the residents of the public housing estates. It is a low moment in the politics of Campbelltown municipality when candidates for the local government election on 9 September are using a scare campaign to try to win votesto try to scare people, public housing tenants in my electorate, with the fear of eviction and with the fear of being thrown onto the street. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a campaign conducted by Mr Baba and Mr EI Khoury, authorised by Mr Kammoun, which is totally unworthy of Campbelltown's future. All candidates standing in the Campbelltown local government elections should support the plan being devised by the local member and the state minister, Craig Knowles, and indeed supported by me as the federal member for the city of Campbelltown. This is a very good plan. This is one of the best things that have been developed for the future of Campbelltown. I call on all candidates contesting the election on 9 September to support the plan. Local government has a very important role to play by virtue of improvements in the open space and the public land associated with these estates and the integration of public housing estates in Campbelltown with privately owned areas and indeed with the entire fabric of Campbelltown's community.

430,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 6 p.m., the debate is interrupted. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, on such a pleasant afternoon, I require the debate to be extended.",119
431,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The debate may continue until 6.10 p.m. Ministerial Reply,119
432,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (6.00 p.m.)-I did not hear all of what the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) had to say, but I rushed down so I could make a few comments about the efforts of the honourable member for Warringah, both in his own constituency and throughout the nation, in his great campaign against mobile telephone towers. I have to say that I think I have probably had more letters and questions on notice from the honourable member than from anyone else on this issue. He might think that that is therefore the badge of courage, that he is standing up for his constituents. But I have probably received even more letters, from people such as the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), demanding that Telecom put up more towers, and perhaps other National Party members, who are saying that Telecom does not do enough in putting up towers to extend the coverage ofMr Nehl-There are lots of holes in the net.",119
433,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Cowper interjects to say, 'There are many holes in the net,' and that is why the telephone companies argue that they should be spending more money to provide better coverage for mobile telephones across the country. But the point the honourable member seeks to make is that more people should be tabling petitions from people from other members' electorates. My attitude has always been that, if the constituents of another honourable member provide me with petitions, I forward the petitions to their local member to table. If the state member for Manly prepares and circulates a petition in his electorate against some issue, then I always encourage him, as I do other state members, to table the petition in his state house, as I think is the proper thing to do. What I have to warn honourable members about is that there are some people-not just members of parliament, but councillors-who are seeking to use this issue to get a bit of publicity in their own electorates. I have a sneaking suspicion that the honourable member for Warringah is one of the people who think that this is a nice issue that they can use to their own political advantage. Mr Leo MCLeay-The monk would not do that.",119
434,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"The Chief Government Whip might think that I am being a little bit too cynical in being suspicious of the motives of the member for Warringah, but let me just point out a few facts to the member for Warringah and others. First of all, the Liberal Party voted to exempt the telephone companies from the state planning laws. Your party voted to allow the carriers to put up the telephone tower and the radiators at Harbord. Your party voted to allow the carriers to be exempt from the state planning laws. This is the thing that you now claim is a great outrage, but it was your party-and my party, to be honest; government and opposition-that voted against the Democrat amendments not to give them the exemption. So I think it is the height of hypocrisy for the member for Warringah to come in here and whip up campaigns in his own electorate to suggest that he is against mobile telephone towers, when it was his party that voted to let the carriers be exempt from the state planning laws. In fact, it was the government that last year moved to tighten the requirements on the telephone companies. I put through a proposal, an amendment to the telecommunications national code, to say that, if there is no agreement between the local council and the telephone company, it gets referred to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency to be the arbitrator. Before my amendments, the carriers could do what they liked but, because of the changes we made last year, it now goes to CEPA as the umpire. Which was the party that threatened to block my attempts to tighten the procedures? The Liberal Party. Senator Alston was trailing his coat around the Senate, looking for support to block the Labor Party's measures and to tighten the environmental rules on the telephone companies. Again, it is the height of hypocrisy for the member for Warringah to come into this House and say that he has tried to stop the telephone companies putting up towers, when it was his party that was looking for support in the Senate to try to stop the government from tightening the requirements on the telephone companies. I simply make the point that there are some people, like me, who think the rules should be tightened. Some people suggest that we should abolish the exemption that the carriers now have-and the member for Warringah says that he might be sympathetic to that point of view. What you do not understand is that some of the state environmental planning laws are weaker than the telecommunications national code. The telecommunications national code is stronger than some of the state planning laws. That is why I have asked Austel, in cooperation with CEPA, to conduct a review into this issue. But the point I make is simply this: yes, there are some people who do not like a mobile telephone tower to be constructed near their home. Everyone likes to protect the value of their property. A lot of people think that nothing should ever be built in their own backyard. But if the honourable member for Warringah is telling me that he thinks no telephone tower should be built anywhere in Australia when any of the local residents are opposed to it-which is the case in his electoratethen what does he tell the members of the National Party who send letters to me and come in here and argue that there should be more towers built? You are a hypocrite. (Time ""expired)",119
435,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The minister will withdraw that last comment.,120
436,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,I withdraw.,120
437,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"There being no minister rising, the minister may have an extension of five minutes, if he so desires.",120
438,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. In conclusion, I simply make the point that, under the standing orders, there is a fair opportunity for a minister to respond to outrageous statements that are made during the adjournment, and I will take every opportunity to exercise my right of reply. The point I would make to the honourable member for Warringah is: if you are serious about trying to make sure that people do get a fair deal in looking at proposals to put up new towers, why are you not trying to work with us as part of the Austel review? Why are you not trying to sit down with us, in a commons""ense way, and see if we can work out procedures that give local communities a chance to have their say? I can tell you that the procedures that now apply are tougher on the telephone companies-and they are tougher on the telephone companies now because my department and this government tightened the rules last July. They are much tighter than the rules that your party agreed to in the Senate when the Telecommunications Act was passed some time ago. The reason they are tighter is that we thought it was important that, if councils could not reach agreement with the telephone companies, that would mean there should be an independent arbitrator-and what fairer arbitrator could you have on environmental issues than the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency? And they are the rules that apply now. I suspect from the quizzical look on the face of the honourable member for Warringah that he never understood that. Mr Leo MCLeay-He cannot understand anything.",120
439,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"He might not understand it, as the Chief Government Whip interjects. But I make the point: honourable members who want to contribute to this debate should try hard to learn what the rules are. It is importnot ant that, if we are concerned about what the environmental rules are for the erection of telephone towers, people put forward submissions to Austel in the review it is now conducting. I have to tell honourable members that, in their negotiations with the Municipal tion of Victoria, all three carriers have been prepared, I think, to make some concessions to ensure that there is proper community consultation and an opportunity for contribution by the community. In fact, I am currently writing to all local councils in Australia for the second time to advise them of their rights and responsibilities to raise issues with Austel, to have issues referred to CEPA as the umpire. But I also have to tell honourable members that there will be occasions when local communities do not want towers built. It is not unusual to have people who live closest to a proposed mobile telephone tower to be against the tower's erection. There are other communities which ask that the tower perhaps be moved to a less obvious location, or that the tower be adjusted in some way so it is less obvious from a visual standpoint. In most cases, councils and telephone companies can reach agreement. But I do get a little bit angry when local councillors seek to use this as an election issue in the lead-up to local council elections and when members of parliament, federal or state, seek to inflame fear and misunderstanding in the community about these issues. What we have to say is, if this is a such a big issue, if the member for Warringah thinks that no mobile towers should be built anywhere where the local communities are opposed to it, what that is saying is that there will be no more mobile towers. I simply ask the honourable member for Warringah: does he have a mobile phone? No answer. So we can simply conclude from that that perhaps the honourable member for Warringah is quite happy to use a mobile phone. If he really wants to prove to us that he is against this technology because he has concerns about the impact it might have on health or the environment, then why does he make the supreme sacrifice and hand his taxpayer funded mobile telephone back into the parliamentary offices? If he does have an objection in principle to these devices, I give him the challenge: hand your mobile telephone back in, prove to us that you will get by with fixed wire telephony rather than using mobile telephones, and make that contribution Associa- to your electorate.",121
