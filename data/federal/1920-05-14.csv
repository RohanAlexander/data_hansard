20,Mr RILEY,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"South Sydney) [11.10]. '-Like most other honourable members, I desire the discovery of oil in this country. We have done our best to find oil in Papua and in other parts of the Commonwealth, and I still 'have great hopes of success; but, until that success has been obtained, we shall be in the clutches of those who at present supply this community with oil, that is, unless we can make some arrangement which may free us from them. At the present time, the Vacuum Oil Company, and other oil companies, have a complete monopoly of this market. They could, if they liked, stop our supplies; and they could also increase the price of oil. We are entirely dependent upon them. The Government, how- ever, have invited the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to erect refineries here for the treatment of the crude oil which they will import. Personally, I do not object to this arrangement. In my opinion, to establish refineries here is a step in the right direction, no matter by whom taken. I would, of course, prefer to see the refineries erected by the Government, but the agreement that we are discussing creates a partnership between the Commonwealth and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company; and, ultimately, if we desire to take over these refineries, we shall be able to do so. As we have not yet found oil in this country, crude oil must be imported 1911 . . for treatment. I should like to know 1913 why provision is being made for the re1914 fining of only 200,000 tons of crude oil 1916 . . per annum, seeing that the Common1917 wealth needs nearly double that quantity. Is the company prepared to eTect reI fineries which eventually will be capable of wholly supplying our needs ? If it or the Government will do that, I shall be very pleased. The objection has been raised that, by making this agreement, we are playing into the hands of a monopoly. But, even if that be so, the monopoly will not be so dangerous as that which at present exists. We are really entering into a partnership with the British Government and the Anglo-PeTsian Oil Company, and are at worse choosing the lesser of two evils. Having read the evidence given by officials of the Vacuum Oil Company before Boards of Inquiry and the Inter-State Commission, to justify applications for permission to increase the price of oil, I am astonished that some of these men are not now behind the bars of a gaol. According to Judge Edmunds, of New South Wales, they have made statements which are untrue, and have falsified their books. On the last occasion when the Vacuum Oil Company applied for permission to make an increase in the price of kerosene, the Judge said he would not hear the case. His mind was made up that the Vacuum Oil Company had so misled the Court, and so falsified its books, that he would not hear the case at all. He was prejudiced against the concern. When Judge Rolin was appointed to inquire into the matter of kerosene suprjly, he made certain very strong remarks. It is interesting to know how this company has extended its operations and interests. The report of the Inter-State Commission dealing with kerosene, benzine, oils, &c, contains highly entertaining statistics. The Vacuum Oil Company, by the way, has seven-eighths of its interests in America, while only one share is held in Australia. I invite honourable members' to study these figures:Period..

Reserves. made. £ £ £ £ 600,000 317,856 1912 .. 600,000 203,254 1,701,356 301,140 .. 600,000 367,470 2,074,016 263,400 1915 .. 600,000 800,000 471,646 603,626 2,209,839 2,274,360 274,020 402,660 800,000 806,208 2,883,184 679,620 . . 1,600,000 1,270,588 3,842,519 488,619 t will be noted that the capital of the company in 1915 had reached £800,000 - whic h was purely a book entry-and that in 1917 the paid-up capital amounted to £1,600,000. According to the remarks of the Judge that, also, was a book entry. The figures above reveal at a glance the enormous profits made by the ""Vacuum Oil Company within a very brief period. While the public was called upon to pay prices which were soaring rapidly higher and higher, this company was piling up enormous returns. It had made its own arrangements, of course, and there was no competition. Since August, 1914, the price of kerosene has risen from 6s. l i d . to 14s. 6d. per case-a n increase of more than 100 per cent. The price of benzine since that same year has risen from 13s. 4d. to 23s. 8d. per case-a n increase representing more than 77 per cent. We are consumers of oil in this country to the extent of about £4,000,000 per annum. Wc can realise what our position will shortly become if we are compelled to continue to pay the increased rates demanded by the monopoly. The. Government are endeavouring to bring into the Australian market another competitor. The Vacuum Oil Company has taken good care to pass every risk on to the consumer . During 1915 and 1916, on a capital and reserves averaging £1,500,000, the company made a net profit of £981,000. Honourable members will be impressed with these particularsPeriod.

While we have been paying enormously high prices for our oil modities, the same, precisely, have been sold in the United States of America considerably less. Without the shadow doubt, we are in the hands of a complete monopoly, and we are justified in trying to secure resources of our own. In entering into th s contract with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, we are to have a controlling number of shares. Activities will not be carried on in some far part of the world, but within our own borders. We shall have our own representatives upon the directorship, and we shall know everything that is taking place. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) proposes an amendment to insure that the Government shall insist that so many thousand pounds per annum shall be expended in developing our own resources, with the object of securing raw crude oil from some part or another of Australia. I have had the pleasure of visiting STew Guinea for about six weeks, and from what I saw and learned, I should say that there are good prospects of commercial oil being discovered there. 1 It does not matter how much money the Government may spend in trying to discover and develop oil prospects nowadays there appears to be some influence at work to militate against success. Whether it is purely fortuitous, or whether it may bedue to the influence of the Vacuum Oil'. Company, orsome other company, with' the object of stifling competition, I do not know; but there is certainly some malign influence at work to prevent this country from investigating and develop-' ing its' own resources. I hail with pleasure, therefore, the establishment of a company, backed by the British and Com- 1 Profit per monwealth Governments, and having its Per Case. expert knowledge and appliances availableTurnover. in our interests.

But when we have reached the stage of producing our own oil requirements-as 3/9.67d. I hope we shall do ere long-w e shall bo in the position of partners in the refining process; and it will then be open for Parliament to take over the whole activity, so desired, and to run it entirely in the cent. The interests of the people. I trust that a Select Committee will be to make exhaustive investigation. If refineries are to be erected, the commost suitable sites should be chosencentres where there is abundance of coal at and adequate shipping facilities, and of which will not be unreasonably far from the sources of oil supply. The refineries should be erected in various localities rather than that the whole work should be concentrated in one spot. They should not necessarily be established either in Melbourne or in Sydney, if the inquiries of the Select Committee can show that there are more suitable sites in other of the Commonwealth. What is the outcome of the bonus which the Commonwealth pays for the production of crude oil? When the Act came into force, we were hopeful that it would have the effect of relieving the pressure in the matter of Australia's oil requirements. To-day, oil is being produced from shale; but what good is that to the Commonwealth ?",21
21,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,What will be the position of the shale oil industry under this agreement?,23
22,Mr RILEY,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"That is one question which might well be considered by a Select Committee. We are not refining into kerosene the crude oil upon which we pay a bonus today; we are not securing any of its by-products. Messrs. John Fell and Company are supplying their crude product to the North Sydney and Sydney Gasworks, and to the Auckland and Christchurch Gasworks. The Commonwealth is paying a bonus to John Fell and Company, but the firm is selling its product to gas companies which could well afford to buy coal for the production of their gas. Meanwhile, despite the bonus, we are neglecting to develop our oil resources.",23
23,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,The matter of the oil bonus was very similar to the present position respecting this agreement: we do not know too much about it.,23
24,Mr RILEY,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"We know that our bonus is not bavins the effect of developing the Australian oil industry. Before we enter into an agreement to bind the Commonwealth over for fifteen years, and involve ourselves in the outlay of a large sum of money, there should be the fullest possible inquiry. I welcome the agreement itself, and I welcome the prospect of the erection of refineries. I trust, however, that the Government will not object to the appointment of a Select Committee, so that the agreement may be made most acceptable to the people of Australia.",23
25,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Wilmot) [11.26] The agreement has been very carefully considered by the Government, and, although I am not prepared to accept it precisely as it stands, I do not think there is any necessity for the appointment of a Select Committee. Nobody, who has carefully read the agreement can say that it contains anything to suggest that the parts Anglo-Persian Oil Company is endeavouring to trick the Commonwealth Government. I consider that the agreement requires a little tightening up at some points. Rather more definition and clarity are desirable in certain respects; for example, in the matter of insuring that the company shall draw its supplies, if and when available, from Papua, instead of seeking to carry on refining activities with crude oil imported from other parts of the world. In regard to capital, the agreement itself provides that an increase may be made at any time, and that the Commonwealth authority, no matter what changes may take place, shall still retain the balance of interest in the whole concern. I do not think a Select Committee is required to ascertain exactly what capital the business should begin with. In discussing the measure in Committee, the Prime Minister, no doubt, will be able to present such information upon that head as should satisfy honourable members; and necessary amendments can, of course, be made. It must be remembered, however, that whatever amendments may be decided upon must be submitted to the Anglo-Persian Company, seeing that it is a partner with the Commonwealth. I do not think there is any reason to suggest mala fides on the part of the company, I am satisfied that it will try to meet lis upon all points. I am very glad that this is an all-British agreement. It is time that the Empire became, in respect of one or two essentials, a little more self-supporting. In Australia, for instance, our iron resources need to be developed. The Government should do what they can to encourage the founding of an iron industry in Australia. The war has taught us that oil is a basic requirement, and we should do the best we can to obtain a proper oil supply within the Commonwealth. I hope that, before long, Australia will be supplying this company with oil, and that we shall have it refined here. Some - people seem to think that the Government have practically handed over to this company the oil business of the Commonwealth. It is suggested that, under this agreement, we shall be practically in the grip of the company, which will be placed in the position of a monopoly. I cannot prophesy what may be the consequences of the agreement, but there is certainly nothing in it to suggest that it will lead to the establishment of a monopoly. It is open to any other company to come along to the Commonwealth with an oil proposition.",23
26,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Not under this Bill.,24
27,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,The best expert in Australia is opposed to the view of the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Atkinson).,24
28,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"I care not what experts may say. I have read the agreement, and am placing my own interpretation, upon it. There is nothing in it to prevem the Government .from helping any other company in Australia that has an oil proposition to submit. If I thought that by ratifying this agreement we should found a monopoly-if I the""ught we should be putting ourselves in fetters, and handing ourselves over body and soul to a monopoly - I would' oppose the scheme.",24
29,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,We shall kill the oil industry of Australia.,24
30,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,At the present time we have no Australian industry in oil.,24
31,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,We hope to have.,24
32,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The Bill will stimulate the development of oil production here. I fail to see why we should prevent any one from doing the very bestto produce oil and refine it in the Commonwealth. So far as I can see, there is nothing in the agreement that would have that effect. There is in the Bill a clause designed to protect the company from dumping. To that I take no exception. Under it, if the Standard Oil Company, or any other concern, enters into unfaii competition with this company, the Government will come to the assistance of the local industry by means of the Customs or other Government agencies that it may need to employ. There is nothing wrong about that. Surely this Parliament will see that the Government protect the people in the matter of the price at which the oil shall be sold. . Mr CoirsiDrNE - Why stop at oil in that respect?",24
33,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"This Bill deals only with oil, and when I address the House I try to confine my remarks to the matter before the Chair. I see no danger in the provisions of the Bill relating to dumping. If this company helps to found the oil industry of Australia, and enables us to supply our own requirements, it will do good service. We must have some source of supply upon which we'may rely, especially in time of war. Apart from the requirements of the Navy, the industrial world is daily increasing its demands for fuel and lubricating oils. Without this company we cannot at present supply our own wants. Even now we are in the hands of monopolies. The companies which supply ua from abroad can make any arrangement they please between themselves. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr. Biley) has quoted figures showing that in the United States of America petrol, benzine, and other oils have been very much cheaper than in Australia. The prices here are steadily rising, and there seems to be no limit to the price that kerosene may reach. This agreement is of special interest to me, and I have scanned it carefully to see that it leaves the way open to other companies in Australia to secure governmental assistance if they can show that they are able to supply oils at cheaper rates. I am not at all satisfied with the way in which the Navy Department has been treating a Tasmanian oil company. There is in my own electorate a deposit of shale which, according to excellent authority, will produce 40 gallons of oil to the ton. The oil has been proved to be very strong and pure, and suitable for naval purposes. In Papua, we have found a very valuable oil, but it is not suitable for naval purposes. We have been importing oil for the Navy, and have been paying for it from £6 to £7 per ton. The latest figures supplied to me by the Navy Department show that it is now landing oil in Melbourne, in its own oil-tank steamer, at £5 Os. 5d. per ton. I dare say that, if thesefigureswere carefully analyzed, it would be found that the cost is considerably more. Doubtless, no allowance is made for interest on the money invested in the oiltank steamer and for other incidental expenses, which should be included in a proper business calculation. The company which owns the Tasmanian shale deposits, to which I have referred, has offered the Government a contract for the supply of oil at £4 103. per ton. The Commonwealth Government did, ,on one occasion, agree with the State Government of Tasmania to accept 8,000 tons of this oil at £3 15s. per ton, but it has not been able to secure a renewal of that agreement even at £4 10s. per ton. Certain objections have been raised by the Navy Department. The company is prepared to try to meet them, and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) told the Naval Board, in my presence, to prepare a contract and send it to the company in Tasmania, with the object of endeavouring to come to terms. The Naval Board, however, has done nothing. It continues to play with the company and its offer. The deposit of shale is a very large one, and we should do our best to encourage those who wish to develop it. The company are not asking for money. They say that if the Government would enter into a contract with them for the supply of oil, they would be able at once to raise sufficient capital to develop the industry.",24
34,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"When Mr Jensen was Minister for Trade and Customs, did he not make the Tasmanian company an offer? Hr. ATKINSON - Whil e he was Minister, the Tasmania^ Government, which, would have taken over the concern but for the action of the Upper House in rejecting the proposal, had a contract with the Commonwealth to supply 8,000 tons of oil at a certain price. The company, as I have said, is now asking the Government to enter into another contract. It must have some protection. Is it reasonable that it should be expected to go on the market and ask for more capital when, as soon as it started work, it would be open to the Standard Oil Company, or other foreign corporations, to enter into competition with it? The Standard Oil Company could afford to give oil away here for a year or two in order to defeat the local industry. By slightly increasing its prices in other countries it would not be out of pocket. Even if it were, it would not mind as long as it succeeded in strangling our industry. If we do mot come to the assistance of a local industry such as this, we shall fail in our duty.",25
35,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,This Bill will not help the Tasmanian venture.,25
36,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,No ; but I see no danger in this Bill as long as the Government will do what they ought to do with regard to the Tasmanian company.,25
37,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,The Commonwealth Government is its only customer.,25
38,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,It merely asks the Government to enter into a contract with it for the supply of oil.,25
39,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,That is practically what every one wants. No one asks for more.,25
40,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Not at all. Many companies approach the Government with requests for monetary-assistance for their ventures. We have reached a stage in our history when, in order to develop Australian, industries, and so to improve our financial position, we must be prepared to take business risks. While it is our duty to see that the public funds ""are not foolishly expended, we must at the same time display business enterprise, since we need fresh sources of revenue to balance our accounts. Unless we develop the latent resources of Australia,we shall not balance the ledger. We have great possibilities of development-w e have tremendous resources as yet un-. touched-and the war has piled up on us a war debt which, for a population of 5,000,000 to confront, is almost appalling. But, if twenty-five years hence we could show that we had developed Australia's national assets to the extent of £1,000,000,000, our balance-sheet would look very well. The history of industrial expansion in the United . States of America shows that such development is by no means impossible. A coumitry is different from an individual. When an individual dies, his' assets are distributed in accordance with the terms of his will. A country, however, goes on for all time developing its assets, and so adding to the general wealth of the community. The development of our latent resources is our great hope. Our industries must be expanded if the country is to carry a larger population and meet its heavy financial obligations. I shall support the Bill, provided that satisfactory amendments are made in Committee. I believe that the Govern- merit will 'be prepared to accept any sonable amendment of the agreement, and I do not think there will be any culty in inducing the other parties to the agreement to accept such amend-ments made by us. I regret that the Minister for the Navy is not now present, ' because I wish to impress upon him the necessity of giving a little more encouragement to the Tasmanian company of which I have spoken. If it were ask' ing for monetary assistance, I should appreciate some shymess on the part of the Government or the Naval Board. As it is, it merely asks the Commonwealth to enter into a contract with it for the supply of oil. It is said that if such a contract were entered into it would be able, within an hour, to raise in Melbourne the necessary capital for the development of its shale deposits. Even if this agreement be adopted the refinery will not be in operation for about two years. I recollect the management of this Tasmanian shale company saying 'that if the Commonwealth would give a satisfactory contract the company could raise £150,000 immediately, and could be supplying fuel oil to the Navy within twelve months.",25
41,Mr GIBSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Surely the present prices of oil are sufficient inducement to any company to start work at once. ' Mr ATKINSON - That would be true under ordinary conditions. But if anybody asked the honourable member to take shares in an oil venture in Australia he would immediately ask what protection the venture would bave against the competition of the Standard Oil Company and other big trusts. And if he were told that there was no such protection he would withhold his capital. That is the position of this Tasmanian company, and indeed of every Australian oil venture at the present time. Unless the Government give assistance in the manner I have suggested - they will not be able to found the oil industry in Australia in the face of the terrible competition of big overseas trusts. The Government would take no - monetary risk in giving the contract that is asked for; if the company does not supply oil it will receive no money. If the Government found that by any such contract they were tieing their - hands in regard to the obtaining of oil reasupplies for the Navy they could cancel the contract if at the end of six months diffiit appeared that the company could not fulfil its part of the bargain. The Government have not 'done their duty to this company; they have not made sufficient effort to foster the oil industry in Australia. I hope that the Government will not regard this agreement as representing all that they need to do to foster our oil industry. The agreement is a very good arrangement so far as it goes. But the Government must keep clearly in mind that other people in Australia have oil propositions that are quite worthy of the closest investigation by the Commonwealth.",26
42,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Franklin) [11.49]. - We are dealing with an exceedingly important question. A scientist said recently, "" We are now passing through : the coal and steel age. The immediate future will be the era of oil and cement."" We know what oil means to Australia, because, as has been pointed out by other honourable members, this country has suffered seriously through the operations of a monopoly which, second only to the shipping trust, is the greatest monopoly ih existence. I intend to vote to refer this Bill to a Select Committee, because the one thing needed in dealing with this agreement is expert evidence.  will get his expert evidence from the Standard Oil Company and the Vacuum Oil Company.",26
43,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The expert evidence I require is not as to the oil, but as to the constitution of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and the extent to which Australia is being pledged under this agreement. An interjection made by the Prime Minister when the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) was speaking, shows the serious necessity for further consideration of this agreement. The Prime Minister said that because under this agreement the Commonwealth will hold a majority of the shares it will therefore have the controlling influence. The agreement itself deprives the Commonwealth of that control for the whole period of its operation, because one paragraph readsTliat of the total number of directors of the Refinery Company (including the managing director; if he has a vote), three-sevenths in number shall be nominated by and represent the Commonwealth, and four-sevenths shall be nominated by and represent the company. Therefore, the Prime Minister's interjection placed the position in a misleading light. As four-sevenths of the directors will be nominated by the company, the company will have the predominating influence.  will always retain the right of veto.",26
44,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"That has nothing at all to do with the point I am now making. This matter must be considered in the light of the agreement itself. If we agree to give the company predominating control it will be impossible to alter or escape from that agreement. absurd for the Minister to interject that we can veto the conditions of our agreement. What is the position in regard to Papua? We have known for some years that oil deposits exist in Papua, especially in German New Guinea. About eighteen months ago I introduced to the Minister 'a gentleman who had just returned from New Guinea, and who offered to select an area of land, float a company, and work theoil deposits, paying the Government any fair and reasonable royalty that they might care' to impose. was rejected on the ground that the Government intended to retain for themselves the whole of the oil-bearing lands of New Guinea. Then an agreement was entered into between the British and Australian Governments that each should contribute £50,000 towards the cost of prospecting for of l there. ing operations were placed in the hands of the Anglo-Persian O i l Company, but so far the reports to date show that company has not discovered any payable deposits.",27
45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,The company only just commenced operations.,27
46,Mr JH CATTS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,They have been on the job for six months.  it for two weeks. Mr MCWILLIAMS' - How money has the Commonwealth spent under that agreement with the Imperial Government? ,27
47,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The company which has been appointed to prospect for oil in New Guinea is the company with which the Commonwealth is now proposing to enter into a second agreement. I placed the agreement which is contained in this Bill before a Melbourne man, who has, perhaps, as wide a knowledge of company flotation as has any m,an in Victoria, and he told me that he is by no means certain that under this arrangeCommonwealth ment the company will not dominate the whole of the oil production of the Commonwealth; certainly it will dominate the whole of the oil production in New Guinea.  company start there tomorrow.",27
48,Mr JAMES PAOE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,But it could not It is bring of l to Australia to be refined.,27
49,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"That is the point. If any other company found o i l in Papua, it would be precluded by this agreement from bringing the oil to Australia to be refined.",27
50,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Of course it could send the oil to Australia.,27
51,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,The dumping clause of the agreement would prevent that.,27
52,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Dumpin g against ourselves ? That offer Mr MCWILLIAMS - If there is one article in respect of which we could stand a little dumping at the present time, it is oil. When discussing the Tarif f on one occasion, I said that I had never been able to discover that any dumping had taken place in this country; certainly, no evidence of it has ever been adduced. The prospect- However, having regard to the honest difference of opinion in this House, and between experts to whom I have referred the matter-me n who have spent all their lives in the promoting and formation of companies-and bearing in mind the greatness of the issue at stake, we should has not pass a Bill of this character u n t i l we thoroughly understand it .",27
53,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The statements the honourable member has made are rub-, bish, no matter who is his authority.",27
54,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The r e is such a much difference of opinion regarding the agreement, that I believe it would have a quicker passage through Parliament if we had a brief reference to a Select Committee, which in a few days could take expert evidence, than it will have without such a reference, and if the House is called upon to consider the amendments which I hope will be moved to safeguard our interests in several respects.",27
55,Mr CORSER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,'What sort of expert evidence does the honourable member desire to get?,28
56,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"I desire to have the agreement interpreted by business men. This House has passed several agreements, and our experience in connection with them has been decidedly unfortunate. Practically all the commercial agreements which were drawn by the Crown Law officers have let the Commonwealth down badly when they have been put to the test. The shipping agreement is a case in point. I am not prepared to take the responsibility of passing ameasure which may involve tens of millions of pounds until I know more about it. I am not hostile to the B i welcome it.",28
57,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Why discuss ten3 of millions of pounds? The Bill involves only half-a-million pounds.,28
58,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The Commonwealth is only to find £500,000 .in connection with this agreement, but how many millions of pounds may be represented by oil discoveries, which will be affected by the agreement?",28
59,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Nothin g can done without the authority of Parliament.  orable member move yesterday to refer to a Select Committee the question of increasing honourable members' salaries?,28
60,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"When the Bil l to increase the salaries of members comes before this House, I shall have something to say on that matter.",28

64,Mr SPEAKER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL, Order ! The honourable member for Franklin is (not in order in discussing that matter on this question.,28
65,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,The interjection made by the Minister for Home and  to the standard of ' his intelligence. - I shall support the proposal to refer the Bill to a Select Committee. If a press report is correct an interjection made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) in reply to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) shows distinctly that the right honourable gentleman does not understand the power given to this company. He said that because the Commonwealth had a predominance in voting power it controlled the directors of the company.,28
66,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,No . The Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth had a controlling number of shareholders. Mr MoWILLIAMS - What does that mean?,28
67,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,It . means a good deal when a question of policy arises.,28
68,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,It means nothl l ; I ing when by this agreement we allow the Anglo-Persian Oil Company four directors to our three. The only power the shareholders will have is in electing their own proportion of directors. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company elects its four and we elect our three.,28
69,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,That is only for the commercial running of the company.,28
70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,If the commercial aspect is taken out of it there is be nothing left in the agreement.,28
71,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Who could handle the distribution and sales as well as the company could?,28
72,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"That is an entirely different aspect of the question. Let us face the matter clearly. It is proposed to hand over to the Anglo Persian Oil Company the control of the directorate. That is to say, we hand over the whole control of the refinery company-the commercial aspect, the only thing that matters one iota to Australia.",28
73,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,What does the honourable member mean by the commercial aspect ?,28
74,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"What the com. pany will get out of it, and what the Commonwealth will get out of it.",28
75,Sir JOSEPJI COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Does the honourable member contend that the Commonwealth are handing over that aspect to the company?,28
76,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Yes . We are handing over to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company the sole control of all commercial arrangements, and allowing 2122 Oil Agreement them 10 per cent, for doing so. I claim ' that the Government do not understand the agreement.",28
77,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Does ' able member contend that the directorate will control the price of o i l in Australia ?,29
78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"No ; but it will control the sale of all oils outside Australia, and if it suits the Anglo-Persian O i l Company it w i ll not seek to discover oil in Papua.",29
79,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"That fetched. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - If my information is correct, namely, that the control of this refinery company is to be exercised by Lord Inchcape, who has been appointed as representative of the British Government, I would point out that he is already the chairman of the big shipping Combine which is crushing the life out of Australia.",29
80,Mr CORSER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"He will have no in terest in this except as a director. . Mr MCWILLIAMS - Of course, he is only one director of a majority.  British representatives. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - I do not care whom he represents, but it makes me cautious when I see that Lord Inchcape, the chairniaji of the biggest shipping - Combine the world has ever seen, which is charging monstrous freights all .the world, is one of the four men who will command this industry.",29

83,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"My information ister indicates. is that practically the whole of the ships running to Australia today, except those owned by the Commonwealth, are more fore now. or less under the control of the Inchcape Shipping Combine. It is the duty of every honourable ber to place his views before the House on a question such as this. The honorwhat able member for Wilmo t (Mr Atkinson) cepted. has already pointed out that, for nearly refusing this contract. three years, the Latrobe Shale Company have been seeking a. contract to supply the Naval Board with o i l at £4 10s. ton.",29

85,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Yes , they have. Mr MaWILLIAMS- I maintain that ihe honourable member for Wilmot the honor- is correct, and that the price asked was £4 10s. per ton. I have spoken to a gentleman who came over to Melbourne as one of a deputation which the honourable member .for Wilmo t introduced to the Naval Board when the Minister for the Navy was absent in London.",29
86,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"But they have seen me since then, and I have not heard is too far- of any such price being asked.",29
87,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,They submitted an offer at £4 10s. per ton.,29
88,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"They did not. , Mr ATKINSON - I was there when they made the offer. They are still prepared to submit it .",29
89,Mr SPEAKER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Order !,29
90,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The s e interjections bear out what I am saying, that the House has not the information it ought to have. Here was a company prepared to enter into a contract with the Naval Board to supply o i l at £4 10s. per ton, at a time when the Navy were payis one of the ing a very much higher price. They asked for no additional financial assistance. If a contract was available they were prepared to start a company, get to work, and provide Australia with oil.",29
91,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The deputation over which interviewed me stipulated for a price of £ 6 15s. per tori, plus some other things.",29

The'Select Committee which has been inquiring into the sea carriage of goods, a much wider subject, has been able to submit a report within four weeks of its appointment. The progress of the measure will be expedited, and be made easier by referring it to a Select Committee. With the guidance of the report of such a Committee, honourable members would be in an infinitely better position to give consideration to the agreement, which I candidlv admit I do not understand. When I went across to Tasmania I read it on the boat, and I read it over and over again while I was away. I also referred it to men to whose opinion I defer, but I cannot tell now what will be the position of the company in Tegard to discoveries of oil made by other persons in Australia. That is a point which ought to be cleared up. For the reasons I have advanced I shall vote to refer the Bill to a Select Committee, and I would limit the time the Committee would have for bringing up its report to three weeks. If we adopt this method of dealing with the Bill we shall make better progress than if honourable members are compelled to go outside to seek for information, and iS we are obliged to examine the agreement clause by clause, as we shall be compelled to do, if the Government do not agree to the appointment of a Select Committee.",29
96,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Maranoa) [12.12]. - The greater portion of my constituents are large consumers of kerosene and petrol. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) was right in saying that we have reached a new era by reason of the extended use of oil and petrol. I want to be sure that the people of Australia get, not cheap oil, but oil at a fair price, while the people who control the commodity also get a fair profit. Many years ago we were anxious to establish the oil industry in Austricts tralia. I can speak feelingly .on point, because the prospects of doing looked so fair at one time that I thought I would die a millionaire. The honourable of Australia. member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) persuaded me, in a frail moment of mine, to purchase shares in a company formed for the purpose of boring for oil at Boma, in Queensland, and everything in the garden was lovely. At one time, the Tariff was under consideration, a director of the Standard Oil Company, who was watching our proceedings on half of his corporation, raised my hopes very much indeed by telling me that if had only one-tenth of one share in the company at Boma, and its bore proved a success, which he doubted very much, I would die a very rich man indeed. However, our hopes were not consummated. After spending a lot of money the company had to go into liquidation, and foi my shares in it I was paid 12s.",30
97,Mr MCWILXIAMS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,You were lucky to get :that!,30
98,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"I was, but I cannot say I Tegret spending the money, though I do not think we, as a company, got a square deal. By some unforeseen circumstances, at a time when the hopes of everybody concerned were raised very high, the gas took fire, and the heat was so great as to melt some of the casings. After several weeks of blazing, the fire was put out with a bonnet, and we resumed boring, only to meet with a serious accident when we had gone down a little further. The whole of the tools were left in the ground, and, after spending the balance of our money in trying to get them out, the company went "" bung."" The Queensland Government-that is, the Denham Government-cam e to our assistance, and, satisfied that oil was there, they took the enterprise over and made it a State monopoly. The Government proceeded with the sinking, and are sinking yet, but have had the same ill-sue: cess that we experienced. Drillers had to be brought from America; and it is most peculiar that trouble started when they got down to where the gas was to be tapped, at 3,500 feet. I may say that 3,500 feet is not the deepest bore in Queensland, for there are water-bores much deeper, sunk by private enterprise. I am satisfied that there are many disin Queensland, where there is seepthe age, and where oil will be found in the so near future. My anxiety is for the people of Queensland and for the people We are told that this agreement will not interfere with the oil or shale deposits of Australia. I am not an expert, and I do not pTofess to be one, but I have common sense, and when I see a sheep I know that it grows wool on its when back. There are some deposits of kerosene oil in the Moreton electorate, quite near to Brisbane; there must be oil there, befor it is coming out of the ground, and practically asking us to dig for it. I have I in my hand a telegram from a shale oil company which is doing business in Queensland, the company, I believe, receiving the bonus for the production of oil. This telegram was sent to the honourable member for MacquaTie (Mr . Nicholls), but as that gentleman is unavoidably absent, I intend to make use of it for the benefit of honourable members, who may take it for what it is worth. The telegram sounds a note of suspicion, and that is why I am anxious for a .Select Committee. We have been told that the only expert evidence obtainable is from the Standard O i l Company or the Vacuum O i l Company, but if that be so, the evidence will be very tainted indeed.",30
99,Mr MATHEWS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Why should we not have that evidence?,31
100,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"On e reason for my suspicion is that these companies are the biggest monopoly in the world, and if it was thought we were going to create a competitor, we would not get the in formation we desire-it would be "" giving the show away.""",31
101,Mr JH CATTS,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"According to speech of the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), this Anglo-Persian Oomspany may "" be in "" with those two companies.",31
102,Mr JAMESPAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,I did not so interpret the speech of the Prime M in ister.,31
103,Sir JOSEPH COOK,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,This Anglo-Persian Company was formed to fight the others.,31
104,Mr JAMESPAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"I do not care whether the Anglo-Persian Company is part and parcel of the great monopoly, because, sooner or later, we shall have to fight all monopolies, and we ought to be very careful if there is danger of our creating another. The appointment of a Select Committee could surely do no harm, if it did no good. The telegram to which I refer is from Messrs. John Eell and Company, of Sydney. If men are engaged in an - industry, and have expended all their money and energy in developing it , they naturally become anxious when a great company like this is given a practical monopoly, although we are told by the Minister for the Navy (- Sir Joseph Cook) that it is not a monopoly. It is a fact, however, that they are the only people in Australia who would have a refinery, for no one else is to be allowed to erect one. If crude oil is discovered on any of the Pacific Islands or in Papua outside the ramifications of this company, the oil will have to be sent elsewhere to be refined. However, the telegram is as follows:Regarding Anglo-Persian oil agreement, we regard it as imperative for the protection of the shale-oil resources of this country that the Bill under discussion should be held up pending a complete investigation. The measure, if passed, will automatically close the shale-oil industry of the Commonwealth. Shale is our natural source of oil supply, and if closed we will be dependent on oversea sources. To protect these sources, a Navy and fortifications will have to be maintained for all time. Papua is especially vulnerable. Part of this money could be spent to better advantage in protecting and developing our natural resources with white labour. In the event of war with Japan or the United States of America, these' oversea routes cannot be protected, and the whole source of oversea oil supplies for the Commonwealth would be cut off and complete isolation result. It would be criminal to leave the shale-oil industry unprotected, and to place this country in such a position, besides allowing foreign imports to strangle our natural resources. The Scotch shale industry was of vital importance to Great Britain during the late war. Great Britain and United States of America, recognising the necessity of developing their shale resources, the are at present giving the question the gravest consideration. Mr Fell is proceeding to Melbourne, and will interview you. Our information should be of value. Regarding shale oil, under reasonable circumstances present output can be enormously increased. This company is in operation) in a big way in New South Wale3, but it is not the first company that has worked theso deposits, for enormous sums of money have been lost in efforts to develop this industry. This firm, which is specially interested, asks, for delay in order that there may be further investigation. This is not an industry in its infancy, but one that has been tried. The latter part of the telegram' tells us.that the present output of shale oil could be enormously increased, and surely that is a matter into which a Select Committee could inquire. If this Parliament will not protect Australian industries, where are the industries to find protection? The scheme proposed looks very nice on paper- a scheme to bring crude oil from the Persian Gulf to Fremantle. The gentlemen interested have been busy for some considerable time in the matter. In the West Australian of 3rd October, 1919, the first announcement of the Anglo-Persian Company appeared, as follows: The Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited's Act 1010: Power to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited, to erect reservoirs for the storage of oil and supply of same; compulsory use of roads, &c.; power to lay down pipes, &c, in streets, under railways, and in Government lands, and along wharfs, and exercise other powers.

To empower the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited (hereinafter called ""the company"") upon all or any lands and premises now or hereafter to be acquired by it, or any part thereof respectively, to construct, erect, and maintain a reservoir or reservoirs for the storage .of oil with all necessary engines, plant, machinery, works, buildings, appliances, apparatus, and conveniences for storing and distributing oil within the area comprised in(a) The district of the Fremantle Municipal Council; (6) The lands vested in the Fremantle Harbor Trust Commissioners; and (c) Such of the lands vested in the Honourable the Minister for Railways on behalf of His Majesty as are comprised in, abut on, adjoin, or are con- grant. tiguous to the district- - and lands beforementioned, or any of them, or any part or parts thereof respectively. 2. To empower the company to open, break up and interfere with streets, roads, public places, ways, footpaths, railways, tramways, rivers, bridges, culverts, sewers, drains, pipes, telegraphic and telephonic tubes, wires, and apparatus, and to lay down', set up, maintain, renew, or remove either above or underground pipes, tubes, troughs, inspection chambers and boxes, and other works, matters, and things for conveying oil, water, and materials to or from its reservoirs, situated on Fremantle town lots Nos. 1186 to 1192, 1197 to 1199, 1200, 1207, 1208, 1213 to 1216, and 1224 to 1227 (all inclusive),, or on some parts thereof respectively from or to the Victoria Wharf, or other wharfs of tlic Fremantle Harbor Trust Commissioners, in, under, and along such wharfs, lands, streets, roads, public places, ways, footpaths, railways, tramways, &c, as aforesaid, situate within the area beforementioned as may be defined on the plans and sections to be deposited as hereinafter mentioned, or as may be provided by the Bill. 3. To empower the company to acquire compulsorily, or by afrreement, easements in respect of the lands adjoining or contiguous to the property to he acquired by the company. , 4.

Copies of the intended Bill will be deposited in the office of the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, on or before the 11th day of November, 1919. Dated this 2nd day of October, 1019.",31
105,Mr BUKCHELL,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,What do you think is the meaning of all that ?,32
106,Mr JAMESPAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"I take it that the company is to exercise greater rights in putting up this reservoir than the Western Australian Government itself could exercise. The Commonwealth Government could not do what these people are asking the Western Australian Government to permit them to do, and what the State Government is prepared to",32
107,Mr BUBCHELL,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,The company cannot exercise those rights unless the Western Australian Government give them the power. . What is all the argument about?,32
108,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The Anglo-Persian Company "" owns the earth "" so far as Persia is concerned', and it wants to "" own the earth "". in Western Australia, which is part and parcel of the Commonwealth. Mr BUBCHEI/L - Does the honourable member know what all this is designed for ? It is to enable the port of Fremantle to be equipped for giving o i l supplies to any oil-driven vessels. "" Mr JAMES PAGE - Is that all? I am very much obliged for the information; but why should not the matter have been put in plain English, simply saying that what is required is provision so that ships may take oil back after bringing it over here?",32
109,Mr BUKOHELL,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,That is twisting .,32
110,Mr JAMESPAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Not at all. The clauses setting for t h the desired powers seem to annoy honourable members opposite.,32
111,Mr BOWDEN,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Thos e are the ordinary clauses.,32
112,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Unde r these clauses the Anglo-Persian Oil Company could acquire compulsorily the property of the Standard Oil Company. I am told that it would not do that. But the agreement empowers the company to do it . I do not wish any monopoly to have a footing in this country, unless i the a Government monopoly, and I am not an advocate for the Standard Oil Company, the Vacuum Oil Company, or any other. But when I have approached the Shell Oil Company, that is the British Imperial Company, in the interests of my constituents, they have done what they could. Only a fortnight ago I went to the Government for help, and was told that they were powerless to assist me, having no oil in reserve. I then, in fear and trembling, approached this great British I m perial Oil Company, but I came away in a very different state of mind. They promised to do all that they could to assist the men out in the back parts of Queensland' to get petrol to drive their pumps and engines and do other indust r i a l work. They depleted their reserves in Brisbane and hurried down a boat from Singapore, to do this.",32
113,Mr TUDOR,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"They kept their supplies for industrial use, and stopped joyriding .",33
114,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Yes . I did not make application for assistance to any particular town or place; I asked for help for the pastoral, agricultural, and v it cultural interests of Queensland, which needed oil for industrial purposes.",33
115,Mr CORSES,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Oi l was not made available in my district.,33
116,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Perhaps the honourable member did not go the right way to get it . If you want anything, you must hustle and bustle.  ber speaking of something that occurred before the Bill was introduced? ' Mr JAMES PAGE - Yes . I went to the company on two other occasions when there was a shortage of petrol out wost, and each time the company did its best for me. I would remind honourable members that the House of Commons passed a resolution of thanks to the British Imperial Oil Company for what it did during the war. it supplied 80 per cent, of the products that make up TNT., as is stated in a booklet issued by the company, on the cover of which is printed "" The Shell that h it Germany the hardest."" I advise honourable members to read that publication to see what the company has done for the Empire. I know of nothing that it has done detrimental to the interests of Australia.",33
117,Mr FLEMINO,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,You will admit that the price of petrol in Australia is tremendously high.,33
118,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"The only countries in which it is lower are those in which cil is produced. Petrol costs more in South Africa and in some of the States of South America than it costs in Australia.  costs in Great Britain , where it is not produced.",33
119,Mr COESEE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Is the honourable member supporting a monopoly?,33
120,Mr JAMESPAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"T h at is an amusing interjection to come from a member representing the sugar districts of Queensland, who is the greatest advocate of Australia's greatest monopoly, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.",33
121,Mr CORSER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Would not the honourable member rather support an Australian monopoly than an American one?,33
122,Mr JAMESPAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"I do not support any monopoly. Let those flag-wagging patriots, of which the honourable member is one, listen to this:During the critical year of 1915, "" Shell's "" Portishead Distillery produced approximately 80 per cent, of Britain's total output of toluol, i - the basic ingredient of the high explosive TNT. (trd-nitro-toluol), so extensively used for shells, bombs, and mines. Addressing the Institute of Petroleum Technologists, at their annual dinner some months after the armistice, Sir Frederick W. Black, KC.B., referred to the "" Shell"" group as having given us that valuable product toluol, from Borneo petroleum, without which we could not have defeated the enemy. Under the agreement companies other than the Anglo-Persian O i l Company will be prevented from trading in Australia. The agreement saysThat the Refinery company shall not enter into or be in any way concerned in or a party to or act in concert with any commercial Trust or Combine, but shall always be and remain an independent British business. The firm of Walkers Limited , in Queensland, can make any machinery that it may be asked for. Nearly all the in t r i cate machinery used in the sugar mills of Northern Queensland was made in its works, and against open competition the firm has gained a contract for supplying the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments with locomotives, which aro some of the finest to be seen anywhere. Why should we not require the AngloAustralian Persian Oil Company to use Australian machinery? But the . agreement says:That other things being equal, the Refinery Company shall give preference to goods manufactured in the Commonwealth when purchasing machinery, plant, and supplies. I think that the Refinery Company should, under all circumstnces, give preference to goods manufactured in Australia. Then, again, it is stipulated that the Anglo-Persian O i l Company shall ' have full commercial and technical control . Where does the Commonwealth come in under that arrangement?",33
123,Mr CORSER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,It is a partner with the company.,34
124,Mr JAMESPAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"I would not like to enter into such a partnership. clause respecting freights should be explained. "" C u r r e n t rates"" are to be charged. The other night the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) gave us a dissertation on. the Bill which was one of the finest I have heard in this chamber. He convinced me that there are certain 'matters in the agreement which should be rectified. For instance, no. one can say what are the current rates of freight between Australia and this port in the Persian Gulf from which crude oil is to be brought, because there are no vessels trading regularly between the two places, and no back loading.",34
125,Mr CORSER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,""" Current rates "" means the rates at which shipping could be got.",34
126,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,But there would be no competition.,34

129,Mr BELL,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Unde r the agreement we could employ the vessels of other companies if they offered cheaper freights.,34
130,Mr JAMESPAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"I have my doubts about that, and I should very much like to have a clear definition of what is meant by "" current rates."" On the question of dumping I may say that personally I should like to see the dumping of oil and petrol in Australia start tomorrow, because it would benefit our people if they .were able to secure cheaper petrol and .kerosene, since the priceswhich have to be paid at present in Australia for both these commodities are exorbitant.",34
131,Mr CORSER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Dumpin g would wipe out any local industry, and we should then have to pay the piper. - Mr JAMES PAGE - What would be the difference between dumping by other companies and by the Anglo-Persian Company? The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) is a red-hot patriot. He is willing that the Anglo Persian Company should be given a monopoly in the supply of petrol and kerosene required in Australia. He does not mind dumping by that company at the expense of those engaged in the production of oil in the Commonwealth. He has nothing to say about, possibly, thousands of men engaged in the industry in The New South Wales being put out of employment. The telegram I have read shows clearly what might happen in the matter of dumping by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but all the honourable member is concerned about is to prevent the introduction into Australia from overseas of cheap o il and petrol supplied by other companies. I ask honourable members to say whether they consider that under paragraph c of clause 14 of the agreement a fair proposal is submitted? It provides - thatIn order to insure the full success and development of the oil refining industry in Australia, the Commonwealth will, so long as the prices charged by the Refinery Company for products of refining are considered by the Commonwealth fair and reasonable(c) Cause to be introduced into the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and supported as a Government measure, a Bill providing for the imposition of Customs duties on crude mineral oil whenever, in. its ' opinion, such action is necessary or advisable to prevent unfair competition with the products of crude oil refined in Australia by the Refinery Company.",34

I am not in the habit of bandying irresponsible statements about the chamber in the way that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. MCWilliams) accused me of doing just now. Por that reason, I wish to tell the House the facts about the proposal from Tasmania with regard to the supply of shale oil. The price is as stated by the honourable member for Franklin, but he told the House only half the facts. The offer of the company is to supply oil for 90s. per ton, plus the bounty of 45s. per ton, which brings the price up to the figure stated by me, namely, 135s. per ton. The payment of the oil bounty will run out at about the same time as the proposed contract was to begin. The proposal of the Tasmanian company, therefore, means that we should enter into a fresh undertaking to offer a bounty of 45s. per ton for ten years for the production of oil to supplement the price of 90s. per ton at which they are prepared to supply oil. It was specifically provided that, failing the renewal of the bounty, the price was to be 135s. for ten years.",36

I have said that the oil bounty will cease to be payable at about the time when operations under the contract provided for in the Bill are supposed to begin, and the Tasmanian proposal is, therefore, that the oil bounty shall be renewed for ten years.

192,Mr CORSER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Wide Bay.) [2.18] This is one of the most important measures calling for the attention of Parlia'ment today. It affects not only the present industries.of the Commonwealth, but 'those which, we hope, will be established after the Tariff has been considered. It vitally affects also the welfare of our Navy. It is important for the manufacturing interests of Australia-in being, aud to be-that we should be in a position to supply industries with necessary motive power adequately, and with certainty. Some honourable members have stressed the necessity for appointinga Select Committee. I could quite appreciate that if the Committee could call upon expert evidence; but we have not expert experience and information at our disposal in Australia. It is all very well to say that the Committee could examine commercial men representing oil concerns; but it is not usual for business men to go to their mercantile' opponents , to secure technical information. Surely we have in the Ministry and their advisers men who are as good as those whom we could call upon from private commercial sources. Time is the essence of this contract; we have no time to lose. I congratulate the Government upon having entered into the agreement. It should be remembered that it will be two years before the refinery can be completed. Meanwhile, there are prospects of large crude oil supplies being struck in Australian Territories. What will be the value of crude oil discoveries if 'there is no refinery available to deal with the product? I know of two companies, working today in Queensland, which are very hopeful of getting oil within a brief period. One man interested has told me that he feels sure he will be. able to get oil within the next three months. It is believed that in Queensland alone there is no less an area than 20,000 square miles of oil country. The best encouragement we can give these prospectors is, first to offer to reward them for making a discovery in payable quantities; and, secondly, to re-assure them that, when oil has been discovered, there will be a ready purchaser who will refine it . The buyer to whom they should look to receive the highest value from their supplies should be the Commonwealth refinery. I do not consider the Anglo Persian Oil Company in any degree a foreign concern. Seeing that more than half of its shares are held by the I m perial Government, and that the Commonwealth will hold half of the interests in the refinery to be erected here,, it means that practically three-fourths of the total interests will be in the hands of the British and Commonwealth authorities. We should give the Imperial Government credit for being shrewd. When they entered into an. agreement with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, they knew what they were about. When they appointed to the directorate as their representative a man of such knowledge and experience as Lord Inchcape, who was not a shareholder, they knew what they were doing. Their purpose was to secure the benefit of his world-wide acquaintance, with business management. If the British authorities considered it safe that they should be represented by only two out of fourteen members of the directorate, they must have recognised that their nominees were men of specially wide experience, and that the remainder, who were experts, would not be hostile to Imperial interests. If we in Australia take the precaution of appointing three out of the seven directors as Government representatives, it should be sufficient to insure that those three shall be men of considerable mercantile experience, and that the four remaining shall be oil experts. The fact that Lord Inchcape is largely associated with a shipping combine has no bearing in this instance, and it is absurd to raise the point. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has tank steamers of its own-sufficient , I understand, to make the concern independent of any outside shipping combine. cape cannot hope or expect to control or wield influence along those lines. So far as Australia is concerned, it is obviously advantageous that we should be associated with a company which has its own shipping available to bring to us requisite supplies of crude oil for refining here, u n t i l we have our own. We will not be dependent upon other shipping sources. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has informed me personally that ample protection will be afforded to producers of oil in Australia, in the matter of their securing fair value for the product. He has told me, further, they will be given preference. the Prime Minister will take the opportunity, when this measure is being dealt with in Committee, to place those safeguards in the Bill itself. . continent which is larger than the United States of America, and I look forward to the day when discoveries of valuable oil deposits will have been made in Australia. We shouldsee that, having a national refinery, the are given not merely a preferential opportunity their crude oil refined and placed upon the market. It is essential the Commonwealth should be fully tected against the possibility ing. In my experience as an importer I have seen a good deal of thatevil. And there is always the danger that, as soon as one has established an industry, the large foreign interests already operating may so reduce the price of their commodities as to crush the local infant Mr Corser. rival. What consideration would the loss from a temporary reduction in the price of oil supplies to the Commonwealth be to the foreign oil companies which carry such huge interests at the present time? The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr . Page) said there was no fear of dumping in Australia, but I remind him that directors prior to the war there was a .considerable amount of dumping on the part of German houses, shipping freights, Germany to Australia, being offered at 12s. 6d. per ton, as compared with our coastal rate of 35s. In candles, for instance, dumping was particularly notice* able. British firms at that time supplying mining companies' requirements were Lord Inch- under agreement between themselves not to sell at below a certain price in London, but some of them shipped enormous quantities to Australia on consignment, and drew upon their agents for 90 per cent, of value, and theTe was an understanding, I believe, that the agents were not expected to pay any more. As a result, British firms were able to compete very effectively with Australian manufacturers who were then becoming established. I think I was instrumental in inducing the Government to offer the reward of £10,000 for the discovery of payable oil in Australia, but I believe now that that Australian amount is not sufficient. I hope the that Government will see their way clear to I trust increase it . What would £100,000 mean to the Commonwealth if , as a return for this reward, payable oil in large quantities was found irii some part of the ComWe have a monwealth ? In Queensland the practice of the State Government, who have an oil monopoly, is to issue a licence for prospecting over an area of 2,000 acres, somewhere and to grant a lease for 60 acres only, but the prospector - will get 2-J per discoverers cent, on all oil taken out of the balance a fair, but of the area of 2,000 acres. This induceof having ment is not sufficient to encourage prospecting. that If the agreement with the British Gopro- vernment is considered a fair and workof dump- able one, surely after investigation it ought to be good enough for us to establish a refinery in conjunction with the Anglo-Persian O i l Company. If we do not take advantage of this opportunity, where are. we likely to get experts and the machinery to carry out the work ourselves, and what would become of our crude oil? I have not heard any honourable member suggest an alternative.",38

197,Mr CORSER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Of course. outside firms compete on f a ir terms, nobody should object, and the Government w i ll not object. There is a general belief that payable oil exists in Western and South Australia and Queensland, and there is every reason, therefore, why refineries should be established without undue delay, so that we may be able to deal with oil when found. I should like to emphasize the fact that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company controls a larger area of oil lands than all the companies in the United States of America, and, therefore, it should be to our advantage to be associated with the corporation commanding such huge supplies of crude o i l , and which, moreover, is not dependent upon any other organization for transport. The agreement also contains a safeguard in that, if the Anglo-Persian Oil Com,pany attempts to charge unfair transport charges, there is nothing to prevent our chartering other vessels for the conveyance of this crude oil to Australia, the price fixed being f.o.b. port of shipment. This means that the oil becomes our property when it is put on board ship, such ship to be named by us, so we are free to choose our own vessels for its conveyance to Australia; but the Anglo-Persian Company undertakes to carry it at a reasonable price. I trust the agreement will be ratified with as little delay as possible, so that, with an adequate supply of fuel oil at reasonable prices guaranteed, our manufacturing in dustries may be increased and developed satisfactorily.",40

If , however, it is referred to a Committee, and a report is presented to the House in three weeks' time, it is quite likely that, with the information then available to honourable members, the Bill wil l be agreed to unanimously.

I shall quote the conclusions arrived at after an exhaustive investigation. The report statedWe find that 1. There is grave danger of a permanent world famine in motor spirit, even at fabulous prices. After analyzing the present and potential oil supplies of the world, the Committee arrived at that very important conclusion. It went on to report that2. The sole remedy for this country is a largely increased production of home and/or Empire produced motor fuel. 3. Power alcohol is the only potentially unlimited source of supply. 4.

199,Mr CORSER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Surely we need not have any investigation as to power alcohol. The matter has already been investigated here.,40
200,Mr FENTON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"But since the British Government thought it worthwhile to investigate these matters, surely we should have an inquiry before we enter into an agreement of this kind. We have had quite recently a concrete illustration of the expedition with which a Committee can report. The Select Committee appointed only four weeks ago to inquire into„the question of sea carriage has already presented to the House' a progress report of a very valuable character. In order that the House may be supplied with the fullest information, and so placed in a position to arrive at a proper conclusion in regard to this agreement, we should have an inquiry. This proposal for a Select Committee is entirely non-party. Surely the mere fact that it has emanated from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) should not give to it a party tinge? A Select Committee would be able to analyze the agreement, obtain further information, and report to us within three or four weeks. This agreement will bind us to the company for the next fifteen years. What will be our position at the end of that period ? Are we to remain at a stand-still in the matter of the invention and discovery of motor power ? Already we have power alcohol, benzol, and a new product known as natalite competing with petrol. Fifteen years hence, in the matter of power, our position will be very different from what it is today. I believe that oil fuel will have competitors that will push it right cut of the market. All over the world chemists and other experts are at work looking for substitutes for petrol, because we are faced with a famine in respect of motive power, and fifteen years certainly seems to be a long time to be bound to one company. The Public Accounts Committee conducted an inquiry into the Papuan oil fields, and examined Dr Wade, who is the only expert representing the Australian Government - It""reported thatThe opinion of one experienced witness was to the effect that the prospects of obtaining oil in Papua are distinctly good. At the same time, he added, "" we have to remember that .oil, being liquid, and able to migrate, cumulation comes under very different laws from those applying to any other mineral; it t is the biggest gamble on earth. The thing is to be able to locate the place where the geological conditions are suitable for the accumulation of oil in the pools, and then to bore it. But in one of those places some little accident in the geological structure underground may have led up to the escape of the oil and its migration elsewhere."" For this reason the witness thought that "" there ought to be as many people as possible trying to get oil. The more people there are in New Guinea putting down bores and trying to develop the field, the niore likely is hit the place for a big supply."" I should like the production and distribution of oil in Australia to be a GovernMr Fenton. ment monopoly. The distribution of petrol, and also kerosene, I think, has been made a Government monopoly in France, - and is yielding a revenue of something like £2,000,000 per annum. The m a j o r it y of honourable members, apparently, are averse to the carrying on of this industry wholly and solely by the Government, and are determined to give the Anglo-Persian Oil Company an opportunity to develop our oil resources in Papua. Why not allow other great o i l concerns to step in ? I admit that we have not made very much progress in Papua during the seven years in which we have been engaged in oil development there. We have expended £21,000 on the work, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is going tobenefit by that expenditure, which was largely incurred in clearing the country. We have cleared the way for this company to step in and take advantage of the spade work done by the Commonwealth. As the result of our outlay, it will be able to secure a profitable output sooner than would otherwise have been possible. In that respect alone, we are giving the company a great concession.  we giving the' company ? It is merely to be our agent, and Ave shall pay it for the work done. It will not participate in any discovery made.",40
201,Mr FENTON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"O i l has already been discovered in Papua. Two .men who were non-experts' were the first to make the discovery, and their dependants have got very littl e out of it . The presence of oil has been located over a number of square miles in Papua, and any company now entering into the industry has only to further explore the fields already disits ac- covered. Dr Wade is the only expert representing the Commonwealth Government, and we ought surely to be prepared to take his advice. He has said that if we intend to allow private enterprise to for enter these oil-fields, then the greater the number of persons, that we have boring for oil the better. Since the Government have determined to depart from the policy that has been followed for some years, and to allow private enterprise to step in , we ought to say to every company, "" You can come in under coni t to ditions similar to those which we are laying down in respect of the Anglo-Persian Company, and bore for oil in Papua and Australia,"" The greater the number of experts we have at work the sooner shall we have an adequate supply of oil. Why l i m it this undertaking to one company, especially when we know that its antewords, cedents are, in some respects, no better than those of some of the biggest combines in Australia? Something has been said as to the guarantee we have in presence of Lord Inchcape as a representative of the British Government on the company's board. The Minister for Home  now in charge of the Bill , not long since pointed out in this House the serious competition to which the Commonwealth line of steamers was subjected. I would ask hi m who was the man he had in even in its raw state. mind when he made that statement? H was able to inform the House that, under the chairmanship of Lord Inchcape, great shipping concern had obtained conalty trol of practically half our British toms, and it has since swallowed up more small shipping companies. honourable member for Flinders (Mr connection Bruce), in dealing with this Bill , that, so far as be could see, the profit that the Anglo-Persian Oil ComOur pany would make under this agreement would be by carrying crude oil from Persia to Australia, and refining it here. It will obtain two profits- a profit on production, of the crude oil and a profit on its carriage from Persia to Australia. Having taken these two big bites out of the profitable cherry, it will allow Commonwealth to take a small bite out of the remaining piece. If the Government are going to change their policy in regard should act. to oil development, let them throw. open our oil-fields to the world. W it h the decline in the production gold in Australia, we shall have to more and more to our primary industhe tries, and particularly to the pastoral agricultural industries, for our developindustry, ment. Power alcohol is coming into the field more largely than ever. It is said that this is a petrol age, but we know that Germany during ""the war was cut off to inquire into this matter. from her supplies of petrol, and by resortmeans ing to the production of power alcohol, was able to carry on much of her transeverything port operations. Think of the number of be dissipated. vegetable products - from which power alcohol can be produced. It is extracted from molasses, sugar-cane, sorghum, wheat, oats, barley, maize, kaffir corn, total of fourteen. potatoes, sweet potatoes, beet, sawdust, wood, prickly pear, f r u it , vegetables, honey, and palm trees. An y plant which, produces starch or sugar can be used for the manufacture of natalite; in other anything which contains starch and sugar will produce power alcohol.",41

203,Mr FENTOJST,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Yes . I know that a good deal of alcohol is used for in ternal combustion, but it is the wrong I am aware, too, that if alcohol be used for power purposes there are some persons who will not hesitate to consume it In Germany, to e prevent that being done, nauseous in gredients have been introduced into it . a That country also imposes a severe penupon any person convicted of con-botsuming alcohol which is intended to be many used only for power purposes. France The is about to follow her example. In with this Bill we have to consaid sider not . merely power alcohol, but only many other articles, such as benzol. - gas companies, for example, are operating under an old Act, which compels them to provide gas possessing a standard of illumination, whereas, if the they were obliged to provide gas possessing a calorific value they would be able to extract benzol from their coal, and the thus supply a substitute for petrol. These are the lines upon which it is suggested that the British Government Whilst I am in favour of referring this Bill to a Selecit Qommittee, I ' a m also in favour of doing all that we can to develop our oil resources. of En fact, the report presented by the look Finance Committee recommended that Ministry should go ahead with a and more vigorous development of the o i l either from shale or crude o i l . The Government might reasonably adopt the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, and appoint a Select Committee B y that the passage of the Bill would be expedited, and the public suspicion that is not quite above board would To me it is nothing that the British Government, in their agreement with the Anglo-Persian Company, asked for only two directors out of a I do not wish to be hard upon the Imperial authorities, but I believe the British Governments and British parliamentarians are far more susceptible to outside influences than are Australian parliamentarians.",42
204,Mr LISTER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,That is a very serious reflection to make.,43
205,Mr FENTON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"If the honourable member will refer to the history of persons who have taken a prominent part in Imperial politics, he will see that some of them who should have been relegated to obscurity have been appointed to very high positions. Take the Marconi scandals, with which a number of members of the British Cabinet were associated. One of those members, in particular, has since been appointed to one of the highest offices in the TJnited Kingdom. Knowing that the3e things are taking place, the fact that Lord Inchcape represents the British Government in this matter is no inducement to me to vote for this Bill. That gentleman possesses great control, particularly over shipping, and is associated with a body of men who are neither fools nor philanthropists. They are out to make money, and if they can make it by establishing an oil refinery in Australia they will do so. In war time the British Government itself proved to be one of the greatest profiteers in the community. Under this Bill the Anglo Persian Oil Company will supply Australia with only half its annual requirements in the way of products other than fuel oil. It will be two years before we get a drop of oil from the refinery which it is proposed to establish. What will happen to us in the meantime? We shall be dependent upon the very people whom honourable members opposite so vigorously denounce. What happened to Britain? Out of a total of 300,000,000 gallons of oil required by her annually, the American companies have supplied 200,000,000 gallons. In this connection I desire to read a paragraph written by Professor Chester Lloyd Jones, of the University of Wisconsin, in which he saysAt present there can he no doubt that the most important economic development of this sort which has occurred to the south of the United States is in oil resources. The most important among these thus far are those in Mexico, a country which in 1001 produced but 10,345 barrels, which began exports a decade later, and which produced in 1917 55,202,770 barrels, a large share of which went to keep the fires burning in the ships of the Allies in their struggle against Germany. there were shipped from Mexican ports 53,910,863 barrels. From producing practically nothing at the beginning of the war, Mexico has risen to what is probably second place among potential oil producers, for the oil marketed is now limited, not by the capacity of the wells, but by transportation facilities. I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill; and shall support the motion of the Leader of the Opposition to refer the measure to a Select Committee, in order to remove the public suspicion with which this matter is surrounded.",43
206,Mr FLEMING,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Robertson) [3.10] Quite contrary to the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, the fact that the company with which the Government propose to enter into this agree- 1 ment is a purely British one carries considerable weight with me. To my mind, especially in the matter of o i l , it is essential that the British Empire shall protect its interests against the great Trusts of the United States. I have no desire to traverse the agreement, which is set out in the schedule to this Bill, and which appears to be, on the whole, a very acceptable one. But I wish to draw special' attention to one remark made by the Prime Minister in discussing the measure. He stated that, in connection with the future oil supplies of Australia, we should put shale upon one side and look only for well oil. Now, there are quite a number of really good shale propositions to be found throughout the Commonwealth. Some of them are of the most promising nature. Upon page 441 of the Official Year Book of the Commonwealth for 1914, I find the following:Production on "" anything like a large scale commenced in 1868, when about 17,000 tons, valued at £48,000, were raised. The production in 1912 amounted to 86,018 tons, valued at £34,770, as compared with 75,104 tons, valued at £36,980, in 1911. Of the total raised in 1012, 40,185 tons were produced in the Northern District, and 45,833 in the Western District. In addition to that there are deposits in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland, any one of which might be well worth developing. Some of them certainly are. The Tear-Book further saysDuring the year ended 30th June, 1913, the Commonwealth Oil Corporation at Hartley In 1918 Vale, New South Wales, received bounty to the amount of £804 on kerosene, and £882 on refined paraffin wax, while the British Australian Oil Company received £1,988 on kerosene, and £86 on parafin wax. That bounty ceased to exist at the end of 1913. When it ceased the British Australian O i l Company, - which had its works at Murrurundi, was compelled to close down, though a very small additional bonus would have enabled it to continue operations. It seems to me that the Government would be well advised not only to adopt this agreement with the Anglo-Persian O i l Company, but to do something in the direction of encouraging shale o i l production in Australia. I know that a good deal of money has been lost, both in Scotland and Australia, in connection with the production of shale oil. ..But that was before o i l was i h such great demand as it is today. We must recollect that during the past three or four years the price of that commodity has increased by 200 per cent, or 300 per cent. Properties, therefore, which under former conditions required a good deal of assistance from the State ought not to need very much in the way of financial assistance in the future. I have not the slightest doubt that before many years we shall discover mineral well .oil in Australia. In this connection the honourable member' for Maranoa (Mr James Page) told us today what happened in Queensland. All the o i l experts in this country, and. certainly a great number of American experts, regard the experiment at Roma as convincing proof that, sooner or later, good, free o i l will be discovered in Australia.",43

Under the agreement .we are virtually handing over to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for a period of fifteen years the sole right to refine oil in Australia. The term is a very lengthy one, and I cannot recall an agreement of a similar character being arranged for such a number of years. Do honourable members realise that in supporting this Bill they are assisting in establishing a huge monopoly in the Commonwealth? The agreement embodied in the measure does not make any provision for exploring for o i l , but simply 'creates the necessary machinery for erecting a refinery in Australia. The crude oil .to be handled will have to be imported from other countries, and as the arrangement is for refining only, other companies should be given the opportunity of bringing crude oil to Australia. The agreement was drawn up in an atmosphere totally foreign to Australian sentiment, and entirely opposed to the best interests of the Commonwealth. ' Those gentlemen who were responsible for its drafting are doubtless past masters at the work, and when the document was submitted to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Jos.eph Cook) they apparently overlooked the fact that they were being influenced by such men as Lord Inchcape. I do not think it can be called an agreement, because such documents usually embody a mutual arrangement between the contracting parties; in this case ali of the benefits are on one side. It would be interesting to know how the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) intends voting on this Bill , because he very critically analyzed many clauses in the agreement, and came to the conclusion that practically every one would have to be amended in Committee. Why does not the honourable member support the appointment of a Select Committee to enable the fullest Until that possible information to be submitted to this Chamber ? When considering a proposal such as this we should know what developments are taking place in oil-producing centres, and what prospects there - I are of other corporations entering into a similar arrangement with the Commonwealth. When I was in New Guinea, in 1912, I was informed by men who had been engaged in exploratory work there that the principal difficulty in connection The honourable with that field was in finding a means of transport between the oil deposits and the port of shipment. That view was supported by the gentleman who represented the Commonwealth before Dr Wade was appointed, and who had done boring operations in the oil-fields of Russia and' America, ancl has a very extensive knowledge of the whole industry. The other agreement entered into may be regarded as a deed of gift, as we to provide £50,000 for exploratory and have absolutely no control. generally supposed that extensive oil deare posits will not be discovered on the mainday land, and that the chief source of supply will be in the Pacific Islands the control of the Australian ment, but no provision made for bringing supplies from source to an Australian refinery.

Since this matter has been underdiscussion I have been surprised to learn of the number of people in Australia endeavouring to get have oil. Many people have been at work at work, Newnes for a long time past. They It is are producing oil in large quantities, and able to dispose of all they get.

It is too long, and long agreements are entirely dangerous. The shorter an agreement is a made the more we may be sure that the interests' in it are mutual. If a legal made gentleman produces a long document for one's signature, we may be sure that it a has purposely been made long so that The honthere may be a chance of having it defeated. This is not a mutual agreement. knowledge Too much power is given to one side, and of the too little to the other.

But there many omissions from the document. No kinds-I provision is made for depreciation or for as a profit and loss account, or as to what the the size of the refinery will be, or as to how much o i l is to be put through each year. I think the attitude of the Governoil in Ausment is one of obstinacy. If they consider supplies the agreement a perfect one. with which no fault can befound, surely they should It not be afraid to have it subjected to the of day. As the Leader of the Oppoto sition (Mr Tudor) has pointed out, bebefore this Houseagreed to involvethe country in an expenditure under the Iron Bounty Bill, it decided to hear the evidence of experts. Yet here Ministers propose to involve the people of Australia in a big expenditure and create a monopoly for fifteen years in a commodity, which is most essential in our industrial life and for the transporting of our produce. We are very foolish if we agree to do so without a preliminary inquiry. We are ^anxious to do the right thing, but we cannot when the Government are - determined to prevent us from knowing the full details of the step we are asked to take. The Commonwealth has spent £120,920 to date in prospecting for and the production of oil in Papua, and at the last stock-taking in June, 1919, the realizable assets were valued at £24,500. I am quite willing to admit that, when a Government undertakes exploring work of this character, there are losses, and I do not condemn our Government in this respect, but under the agreement with the Anglo Persian Oil Company and the British Government all our iabour and expenditure in Papua is to be handed over to the oil company, and I am told that Lord Inchcape is connected with the concern. If Lord Inchcape were cut up into twenty-five pieces, he could not fill the chair in half the propositions with which he is connected as director. But if his name is included in the directorate of any concern, we may be sure that it is one that is out to get an advantage over the people. The Peninsular and Oriental Navigation .Company now propose to establish banks at every comer of the world where their vessels touch, so that they can control monetary transactions as well as shipping, but if Australia allows it to be done here, the people are simpler creatures than I Lave always taken them to be. I maintain that this agreement is not an agreement, because it is not mutual in character, and that the Government have been very unwise in asking the House to agree to it.",44

211,Mr HUGHES,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.38] - I shall confine my remarks to dealing with the material points raised during the course of the debate by honourable members who for one reason or another do not .entirely approve of the Bill. I wish to preface what I have to say by repeating in most emphatic and unambiguous language that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has no connection, direct or indirect, with any other great oil company. I have explained that the Burmah Company, which is to all intents and purposes part of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, is in itself a British company. The Anglo-Persian Company has no relation to the .Standard Oil Company, the ""Shell"" group, or any American or foreign company. It is British in essence and origin, and owes its success to British enterprise and capital, and its control is now in the hands of the British Government. Many reasons have been urged by honourable members as to why the agreement should not be ratified. I must confess to a feeling of disappointment at those which have been put forward by some honourable members. Some have urged that if the agreement is ratified it will create a monopoly in this country and place usunder the domination of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but this accusation comes strangely from the lips of men who have been absolutely silent under the complete domination of the Standard Oil Company and the "" Shell"" .group for years and years. As soon as a British company, which is dominated by the British Governmeut, and which is Imperial in essence, offersmaking the Commonwealth a full partner - with it-to erect a refinery in this country, members rise and say that this is a monopoly, and, for their part, they will not agree to it.. The .Shell? Yes. Standard Oil? Yes. But the Anglo-Persian, Great Britain, and . the Commonwealth. ? No. I must confess that their attitude surprises me. What surprised me no less was to hear, for the first time in my life, that moderation was one. of the characteristics of the Standard Gil and Shell Companies, that they had not increased their prices, but had stopped. short of taking the last penny from the users of petrol/ benzine, lubricating oil, and fuel oil in Australia. We were told, in short, that those companies, which for years had been, as it were, the stalkinghorse of every Democrat, every syndicalist, and every demagogue, like myself, throughout the world, had suddenly become clothed in the shining garments of the philanthropist, and all the hosts of the archangels. As I looked at the reS resentatives of the Shell.and the iStanard Oil in the gallery while these things were being said, I saw their faces shine like the faces of those who had found an abiding place in the bosom of Father Abraham. They surely did not recognise themselves in that description. The fact is that the Standard Oil, the Shell, and other foreign companies have done everything that lay in their power as commercial concerns, which are not immoral, but unmoral, whose only god was profit, and whose only purpose was to wring the last penny out of the consumers of this country, to serve their own purposes at our expense, even to threatening this country with an oil famine. When the Prices Commission declined to increase the price of oil, they said, "" If you increase the price, you will not have any oil.""",46
212,Mr JAMES PAGE,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,Lord Inchcape said the same with the shipping.,47
213,Mr HUGHES,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Hav e we' come to this, that when it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall become a full partner in a great Imperial concern-becaus e it is Imperial in the best sense of the word, since the British Government is a. full partner in it-w e should refuse to take the opportunity to erect in Australia a refinery which would insure fuel oil for our Navy, without which we aTe undone, and for the British Navy, without whose co-operation we are also undone? I say deliberately that the China Fleet, as well as our own, cannot operate effectively in time of war unless there is ample .oil storage round these coasts. On whom are we to rely, then? Is it on the American company and the Dutch companies, or on this company which is built on the rock of Britain itself? So I put these things to one side as being in themselves abundant proof of the excellence of this agreement, since no better arguments can be adduced against it . I take the other points in the agreement against which criticism has been directed. It is said that we shall have no guarantee of getting crude oil at a fair price from the Anglo-Persian Company. I said when introducing the Bill that we would get it at a fair and reasonable price. It was pointed out that that was not in the agreement. I have had it put in. If honourable members ask, "" Wiho is to be the judge of a fair and reasonable price ?"" I answer, "" The Commonwealth."" That, I submit, is a full and satisfactory answer. It has also been said, "" The company will make their money out of freights, for which, they will charge us what they like."" My reply was that we would get freight at current rates. . One honourable member laughed at this, as if it was the most unusual thing in the world that prices should be regulated by supply and demand. We have always heard from the Ministerial Corner, in regard to wheat and wool, and from the Opposition Corner in regard to labour, that prices do not should be regulated by supply and demand, plus whatever pressure can be brought to bear on the market. Is that not the law which governs the world? However, in order to meet this objection, we have had that provision altered, and, if the freights charged by the Anglo-Persian Company for bringing their crude mineral oil are such as we consider unfair, we can get other freights, either our own or anybody else's. I think it was the Leader of the Opposition who said that the effect of the agreement would be that the consumer of oil would be sweated and bled. For all these years honourable members opposite have been silent. While we were under the domination of the Shell and the Standard Oil Companies, they cared nothing about the unfortunate consumer; but now they sweat with terror or apprehension at the prospect of the poor consumer being exploited by this company, in which the Commonwealth itself is to be the dominant partner. But what are the facts? For the first time since oil has been used in Australia, the interests of the consumer will be conserved. No longer will he be compelled to pay whatever Standard Oil likes to charge him. I have said that the price will be fair and reasonable. It was contended that there was no guarantee of this, since no provision was made for it in the agreement. In order to meet this objection, I have had such a provision inserted. If I am asked, "" Who is to say what price is fair and reasonable ?"" I say, "" The Commonwealth."" I ask honourable members who are capable of looking at anything that comes out of Judea-o r is it Nazareth ? - wit h an unjaundiced eye, what more do they want? Further, the critics of the agreement complain that this company is going to be protected against the competition of the Shell and Standard Oil concerns, the two which I take as being the greatest of the foreign companies, by having a refund of duty on crude oil if those companies, as our competitors, wish to undersell the Anglo-Persian Company and destroy them, foT the purpose of subsequently exploiting .this country and resuming their monopoly of it. It is said "" You are going to give the Anglo Persian Company an unfair advantage."" My answer is this: "" The established policy of this country is Protection. It is a good thing to have the oil refined here, in order to give employment to our people, and to have here supplies of oil, both in its raw and in its refined state. In order to do that, we must protect these industries in Australia by the same means as we employ to protect every other industry."" But we provide that, in order to prevent this company exploiting the people, none of the advantages set out in section 12 to safeguard the company against unfair competition - by foreign companies shall be enforced unless the company sell their finished article at a fair and reasonable price. The. Commonwealth is to say what a fair and reasonable price is. If the company charge more, we lift the floodgates and allow the foreign oil of the dear friends of the critics of this Bill, the Shell and the Standard Oil Companies, to come in, and they can wallow in it to their heart's content. It is said that we shall have to pay a greater price for crude oil than is necessary. I have already said that one guarantee against this has been inserted in the Bill. But there is also another, and it is this: That in no circumstances is the price to be greater than the price paid by Britain to the Anglo-Persian Company for crude mineral oil. Surely it will be admitted that there is now a complete guarantee. - Honourable members have seen in this measure the shadow of a menace against exploration for oil in this country and in its Territories. They say, "" If we are to get 200,000 tons of crude oil from Persia, the Anglo-Persian experts will not be very keen on finding oil in Papua."" One honourable member said that the effect of this agreement would be to send up the price of Anglo-Persian shares. There is an old story about the three tailors of Tooley-street that might be applied here; but all I will say is that when we speak of a company with £20,000,000 of capital, and remember that all we are asked to consider is a matter of £250,000, such a contention may be dismissed without more ado. The best answer to those who fear that the effect of this agreement will be to retard development and the discovery of oil in Australia or in its Territories is the fact that there is an ample market for Anglo-Persian crude oil all over the world. We believe they will do their best to find oil in Papua. It is an I m perial venture, of which the British Government is paying half the cost. But I say, on behalf of the Government, in order to remove all apprehension, that we shall do two things. First, we shall increase the reward offered to those who find oil in payable quantities, either on the mainland or in New Guinea, or in German New Guinea when we begin to explore there, to the sum of £50,000. Then we shall offer every facility to experts, other than the Persian Oil Company's experts, to explore the mainland - I mean Australia-Papua , and German New Guinea. Further, we shall do all things within our power to give breadth, scope, and life to a p.olicy which will insure not only the discovery, but the development of oil when discovered in this great country of ours. I think that what I have said COVOTS most, if not all the ground that has been traversed by those who object, for amy reason, to the Bill. It has heen suggested that the Bill should be referred to a - Select Committee.. What is this Select Committee going to do? Who is going to compose it? Who ie going inform its mind ? To whom shall it look for inspiration? I speak not at all, of course, of those higher sources that are open to all poor mortals; but to whom below is the Committee to look? What do we know about oil? as a chastened, humble being, and I say that I know nothing about oil. There are those in this Chamber who know everything, about all things, and I leave them to flounder in the wealth of their knowledge. I speak of ordinary men. If I were on such a Select Committee, I sliould have to inform my mind from reports of previous Com-' mittees on the subject, or to listen to evidence from the Anglo-Persian, the Standard, or other panies. The Cabinet has done its best to in f o rm its mind, and it relies principally o'n. the fact that - what is good enough for B r it a in is good enough for the Commonwealth. And above all things, that our present circumstances are such dare not go on as we are; we dare not, in the face of facts-in the face - particularly of the. fact that, without 'fuel oil; our Navy is ' powerless-allo w this country to remaindependent for - supplies of this thing, which is vital alike to our national safety and economic wel-fare, upon foreign companies. For that reason, I uTge the House, to accept this proposal. One other point before I sit down. It is said that .this Bill will mean the death'knell of the shale-oil industry. 'that utterly. It exposes the shale to no greater competition than at preGreene; W. M. sent, though it changes the nature of the Fowler, competition. The shale industry will not Bamferd, F. W. 'be exposed to the American only; it will be asked to face 'partly in our midst and partly from overseas, but the volume of competition - remain the same. Since we have established', by bonus and otherwise, the shale moveindustry in this country, we shall not desert it merely because we pass this mittee. agreement. We shall encourage the - industry; we .never know may come when we shall have to fail Mr Hughes. back on shale oil, and we shall not .desert those men who have put their money and given their time to the establishment of the industry. Above all, we shall do to - everything we can to make ourselves independent of Anglo-Persian crude oil by finding of l on the continent of Australia or in our Territories.

215,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Wilmot) [4.13] During the debate on the Oil Agreement Bill, when the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) was speaking, the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) made an interjection which I apparently contradicted; though mine was not a direct contradiction, because, the Minister and I were looking at the matter from different points of view. The actual offer, by the Tasmanian Oil Company was £4 10s. a ton; hut, as the Minister explained afterwards, the company asked that the Government should continue the present bounty on oil. The honourable gentleman will remember that the company's offer was set aside by his Department. ' Certain figures and facts, however, were put before him, and he stated that he thought that the Naval Board ought to send to the company the terms of an offer which might be accepted. I should like the honourable gentleman to go into that matter again.",50
216,Mr SPEAKER,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,The honourable member may not now revive a debate which is closed.',50
217,Mr ATKINSON,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"What I desire is that the Minister for the Navy shall look into this matter again. As far hack as October last, he asked the Naval Board to Bend these terms to the company. I understand that something is. being done, but there has bean too much delay. I believe that the company is Teady to make an offer, to which the Department must give the most careful consideration, because it is very anxious 'to develop its property. Sir JOSEPH Coos - I shall look into the matter.",50
218,Mr KERBY,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Ballarat) [4.15] - Ac cording to the press, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) interjected yesterday, when I wished to ask a question without notice, that I was casting a reflection on St. Xavier's College. I had no intention of doing that, because I have the greatest admiration for that college. In another newspaper it is reported that certain members on the Opposition side of the chamber interjected that I was adopting low-down electioneering tactics. I have no intention of adopting their methods of electioneering. Mr .SPEAKER-The honourable member is now reflecting on certain honourable members, and I ask him not to do that.",50
219,Mr KERBY,WHEA T AN D WOOL POOL,"Then I withdraw what I said, and I should like them to withdraw their remarks of yesterday. Had I desired to pursue electioneering tactics I had a splendid opportunity last night, of which I did not avail myself. I asked my question because I think it of urgent public importance that disloyalists shall not he given a chance to instil their opinions into the minds of young Australians. .
