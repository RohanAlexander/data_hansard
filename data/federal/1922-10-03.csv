1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Sir Elliot Johnson) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers. PUBLIC ""WORKS COMMITTEE. AUTOMATIC TELEPHONE EXCHANGES.",13
2,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"On behalf of the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee, on Public Works, I present its report and minutes of evidence relating to the proposed establishment of automatic telephone exchanges at East Sydney, Randwick, Waverley, and Gordon. Ordered to be printed.",13
3,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I also present the report and minutes of evidence relating to the proposed establishment of an automatic telephone exchange at South Melbourne, and move That the paper be printed.",14
4,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Nepean) [11.8] Motions for the printing of reports and minutes of evidence are made so frequently that the duties of the Printing Committee seem to be almost entirely disregarded. I do not know how much of the document which has just been laid on the table is evidence, and what it will cost to print this evidence; but I think that proposals for the printing of papers should be referred to the Printing Committee.",14
5,Mr FEWTON,Unknown,This action is taken in accordance with an Act of Parliament.,14
6,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"In these cases, the reports of the Committee must be printed, of course; but there is a doubt in my mind as to the need for printing the minutes of evidence.",14
7,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Balaclava) [11.3] - I would suggest to the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Bowden) that the Printing Oommittee haB in its own hands a remedy for what be complains of. If the members of the Committee think that too much printing is being authorized, it can make a report on the subject to this House as to the need for restricting expenditure on printing. I would suggest that for the consideration of the Printing Committee.",14
8,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Maribyrnong) [11.4] I beliove that the motion under discussion is being moved in accordance with the requirements of the Publio Works Committee Act.,14
9,Mr WATT,Unknown,That is so.,14
10,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The Printing Committee is merely a Committee of this House, and it is questionable whether it could, in any case, override the Public Works Committee. The minutes of evidence relating to the inquiry upon which the Committee has reported are already in print, and the ordering of the printing amounts merely to the ordering of a few more copies for the convenience of honourable members generally. On occasions when reports have been presented without the minutes of evidence on which they were founded, honourable members have complained of being deprived of the opportunity to peruse that evidence, and, therefore, it is now customary to have the minutes of evidence printed. Tho honourable memb<v for Melbourne Ports, acting for the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, is simply performing a function which, under the Public Works Committee Aot, devolves upon him.",14
11,Mr COESEE,Unknown,Wide Bay) [11.5] - As Chairman of the Printing Committee I know that it is considered by the members of that Committee that if the House makes the order that a paper must be printed the Committee cannot interfere. An order for the printing of a paper ends all the matter so far as the Printing Committee is concerned.,14
12,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [11.6] - I would remind the House that the Publio Works Committee in the taking of evidence and the making of reports always pays due regard to considerations of economy; in fact, ib is the most parsimonious crowd that 1I have ever been associated with. Question resolved in the affirmative. ESSENTIAL OILS. DUTY ON SPIRITS.",14
13,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether he cannot make some arrangement for the reduction of the price of spirits used by the manufacturers of essences, such as essence of lemon, from Australian essential oils? Could it not be arranged that they should get the spirit they need at the same rate of Excise as is charged to the manufacturers of scents and other commodities which are not of so mucb importance to a community as essences?",14
14,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The matter has had a good deal of consideration, but I shall confer with the Governmenb Analyst regarding it, to see whether something cannot be done to cheapen the spirit used in the manufacturing referred to.",14
15,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,The essential oil industry will be crippled if it is not cheapened. LONG SITTINGS OF PARLIAMENT.,14
16,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"At the present time a fine propaganda in the interests of health is being undertaken, not only in Melbourne, but also throughout Victoria and. I believe, the other States, too. The leading men of the medical fraternity are urging the people that for the maintenance of their health they should follow sane habits in the matter of work, diet, and otber things. I should like to know from the Leader of the House, therefore, whether the Government intends to disregard the advice of the medical experts of Australia, and to overtax the physical and mental capacity of members of Parliament by requiring tbem to sit morning, noon, and night, leaving tbem in the end, perhaps, in a state of complete exhaustion ?",14
17,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"It would surely be impossible to overtax: the mental powers - of the members of this House;'while, as for physical capacity, one bas only to look at the honourable member to see that he needs no certincate of fitness. SITUATION INTHE NEAR EAST. sent",15
18,Mr WATT,Unknown,"Is the Acting-Leader the House in a position to inform honorEstimates. able members of the reliability of the information regarding the situation in the Near East which appears in this morning's press, and indicates that better ditions are developing in that critical area?",15
19,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"The latest informarecently tion I have is to the effect that the posiindustry ? tion is easier. All I can say at the moment is .that, if developments take place wbicb materially alter the situation for the worse, the House will be mediately informed. DEFENCE SUPERANNUATION.",15
20,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"In view of the dissatistion faction existing in the Defence Departthis ment of the Commonwealth because the uncertainty of the position of those men wbo have long and faithful records of service, can the Government give the House any definite assurance as to is to be proposed in regard to superannuation or pension benefits for tbem, and when something-will be done on their behalf?",15
21,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I have already told ment the House as definitely as I can the proposals of the Government. We intend to bring down as soon as practicable posals which will give men wbo have long-service records in the. Permanent Forces of the Commonwealth the benefits pension? of superannuation; but I have explained that, because of the peculiar circumknow. stances of their employment, it was found impracticable to link up these men directly with the scheme in the Bill wbicb has been before the House. The whole matter is the subject of investigation at the present moment, and we hope to devise shortly a scheme which will be fair to all concerned. The Government will 1 at the first opportunity submit its proposals to the House.",15
22,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Defence if men of the Permanent Forces submitted applications for discharge, in the event of no superannuation being provided for tbem, would they be granted compensation on the same lines as the compensation granted to those who went - out of the Service on the 30th June ?",15

24,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I ask the Minister for conTrade and Customs if he will be good enough to make available to honourable members copies of the telegrams he has received in regard to the sugar,15
25,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I bave received numerous telegrams recently from the imNorthern States in connection with the sugar question. Tbey refer, in particular, to a phase of it that has been committed to the Tariff Board for investigaand report. I do not think that at juncture it would be advisable for of me to place bgfore the House material that is in the hands of the Tariff Board.

Is it true that only one officer in the Defence Department is not receiving a war'",15
27,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,Unknown,"I do not War pensions are paid purely on the medical assessment of applicants' disabilities due to. or arising out of war service. No information is sought from pensioners as to their places of employment nor the amounts of earnings received by them, as these are not factors GEOOMin the assessing of the rates that shall be paid, and, therefore, no record is kept of the same.

31,Mr SPEAKER,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON," Before the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) resumes the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill , I have to say that the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) submitted an amendment to the motion, on which a point of order was raised, and a ruling was asked for . The ' proposed contains an instruction to the any Committee on the Bill which cannot be moved as an amendment to the motion for . the second reading.

34,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Cowper) [11.15]. - I should like to thank the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) for his kind and words of congratulation to me on my and escape from the perils of death during last week. I regret that I should bave Year ended Year ended escaped from one danger only apparently 31/12/20 31/12/21 to be comfronted with another deadly f £ peril owing to the fact that, as I was in 319 formed, the "" sword had been drawn from 9,258 its scabbard.""

I wish to protest against the consideration of this Bill during a morning sitting of the House at this stage of the session. If we are asked to work day and night we cannot expect to do our work efficiently. It is impossible for in conmembers to sit in the fetid atmosphere of this chamber from 11 o'clock in the morning to 11 o'clock at night without their minds becoming jaded, and rendered more or less unfitted for the work of legislation. The inevitable result must be the passage of ill-digested legislation that will do more harm than good. In moving the second reading of the Bill the Attorney-General (Mr Groom) referred to the consideration due to the members of the Public Service, and I may be allowed to say that I think they are entitled to a great deal more consideration than they are receiving, owing to the action of the Government in deciding to proceed with this measure in the dying hours of this Parliament. The Bill proposes practically to re-organize the whole of the Service, and certainly to make some very radical changes in the conditions under which it is to be carried on. At a time when the elections are approaching, and the minds of honourable members are disturbed, they are presented with a list of thirteen or fourteen Bills, many of which deal with matters of the most urgent importance. In the circumstances, it is impossible for honourable members to give them the consideration they require. The debate on this measure, which is of vital importance to the Public Service, was proceeded with yesterday, when the Minister in charge of it was not present toanswer the questions of honourable members who desired information. The Bill contains 113 clauses.",16
35,Mr MCWILI,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,IAMS - And there are to be ninety-five amendments proposed.,17
36,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I do not know the exact number of amendments that are to be proposed, but it was suggested in a statement made by the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) last night, that the Government had some intention of getting the Bill through today, and going on with the next business on the notice paper. The amendment of the Publio Service Act has been left in abeyance for something like six years. During that period we have carried on with an Acting Public Service Commissioner. No officer was appointed permanently to the position because it was felt that it was necessary to deal with the conditions of the Public Service in a comprehensive way. It is not fair to the Service, nor is it fair to the people, that we should be asked to consider this measure at such short notice. ""We aro not given time to digest its provisions, or to appreciate the amendments of the existing law which it proposes. If , because so little time was given for the consideration of the measure, its results, when passed, are found unsatisfactory, it will be difficult to suggest how many years must elapse before steps will be taken to pass a satisfactory law for the control of the Public Service. When the Government decided to proceed with a measure of so much importance, why did they not call Parliament together early in March, in order that the business might be conducted in a proper way, and it would not be necessary to rush legislation through in the closing hours of the session.",17
37,Mr GREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The honourable gentleman was in Java at the time he suggests that Parliament should have been called together.,17
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I would not have been there if arrangements had been made for the meeting of Parliament at that time. Parliament did not meet until the Supply voted last year had run out. We have done our best since the meeting of Parliament to deal with the measures submitted to us in the proper spirit. This is one of the most important Bills which Parliament could be called upon to consider. Ib deals not only with the re-organization of the various Commonwealth activities, but with their conduct generally. But I would like to see some definite provision in the Bill, calculated to prevent the present rate of increase in the number of public servants. The Bill should also make specific provision for improving the standard of our services right through. What is required is not quantity-not large numbers of men drawn from productive occupations-bu t a high quality of public officialdom thoroughly well capable of carrying out the most important functions of govern-' - ment. At present the Public Service is practically a dead-end occupation for about 80 per cent, of those who have entered it. This is singular, as compared with other avenues of employment, because of the fact that practically all entrants must pass a qualifying and competitive examination. The Public Service draws upon a very high average standard from among the youths of our schools. These have been attracted, in the main, by the fact that the initial rates of pay are comparatively good. But what is the position of vant after twenty, thirty, or forty years' service? Generally, as I have said, he is at a dead end. Men who would have been very much better employed in other activities are unable, after a few years, to change their occupations, because they have weighted themselves, probably, with family responsibilities, and are in a cul de sac. Honourable members should be afforded the fullest opportunities for discussing this measure in its every detail, and much more information should be made available to enable us properly to handle the whole subject. First, consideration should be given to the cause of the increase in our Public Services, both State and Federal. In the last twenty years, since the inauguration of Federation, there has been a total increase from 89,831 to 248,976. This represents something like 260 per cent. But the population, meanwhile, has grown to the extent of only 45 peicent - fro m 3,373,000, in fact, to 5,416,000. In the Federal Service alone the increase of permanent public servants, outside of such trading Departments as the Postmaster-General's Department-thos e especially under the control of the Public Service Commissioner - ha s been from 1,417 to 4,573, which represents an expansion of more than 300 per cent.",17
39,Mr LAIKD SMITH,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Do those figures include railway servants?,18
40,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"They are independent of them, altogether.",18
41,Mr GREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Do the honourable member's statistics take into consideration the various services which were taken over by the Federation from the States? instance, 3,500 employees came over to the Commonwealth in connection with the transfer of State activities alone.",18
42,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The present number of public servants, whose total I have just given, is exclusive of those who were taken over in that manner.",18
43,Mr GREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,That is not so. The honourable member's total is inclusive.,18
44,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I have drawn upon those servants under the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Works and Railways, and the Minister for Trade and Customs; and I have excluded those under the Postthe public ser- master-General.",18
45,Mr GREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"But the Department of Trade and Customs has taken over quite a number of services, which has entailed the transfer of 3,500 former State omcers. That factor makes a tremendous difference in the honourable member's comparisons.",18
46,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I have dealt with the employees of the Postmaster General quite separately. I repeat that the total number of State and Federal servants has increased in twenty years from almost 90,000 to just under 249,000.",18
47,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,-Probably ; the honourable member is including all those additional employees who have been required in connection with the tremendous expansion of State railway services.,18
48,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Tb e important fact is that the Public Service - has ex - ' panded to the extent of 260 per cent., wbile the population of the Commonwealth in twenty years bas increased only 45 per cent - that is to say, the increase in State and Federal services has been six times as rapid as is the total of our population. Salaries paid to public servants bave gone up from £11,733,000 to £55,000,000 in that same time, which represents an increase of 500 per cent. One among every twelve adults in Australia today is a public servant; and since the greater proportion of our publio servants consists of males, it would probably be correct to say that one out of every seven adult males in the Commonwealth is now a State or Federal servant. That .is an enormous percentage, and it indicates a most serious withdrawal of our manhood from the active ranks of For producers, and their utilization, in the main, in non-productive employments. What can be done to put a stop to further increase - in the same direction 1 What can we do to diminish the total ? If duplications were eliminated there would immediately be brought about a marked diminution of these non-productive public employees. To-day we see duplication in the Electoral, Taxation, and Health Services; duplication, also, in respect of our Agency Services, and in the matter of Commonwealth and State Police.",18
49,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,There are no Commonwealth Police.,18
50,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Tho y are disguised at present under some other name.,19
51,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"There are no Commonwealth Police even under disguise. I have said so over and over again, but the honourable member will repeat the statement.",19
52,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"We bave also duplication in respect of statistical work; and although Premiers' Conference after Conference has been called, having this matter of duplication upon its agenda, we are still no better off. Now and again some small alterations are brought about, but these have never represented anything material. The only effective method of alteration will be in tion of amendments of the Constitution, so that State and Commonwealth activities shall be more strictly defined. In this connection, by the way, the people were promised, both before and after the last Federal elections, that the Commonwealth Parliament would be given an opportunity to deal with the matter of Constitution amendments. Apparently, bowever, that promise is not to be honoured, because the Prime Minister made no mention of the subject when he placed before the House his list of business to be dealt with before the end of the session. There will never be any very marked decrease in Government expenditure until we have some means of proper supervision-as the honourable memher for Balaclava (Mr Watt) suggested-secure d by some method of reducing the unwieldy areas of our States. In those huge territories embraced in the larger States there is inevitable circumlocution, delay, and unwarranted cost in carrying on public concerns. In the smaller States-as Victoria and Tasmania-muc h less expenditure is incurred in removing public servants from one post to another. - With a uniform size of State, or the division of the Commonwealth into zones, approximately equal in size, it would be possible to make comparisons in standards of departmental efficiency in areas of something like the same size and population. At present we have such centres as Tweed Heads under administrative control from Sydney, though it is most difficult to get in touch with Sydney. Some of the Federal departmental beads have never been through the districts under their control, because of their inaccessibility and the fact that, though we are supposed to be a Federation, we are doing what Sir Robert Anderson pointed out in his report on the Postmaster-General's Department seven or eight years ago-controllin g areas as though we were a series of isolated States instead of a Federation. We axe keeping in existence for Federal administrative purposes the old. State boundaries, wben, for Commonwealth purposes, there is no need whatever to do so. Altogether the present system interferes materially with the attainment of high standards of administrative efficiency combined with economy.",19
53,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Does the honourable member think that more authority should the direc- be given to the deputies?,19
54,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"That is what I intend to suggest later, when we come to deal with the administrative clauses of the Bill, and that is what Mr MCLachlan urged in his report to the Government in 1920. Apparently we are not going to have an opportunity to deal with Constitutional amendments in a way that will enable us, in the immediate future, to make the necessary alterations in State boundaries, and make possible a comparison of standards of efficiency and economy in the Public Service administration of smaller areas. In the absence of any such change, the time has come, with the present strangling taxation on the people, for some self-denying ordinance to be imposed by all the Governments of Australia on themselves with regard to the appointment of additional members of the Public Service in connection with the ordinary business of government. It is impossible to prevent new appointments to such Departments as the Post Office and the railways, which are continually expanding, to meet the increasing requirements of the people, but in other ordinary administrative Departments there should b« no reason for the present steady increase in „the personnel of the Publio Service.  are baving representations<made to us by honourable members to haye the postal staff increased in different places. We find it very difficult to resist these requests.",19
55,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The Government should be strong enough to resist every request that is not fully justified by the circumstances. The important thing to remember is that we must in some way or otber reduce the cost of government, and lighten the taxation burdens of the community. If we wish to bring additional people to this country, we must hold out some inducement to tbem. We should be able to show them that if they do come here, the taxation levied upon them will be less than in'any other place, and that their opportunities bere will be greater than elsewhere. .In addition, it seems to me that we could effect some improvement aud secure increased efficiency in the service by the abolition, as far as possible, of the system of temporary employment. At present there are about 15,000 temporary employees in the various branches of our Public Service.",19
56,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The Bill contains provisions dealing with that matter.  member suggest that we should make all temporary employees permanent employees ?,20
57,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No ; but I think the Government would get a great deal more efficiency if they re-organized the Service, and, instead of having such a large number of temporary employees, made the employment of those absolutely essential to the work of the various Departments permanent, and therefore continuous. The Government might very well consider also the wisdom of increasing the hours of work in the Public Service to 5 o'clock in the afternoon, so as to bring them into conformity with the hours worked by employees in the Public Services of the various States. This suggestion was made by me last year, and I notice that it is also recommended by Mr. MCLachlan. Let me read what the Commissioner had to say on 'the subjectAs a general rule the hours of duty of officers engaged in clerical or professional work, and also those of many General Division officers, are from 9 a.m. to 4.'30 p.m.; with three-quarters of an hour interval for the midday meal. In two States these officers are allowed a meal interval of an hour, and remain on duty until 4.45 p.m. The actual working hours of these officers are six and three-quarter hours a day, Monday to Friday, and three hour's on Saturday, or a total of 36} hours in a week. In four of the six States the practice in the public Departments controlled by the States Governments is to employ clerical staffs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Monday to Friday in each week, and from 9 a.m. to 12 noon on Saturday. Reasonable warrant exists for amending the present arrangement, and providing that the ordinary working hours for such classes of officers in the Commonwealth Service shall in future be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with an allowance at one hour instead of three-quarters of an hour for a meal, and that on Saturdays the hours should be from 9 a.m. to 12 noon. The present provision as to meal interval is more honoured in the breach than the observance, as many officers actually take a full hour instead of the three-quarters prescribed, and the actual effect of the suggested alteration would he to obtain from such officers half-anhour's daily extra service. It is recommended that in any amendment of Public Service regulations, following upon the passage of new legislation, the question of revision of hours of duty on the lines indicated should be gives consideration. As the Minister has stated that he has en'deavoured to follow the ex-Commissioner's recommendations in the main, I trust he will not neglect this phase of Public Service administration, which is so definitely commented upon by Mr MCLachlan. The proposed change would involve no hardship on anybody^ and probably it would do away with any necessity to reduce salaries as deflation progresses. I bave not yet been able to satisfy myself as to the exact purpose of the Board of Commissioners-whethe r the functions of that body are to be executive or not. I did not have the opportunity of hearing the Minister's second-reading speech, but I have read his remarks, and I am not at all clear on this point. Will the Board simply replace the Public Service Commissioner in every respect, and will it also be a Board of Management, as was suggested by the Economies Commission, and, in addition, be charged with outside supervision? I think the House ; s entitled 'to some explanation as to why the Government departed so definitely from the recommendation of the exPublic Service Commissioner.",20
58,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Does not the honourable member think that one man will be better than three Commissioners?,20
59,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Yes ; Mr. MCLachlan in his report dealt - with that matter very fully.,20
60,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Mr MCLachlan did not deal with the need for securing economy and efficiency as the Economies Commission did.,20
61,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Hi s suggestion was to effect economy through a system of accountancy rather than by a Board of Management. His remarks ou that 'subject are worth putting on record. saidIn my opinion there are strong reasons against alteration of the present system of management of the Commonwealth Public Service. Control by a Board of three members necessarily involves a more cumbrous procedure than by a single Commissioner, and consequent delays in settlement of questions of administration. In addition, the important factor of direct and personal responsibility would be sacrificed by the appointment oif a Board. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the 'Commonwealth Service differ very materially from thOBC of a State Public - Service, seeing that the former service is spread over all the States forming the Commonwealth, necessitating the location of a Public bervice Inspector in each State, exercising delegated powers of the Commissioner. In providing for the future administration of the Public Service Act. it would be disadvantageous to establish a Public Service Board, with the consequent inelasticity of control and the diminution of personal responsibility, 'ine existing system of management by one Commissioner will undoubtedly better meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Public Service, provided that the .necessary assistance is given him to carry out the duties and extended functions to be conferred upon him. lie pointed out exactly what he had done is Public Service Commissioner, and then . MI t will be of obvious advantage to - the Commissioner to have the assistance of a professional expert in a particular section of 'the work of a department. At present, the Commissioner is at a disadvantage in combating the views of officers whose interests may lie in the continuance of existing methods and whose professional knowledge of the subject might carry weight when expressed in opposition to the views of a layman. In regard to the tenure of office, he saidUnder the provisions of the Public Servico Act of 1902, the tenure of office of the Commissioner and Inspectors is limited to a period of seven yeara, and power is given to re-appoint these officers for a further term or terms. It is difficult to understand the reason for such a condition of tenure when it is remembered that no statutory limitation is imposed in the case of the Judges of the High Court or of the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth. 'While it is questionable whether any - advantage accrues vfrom -.the existing provisions >of 'the .Act, J am convinced that serious disadvantage /results from .the fact .that .experienced .officers of .the Federal and 'State Services, or - men of high standing outside ""the'service, will 'hesitate 'to accept appointments involving <a Mhriiteu tenure. It is within my recollection .that in 1902 a prominent.omcer.of the Post .Office Service withdrew his application for-- appointment as Public Service Inspector because of the condition imposed by the Act as to a seven years' [120] tenure. The limitation of the period of appointment is particularly unwise from the stand-point of independent administration, and He although my own experience in this respect when holding office as Commissioner was satisfactory, and such as to give 'no cause for complaint, it may readily he - understood that the possibility of non-renewal of appointment is likely to - affect the independence of a Commissioner or Inspector, and to prove detrimental to the public interests. The Royal Commission on the Victorian State Public Service, reporting on this subject last year, stated:""'The Commissioner sliould in our opinion have real power and should be really independent. Nominally he is independent, .but as he cannot be appointed for more than seven years at a time it will be seen that he is not really independent. He cannot help feeling that if he does not endeavour to please the powers that be, he may not get a renewal of his position when his term expires. And he should be paid a salary befitting his important office. There is no good reason, so far as wo can see, why he should net be appointed to hold office during good behaviour, as the Auditor-General is. Of course, we do not suggest that the administration of the present Commissioner or any of his predecessors has been influenced in the slightest degree by their insecurity of tenure, but 'we feel that the office should be placed in such a position of strength that there would be absolutely no colour for the suggestion that in some particular case or cases the Commissioner's action was not altogether disinterested."" In the report of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service of Great Britain (1914), it is pointed out that the members of the Civil Service Commission (two in number) hold their appointments direct from the Crown, and that like other members of the permanent Civil Service, these omcers hold office during .His Majesty's pleasure, this meaning in practice until they are retired owing to age or invalidity. About 1918 or 1919 the Government of New South Wale3 appointed Mr G. M . Allard a Royal Commissioner to repert upon the Public Service of that State, and he reported as follows in regard to the tenure of office of the members of the Public Service BoardThe present limited tenure makes it possible for periodical pressure to be applied to the - members .of ithe Board, 'especially when the - term .of office .is approaching completion. .1 consider it imperative that the tenure of office should be such as to make the Board indetpendentiin spirit as-well, as in.letter, - and that, - subject.to removal .by,a vote of both-Houses of iRar.liament, the tenure of office should be from the date of appointment until the date upon which each Commissioner shall attain the age of sixty-five years. In the face of such unanimous testimony it is strange that the Minister sbould bring down a Bill under which the maximum period of appointment will be five years. If the Government are determined to proceed with the appointment of a Board of Management we shall not get applications for appointment from men of wide outside business experience if they know that in four years' time their appointment will be jeopardized if some act of theirs has rendered the Administration of the day hostile to them. If a singlo Commissioner is to be appointed, the length of tenure should be materially lengthened, even if it be not made continuous during good behaviour, so that he Bhall be independent of political pressure. It is hopeless to attempt to reorganize wholeService if we are unable to secure the services of the best men available. Wc bave already had experience of appointments that were' unsatisfactory, largely because the salaries and conditions ofappointment were not such as to attract men of the right stamp for the work to be done. We cannot expect a manager of a big business firm to sever his present sociations and accept an appointment under the Government for a limited number of years with the possibility that, at the end of that term, he may be compelledto go back to private employment, only to find the old avenue closed to bim.",20
62,Mr MCWILUAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Hav e we not had some experience of the placing of absolute control in the hands of Boards?,22
63,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Any Board appointed would require to be subject control by Parliament, but I personally believe in the appointment of a single Commissioner.  able member was suggesting that the Commissioner should be free from politiup cal control.",22
64,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The Commisinclined sioner should be independent in his look, but he must be subject to the control of Parliament. Only in the event of a very severe dereliction of duty on his would Parliament take action against him.",22
65,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The honourable meinber utterly opposed to the recommendation the Economies Commission in favour of the appointment of a Board of Manageu'enr ment?,22
66,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No ; but I .he'ii.selves would nrcfer the appointment of a' Commissioner with very highly paid inspectors in each State. Most of all, I should like the Commonwealth to be cut into smaller areas and placed under the control of inspectors, who would bo able to adequately acquaint themselves personally with the conditions throughout their province of control. Such familiarity as the inspector would thus get in handling smaller areas, would tend to increase efficiency. I am also in favour of throwing responsibility upon the heads of the Public Service in each State, giving them very much wider powers than at present, and decentralizing to a greater degree their control in the the various Departments. It seems absurd that an officer should one day be a Deputy Poatmaster-Gcneral, and only able to spend a limited amount, wbile the next week, by accident of time, he might, as secretary to the whole Department, be called upon to deal with millions.",22
67,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"There is a constant appeal on behalf of men who cannot get as- all they want. They go to the Postmaster General and ask for it. Hundreds of such cases arise, and very often honourable members are parties to the practice; in fact, honourable members are the biggest offenders.",22
68,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,That is no reason why we should not appoint strong men to hold these positions.,22
69,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"When the man is strong, to it makes the member all the more insistent to obtain the ear of the M'nister.",22
70,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Our actions should be guided not by expedienay, but If my suggestion were adopted, we should have men standing to their responsibilities much better than they do now. They would be more to take independent views as to outwhat they regarded as necessary in the public interests, rather than having to subordinate their opinions for otber reapart ons. If that system were adopted, not only with regard to the inspectors in charge of districts, but right down is through the Departments, and a better of system of devolut'on of responsibility were evolved, there would be a more effiService. It is ridiculous that postmasters, in quite big towns, should find in such helpless positions as h >v are with regard to the amount of money they can expend on very urgent matters.",22
71,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"You are an advocate of reform, but if we gave too great a power of expenditure to postmasters all over Australia the postal bill would mount up very rapidly.",23
72,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"There ; could be supervision by a proper system of checks and auditing, and there is no reason why there should be the vexatious delays now experienced. I sball mention a case that has come under my notice in connection with a State Department, and the same thing is practically true of the Federal sphere. In a northern town the chairman of the Land Board receives about £750 per annum. He examines the whole of the applicants for lands; but ho has no right to spend any sum of public money above £1 without reference to his superior omcers in Sydney. The counter accommodation in the office of the Board is not the best that could be provided, aud an agent suggested that if the counter were cut into two, and made L shaped, instead of being straight, it would afford greater convenience to the public. The officer endorsed this alteration. An architect was obtained from Lismore to examine the counter, and altogether about £30 was spent in preliminary expenses prior to accepting a tender for 30s. for the necessary alteration. Such things nre constantly happening.",23
73,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,I do not think that would occur in a Federal Department.,23
74,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I shall now give an instance in the Federal sphere. Two and a-half years ago I secured from the Postmaster-General a promise that tenders would be called for the erection of a post-office at Wingham. After a long lapse of time tenders were called. Then suggestions were made for alterations to the building, involv ng an expenditure of something like £25 or £30, in order to provide greater convenience for the public. Owing to the system that obtains in the Federal Departments concerned, the whole scheme was delayed for about nine months to get proper official sanction at the source, and only now is the building being commenced. I went to three or four Departments in endeavouring to push the work ahead, and I was assured on every hand that, if there had been greater power to deal with the matter locally, it would have been attended to eighteen months ago. During the whole of that time the people have been inconvenienced, and no money has been saved.",23
75,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Do you suggest that local postmasters should have the right to deal with tenders? ',23
76,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No ; but I think the local inspector who controls a district that is about twice as large as Tasmania, and has about the same population, sbould be able to deal with a matter of that kind. If it is not possible for men in receipt of large salaries to do such work, it is time we had a better system. Although at the beginning of an officer's career the Public Service is moderately attractive as regards salary, compared with private employment, we find that at a certain stage officers come to a dead end. The number of civil servants receiving £600 a year is lamentably small, and we lose the services of the best men. Those officers who are tied up with family responsibilities probably remain in the Service; but we ought to be able to retain the services of the most capable men. We have been more fortunate than we deserve up to the present in the heads of our Departments, as many came over from the States, by reason of the fact that the Commonwealth Service should be, as it was expected to be, more attractive than State Government employment. This Bill does not deal with the grading of the Service at all. It simply alters the number of divisions from five to four, and these divisions practically include the whole of the officers. In each division there are various grades, and, if the present system were made somewhat more clastic, a considerable sum could be saved every year in the matter of removals of officers.",23
77,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The Bill is drafted to pro: vide that elasticity.,23
78,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I have known officers to be transferred to positions 500 or 600 miles away, and the whole of their removal expenses had to be borne by the public, simply by reason of the fact that for a time they were in a grade that was unable to give them the rate of salary they were looked upon as entitled to receive. In a short time the officer would rise to the higher salary, and another transfer would take place. He would probably be shifted back to the starting point, and his removal expenses, of course, would again be paid by the Government. goes on to sayIn one town alone there must have been £500 or £600 wasted in that way inside attack of two years. I remember the case in of an officer who for about eighteen to months, carried out with the greatest Professional satisfaction the duties of a local postcorresponding master who had become ill , and in the end he was sent to a position some 600 and automatic. miles away, because he was about £10 tions too low in the salary his grade entitled him to, fo still hold the position. maximum salary, of the class. I should like some explanation from the Minister in reference to increments, tration which, as I gather from the Bill, will be extract statutory and automatic. Though I am quite prepared to allow that public vants whose work entitles them to continuous increments shall receive them, important there are many instances in which, if these men were in private employment, is their work would not be considered worthy of the increased salaries. There ought, I think, to be some discretion exercised in the matter.",23
79,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,To whom would you give the discretion?,24
80,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"It should be in special the hands of the Commissioner or the probeen posed Board, and if competent men are oflicer : appointed to control the Service there should be no difficulty. Of course, conis ditions have been altered under the preattends sent arbitration system; but, quite apart from that, there ought to be some In elasticity provided for when increments are considered. Mr MCLachlan in his administer report saysIn this provision of the Act for sub-divisional promotion of officers in the fourth, and higher elasses lies one of the most' difficult and troublesome problems confronting the Commisdealt sioner. Ihe matter is complicated by the disber similar nature of duties in the several Departmore ments, and by the divergent views held by permanent heads, chief officers,, and heads branches, not only as to their obligations to the Commonwealth in making recommendations for public expenditure, but also as importance and value of oflicers' duties. Notwithstanding the varying sonal idiosyncrasies of chief officers; it has been the aim of the Commissioner and Inspectors to secure uniformity of treatment and of valuation of work, and in carrying this policy the recommendations of chief officers have frequently had to be departed from, either in the direction of advancing officers who have been passed over or in approving of advancement which has been commended by chief officers. As a result of that, there is a certain amount of discontent. Mr MCLachlan These have been used as a basis of a general on the system of advancement of officers the higher classes of the Public Service, andsuch effect' that, in the recent award of the Arbitration Court relating to officers of the Division, increments to officers of classes to those of the Clerical Division have been made practically annual There are many posiwhich must necessarily be classified in a particular class as being worth the minimum salary, although not worth the The object aimed at in the Commissioner's adminishas been to grant an appropriate rate of salary, and in this connection the following from the report presented in 1917 by the Royal Commission on the State Public serService of Victoria is of interest:""The neglect to give proper effect to an provision of the law enacted for the first time in the Act of 1883, which enabled salaries to be fixed at a limit within a class, another instance of faulty administration. When the Act referred to was passed: Parliament very properly recognised that the duties of a particular officer' might not be worti. anything like the maximum salary of his class, and therefore gave power to fix a limit in that case below the maximum. But, except in a few cases-and it is hard to say why these particular cases have been singled out for treatment-the will of Parliament has set aside. Let us take an example. An in the 4th class-minimum ' salary. £21fi, maximum-£336-ma y be engaged in work that not worth more than £250 per annum at the outeide; yet, so-long as-he behaves himself and to his duties, he gets, regular increments until he reaches the maximum of £336. all the different classes the position is similar. We are satisfied that the neglect to the provision under notice in accordance with the intention of the framers of the law has greatly increased the cost of administration. Instead of fixing salaries as has been done in a few cases only, the great majority should, in oiir opinion, have-been so with, as the duties of a very large numof the positions in the various classes are or lessroutine. No commercial institution run on - business lines* would dream of of paying its servants'as the State does.""",24
81,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,You would prevent a to the man getting his increment'by keeping him at work that is not worth more than his views and perpresent salary?,24
82,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I should like to his see encouragement given to men who do out their work well and' conscientiously.

What steps are being taken, tolessen the necessity for the employment of so many temporary men?

91,Mr WISE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Gippsland) [12.10] - It is to be regretted that this measure should be introduced so late in the session, and that honourable members should have sucb limited time in which to discuss many of the important provisions it contains. It is not my intention to deal in detail with its numerous clauses, but to refer particularly to the proposed Board, which amounts to the appointment of three men to do the work of one. The reasons given for the appointment of the proposed Board is that it has been recommended by the EconomiesCommission; but it must beadmitted that, although that body was appointed ' to advise the Government as to the direction in which economies could be effected in the Public Service, they suggested the appointment of quite a number of Boards, and their report contained the most extraordinary recommendations. There was, in the first place, the suggestion that a business Board should be appointed in connection with the Defence Department and a I similar Board for the Department of the Navy, and also a Board in connection with the Post and Telegraph Department, which employs by far the largest number of public servants. In addition, they proposed, to-have a Board of. Management for the Public Service, and when the matter was first mentioned there was ah outcry against the appointment of such a Board in addition to the Public Service Commission. The Government have evidently decided to dispense with, the Commissioner, and to make the Board of Management carry out his duties as well whichreally means that three men will be called upon to-do the work, which has been efficiently carried out by one man. It is also going to lead to the creation of another big staff. The Economies Commission, in their report on the business management of Eederal Government - Departments, s/iid'14. The organizationof the Public ServiceCommissioner's Department consists of the Public Service Commissioner and his staff in Melbourne, none od whom carry out any inefficient specting worlcs in the various Departments. 15. Then in every State there is a Service Inspector, who does inspection Departments-limite d by his' physical capacity; each Public Service Inspector has office staff which docs no inspecting. 16. There is, therefore, one officer in State to do inspecting work, and.'as in most of the States there are many thousands of Federal Government servants, it will be obsafeguards vious that even if the Public Service Inspecthat tors were all their time doing inspecting - whic h is not the case- a large part of the staff must each year go uninspected, for the reason that it is a nhysieal impossibility one man to inspect them. That is the real fault. Wo should have more than one inspector in each State. The Commission suggest a Board of independent Management of three members to do the and work in all States. The report conor tinues25. The duty of measuring economical and efficient working of a Department as a whole in a systematic, comprehenBoard sive, and continuous manner should be persisting formed by the Permanent Hoad of that Departshould ment, and should be his most important duty. Yet a little further on they say28. In some Departments, such as the Law Department, Quarantine, Lighthouses, Science and Research. Home and Territories, Treasury, Audit, Wireless, and Navy, it is not possible for the Permanent Head of the Department to compare the economical working in the above manner. Although, as I pointed out, they have just stated it was his duty to do it. The report goes onThe most suitable method of securing economical working is by the exhaustive inspection of each office or section by Inspectors with the experience and mentality necessary to enable t.hem to satisfactorily criticise and make helpful, constructive suggestions in regard to the staff employed and work performed. 29. In Departments such aa the Works Department, the Naval Construction Branch, the Ship Construction Branch, and the Engineering Branch of the Postmaster-General's Department, the economical performance of work can best be measured by a satisfactory and detailed system of costing. The costs of work performed should be closely scrutinized by t.Ii"" head of the Department; this duty' should not be delegated to subordinate officers. First of all, they say that the checking should be done by the permanent head, and then immediately point out the number of Departments in which he cannot do it; and then they say that the proper way is to secure the services of qualified inspectors. They then go on to say that the -.vo""k can only be carried out by an ilr. Wise. system of costing, which should Public be checked by ihe departmental head. work in The report continues33. The Commission, whilst recognising that an the public nnd Parliament rightly demand that there shall be unimpaired Ministerial each responsibility for all matters of policy and the avoidance of the evils of bureaucracy, also recognises that the public rightly demands that shall be set up which will insure all coses of unnecessary or indiscreet exwork penditure or costly working by whomsoever authorized, and notwithstanding who is responsible, will be brought under the notice of Parfor liament and the public. 34. It seems to us that the duty of maintaining such safeguards upon the economical and cllicicnt working of the Departments should be performed by some authority quite of the Departments themselves, as free from the possibility of its powers of healthy criticism being in any way impaired intimidated, aa the Auditor-General is in regard to his check upon the accurate and and checking the honest accounting. 35. This duty should bo performed by n of Management for Public Services, conof three persons, whose appointment be for a term of years, and whoso retirement should be on the principle of rotation to insure continuity of policy, and with eligibility of rc-appointmcnt. 38. Upon any indication of costly worsing. it should be immediately investigated by inspection by qualified officers for the purpose of ascertaining whether the high costs arc due to unavoidable causes or to extravagance. 40. It is necessary that tliere shall bo attached to the staff of the Board of Management a small staff of technical officers expert in different classes of work. These officers should not only be utilized continuously for investigating the economical efficiency of tlit work in which they are expert in the various Departments of the different States, but should bs utilized for the purpose of advising tlio Board in regard to the rates of pay and efficiency of officers of the Public Service in the technical grades, as it is impossible under the existing system for this work to be otber than a pretence. 41. Attached to the staff of the Hoard of Management thero should be a small staff of officers expert in the science of modern office systems and appliances. This staff should be utilized for the purpose of overhauling the office work of every Department periodically in order to insure(i) That the office organization and the methods followed aro efficient; (ii) That advantage is being taken of all modern methods and appliances which would secure more economical and efficient results: (iii) That the work performed justifies the number of staff employed and the remuneration paid to that staff; (iv) That the work performed is necessary, and is utilized for some useful purpose. Why should these three men be appointed when the Commission say that experts are i*equnred to do the work? What is the use of saying that inspectors must go through the Departments and do what they previously said should be done by the permanent head ? The Commissioners further report51. ' A Board of Management constituted in the. manner we have suggested would continuously perform the duties that this Commission had been appointed to perform in a spasmodic manner, and should also be used by the Treasury Department to assist in the annual scrutiny of the Estimates of Departments beforo submission to Parliament, and otherwise act in conjunction with the Treasury Department in investigating, not only general questions affecting the Public Service at largo, but also specific matters on which expenditure is proposed. 52. It should also be the duty of the Board of Management to assess salaries on the basis of a fair deal to all concerned, instead of the haphazard, unfair, and non-uniform system uxisting at present. All that has been done previously by inspectors, and the real trouble is not due to having one Commissioner, but to the fact that there are not sufficient qualified inspectors. If we had qualified inspectors with a thorough knowledge of modern methods, we would achieve all we require under the present system and the appointment of a Board of three would be obviated. It is also suggested that the Board should consist of a member with outside business experience, but those appointed to the Board from inside the Service would soon prove to the other member that business methods employed outside could not be applied to Government Departments.",25
92,Mr JOWETT,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Why not?,27
93,Mr WISE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has not, apparently, had much to do with the administration of Government Departments or be would not ask such a question. The Government sbould appoint only one Commissioner, because when the Service was under the control of Mr MCLachlan tihe work was very satisfactorily pelforrned, and if complaints bave recently arisen it is becauso the chief officer!"" in Public Service Commissioner's office have been only acting. We have had an acting Commissioner, an acting Secretary, and an acting Chief Inspector. Ministers have been perfectly aware of the position for tonio time past, but have experience! considerable difficulty in dealing with the situation; because they contemplated acting on the advice given by the Economies Commission upon this point, and could not, therefore, make any permanent appointments. I think the situation can be met quite well' by having a thoroughly qualified Commissioner and thoroughly expert inspectors, intrusted with greater power than they now have. That system should give us exactly what the Government hope to secure by appointing a Board of Management, as recommended by the Economies Commission. The Board must spend most of its time in Melbourne. It cannot journey all over the Commonwealth. It will probably adopt the procedure of sending a. Commissioner to one State, and another Commissioner to a second State; and when a Commissioner returns to Melbourne with his report, the Board must swallow it, otherwise the Commissioner will gay, "" Why are you making a fool of me by sending me away to furnish you with a report ? "" When' a Board of three Public Service Commissioners was first appointed in the State of Victoria, they adopted this method of classifying the Public Service. One Commissioner visited one locality, and a second Commissioner visited another. I have a distinct recollection of the way in which one oflicer was classified. The Commissioner had visited Bairnsdale, and was on his return to Melbourne. It was his duty to classify the office of Receiver and Paymaster at Sale, but, as it did not suit his convenience to stay overnight at Sale and catch the train to Melbourne on the following day, he telegraphed to the officer who was filling the ^position, and asked him to meet the train. During the twenty minutes' train stop at Sale, among the crowd on the platform, the interview took place, and the Commissioner classified the office on that conversation, without seeing the work which was being done by this mau, who was in my opinion, one of the finest officers in the Victorian State Service. The contemptible way in which the position was classified rankled sorely in that the officer's breast for the rest of his life, If we appoint three Commonwealth Commissioners, they'must not absent themselves from Melbourne at the one time, otherwise the general administrative work of the Department will be neglected. Their policy, tlierefore, - will be to send one missioner to one locality, .and a second ^another. It is a system which must lead to delay and trouble. ITI my opinion, the only proper method of controlling our Public Service is to have one Commisestablishments sioner. After experimenting with three businesses - Commissioners, the State of Victoria came down to one, and with the expartments perience of various States before the Commonwealth 'Government in the early days of Federation deliberately set out by having - one Commissioner. As a matter of fact, no Commonwealth - Government saw fit to alter that system until the report of the Economies Comsimply mission was submitted, embracing a recommendation that a Board of Management should be appointed to control the Public Service. The suggested Board will do more work than one Commissioner has shown that he can do. As a matter of fact, the Economies Commission admit that the practical work can only be done by the appointment of qualified experts and competent oflicers and inspechave tors. Is there any need for such men report to three Commissioners, when report to one man should be sufficient? The appointment of a Board of CommisCommissioner's sioners will necessitate the creation of new Department, with two or three techof nical staffs and additional inspectors. Why cannot we keep the Department we have already? Let us 'appoint a permaDeputy-Coinmissioners' ment Commissioner and a sufficient per of qualified inspectors. I would not have have one inspector only for each State. The system of having too few..inspectors each State is already leading to trouble more than one Commonwealth Departand ment, particularly in the Post Oflice. fact, when I was Postmaster-General, found fault with the wide districts - which inspectors were given to control with the idea of effecting economy. I found that a man could not - get over a big trict properly. He was obliged to spend most of his 'time in travelling. To secure 'expert 'supervision, the size - man is called upon to inspect shoula be --reasonable, and iff *we - are to - have ""Public .Service 'thoroughly inspected, the - inspectors"" districts must be limited in area, and we must appoint a sufficient number of competent men in each State. of good men in it. But to get competent men, we must pay decent salaries. If this Parliament is secure a satisfactory Service, it can Mr Wise.

The honourable member for Gippsland' (Mr Wise) has imparted to this .House some very interesting information. The information is certainly available to all' honourable members, but to. be reminded of thei circumstances is. most beneficial'. Itshould be patent to honourable memthat the Government,- in sheddingits"" responsibilityandi placing its mantle, of."" exagpower on Commissioners andBoards, if constituted! on the lines proi n tihe Bill , is* departing from the It seems that the Government, recognising that it is overwhelmed with sins of omission and commission, for which we hope it will shortly be required to answer to the people of this country, seeks as far as possible to be relieved of the responsibility that should rightfully belong to it . We ought to realise that we get no further by delegating our powers to another body that is responsible, practically, to no o?ie. The Bill proposes to establish a Board of three Commissioners. In the form in which the Board is proposed to be constituted it certainly does not meet with .my approval, and wilL not have my support. I hope the House will give a very clear and distinct indication to the Government of. its views, and will declare that it will not consent to the building up of a useless form of oversight of the Public Service that will only lead to further dissatisfaction, and will not give us that form of efficiency that we have a right to expect from this measure.",29
106,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,It will build up one of the biggest and most costly Departments in the Service.,30
107,Mr MAKIN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I am satisfied that if it is allowed to pass in its present form it will create a bureaucracy. We cannot tolerate, or allow to be tolerated, circumstances which will, lead to the establishment of anything of that description. I hope the House will see that we do not add to the overhead charges and make the Service top-heavy. If the House is determined to stand by the provision for the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners, then I think that the Board should be so constituted that employees in the Service will bave a voice in the determination of the methods by which they are to be controlled. The general tendency on the part of large industrial concerns is to give the employees some voice in their control and management. The adoption of that course has been attended with a great measure of advantage to both employers and employees. In Great Britain the Public Service is now administered by a series of councils, consisting of direct representatives of the employees and the Government. In that way considerable dissatisfaction has been eliminated from the Service. If a representative of our public servants can be trusted with the responsibility attaching to membership of the Board of Appeal, as well as to membership of the Classification Appeal Board, surely a member of the Service should be worthy of appointment to the Board of Commissioners. On behalf of the united organizations - of the Commonwealth Service, I make the suggestion that the Government should provide in the Bill that one of the persons appointed to the Board of Management shall be nominated by the Commonwealth Public Service organizations. I understand that the High Council of the Public Service organizations is prepared to submit to the Minister a list of persons, the appointment of any one of whom would be satisfactory to them as being truly representative of the employees in the Service. The Bill discriminates in a way that is not desirable, since it has one set of provisions governing the permanent heads or chief officer staff, and quite another relating to those lower down in the Service. This discrimination relates more particularly to appeals and to grievances that employees of the Commonwealth may have in regard to promotions and increments. Thoso lower down in the Service are not afforded the same opportunities to have these matters dealt with as are the permanent heads and the higher officials. So far as questions in regard to appeals, promotions, and increments aro concerned, all should be on an equal footing. Any attempt to discriminate would croato dissatisfaction, and would certainly bo unworthy of a Democracy. Then again the Board of Commissioners may give important decisions affecting large bodies of the Public Service.",30
108,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,They certainly. will do so.,30
109,Mr MAKIN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The Board of Commissioners will not only have to deal with individual eases, but to give decisions of a far-reaching character. There is no reason why the right, given by this Bill to a permanent head, or chief officer, to request that a recommendation made by an individual member of the Board under clause 15 shall be referred to the full Board, should"" not also extend to organizations representing the whole of the officers engaged in the work to which such a recommendation relates. As the Bill stands, this right is given to a permanent head or chief oflicer, but is withheld from those who arc lower in the Service, and who might be equally nftccied. I ask for an amendment extending the clause in the way I have indicated.",30
110,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The Bill provides for appeals. ° Mr MAKIN"" - I am referring now to clause 15. We say that the word "" or "" in sub-clause 3, line 27, of that clause should be deleted, and that after the word "" officer """,31
111,Mr SPEAKER,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON, The honourable member is not entitled to deal in detail with that matter at this stage.,31
112,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The honourable member might state in a general way what is desired.,31
113,Mr MAKIN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"We desire that the right given to a permanent head or chief officer to request that a decision shall be referred to the full Board shall also be given to the Public Service organizations, which include the following:The Commonwealth Public Service Clerical Association, the * Postmasters Association, the Australian Telegraphists Union, the Federated Assistants Association, the Australian Letter Carriers Assotion, the Postal Sorters Union, the Post and Telegraph Association, the Postal AssistantsAssociation, the General D ivision Telephone Officers Association, the Postal Linemen's Union, the General Division Officers Union (Trade and Customs Department), the Commonwealth Artisans Association, the Line Inspectors Association, and the Postal Electricians Union. It is desirable that the High Council, of these organizations, which is the custodian of the welfare of the public servants, should be represented on appeals from the decisions of the Board of Commissioners. Under the Bill as it stands, an officer appealing against a decision of the Board in respect of his classicommendation fication has merely the rigbt to submit his case for the reconsideration of the Board. I do not think that it would satisfy any of us to be told that we had the right to appeal to an authority that had already judged our case. We should not feel confident that any measure of success would attend such an appeal. The Board is to consider the appeal, so called, with a representative of the permanent head and of the organization. Thus an officer would have to appeal to a body consisting of five persons, four of whom had already taken an active part in regard to the classification against which he was appealing. In such circumstances there would be little hope of securing favourable consideration for an appeal against the decision of the Board.",31
114,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,It is an appeal from CfBsar to Csasar.,31
115,Mr MAKIN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Quite so. Under the existing Act the provision for appeals against promotion is infinitely more just than the system provided .in the Bill for appeals in regard to classification. Section 50 of the Act gives an officer the right to appeal to a special Board where action has been taken to his prejudice. It is strongly urged by the public servants that classification is a matter as important to them as the fixing of remuneration, because it vitally affects the careers of those in the Service. They think that an officer who is dissatisfied with his classification should have the right to submit his case to an independent Appeal Board; and I think the House will recognise the merit of this claim to have classification appeals considered by a tribunal which will bo distinctly impartial and independent.",31
116,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,So is the Board of Commissioners.,31
117,Mr MAKIN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I am referring to appeals against decisions given by the Board and affecting classification. If the classification of an officer docs not give satisfaction to him, he has merely the right to appeal to the body responsible for that classification; but in the Act provision is made for appeals to a special Board, differing in personnel from that which arrived at the decision appealed from. The Bill makes the granting of increments to officers dependent on the recommendation of the permanent heads. This remay be withheld if a permanent head thinks that there has been dereliction of duty, or that the officer's conduct, diligence, or ability is not satisfactory. The withholding of an increment from an officer seriously interferes with his advancement, and, in addition to affecting his seniority, amounts to the infliction upon him of an annual fine. It is only fair, therefore, that he should have an opportunity to rebut any charge laid against him by the head of his Department. The effect of stopping an officer's increment might be equivalent to fining him £20 a year. The right to interthoroughness fere so seriously with an officer's condimands. tions and prospects should not be given to a permanent head without the estabsible lishment of an independent tribunal to opportunity to gauge. determine, on appeal, whether the action taken was justified. Justice demands the establishment of Appeal Boards to which officers can appeal who think the withholding of increments is due to the vindictiveness, misunderstanding, or mistakes of a permanent head. various Anv officer who might think himself aggrieved by the withholding of an increcases ment .should have the right to state case to an independent Board. There are men who lose their heads when put in positions of responsibility, becoming absolutely autocratic towards their subordinates.",31
118,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Authorit y intoxiand cates some persons, it is said. Mr MAKIN"" - Many of us have been subjected to indignity and embarrassment 'by the high-handed conduct of certain years. publio officers, and we can estimate, by own experience, the treatment to which the subordinates of those officers would subjected. I hope that the Government will so amend the Bill that officers be given an opportunity for appealing an independent tribunal against what they may deem autocratic conduct on the part of heads of Departments; and that they will be given just representation Boards whose decisions affect, not only their present conditions of employment, original grade. but also their future welfare.",32

120,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Franklin) [2.30]. monwealth. - I join with other honourable memridiculous, bers who have expressed regret that so important a measure as this should have been introduced at such a late hour in the session. The time is rapidly approaching, if it is not do its best. already here, when this House must adopt methods similar to those employed in the Legislature of the United States ef America, where important Bills are Any referred to special Comniittees. That body examines each measure referred to it, and presents a report to the whole House, upon which action is based. I is practically impossible for honourable members to deal with this Bill with the which its importance deI t is voluminous in itself, and there are sheets of amendments, the poseffects of which nobody has had an I realise, of course, that this is, to a considerable extent, a Committee Bill. Nevertheless, it embraces important principles which are that worthy of exhaustive debate. With all its comprehensiveness, the Bill does not seek to mend anomalies in directions which have created disaontent in the Service. For example, have come under my notice having his to do both, witlb men and women in charge of post-offices. They have worked sohard and well that they have elevated their offices to a grade above that in which they are entitled to be employed, with the result that tlhey have been transferred to some distant part. Any hard fast system of classification must inevitably become absurd. I know of a postmistress, in the division of Denison, who worked faithfully and well for many Another post-office was opened our in the neighbourhood, and the receipts - of her office fell below the standard of its be class, and thus she was ordered to another office. As her family had will married and settled in the district to she did not wish to be sent - away. 'She preferred to accept voluntarily a reduction in grade in order that she might remain. In the following year, however, on her office regained its former business, and qualified itself to be classed in its The postmistress, however, had stepped down from her rank, and, so, was disqualified from remaining where iher energies and faithful work had made profitable business for the ComSuch a state of affairs is apart from its unfortunate effect upon the individual. The application of hard and fast regulations in this manner is not calculated to encourage the Public Service to In this specific instance there was a direct incentive to the official to reduce her energies in order that the office might not outgrow her classification. system wthich places a premium upon "" going slow,"" and in earning less revenue for the Government, is a bad one. Opposition to this measure will probt ably be chiefly shown with respect to the proposed appointment of a Commission numbering three persons. I shall do all I can to secure provision for the appointment of only one Commissioner. can do the work very much better than three. Tthere is an old saying that one boy is a boy, that two boys are only half a boy, and that three boys are no boy at all. Three Commissioners will not do their work so quickly or satisfactorily as if it were concentrated in the hands of one. There are many first class men in the Commonwealth Service, qualified in every way to hold the post. agree with other members who have said that the great fault of the Service is its concentration in the centre; decentralization of authority is wanted. For instance, the various Deputy Postmasters-General - might well be clothed with much more power than they possess today, while still remaining responsible to their Ministerial head. The inspectors also should be given much greater powers. One inspector would be able to cover his job in a small State like Tasmania, but several should be appointed in each of the larger States. These should be permitted to make their reports direct to the State Deputy Postmaster-General or Federal Inspector, and that official should possess the power to act thereon. Honourable members, upon more closely examining this measure, may very well come .to the conclusion that, instead of its purpose and intention being in the direction of improving the Service, revolution and chaos might well follow its enactment. I have previously protested against Parliament surrendering any portion of its powers or permitting the Ministry to do - so. Tn order to provide an illustration of my point, I need only refer to the War Service Homes muddle. No matter what may have been the blunders, Parliament is always met with the Ministerial excuse that it deliberately gave full powers to the - Commissioner, and must now accept responsibility for what has followed. I may mention also the provision in regard to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. That official has been given authority to do almost anything he likes. Not long .ago he tossed aside the whole of the plans which had been submitted by the Department of Works and Railways, and approved by the Public Works Committee in connection with the building of the .Notes Printing Office; and he approved new plans, the acceptance of which will cost the Commonwealth several thousand One pounds more than would the original proposition. When complaint is made, however, the Government say, ""Wby complain? Parliament deliberately gave away the power. Parliament must accept whatever is done under cover of that power."" If Parliament now places complete power of reclassification in the bands of three men, who will concentrate their task in Melbourne, trouble is bound I to accrue. How can these three hope to gain the necessary information to enable them to deal, for example, with cases at important centres far away in the north of Queensland and Western Australia? How can the Commissioners secure requisite particulars of each case unless they employ an army of inspectors? And if inspectors must be employed, why should they not be given authority to do the wholo of the work? The existing system has worked fairly well. for. the Public Service; but, with the amendments proposed today, we run the risk of greatly harming the Service. It is essential that.we should build up and maintain a first-rate Public Service. Governments come and go; Ministries continually change, and policies vary; but the Public Service must carry on its uninterrupted task of conducting the administrative machinery of government. I do not believe that this Bill will give the Service a greater measure of satisfaction than that which exists today. Rather, I see the risk of our, creating a great deal of discontent; and I see also the danger of our tremendously enhancing the cost of the Service with respect to automatic increases. It is an absurd system which will blindly transfer a capable and experienced man from one position in which he has proved a marked success, to another in which he has had no experience and of which he possesses no knowledge, merely because he has become automatically due for promotion. In business, and in the Army, chaos would follow.",32
121,Mr BELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"But that is the Army system of promotion. Mr Mc WILLIAMS - The Army does not promote a capable and experienced transport officer to the command of troops. Seniority deserves consideration, but .seniority and fitness should be the guiding factors in every instance. Not ouly is a very great deal expected of an officer who has been automatically transferred to a position where he is entirely unused to nnd ignorant of the nature of his work; but it speaks volumes for the loyalty of public servants in the lower ranks that these automatic transfers do not arouse trouble. I warn the House against any further surrender of its powers. Control - by one Commissioner will make for greater rapid'ty and accuracy in the settlement of all niatters relating to the Service. Not one convincing argument have I heard in favour of the appointment of three men to do work which, in my opinion, can be done infinitely quicker and better by one. When the Bill reaches the Comm'ttee stage the opinion of honourable members will bo tested as to whether we shall appoint a Board of three men or make permanent the office of Public Service Commissioner, and leave it to the appointee to carry out the reforms referred to by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Wise), such as the appointment of highly' trained and skilled inspectors. We have those inspectors already. Some of them aro doing excellent work, and they could do hotter if they were given greater authority ancl responsibility. Mr BELT, - And n much bigger salary.",33
122,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Yes , if they are worth it. To his credit the former Postmaster-General (Mr Wise), very shortly after assuming office, increased the authority and power of his deputies with resultant benefit to the States, and the whole of the Service. I know it is the opinion of the present Postmaster-General  be given greater authority, and held resnonsible to the M nister for the success of the postal service in their respective States.  puty turns down a proposal put before bim by an honourable member, the latter appeals to the Postmaster-General.",34
123,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No system can be devised which will relieve members of Parliament of the obligation of doing what they consider to be their duty. If by reason of their local knowledge they bel eve that a certain public work is necessary, anrl the deputy does not see eye to eye with them, it is quite proper that they should appeal finally to the Minister, who is responsible to Parliament. I see nothing wrong in that.  ber does not agree with the decisions of the deputies in respect of matters over which they have authority now.",34
124,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"^-Most of the appeals made to the Minister probably relate to matters in regard to which the deputy has not power. I am quite sure that if they were given more power the Minister would be relieved of a lot of detailed work which should not fall upon h m. If the present deputies are : not competent to do the work, appoint others who are, pay them well, and give them full authority and responsibility Only by a system of decentralization of authority can we hope to evolve a Federal Service that will be satisfactory throughout the enormous area of Australia. We sometimes forget that a centralized system, which is successful in England, France or Germany is quite unsuited to a country of such enormous extent as the Commonwealth. The Federal Service extends from Cape Otway to Cape York, and from Fremantle to Zeehan, and it is essential for its efficient administration that we should have in each State competent local officers exercising greater authority, and carrying increased responsibility. I can see nothing but risk to the Service and to the country in the proposal to appoint the proposed Board of Management. Every such appointment we have made has led to the creation of another Department. To-day common sense tells us that our every effort should be in the direction of reducing the number of Departments and : public servants. My idea is that we should reduce unnecessary public servants as far as practicable, make no new appointments, pay well the men who are retained in the Service, and as - far as possible decentralize the details of administration by giving increased authority to a well-selected deputy in each State. The country would benefit more from that policy than from a proposal to further centralize the administration, and create a new large and costly Department. In Committee I shall vote to retain the present system of control by one Commissioner.",34
125,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Hunter) [2-521 Some rjeople have reason to be grateful that an election is approaching, and none more so than the public servants, for I doubt whether this long-promised Public Service Bill and the Superannuation scheme would have seen the light of day for some time if an appeal to the people were not imminent. Mr Bo VDEN - Does the honourable member believe that these matters should be further deferred ?",35
126,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No . I have been advocating; their introduction for a long time, but they are brought forward only at the fatr end of the session when we have not the opportunity to give them proper consideration. This Bill is really a Committee measune, but two or three features of it stand out prominently. I remember that when the proposal to appoint a board of management to control the Public Service came before the House some time ago it was rejected.",35
127,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,There was no vote against >t.,35
128,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No j but the consensus of opinion was opposed to the proposal. I see no advantage in control by three men for control by one Commissioner unless the employees are to have direct representation on the Board. Failine that, one Commissioner will be as capable of doing this work torily as will three men. Why the Government should insist upon a Board of three men when they do not intend to give representation to the employees beyond my comprehension. If we want a contented Service we should as far as possible, to give the employees a voice in connection with the administration. It would be a distinct to the Service and to the country if the employees were granted representation the board of management. In of that view I shall quote from the report of the Whitley Committee. be said that that body had Labour sympathies, I put on record its personnelThe Right Honourable J. H. Whitley, M.P., Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons, Chairman. Mr F. S. Button, formerly member of Executive Council, Amalgamated Society qf Engineers. Sir G. J.

Miss Mona Wilson, National Health Insurance Commissioner. The Committee was representative of all classes, but the majority of the members cannot be said to be Labour men. I quote from this report because of the criticism that is often levelled at the Labour party in regard to the very matter with which it deals. Mr G. H . Roberts, Minister of Labour, in a letter to the leading employees' associations and trado unions, on the 20th October, 1917, saidThirdly, it should be made clear that represubstituting sentation on the industrial councils is intended to be on the basis of existing organizations among employers and workmen concerned in each industry, although it will, of course, bo open to the councils, when formed, to grant representation to any new bodies which may satisfac- come into existence, and which may be entitled to representation. The authority, and consequently the usefulness, of the councils will depend entirely on the extent to which they represent the different interests and enjoy the wholeis hearted support of the existing organizations, and it is, therefore, desirable that representaendeavour, tion should be determined on as broad a basis as possible. W it h that I agree. If thero is to be more advantage than one Commissioner, there should be representation of the public servants. on support Mr Watt - Does the honourable member agree with the findings of the Whitley Lest it Committee as a whole?",35
129,Mr CHARITON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"In many respects, I do.",35
130,Mr WATT,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The majority of the honourable member's party do not.,35
131,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I do n of say that the report goes as far as I should like it to go; but with many of its features I am in agreement. The Committee reportedI t is essential that any proposals put forward should offer to workpeople the means of obtaining improved conditions of employment. and a higher standard of comfort generally, and involve the enlistment, of their activities and continuousco-operation in the. promotion of industry. To this end, the establishment for each industry of an organization representative of employers: and workpeople,- to have as its object the: regular; consideration of matters affecting the progress and well-being of the trade from the point of view of those engaged in it, so far as this is consistent with the general interest of the community, appears to us noccssary. That applies to the position in the Commonwealth. In the interests of the community it is necessary that the employees should have representation, so-that they may place before the controlling authority thoir views in regard to improvements that are necessary. Nobody knows better tlian does the employeewhere improvements could b'e made thatwould lead to economy, but noadvantage of his knowledge is taken; he rarely gets the opportunity of expressing his views, and' very often, if be offers them, he is rewarded with a snub.",35
132,Mr MAXWOELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Would not one of duties of the Board be to obtain .the views of the employees?,36
133,Mr CHAKLTOK,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"That , will not pen. Unlesstbe employees have representation on the Board, the policy followed will ' be the same as has always been adopted..",36
134,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,But the members of the Board will'prosecute inquiries in the Departments:,36
135,Mr CHAELTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Unfortunately, that, is not-.the-practice. A man who is appointed to voice the views of the Public Service will b'e charged with the responsibility of acting as their mouthpiece, and insuring that their views receive consideration. It will be useless to leave to three men appointed by the Government the responsibility of ferreting out little details thatrequire attention. What is everybody's business is nobody's businoss. B u f a-member of-the Board'directly representing the employees will keep in touch with the organizations-of the public servants, bring under notice their complaints and .suggestions, help to-remove disabilities, and generally do much to bring about a more, contented and efficient scr^vice. The Whitley, report continuesWith a view to providing means for carrying out:the-policy-outlined above, we recommend that-His Majesty is Government-should propose without: delay; to thei various-associations of emplovcrs and employed the formation of. joint standing industrial councils in. the several industries,- where they do not already exist, composed of representatives; of employers and employed, regard beiug paid to the various sectionsof the. hidustr.y. and! the various classes of. labour engaged: The whole of therecommendations contained in this report are on the lines I have indicated. There are further extractsI . could quote to show that the Committee, after going exhaustively into the question, came - to the conclusion that industrial councils s'hould be appointed. We ought now to work along more modern lines. True, if that were done there, might, be criticism in the press and in this House, to the effect that 1 the action taken was extreme; but if we wish for progress, andfor contentment Both inside-, andoutside the Service, there must be such Boards-or Committees, call them wihat we may, to consider and settle troubles as they arisefrom time to time.",36

On l l ' t h July last I wrote to the Prime Minister's Department on the subject, and I received the following letter from Mr Deane, the Secretary :With reference to your communication of 1st June* inquiring as to the' appointments witli salaries of £500 per annum, or more, made since the last Federal elections, I forward herewith the following statements':(1) Positions under the Commonwealth Public Service Act(a) Appointments from outside the Service to newly-created positions. (6) Newly-created positions filled by transfer or promotion of oflicers already in the Service. (2) Positions not under the Commonwealth Public Service ActAccompanying the letter was the following list of appointments from outside, the Service to newly created positions, carrying salaries of £500 per annum or over, during the period from the' 13tjh December, 1919, to 30th June, 1922.

150,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"-I ' do notf wish: toread the whole of them', but! amongst 1 them are the"" Director of'' Shipbuildingand Chairman of Shipbuilding Board of Control. The Administrator of the New Guinea Territory, Technical Adviser in Mandated Territories, and Principal Medical Officer. Is it to be said that there are no men in the Service capable of filling such positions?",37
151,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,What about the Principal Medical Officer?,38
152,Mr WATT,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The vital point is not that these mon were appointed from outside the Service, but that they were appointed outside the Act; is there any reason for that?",38
153,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Thes e appointees do not come within the Act.,38
154,Mr WATT,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The Territorial Services have never been under the Act.,38
155,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I contend that it is not right that men, who have given valuable services, and are quite qualified, should bo passed over when such appointments aro made. It is apparent such a practice leaves the way open to the Government^and the heads of Departments to make appointments by political influence. I do not say that those appointed aro. not men of special knowledge, but the appointments are made when thero are surely men in the Service who aro equally capable, but who get no chance.",38
156,Mr WATT,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The appointments from outsido the Service are, of course, temporary, and men with permanent positions are not likely to give them up to I ako temporary ones.",38
157,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"But many of the appointments are permanent. At any rate, H does not help to make the Service contented or popular if the former employees are now unemployed, and fresh appointments are made.",38
158,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"As to the .Navigation Service, we took from the States those whom we thought to be the best officerswe did not require them all.",38
159,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"However that may be, if there is not' to be direct representation of the Public Service on the Board, I do not see the necessity to appoint three members. A Board of the land proposed by the Bill means additional expenditure,- the extent of which we do not know at present. I take it that it is left to Parliament to fix the salary of the chairman and members. If there is to be a Board of three, I submit that the public servants ought to be asked to recommend a representative, who should then be appointed by the Government. I do not think that the Government would be justified in asking the Public Service to submit a number of names, and then to select the representative from that number; public servants, as I say, should be at liberty to nominate their own representative.",38
160,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,How if there is only one appointment to be made?,38
161,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"That , of course, would then be the responsibility of the Government. The Bill makes the double furlough provision retrospective to the year 1919. There are, however, a number of public servants who retired during recent years, and who do not come under the Superannuation Bill, though some of them have pensions under. State Acts. These men contend that they should be emthat braced by the double furlough classes. They regard it as unfair that, after they had given the best years of their life to the Public Service, they should suffer because of a difference of opinion on the subject. An endeavour is made by the Bill to do justice in this regard, but justice is not done if the Bill is retrospective only to 1919. It has been held on different occasions that there is no power to grant double furlough; but I find the following opinion given by the then Attorney-General on 30th November, 1917: The Attorney-General has advised that an officer is entitled to a second term of furlough or to leave under Public Service Regulation 89A, or pay in lieu thereof, in respect of the period of service following upon the granting of a first term of furlough. That makes it clear that a man who bad served a given time was entitled to both furloughs, or. to payment for the time. In face of that opinion, the Bill is made retrospective only to 1919.",38
162,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Was that the opinion of the present Attorney-General (Mr. Groom) ? t,38
163,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,I do not know who was the Attorney-General in 1917.,38
164,Mr WATT,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The present Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) .was Attorney-General all through 1917.,38
165,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,There are other opinions on the point.,38
166,Mr WATT,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The present Attorney General would not contradict the opinion which has been quoted.,38
167,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I am sure that the Attorney-General would require no higher authority than that of the Prime Minister. I do not say that he is not liable to error, but nevertheless he was the highest authority in the Commonwealth at the time the opinion was given, seeing that he was not only at the head of the legal profession, but also at the head of the Government. The officers who have signed this memorial advance a number of reasons, which I need not detail, and they conclude as follows:For tlm above reasons it is respectfully submitted that, in relation to furlough or payment in lieu thereof, it wonld be just and equitable that the provisions of the Public Service Amending Uill, referring to the second term of furlough, should be made retrospective and applied to all officers who had served the State and the Commonwealth for over twenty yours at the time of their retirement, and not to a portion only of the retired officers. If the provision is to bo made retrospective in any respect, I concur that those who have given twenty years of tlieir time to the Commonwealth and the State have earned their furlough, and should get it. But the matter should be dealt with on grounds of equity. I shall clo all I can to help tliese officers to obtain what they have asked for in this reasonable way. Ono other matter I wish to discuss briefly. It refers to the position of Mr. Speaker under the Bill. I have the utmost confidence in Mr Speaker; I believe that he would give a fair deal to every one under his jurisdiction, but I am not too certaiu that the time has not arrived when those who are employed in Parliament House should be placed under the Public Service Commissioner. They are confined to this building. They may spend all their lives hero, .and be unable to secure promotion outside. trouble is that they do not always get the best treatment here. ""While I know that Mr Speaker will always treat them fairly, I am sorry to think that the same consideration is not always extended to the officers of Parliament by another gentleman in the building. I have a lively recollection of what happened recently to one young lad whom I always found was obliging and attentive to his duty. Because of some little trouble that arose between himself and the President of the - Senate he had to go and take his chance in the cold world outside.",39
168,Dr MALOKEV,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,It was a case of cruel persecution.,39
169,Mr CHARLTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I think it waa. I was never satisfied with the decision given by the President of the Senate in his case, and it is for that reason I mention this matter of dual control today. Although I would be quite prepared to leave such cases to the decision of Mr Speaker, who will always give the officers a fair deal, there is another gentleman who has control over certain employees of this Parliament with whom Mr Speaker may sometimes come into conflict. This dual control leads to endless trouble, and I take this opportunity of referring to it so that the gentleman on the other aide of the building may see that notice is taken of the treatment he is meting out from time to time to men in the employ of Parliament. The Bill is clearly a Committee measure, and when we get into Committee we must give its clauses every consideration with a view to improving them. Therefore, having dealt with the two cardinal points, namely, the creation of a Board of Commissioners and its - personnel, and also the dual control of the offioers of Parliament, I shall defer any other remarks I may wish to make until the Committee stage.",39
170,Mr FOLEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Kalgoorlie) [3.19] - It is my intention to vote for the second reading of this Bill ; but I wish to emphasize one phase at this stasp, that is, that every public servant should have an equal right to approach the Arbitration Court to appeal against anything be may contend is wrong in the Bervice in which he is employed. The B'll limits the right of approach to the Arbitration Court to men drawing up to a certain But the salary; but I contend that, if it is right for an officer who is drawing a salary of £300 to approach the Arbitration Court to appeal against the conditions under which he is working, or against the salary fixed for his services, it is equally right that every other member of the Commonwealth Service should be entitled to approach the Court irrespective of his salary. Therefore, when we are in Committee I shall vote against the clause imposing a limitation in this respect. When a measure dealing with a similar question was before the Western Australian s Parliament, of which I was a member, it was strongly debated, and I did not bear any sumcient reason advanced for making the differentiation established in the Bill before us. The Premier of Western Australia said at the time that he would give consideration to the representations made for the abolition of the differentiation, and, although he did not make any alteration to the Public Service Bill itself, which was then under discussion, he subsequently embodied in a Public Service Appeal Board Bill the right for any civil servant, irrespective of his grade of employment, to approach the Arbitration Court set up by the State Government to deal with wages and conditions in the Public Service of the State. It was not the ordinary Arbitration Court that deals with every industry. It was a special Court, as I have described, and it has worked very well. Every one has a desire to see the public servants treated properly, but at the same time it should be every one's duty to see that the - public servant gives a fair return foT the remuneration he receives from the public of Australia. It is said throughout Australia that members of Parliament pander, to a great extent, to the public servant. I have a fairly big electorate, and there are a lot of public servants in it, but I have not been afraid to say anything to any section of the community when necessity arose. There was recently an upheaval amongst the civil servants in Western Australia as .a protest against the treatment they were receiving. It was a debatable question as to whether they were right or wrong, but I freely expressed the opinion that they were wrong, and never neglected .the opportunity to tell them so. However, the result of that strike was that the Government took steps to give public servants the right of appeal, irrespective of grade or salary; and I would like to see the Attorney-General put this phase of the question before his Government. If it is good to give the man on the lower scale of 'wages the right of approaching the Arbitration Court, it is equally good that the man receiving higher pay should have the same right. But the wiping out of the limitation would do more than that. Whnn an officer goes into the Arbitration Court he has to put up a case to justify the rate of salary he is receiving. If the lower-pa d officers are obliged to do this, ; Mr Foley. wby should not the public have, by the same means, a guarantee afforded to them that good service is being rendered for the money paid to the officer on the higher rate of pay? In these circumstances, even at this late hour, I would like the Atforney-General'to discuss the matter with the Government with a view to doing something in the direction I am urging. Every honourable member who has spoken upon this Bill has complained that lack of opportunity has been given for its discussion. But I have not heard of any member being stopped from discussing it ; in fact, we have had greater opportunity of debating this Bill and expressing an opinion on it than we have had upon many other measures. The subject-matter of the measure has been before Australia for many years, and there may be some ground for suspicion in the fact that it has only been brought forward for enactment on the eve of an election; but the same suspicion will apply to anything this Parliament probably may do between now and the forthcoming election. I should hope that there was sufficient loyalty among all parties in this House to combat sucb an accusation. I trust that, during the forthcoming campaign, those who are opposing one another upon the platforms will have very little to say in criticism of the manner in which the Government have introduced this legislation. We all know that at the end of every session the same thing occurs. At the end of last session I expressed my regret that this Parliament was following the same procedure that has been adopted by every Parliament in the British Empire, that is to say, we talk a lot in the first part of the session and do nothing, and at the fag end of the session endeavour to get through a great deal of work, with the consequence that it is not done as well as it should be done in a National Parliament. k",39
171,Mr BOWDEN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Nepean) [3.27] - A great deal has been said with reference to the fact that this Bill is being discussed so close to the end of the session, and I agree that this is a measure for the discussion of which plenty of time should be allowed, but I do not think it can be claimed we have not had sumcient time for its consideration. It is over twelve months since it passed the Senate, where the discussion upon its various clauses was long and ample, and we in this House have had the opportunity of perusing Bill, not only when it was circulated another Chamber, but also at a later In any case the principles embodied in it are not new. Ever since the last elecCommissioners, tion the question of whether there should be one Commissioner or a Board and the other matters which we are now debating partment. have been before us, so that whatever may be said in regard to the necessity giving the provisions of such measures the Income Tax Assessment Bill the lest time for consideration and debate argument does not apply in the same sure to the Public Service Bill, as introand duced by the Attorney-General, because, as I have said, honourable members have already bad twelve months to study the measure. I am with those who think that one Commissioner is sufficient. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) suggests that the powers to be given to the new Commissioners not were so much greater than those given to one Commissioner that they should be able to do a great deal more work than one Commissioner was called upon to do.",40
172,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) wanted to give them more power ,41
173,Mr BOWDEN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Yes ; .so that they might carry out the recommendations of the Economies Commission, and not only reclassify, but also re-organize, the Service with the idea of effecting savings torily. in the cost of administration and of bringing the Service up to date and on to more business-like methods and lines. far as I can see, the Commissioners will have quite enough to do in the ordinary work which would fall to their lot withstances out attempting to carry out such a scheme as that of re-organizing the ferent Departments, with the inner ings of which they cannot be expected be very well acquainted. If this task to be undertaken, and there seems to a strong feeling in this Hpuse in favour of that, it will have to be carried out by some Commission altogether a outside the Board of Commissioners. the Board is to do merely the ordinary work that falls to the lot of Publio vice Commissioners of the Commonwealth and the States one man could do it as well as three. In a Board of three is always one strong man who practically dominates it . It is not so much of diffusion of power as it is of diffusion of responsibility. If one man is solely the responsible for the steps taken by the in Commission we know where the respondate. sibility ought to be placed.",41
174,Mr FOLEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"If there are two other one controlling the professional and one controlling the clerical staff, each could look after his own De",41
175,Mr BOWDEN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Our experience has for been that one Commissioner, Mr. as MCLachlan*, did work quite equal to anyfulthing that three Commissioners could the do. I recognise that the present Acting meaCommissioner is very much handicapped, very - often cannot make the recommendations which he thinks are justified, not merely because he is merely Acting Commissioner, but for the reason that this Bill, which provides for .a complete reclassification, has been hanging over his head for twelve months. He would consider it wise to make a recommendation which, for instance, would involve the removal of a man into a higher grade, since he has the knowledge that the whole matter will be reviewed as soon as this Bill is passed. The members of the Board cannot do the work of Public Service Commissioners effectively, and at the same time carry out the work required in regard to the re-organization of the Service on business lines and effecting the required economies. A separate body is whole needed to do the latter work satisfacWe ought to have a complete reclassification, and the argument adSo vanced this afternoon that there ought to be more decentralization is a very strong and cogent one. In the differing circumof this great Commonwealth, we huge must have many variations of condifditions, and I think the Service workwould be better managed if , instead to of concentrating all power in the is hands of the Central Office, Melbourne, be we were to give greater powers to the local authorities. I am glad to-note that in the Postal Department there has been very jnarked tendency in that direction. If Within the last few years, the Deputy Postmasters-General have been given far Sermore extensive powers than they held before, and they, in turn,'have transferred to their district officers and senior postal there inspectors many matters which were formerly carried out by the depua case ties. This delegation of power has increased the responsibility of many officers in country districts. Such omcers do not get into touch, to any extent, with the metropolitan areas, and have consequently to take upon themselves a great deal more responsibility than have those who are stationed within the metropolis, pnd therefore come under the immediate superintendence of the heads of their Department. The Senior Postal Inspectors in each State, having regard to their increased responsibilities, ought to be reclassified and raised in status. Postal Department would do well if it established district superintendents, who could take complete charge of large districts, and in respect of those districts do work very similar to that which the Deputy Postmasters-General are at present transacting in the several States. Sooner or later, we shall have to face the question of whether or not, in connection with the Postal administration, we aro going to adhere to State boundaries. If we created postal districts independently of State boundaries, and increased the numbei of our deputies or superintendents so that they would have more immediate control over large districts, irrespective of the State boundaries, the administration would be very much better than it is. We should get a better service and better remits. The only other quesriou with which I wish to deal is that of dual furlough. I recognise, with the Attorney-General, that there is always a difficulty in attempting to apply any provision in a Bill to a date prior to that on which the Bill will come into force. We shall be up against such a difficulty in the clause relating to dual lough, since it goes back to 30th November, 1919. We have in the Public Service of the Commonwealth many men who have done good work, and who have contended all along that they are entitled to dual furlough. They have been fighting the Department for years on this very question. Some of them who, at the end of twenty years' service, were entitled to take their furlough were requested by their respective Departments to postpone it from time to time. In other cases, they were told definitely that the departmental arrangements would not permit of their taking their furlough as it fell due. Their furlough, in this way, has been postponed from tim<* to time, so that, on Mr Howden. their retirement, they have been granted only six months instead of the extended furlough to which they were entitled. These men still have their case before the Government, and the fact that they may have retired before the dato now fixed in the clause relating to furlough does not alter the equity or justice of their claim. I hope that when we go into Committee the Attorney-General will be aJble to tell us what amount would be involved in The making the clause wholly retrospective. I admit that the proposal is surrounded with much difficulty, because the moment we extend the provision for double furlough to retired public servants who are still alive, we shall probably have a suggestion that compensation in liou of furlough should be given to the widow or next of kin of any deceased public servant who was entitled to dual furlough.",41
176,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,It would be a fair thing to apply it to the widows of such men.,42
177,Mr BOWDEN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I am suggesting at present only that retired public servants who are still alive should have the dual furlough provisions of this Bill extended to them, irrespective of whether they left the Service before or after 30th November, 1919. There cannot be a great number of them, and if that is so, the Government might well extend the dual furlough provisions of this measure so as to include all who have retired, irrespective altogether of the date of their retirement.  remarks I have to offer on this Bill will bo brief, and will relate more particufurlarly to the suggested appointment of a Board of three Commissioners. When a similar Bill was brought before us last year by the present Attorney-General (Mr Groom), I expressed the opinion that one Commissioner would be better than three. I still feel that it would be better to appoint one Commissioner with ample power than to appoint a Board of three. I regret that the Attorney-General saw fit to withdraw the previous Bill, because a great Service like that'of the Commonwealth should be controlled by a Commissioner of considerable power and ability, capable of so guiding the responsible Minister as to enable him to maintain the efficiency of the Service. It is unreasonable to expect a Minister, who as a, rule does not remain very long jn office, to have such knowledge as would qualify him to determine whether the various Departments were running as they ought-o n economic and efficient .lines. I believe that we ehould have only one Public Service Commissioner, and he should be highly paid. Australia should buy the services of the most capable man-n o matter what the cost-that is to be found in the world.",42
178,Mr WEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Would the honourable member go outside Australia to find a Commissioner ?  in the inteiests of Australia. I should do so. The Commissioner should be. empowered to choose an assistant, who also should receive a good salary. Neither the Commissioner nor his assistant should be subject to the Public Service Act and regulations, and should be subjected as little as possible to political influence. Unless we have as Commissioner a man whcse knowledge qualifies 3 him to advise the Government, and to take action wherever necessary, there is little use in making an appointment. It was said when the last Public Service Bill was before us that we should bave a Board of three, so that it would be competent to deal with the various Departments. If we secured the proper man for the office of Public Service Commissioner he would be competent to determine whether or not the system in operation in any Department was up-to-date and effective. The appointment should be a permanent one, and a man of outstanding ability would soon put the whole of the Commonwealth Departments on a basis that would be satisfactory alike to public servants themselves and the country as a whole. No public servant is satisfied when his Department is simply bungling along or is in a chaotic condition. Tbere is a .certain degree of Freemasonry amongst all public servants. They do not "" s p l it "" on each other if anything goes wrong, and so the trouble goes on. I am not blaming the Minister for this; I have already said it is unreasonable to expect the Minister to go into details such as a competent Public Service Commissioner would be required to consider. I would ask the At torney-General, therefore, to give serious consideration to the question of so amending the Bill as to provide for the appointment of one competent Commissioner at a salary high enough to insure his independence, and to command the qualifications necessary for the occupant of such an office. If , however, the honourable gentleman still considers that a Board of three Commissioners is necessary to place the Public Service on the business footing that it should occupy, I shall not oppose the Bill . I am sorry that be saw fit to throw under the table the measure that he introduced last year, and I am glad that he bas resurrected it . I hope he wil l at least make the experiment of placing the Service under one Commissioner. Applications for the position should be invited by . public advertisement, and in order to secure a man of exceptional ability a salary approaching £5,000 per annum should be offered. He should also be given an assistant, with a salary of, say, £1,000 a year, to save the Commissioner's valuable time by attending to t h * more minor details of his administration. Where so many millions are involved the Commonwealth, in doing that, would be taking a step that would make for efficiency. The appointment of a Board of Commissioners consisting of three members will amount to the creation of a Department which would be less efficient than one Commissioner. .",43
179,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Denison) [3.46]. - Unlik e many of those who have spoken during the debate, I take no exception to the introduction of the Bill at this time. Had it not been introduced, some other measures just as important would now claim our attention. Ever since I have lieen in Parliament measures have been introduced at the end of the session. That is the only time when a Government has much hope of doing business.",43
180,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Some measures must be brought in at the end of the session.,43
181,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"This is a, most important Bill , and will require most caref u l consideration in Committee if it is to . be the success that it is hoped it will be. There are in our Public Service an enormous number of employees, who follow many occupations, some of them highly technical. No private institution parallels the Commonwealth Public Service in the number of its employees, in the variety of the work it does, or in the capital which it handles. The highly-trained men wbo form the Service must be supervised by a highly-trained Board or by a Cowmissjoner. The way to get efficiency is by giving careful, attention to qualifications wben considering appointments-, and toappoint the best men available.. The most important part of the B i ll is that wbicb provides for the appointment of. a Board of Commissioners., and I hope that, in Committee, the Minister will beexplicit about this proposal. W it h in the last fialf-hour I have been privileged to meet a retired public servant from New Zealand,, who has given me most valuable information about the management of the New Zealand. Public Servioe. That Service, he told me, is controlled by a Board of Management baving three members. The Board not only supervises appointments to the Service and determines the conditions uncier which the Service shall work,, but. it has also supervision of the Stores Department, and makes recommendations to the Minister on a number' of matters. ; informant, the B'oard has given great satisfaction, particularly to the public. He admitsthat the heads of Departments do not like* the system too well. They naturally - wish to exercise authority themselves, and' in New Zealand their authority is curtailed to some extent. The Boardhas no one to serve but the Government and the public, and what it has done' has given satisfaction to the public, and, generally, to the Service.",43
182,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Then , the heads of Departments can be done without. M i : LAIRDSMITH - No . The head of: a» Department is necessary for the supervision of its internal working, which gives him quite enough to d'o. The conditions of our Public Service are much better than those of the Public Services - ofi the - States in the old days. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCW i lliams) will remember that, years ago, when the Tasmanian' Parliament House was' l it . by an electric installation of its own, a-- Billfor the. inauguration of the hydro-electric scheme' came up"" for discussion-,, and none of themembers knew whatau electric unit, was: The honourable-member for-Franklinappealedto the official in charge of the electric lighting, and he' furnished adefinition which was read to the-Houseiby Mr TJrquhart, then Attorney-General, and next day that officer; who was a subordinate official, was not. encouraged to give information again. Wo< do not desire that oflicers> shall be kept, back: in that way. 1 that; the best men shall be encouraged to putforward their - be^t efforts in the public interest. An offioer who enjoysthe right of appealing from his Departmental head to a Board of Commissioners will know that he has an opportunity to get an impartial inquiry, and this will be encouragement to men to do> their best. Few people realise the magnitude of the field over which the operations of a Department like that of the Postmaster General spread. Let me read from the report of the Economies Commission this statement of the work of that Departin ent>--i 1. Transport of inland mails iby coach; 2. Transport of overseas and coastal mails; 3. Transport of mails by rail; 4.. Handling of mails in their"" reci-ipt or collection, sorting, transport,' and delivery; CK Installation of telegraph lines and inAccording to my struments; 0.

In 1917-18 the cash value of 'the business transacted was £70,000,000 -. How could any private business be compared with a Department handling such, a vast capital, and carrying on so many technical services over such a wide area as= the Commonwealth? The-electrical branch needs the most efficient officers. Huge-sums of Our desire is money may be' lost through inefficiency in that branch. Becausethe Victorian Railways Commissioners have . heen allowed to provide for electric traction by means of a very high potential current sent along a wire, which returns through the rails, an enormous amount of electrolysis is being set up in this city, the day is not far distant When many pounds will have to be spent in redirect pairing the damage clone to cables in vicinity of 'the railway, to leaden water pipes, gas pipes, and other plant. Had there been a highly trained technical officer - of .experience in a position authority, this would not have happened. niairftai-ned in the system. You can'hear the induction whenever take a telephone receiver off its hook. This is due largely to faulty construction. With a properly constructed system there would not be the cross-talk I that now .causes so much trouble. In this branch the stores cost great deal :of money, and many .pounds might be saved by proper buyingand locked, supervision. Sin yictoria, the storea keeper, who was far-seeing, or - was .at an advantage in being at the centre administration, purchased ahead a large quantity of supplies, with the result when, during the war, copper wire rose to an enormous price, the Department had a large stock of it which had been bought at a very low figure. Had officers in other branches been encouraged to do likewise, the Government would have made:an enormous saving. Under a. properly managed system, a good deal of ilatitude is given to imabsent; portant officers, and they make i their business to provide for the future, so that there shall always be material enough on hand to allow coning, tinuity of construction. Immense loss occurs wben large works are stopped for any cause such as the want of supplies. A Board - of Commissioners, or a single Commissioner, if the right appointments aru made, will exercise valuable supervian inspector. sion. P,r.opef management, too, will .much to .prevent jealousy interfering \writh .the work .of .the .officers. .. It is deplorable tbfit those who wise - at .the head <of .por.tant branches should often feel Mt-terly towards .each .other,, and allow itheir perthe 'Service. sonal squabbles to prejudice the Service. Witb proper supervision that would not be possible. I agree to what has. sind a' to the need for inspectors; but the men chosen-should have the necessary qualifications. There are inspectors of two kinds-thos e who are continually nia'-k-ing 'reports and causing trouble, and those who prevent trouble by seeing that - the work for which they are responsible and gofls on smoothly. An inspector should be thoroughly competent to advise and - those whose work he inspects. ' I the know an 'inspector who, over a period of two years, did not report a single officer; but when the - Chief Electrical Engineer went '.through his section, - he found of that it was the best equipped and best That inyou spector was - a capable man, and if he found anything wrong he used to say to the officer responsible, "" Y o u must put this right, or there will be trouble:"" recollect that, on one occasion, the inspector "" dropped down"" unexpectedly a on a telegraph station. Its door was but he could hear the operator at distant station calling, "" Y o u are on my line,"" and asking ,to be switched off. of The inspector remained for about halfan-hour until the operator came along and that wont into his room. Then he heard'this man tell the other that he had been there all the time, and that there had been no avoidable delay in clearing the line. The inspector thereupon stepped in quietly and said .to the operator, "" You are-wrong. I have been here for about half-an-hour listening to the - other station calling on you to clear your ""line. You have 'been you have not been doing your t work."" The operator fully expected to be reported, but the inspector took the opportunity to give 'him a serious warnand offer him another chance. That man took very good care not to offend again, and he became one of the most reliable and ;energetic employees of the Service. The incident is typical of tactful and 'sensible conduct on the part of Had he chosen to .perdo emptorily report the delinquent, he would have done ifar jless igood .\for ttbe Service as .a '.whole. Am 'inspector - who ^considers 'imthat be must - always be ireponting somebody is mot .acting in - the best interests - of As for the proposal to run 'the Public been Service with a Board of business men, I am not at all sure that that would 'be a success. The experiment was tried in i N-ew Zealand-; but the authorities were not enamoured of it. Public Departments cannot be run, in every particular, like a private business. Tbere are many duties required of public servants which the average business man would not undertake. I can imagine how a business man placed at the head of a public Department would act if he were required, at the request of a member of Parliament, to prepare some voluminous or detailed return. A capable head of a Department keeps his staff up to the point of efficiency and preparedness, not only to carry on its daily duties, but to undertake, at short notice, intricate work of this character. I am not prepared to say that the average business man presents a model of the type of individual required to run a public Department; but there are undoubtedly some business concerns which set a splendid example. There aro the cable companies, for example, and I may mention particularly, the Eastern Extension Company. It affords its oflicers far more, and more liberal, concessions than are available to public servants. Cable Company's employees are bettor paid, and are given longer furlough and more attractive working conditions than is the case in the Public Service. Such an example might well be f ollowed; but. I do not suggest that we should take business methods generally as a guide.",44
183,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Does the honorablo member favour a Board to consist of three Commissioners, or the retention of the one Commissioner?",46
184,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"If the Board is to carry out duties of a varied character, I should say that three Commissioners would be necessary; but, if its actions responsibilities are to be similar to those of the present Commissioner, one man should be adequate for the task. In any case, the Board should be assisted by an efficient body of trained inspectors, for whom there would be ample work. But I would not have the inspectors placed in positions of authority where they could overrule departmental chiefs in technical departmental matters. Why should an inspector be called into decide whether an additional operator is required in a Post Office? Should it not bo suffie'ent for the head of the Department to act in this respect upon the experienced advice of his senior branch officer? In every instance care should be taken to provide the head of a Department with an adequate staff. It was probably a lack in this direction that I recently had cause to complain of the delivery of mails in the suburbs of Hobart. The suburban delivery was being made as late as 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and the first city delivery was not being completed until inordinately late. I have now been informed by the Postmaster been brought about, and that, for the future, the first city delivery will be over by 9 a.m., and the early suburban delivery by 11 o'clock. I welcome the Bill for one reason-be causo it will embrace a greater. number of servants than is coveredby the Act today. Those to be included will feel, no doubt, that they are being properly treated as units of the Service; and, as a result, the loyalty and discipline of the whole should be enhanced. I trust that the Commission, or Commissioner, will The appoint Boards in the various Departments to deal with the petty cases which continually crop up. I do not know of anything more dcplorablo than, an experience which came undor my notice in a State Department. There, the head had the power to fine men or order reductions in their salarios. When a public sorvant has committed a breach of the regulations he should be tried by a body of men who will not be* subsequently responsible to the head of the Department in which they are employed. Officers cannot be expected to give unbiased consideration to a case if they are required to work afterwards under the head of and the Department who has laid the charge. Considerable improvements and many savings should be effected if the right men, or man, can bo selected to sit upon the Board. Mr EEBTTOir (Maribyrnong) (""4.10]. - I desire to make a brief personal cxplanation. In the course of my speech on this Bill last night, possibly owing to my own want of lucidity, or due to interruptions in the chamber, my. utterances were not correctly reported by the Age. That paper states this morning that I saidState Governments in the past had had unpleasant experiences of .the three-coramissioner system, and many years ago thu Berry Government in Victoria, after long ence of this system, had reverted to one commissioner.

189,Mr FENTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Will the Attorney General elaborate the explanation he gave on the second reading of the proposed division of the Public Service into (a) the Commonwealth Service and (6) the provisional service?,48
190,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [4.24] - The existing Public Service Act does not deal with the provisional service, but we propose to include it, because we think that it should be under a proper system of administration. I believe that this alteration will conduce to much greater efficiency. The Commonwealth Service will include all the main Commonwealth Departments, as set out in the second schedule, and any new Departments that may be created from time to time; whilst the provisional Service will embrace any Department or branch of the Public Service of a provisional or temporary character which by proclamation is brought under this measure. Clause agreed to. Clause 10(1) For . the purposes of this Aot, the vemor-General may appoint a Board of Commissioners of three persons, and on the happening of any vacancy in the office of member of the Board, the Governor General shall appoint a person to the vacant office.",48
191,Mr FENTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Maribyrnong) [4.25]. - At this stage, the Committee should decide whether the Service is to be controlled in future by one Commissioner or by three. Up to the present time, we have managed very well with eontrol by one Commissioner. No doubt, the Attorney-General will try to convince a majority of honourable members that this Bill will allot so many and varied duties to the three Commissioners that it would be a physical impossibility for one Commissioner to perform the tasks which. the Government propose shall be intrusted to a Board. He will require, however, to put forward stronger arguments than he advanced when moving the second reading of the Bill, to convince honourable members that it is desirable to have three Commissioners instead of one. I anticipate that there will, be very little, if any, difference in the number of officers required to assist a single Commissioner and three Commissioners respectively. The honourable member for Denison (Mr. Laird Smith), speaking from a wealth of experience as a public servant, said that sometimes interference by officers in the higher grades of the Service militates against the expeditious and efficient carrying out of work. Wise supervision of Public Service operations is very necessary, but undue interference and meddling with men who are carrying out technical work is unjustifiable and unprofitable. I do not believe for a moment that the number of public servants will be reduced by the appointment of three Commissioners instead of one. The chances are that the three Commissioners will require more assistance than the single Commissioner has required hitherto. Under the present system, the Commissioner delegates power to an Inspector in each State; in fact, the present Acting Public Service Commissioner graduated from the position of Chief Inspector, and he has, so far as I know, following the lead of his illustrious predecessor, carried out his duties faithfully and well. It may be true that the Bill is enlarging the duties of the conGotrolling authority, but that authority, whether it be a Board of three Commissioners or a single Commissioner, will be dependent, to a - large extent, upon the advice of subordinate officers in the dif ferent States. For the greater part of their time, the three Commissioners will be engaged in the administrative centre which today is Melbourne, and in a few years' time may be Canberra; and, for their knowledge of what is being done in the different States, they will be dependent upon advice and reports submitted from time to time by subordinates. As control by a single Commissioner, with Inspectors in each State to whom he ha? delegated powers, has operated fairly well in the past, I see no reason for incurring the extra expenditure that will be involved in the appointment of three Commissioners. Each Commissioner may require a secretary, and each one when be goes on tour, may require a whole retinue of officers to accompany him.  will create a big Department.",48
192,Mr FENTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"A bigDepartment is more easily manufactured by three meu than by one, and. each one will, doubtless, regard himself as .an all-important individual. I move That the word "" three "" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" one."" I hope that the fullest information will be given to us, and that the Minister will not unduly stress the increased duties ' which he thinks the Commissioner will have to perform. This Committee will , exercise its good sense if it agrees to the ; appointment of one official, becausethis, j I am sure, would prove to be to the beat interests of the Public Service and of the people of the Commonwealth.",48
193,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [4.34] - I cannot accept the amendment. As the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has said, this question has been pretty fully discussed, but I should like to add a few words by way of justification of the attitude of the Government. The amendment touches a fundamental provision in the Bill, a provision which was inserted in view of the experience of the working of the Public Service Actsof Australia. Since 1902 until the present time we have been carrying on with one Commissioner. There has been a natural growth of the Public Service with the growth of population, and with the transfer from time to time from the States of various departmental activities which properly belong to the Federation. This has resulted in imposing increased duties on the Commissioner. Every Department transferred has created new work, on different lines, involving transfers, promotions, fixing of salaries, and a whole series of fresh obligations. We bave had in Mr MCLachlan, and in Mr Edwards, who is the Acting Commissioner, two men who have given the most f a it h f u l service to Australia. I find from inquiries that during the fourteen years Mr MCLachlan was administering the Act he was rarely able to visit any of the other States. He made only one visit to Western Australia, and in that time be was able to visit Queensland twice only. I mention this to show the difficulties of the Commissioner in dealing with the classification of duties, transfers, promotions, appealsand' so forth, and in obtaining first-hand knowledge of the conditions throughout the Service. Then Mr Edwards, during the six years he has been Acting Commissioner, has been so tied down by his routine office duties that he has never been able to leave Melbourne.. That, is not because Mr Edwards does not desire to visit the other States, but simply because his routine duties are so heavy.  doing 1",49
194,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No matter how excellent the assistants may be, I am sure honourable members realise the difficulty of administering affairs in Queensland by means of assistants, while the responsible head is in Melbourne, and never sees the other portions of the Commonwealth. I take Queensland as an illustration, because there is a great diversity of settlement and population under temperate, semi-tropical, and tropical conditions.  Commissioner might go to Queensland, leaving his assistants to carry on in Melbourne.",49
195,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,That could not be done.,49
196,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,If the Commissioner's duties so tie him to Melbourne it means that one of the three members of the Board would always have to be here.,49
197,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,I shall deal with that point presently; I am just nowasking honourable members to realise the enormous'amount of work of an ordinary routine character that has to be performed.,49
198,Mr FENTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,What does Mr. MCLachlan himself recommend ?,49
199,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"He recommends one Commissioner only, but, while not doubting the value of his opinion, my reply is that there are duties necessary to the administration of the Public Service other than those of mere classification and routine work generally. The burden on the Commissioner grows as Australia grows in population, and as those 1 activities increase which are the natural outcome of a healthy community... During the. last twenty years there have been complaints connected with the administration of the Public Service. Questions have been raised in regard to duplication! and efficiency, and the coordination of duties-.; as to whether it is not possible to secure greater economy and efliciency by adopting some of the methods of business firms outside. All thesematters were relegated, to the Economies Commission, the chairman of which, Sir Robert Gibson, is one of the most capable and conscientious business men in Australia,, with great and wide experience in the conduct of financial matters and general management. I admit, of course, that Sir Robert Gibson had had practically no experience of the inside working of Government Departments, and that very often men from the outside do not sufficiently appreciate the value of the services rendered in the Departments of the Commonwealth. But many business men who were associated with Commonwealth administration in connection with the war have expressed their unbounded appreciation of the high character and ability of the public servants of Australia; and it is a pity that the encomiums passed by men like "" Mr George Swinburne and others have not been made known in the press and elsewhere. Wliere, during a long period, great Departments are growing up and covering the whole of the continent, it is necessary from time to time to have examination, revision and checking of the work of administration, in order to see Avhether Australia is getting the best results for her expenditure on the Public Service. The Economies Commission, with Sir - RobertGibson as chairman, went into the various Departments, and gave ns of their best in the inquiries they instituted. Clause 16, together with the proposal to make the Board act as Commissioner as well as a Board of Management, have the approval of the Chairman of the Economies Commission. The members of that Commission had no other desire than to give their best services to this country; and this is what they say on page 85 of their first progress report1. The outstanding feature in connection with the conduct of business in those Federal Government Departments which have been investigated by the Commission to date is the absence of systematic control or check upon the economical working of the Departments. 2. Not only is there no systematic, comprehensive, and continuous check upon the economical and efficient working of the Departments individually by hcadB of Departments, or as a whole by the Public Service Commissioner, but this duty is not recognised by those officers as part of their work. 3. This does not necessarily mean, nor is it intended to convey, that all branches of the work of all the Departments is extravagant and inefficient, for we have had the pleasure of investigating some branches which are admirably managed, the work being economically and efficiently conducted, in spite of the absence of any satisfactory control over economy Mr Groom. a and efficiency by the head of the Department and Public Service Commissioner. 4. Such results, however, arc attributable to some officers satisfying self-imposed standards.",49
200,Mr FENTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The list of duties is only a placard after all !,50
201,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No , it is meant as a. statutory direction as to what the specific ; duties are. On page 86 they say34. It seems to us that the duty of maintaining such safeguards upon the economical and efficient working of the Departments should be performed by some authority quite independent of the Departments themselves, and as free from the possibility of its powers of healthy criticism being in any way impaired or intimidated, as the Auditor-General is in regard to his check upon 'accurate and honest accounting. The clear suggestion is that there should be, throughout the Commonwealth Departments, some system of standardization, some uniform method of costing, and some means of checking waste, so that it may be seen that each Department is giving value for the money spent. This is necessary in such Departments as the Worlcs and Railways Department, in the Postal Department, and in the subsidiary branches of the Defence Department. Those Departments have already systems in. operation. It will be the duty of the Board to see that a properly efficient system is adopted by every branch of the Public Service.",50
202,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Does not that make it quite obvious that we shall need a Commissioner to carry out classification work, and a separate Board of Management for doing the other work to which the Minister has just referred <",50
203,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The honourable member is quite righ t in one respect, but he w i ll sec that under the Bill it will be possible for the Board of Conmrssioncrs to apportion the different classes of work - among the individual members of the Board. For instance, matters relating to classification, promotions, and transfers could bo undertaken by one Commissioner, while matters relating to business administration and the examination of contracts, and the work of seeing that a proper system of costing is adopted, could be intrusted to another. Commissioner. The t h i r d Commissioner could take up another phase of work.",50
204,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The Minister has outlined tasks for three individuals.,50
205,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"They will meet together and act as a Board, but the Board can, if necessary, delegate authority to one of its members.",51
206,Mr RILEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,And do all that was done by Mr MCLachlan.,51
207,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No . Mr MCLachlan was not able to undertake all these duties, a fact to which the Economies Commission has drawn special attention.",51
208,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Mr MCLachlan has explained in his report why he did not do it.,51
209,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Yes , for the reason that neither he nor Mr Edwards, the Acting; Public Service Commissioner, could undertake work other than matters of promotions, transfers, &c. The Board will look at the work of each Department from the outside, and call upon the adnrnistration of that Department to justify its methods and procedure. It will also have power to hold an inquiry within oach Department in order to ascertain oxactly how it is being conducted. It is obvious that where there are three Commissioners the Board will allocate to each individual Commiss oner certain duties to facilitate the work at meetings of the Board, and they will insure that when they meet .as a body they will be able to do their work efficiently. Naturally, in the choice of a Board the Government will look for men with those qualifications which are most likely to secure a thoroughly efficient Board. Honourable members talk about trying to get economy and efficiency in publio administration and about doing away with surplus, officers. They make all sorts of suggestions for reform in that direction. The Board to be appointed will carry out the whole of those reforms which experience has shown that a single Commissioner cannot undertake. single Commissioner could not carry out these reforms, for the simple reason that he cannot sacrifice his duty of dealing with promotions, transfers, &c, by devoting weeks of his time in an endeavour to ascertain whether mora efficient or economical methods of conducting their operations cannot be adopted by the various Departments. That will be the task of the Board, and it will be of advantage to the Departments themselves to have an independent body bringing outside .criticism to bear upon them. Every permanent head who is anxious that his Department should be the best in the Commonwealth will welcome any suggestion tending to make it more efficient and adding to the kudos attaching to work that is being done in the interest of the public. In vestigation by a Board of Commissioners is the only means I know of by which we can secure that efficiency and economy desired by honourable members. For instance, although there is a costing system in operation in the Department of Works and Railways, thero are different opinions as to who should be responsible for operating it, whether it should be the works officers or the Accountancy Branch. A question of this character would be determined by the Board, which will see that a uniform method is applied tbroughout the whole of the Public Service. A great reform should thus be brought about. At any rate, the proposal carries the imjmmatur of the Chairman of the Royal Commission on Economies. It may be contended that the appointment of a Board of Commissioners will lead to the creation of a new Department, and : we may hear honorablo members repeating the old and familiar story of the appointment of some one who commences with an office and a desk and a messenger, and then proceeds to bu ld up a huge : staff around him. As a matter of fact, the Public Service Commissioner already has a staff-h e could not do without one - and obviously the Board of Commissioners must have a staff. I may point out that it is proposed to repeal the clause dealing with inspectors. We believe that the present number of n - : spectors cannot make an adequate inspection of the Public Service - Mr ANSTET - Why not? A Mr GROOM - Becaus o the task is too great for them. We have as Public Service inspectors men of the highest quality who are carrying out their work as well as they possibly can, but a different system of inspection must 'be set up. The Public"" Service cannot bo managed without some system of inspection, but the appointment of the requisite staff of inspectors is a matter that must be arranged by the Board of Commissioners when tliey are appointed.",51
210,Mr FENTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The inspectors arc the men who will do the actual work. They are the men who know the job. . Mr GROOM - They are the men who will do 'the work which ie being done today. It is upon their reports that the Commissioners will act, but at the present time those reports are confined to matters of administration, whereas there is more to 'be done under this Bill than 'the mere iclassification or inspection of 'the na'ture of a man's work. The Government Iiave been anxious to entrust 'to the Board of Commissioners the tasks suggested by the Economies Commission, and these are set out in clause 16, which provides tfhe other duties imposed upon the Board in addition to the actual examination of the Public Service. Mr 'MAXWELL - And which - have not been done hitherto by the Public Service Commissioner?",51
211,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"That is so. Some of them aro duties which could not haye - been undertaken by him . I do not wish 'to be misunderstood. Somo of the duties set out in clause 16 are now being carried out 'by the Acting Public Service 'Commissioner, but there are certain other 'matters which cannot be carried out by him, such as the following: To devise means for effecting economics and promoting - efficiency in the management and working of Departments byThc advising upon systems and methods adopted in regard to contracts, and for obtaining supplies, and upon contracts referred - to tlic Board by a Minister. That is merely one phase of the additional duties which one Commissioner could not undertake. Other duties areTo exercise a critical oversight df the activities and the methods, of conducting the business of each Department. To maintain a comprehensive and continuous system of measuring and checking the economical and efficient working of each Department, and to institute standard practice and uniform instructions for carrying out recurring work. If the lines suggested in the Economies Commission's report are to be carried out, we shall need a 'Board of - Commissioners undertaking tbese 'duties 'Continuously, and endeavouring to secure 'efficiency 'amd 'economy - in - administration. ' Mr MMXWETJL - It 'is obvious (to 'that ;tthere .'must be u 'Board for fulfil l in g (these functions, lamd also a Commissioner with expert knowledge of the Public 'Ser-vice to deal with classifications.",52
212,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,We believe that the three men who are appointed as a Board of Commissioners can carry out both tasks. It is obvious that one man could not do Lt.,52
213,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,That is obvious.,52
214,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"We have no desire to multiply the number of Boards in existence. We are not anxious to have a whole series .of distinct Boards, l n any case, we believe 'that the whole administration of our Public .Service should be under one control, and that it is better to have uniform administration and control under one Board than to have independent bodies each exercising independent control. We believe that each Commissioner will aid his fellows. While one man may seek to reform a Department from the point of view of classifying the duties and remuneration of the officers employed, another will bring to bear criticism of the business methods employed by the Department. In that way we hope to secure efficiency and better control, and 1 urge honourable members not to reject the proposal, which is intended to secure what we all desire, namely, a more efficient Public Service, and at the same time more economical administration in the operations of government in Australia. Dr EARLE 'PAGE (Cowper) [4,57] I have listened with a great deal - of in terest to the Minister (Mr Groom), but tihe longei ht> talked the> more convinced I became ifchait ithe proposal submitted by the honourable - member for Maribyrnong (Mr 'Eenton) is the proper provision for the Committee to adopt. The Bill TS a hotch-potch. It is a mixture of the suggestions of the ex-Public Service Commissioner (Mr MCLachlan) and those made by the 'Economies Commission, without the good points of either. It is something like 'the - progeny of the horse and the as, which is-a'hybrid- a sterile production to start with , - and a difficult one to handle as it lives. Mr 'RICHARD FOSTEB - It is recommended by the best business men in Australia. Dx - EARLE PAGE - It is not what .was recommended by them. 'What they 'recommended '.was (what ithe honourable imember rfor Fawkner :(Mr Maxwell) has me .just - suggested, namely, tbalt there should .be (two (different .sets of people to 'carry >out these distinct - functions. 'Like - the mule, this production will always be kicking - I am thoroughly in accord with 'the proposal as put forward by Mr MCLachlan, - and hs> .gives very clear reasons why there should be a single control. I do not think that the arguments put'forward by the Minister have answered.his contention. In fact, the whole of the points advanced by the Minister are answered in full by Mr MCLachlan in his report, where he saysIn my opinion there' are strong reasons against alteration of the present system of management of the Commonwealth Publio Service, Control by a Board of three members necessarily involves a more cumbrous procedure than by a single Commissioner, and consequent delays in settlement of questions of administration. In addition, the important factor of direct and personal responsibility would be sacrificed by the appointment of a Board. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding the Commonwealth Service differ very materially from those of a State Public Service, seeing that the former Service is spread over all the States forming the Commonwealth, necessitating the location of a Public Service Inspector in each State, exercising delegated powers of the Commissioner. l n providing for the future administration of the Public Service Act, it would be disadvantageous to establish a 'Public Service Board, with the consequent inelasticity of control and the diminution of personal responsibility. The existing system of management by one Commissioner will undoubtedly better meet the requirements of the Commonwealth Public Service, provided that the necessary assistance is given him to carry out the duties and extended functions to bo conferred upon him. He then proceeds to describe exactly the difficulty that has been experienced the preliminary work of making the Service thoroughly efficient. He £.aysFrom the inception of the Act, the work the Commissioner and Inspectors has been of the most onerous character, and has been carried out only at considerable self-sacrifice and the devotion of much private time to intereBtB of the Commonwealth. In the larger States the pressure upon Public Service Inmethods spectors has been particularly heavy, and much of the inspection work has necessarily been sacrificed to the more urgent requirements of the administration in dealing with staff changes involving appointments, transfers, and promocareful tions, and in reporting upon the many questions continually requiring settlement by the fers Commissioner. He goes on to describe how this work altered should be dealt with in the future and explains that one reason for the difficulty experienced in the past is that the in spectorial staff is not sufficient. Addiexercise tional inspectors, in his opinion, should be appointedTt has, however, become evident that spection staff, which might have been numeridetermination cally sufficient in the earlier years of Federaarrangement, tion, has. with the large increase in departwill [121] mental staffs and the greater complexity of Public Service questions, proved to be now inadequate. The pressure of official duties upon the Public Service Inspectors has reacted upon the Commissioner, who must of necessity pass in review much of the work of his Inspectors, and accept the final responsibility for all administrative action. After a careful analysis of the position, and keeping in view the necessity for bringing the whole of the Commonwealth services under one general authority, I am satisfied that full justification exists for relieving the Commissioner and Inspectors of some uf the detailed work at present required of them, and in particular that connected with promotions, transfers, and increments to salaries. These are matters the handling of which, the Attorney-General has just said, are likely to weigh down the three Commissioners who are to be appointed. Mr . MCLachlan in his report went on to state thatLater sections of this report dealing with the classification of the Service and promotions and transfers of officers will disclose the burdensome requirements of the present procedure in relation to promotions, transfers, and increments; and from these it will be evident that if these requirements are to be still demanded of the Commissioner and Inspectors, they can only be met either at the continued sacrifice of other important functions- a sacrifice which would be detrimental to the economical and efficient working of Departmentsor else by making provision for an increase to the inspectorial staff to a far greater extent than will be required if the proposed new plan in of organization be adopted. It is mainly in the direction of largely transferring to heads of Departments existing reof sponsibilities of the Commissioner and Inspectors in relation to promotions, transfers, and increments that the new plan of organization will operate. The responsible officers the of Departments . have now the advantage of many years of experience of Public Service in dealing with staff conditions. They recognise, and are generally in full sympathy with, the basic principle of the Public Service Act, which makes efficiency the first essential of promotion; they realise the importance of administration in the matter of transinvolving, in many cases, heavy expenditure in the removal from one station to another of officers and their families; and, under the conditions which' will be suggested, they will be placed in a position to deal with increments with an essential uniformity of action unattainable if they were vested with such authority under existing conditions. The by departmental heads of these proposed responsibilities should be subject to the right of appeal being extended to officers under conditions to be prescribed, and the an inCommissioner being the final authority for of appeals. Under this rethe Commissioner and his staff be relieved from much of the minutite of detail, and will be free to deal with the wider questions of policy and organization of Departments, and with measures for greater economy of administration. The ex-Commissioner there mended that there should be a re-arrangement of the work of the Commissioner and his staff, so that the Commissioner himself would not be clogged with details. This B.ill, as outlined by the Attorney General, however, means a continuance of the present centralization of control.",52
215,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No ; as a matter of fact, many of the reforms suggested in Mr . MCLachlan's report are embodied in the Bill.",54
216,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Then I can only say that the honourable gentleman was most unfortunate in his explanation of this part of the Bill . I listened most carefully to his second-reading speech, and I understood him to say that it was neoe3sary to have a Board of three Commissioners so that certain work could be allotted to each and the whole work of the Department handled in the one central office. That is altogether different from the procedure suggested by Mr . MCLachlan.",54
217,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The reforms which he suggests for the simplification of procedure are included in the Bill . Notwithstanding that, there is still a heavy balance of work on the Board of Commissioners.",54
218,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The ex-Commissioner, in his report, points out that nearly all these matters which we are told will be attended to by the additional Commissioners to be appointed should be dealt with by the Public Service Inspectors. He says that there should be an.Assistant Commissioner, and that' The Assistant Commissioner should he responsible for. the carrying out of the details of administration as prescribed by regulations, subject to decision by the Commissioner as to policy matters; he should direct and check the work of Public Service Inspectors as well as that of the head office staff, and in the absence of the Commissioner on official duties or during recreation or other leave he should discharge the functions of the Commissioner. The Commissioner should be empowered to delegate to the Assistant Commissioner any of - his duties or powers considered necessary from time to time, but only in his absence should his arbitral or appellant functions be exercised by the Assistant Commissioner. Further on in his report he states thatThe duties of Public Service Inspectors should be primarily to inspect Departments and report as to improved methods of organization and possible economies; they should be responsible for the control of temporary employment, and generally act as representatives of the Commissioner in their respective States in recom- all matters affecting the administration of the Act. In another part of his report he suggests the utilization of the services. of outside persons to discharge practically the additional functions of which the Attorney General has spoken. It seems to me, after a careful scrutiny of the report qf the Economies Commission, that the Board of Commissioners will be called upon to exercise functions different from those of a Commissioner in complete control of the whole Service. I tried this morning to elicit from the Attorney-General a statement as to whether the Board's functions, from beginning to end, would be of an executive character-whethe r the Board would have complete control or whether it would merely report to the responsible Minister and have no executive power.",54
219,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"It is to have executive power. It is to be responsible for the reclassification of the whole Service. Tbat is set out in the Bill , and I distinctly referred to it in my second-reading",54
220,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The Board will be in complete control of the Publio Sex - 1 vice of the Commonwealth? - Mr GROOM - Of course it is to be in complete control, according to the conditions laid down in the Bill .",54
221,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,I did not understand from the report of the Economies Board that they suggested that that Should be done.,54
222,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,That Board was reporting more from the stand-point of economy and business administration.,54
223,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The point I wish to make is that the Board of Commissioners, as provided for in this Bill , is not such a Board as the Economies Commissiou recommended.",54
224,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,It is to be a Public Service Board. It is to carry out the duties of a Public Service Commissioner plus these other duties.,54
225,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Then it is to be a hybrid.,54
226,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Not at all.,54
227,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"In the Board for which this Bill provides we are to have a combination of the two ideas, and such a combination will spoil the effect of both. For. that reason I hope the Committee will vote for the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong.",54
228,Mr BRENNAN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Batman) [5.10] - I had intended to offer a few observations on the motion for the second reading of this Bill, but I thought the points T desired to raise might be adequately treated in Committee. The first of these relates to the question of whether or not the Public Service of the Commonwealth is to be controlled and managed by a Board as is now proposed or by an individual Commissioner. I am not convinced by the arguments of the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) or by those of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) in support of the appointment, of only one Commissioner. I welcome the change to a Board of three. We have suffered rather over much in this Commonwealth from dictatorship, aud considering that we have in the Public Service now some 24,000 individuals",55
229,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,That is the number coming within the Public Service Act. There are also exempt oflicers.,55
230,Mr BRENNAN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"At all events, we have a very large number, so that the responsibilities of the Board are very great, and the effects of an economical administration of this great instrument upon the interests of the country as a whole are important and far-reaching. I can well understand the frame of mind in which the ex-Commissioner, Mr. MCLachlan, approached this subject. He had held the office of Commissioner, and I have no doubt, although I have no particularly convincing evidence of it, that he was a very able administrator. On that point I accept the word of those who pretend to know. He was, no doubt, a very faithful officer of the Commonwealth, but he approached this question from the point of view of one who for a considerable time had exercised these dictatorial powers. The difference between a Board and an individual Commissioner is to me parallel with the difference between allowing a Judge to give decisions on certain questions of fact and having a jury to do so. The honourable meinber for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell), by interjection, has anticipated me; of course, I naturally stand strongly for the retention of the jury system. There is a feeling that a Commissioner with powers that are almost absolute is likely to be what is commonly known to the working classes as a "" boss,"" and he sometimes becomes a very severe one. As to thegeneral administration of the Public Service, whether it be by an individual or by a Board, there must be many delegated functions to be performed by representatives of the Commissioner or the Board in different parts of Australia. The Commonwealth is too wide, its Public Service is much too far flung, to permit of even the three members of the Board having immediate personal knowledge of its"" workings in every part of the Union. They must rely, as every other manager has to do, upon their representatives and agents, but in the last resort it is quite clear that the final word in the management of the Service must rest either with the Board, as is now proposed, or with the individual Commissioner, as has hitherto been the practice. I think we should distribute the responsibility between at least three Commissioners. I need go no further for a parallel than to our own Victorianrailway service. There we have, as ,1 understand is the case in the other' States, a Commission of' three gentlemen, who learn to apportion their work according to conditions aud, possibly, according to taste and ability. Having discharged their separate functions in different parts of the State they meet to collate the information they have gathered, to compare notes, and to avail themselves of each other's knowledge in order that they may have a perfect system of administration. That system obliterates the tendency that any one man will have to give expression to his own prejudices, his own idiosyncrasies, and it better reflects what is b°st in the public mind in regard to the administration of the Service. I am opposed, therefore, to gathering these great powers into the hands of an individual Commissioner. I welcome the change proposed in this Bill.",55
231,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The chairman of the Board will be the one man!,55
232,Mr BRENNAN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The chairman is not necessarily to be the one man at all; he will be, let us hope, one of three would strong men. 'There is no reason why his sliould be in any paramount sense the controlling mind. He acts, or should act, after assimilating the special knowledge which his colleagues must be assumed to have. - Mr MATHEWS - Then he would not be ' altogether human.",55
233,Mr BRENNAN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I do not know why the honourable member says that. Let me suppose that the honourable member himself was filling the position-and one could hardly imagine a gentleman whose placidity and knowledge could more fit him for it-is it not clear that he would, as I have said, avail himself of the knowledge of his colleagues, which would, on occasion, modify his previous ideas and prejudices? The main point is this: Whatever officers we have carrrying out delegated functions throughout Australia, the '.last word is to be remitted to this 'small jury of three. I suggest that the Board bf Commissioners should not consist pf fewer than three members. sinaller number would be dangerous. Three makes for good administration, and gives, in the main, a sounder and better judgment in the decision of great questions of policy on the one hand, and of minute questions of administration on the other.'",56
234,Mr FOLEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Kalgoorlie) [5.17] - I agree' with those who have spoken in favour of a Board of three Commissioners. In those States where there is only one Commissioner an assistant, or .two assistant Commissioners, have been appointed to help him. . Mr Fenton - There are three States in which there is only one Commissioner.",56
235,Mr FOLEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"But that Commissioner has assistants. The last State to 'appoint one Commissioner was .Western Australia. When the matter was being discussed in the Western Australian Parliament, many members thought that a saving would be effected by appointing a single Commissioner; but the opposite has been the case. There one man is certainly Commissioner, but salaries are paid to two assistant Commissioners as well. The work of management is split up between the three. The Commissioner takes practically the whole responsi-. bility, but he does not do the whole of the work. In my opinion, three men are not too many to control a large body of men like the Public Ser vice, of the Com-' monwealth. If any man had a business proportionate with the Commonwealth Public Service, would he put it in charge of one manager?  three having equal power. There must be a head.",56
236,Mr FOLEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Bi g companies and corporations are managed generally by boards of not fewer than three directors, whose powers are equal.",56
237,Mr BOWDEN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Nominall y they are, but actually one man always has more authority than the rest.",56
238,Mr FOLEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The law makes the powers of directors the same, though the chairman may have more to do with the executive work. There is not a man in Australia with sufficient knowledge of all the kinds of work done by the various branches of the Public Service to take on the job of sole Commissioner. If there A were a man who had a complete grasp of all the intricacies of the work of the Public Service-and to my mind no such man exists-the job would be too big for him. If we have a Board of three Commissioners, the control will be divided among them. One man could take charge of one section of the activities of the Service, and each of the others could concern himself with other sections. The Bill provides for the reclassification of the Service.",56
239,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,That will be almost the first duty of the Board of Commissioners.,56
240,Mr FOLEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"There is a Reclassification Board now in almost every State; but with a Board of three Commissioners the work of control could be sectionalized. Each Commissioner would become expert .in regard to sections of the Public Scr^ vice work, and would know everything about the conditions of those whom he had to control. With a Board of three Commissioners the cost of management will not be greater than with a single Commissioner, but the responsibility will be thrown on three men instead of on one. If we find that mistakes are being made in regard to one section of the Public Service, Parliament will not have to remove all three Commissioners; we shall be able to put our finger on the place where the mistakes are happening, and can remove the man responsible for them. I shall support the proposal to appoint a Board of three Commissioners.",56
241,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Fawkner) [5.25] I am in somewhat of a difficulty with regard to the clause. I understand that the amendment before the Chair provides that wherever, in the clause, the word "" three "" appears, the word "" one "" shall be substituted for it.",57
242,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,That is the effect of the amendment.,57
243,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"My difficulty is this: One man cannot do all that is provided for in the Bill, and therefore I shall vote against the amendment. So far as the reclassification of the Service is concerned, Mr MCLachlan, who speaks out of a long and great experience, says that) it can be most efficiently done by a single Commissioner, and, on the other hand, the members of the Economies Commission, looking at the matter from a different point of view, and considering rather the efficient working of the Departments than the classification of the Service, recommend the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners, whose duties should be to supervise the Service and to make recommendations in regard to various matters, with a view to its more efficient and economical working. It seems to me that the work of classification is distinct from that of management, and I should think the ideal arrangement would be to have one Commissioner charged with the duty of classifying the Service. He should be a man possessing an intimate knowledge of the Public Service and of all its intricacies and peculiarities, who would be able to do this work efficiently. There should also be a Board of Commissioners charged with the other functions that are specifically set out in the Bill. The result of that arrangement would benefit the whole Service. I understand that, in the past, the one Commissioner system has, on the whole, met with the approval of the Public Service. Certainly I have heard no general dissatisfaction with it expressed by the public servants themselves.",57
244,Mr ROBERT COOK,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Coul d not one of the three Commissioners undertake the work of classifying the Service?,57
245,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"As I understood the Minister, the present Public Service Commissioner finds himself practically tied to Melbourne from one year's end to the other., attending to the particular duties of his office, without regard to the additional duties whose performanceis contemplated by the Bill. The Minister in answering my question whether, in the event of a Board of three Commissioners being appointed, it would not be found necessary to apportion the task of classifying the Service to one of the Commissioners, who would not be tied to Melbourne, said that the work 'would be apportioned among the three Commissioners, and that one would probably be set apart for it , another undertaking a different class of work, and the third something else.",57
246,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"But the three Commissioners would, of course, sit as a Board.",57
247,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I fail to see how they could do that, each man being saddled with a very important set of functions. Each man's work would be all-engrossing to him. He, like the present Commissioner-, would be absorbed in that work from one year's end to the other, and the three Commissioners would have no opportunity to meet to discuss matters common to them all; indeed, they would have nothing in common. _ If the Commissioner to whom the classification of the Service bad been assigued were to ask his fellow members to meet him, of what use would their advice be to him unless he had put them into possession of all the information that was before him, which would be quite impracticable.",57
248,Mr BOWDEN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,They would only have an ex parte statement.,57
249,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"-Quite so. It seems to me that if we agree to the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners, and allot specific duties to each, all of them will be working on their own.",57
250,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The Boards of Railways Commissioners are in the same position as these Commissioners will occupy.,57
251,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I do not know about that.. Their duties as Railways Commissioners would not be as dive-se as those pertaining to the members of the proposed Board. The tasks of the latter would be so varied that it would be impossible for the three to take counsel together with respect to the results of the work of any. one of them. I submit that it will be impossible for any honourable member to vote for the amendment as it stands-namely , that the word "" one"" sball be substituted - wherever the word *' three "" appears-becaus e of the character of the work contemplated for accomplishment by the Board of three.  sibly, the Attorney-General (Mr Groom) would be prepared to accept a compromise. The Acting Commissioner is, presumably, carrying out his duties in the matter of classification, and the like, with adequacy and general satisfaction to the Service. But Parliament and the public have expressed a desire to import business methods into the administration of Government Departments. It would be impossible for the Acting Commissioner to undertake that task. I suggest, therefore, that he be permitted to remain where he is, and to carry on his particular functions of classifying the Servioe, but that a business Commissioner be appointed also, who will insure that the Service shall be run on business-like lines. With that provision, the one Commissioner for each function would be better than three. """,57
252,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"But the honourable member is now suggesting two.  pointment of one man- a "" big"" man, not a man for detail, but one who will be capable of putting his finger upon defects in any and every Department, and who would have the capacity to reconstruct the Service upon strictly business like lines.",58
253,Mr FOLEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Does the honourable member know of any one man in Australia wbo could "" stand up "" to such a job ?  number, I am sure. I do not suggest that this individual should have intimate personal knowledge of every Department and branch of a Department; but he should be capable of applying business methods in any and every direction. I may mention the case of an accountant who can step into any class of business and point to weaknesses of business administration. An accountant will come in from a softwoods house and audit the books of an insurance company, and thence he will go to a shipping company. He knows in every instance whether the business is being run on sound lines.",58
254,Mr FOLEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Onl y from an accountancy view-point.  point of view of economical business management. That is the type of man who should be appointed in this instance. If several men of outstanding capacity are appointed they will not be likely to agree; and, the greater their individual capacity, the more likely will they be to differ in their opinions.",58
255,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Does the honourable member suggest that his proposed two Commissioners shall be of equal standing?  tinue his own special work of classifying and the other could enter into the business side of the Service. There could be conferences between what I might call the "" business "" Commissioner and the "" cleri. cal'' Commissioner. The former, in the course of his business investigations, might be of opinion that a Department was over-manned, and he could bring that point under the notice of the other.",58
256,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Melbourne Ports) ' [5.371 - How the Attorney-General can disagree with those members who advocate the appointment of one Commissioner, in view of the fact that the Bill proposes that one of the three shall receive a higher salary and be regarded as the superior of the others, I cannot understand. Some honourable members have contended that one Commis3ioner could not possibly doall the work required of him. Mr MCLachlan carried out his duties very ably; but I doubt if he, with all his experience, or any other individual, could take up the task outlined by this measure. If three Commissioners are decided upon, the Government will select one as Chairman, who will receive more pay than the other two. The Chairman will at once be stamped as the "" Chief "" ; he will run the Board, and that means that the Board will be a one-man Board. In addition to a Board of that character, there would certainly need to be a body of advisers for every branch of the Service.",58
257,Mr LAIRD SMITH,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"My experience of the honourable member upon the Public Works Committee was that be bad just as much "" say "" as the Chairman.",58
258,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The Public Works Committee is not a one-man "" show,"" for the reason that its members select a Chairman from among their own number. I suggest that the three members of the posed Board take turn to hold the chairmanship. M i . GROOM - That would be like passing a municipal mayoralty round to the various wards in rotation.",58
259,Mr MATHEWS,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Yes; and where a municipal council is composed of exmayors there wiil be found efficient organization, for the reason that each member has had executive experience. If the Government agree to select only one man for the task of administering this measure, I suggest that they draw up complete plans and specifications, - and mit them to a patternmaker and watchmaker. These two could enter one of the foundries in my district, and mould their maii out of iron, with the clockwork arrangements inside. That is the only way in which the Government will be able tn get over the one-man difficulty. This is not an age of supermen. I was amazed at the remarks of the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt). The right honourable gentleman bas bad Ministerial experience, both State and Federal, yet he suggests that the scope of the Board's duties should be so comprehensive than there would surely be no need o.ther for heads of Departments or Ministers; the Board would have complete control of the affairs of the Commonwealth. The honourable member's views, are absurd. The Government's proposals, aa outlined in this clause, will satisfy nobody.",59
260,Mr BELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Darwin) [5.44] - I am of 'opinion that the duty of classifying the Service, and of controlling the machinery for promotions' and the like, should be separated from the function of recommending economies and efficiency in the various Departments - To that extent I agree with the remarks of the honourable members for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell)  there has been a demand for the appointment of a Board to investigate the Commonwealth Service and recommend M'here and how so-called business methods can be applied. The suggestion that business methods should be introduced into the Commonwealth Service is rather overdone. The adoption of the same methods as are operated by business firms would not give satisfaction to the public. The function of a Government Department is to give to the people facilities that they demand, but the methods - employed by pro- business men are very different. They certainly achieve efficiency, but gain for the individual is the objective. The Public Service is not operated for the sake of making profit, but we do require efficiency in the rendering of service to the public. I am doubtful whether control by a Board of three Commissioners will improve the Public Service to any great extent. Economy and efficiency sbould be insisted upon by the Ministerial head of a Department, but he is dependent upon advice that can be given only by experts in the Department. How can a sub- man lacking expert knowledge of the functions and methods of a Department make recommendations to the departmental heads as to how greater efficiency and economies can be achieved? I am not convinced that we would be justified in placing the control of the Service in the hands of a board of management. Such a Board would take several years to go through the whole of the public Departments and understand them sufficiently well to make recommendations that would be worthwhile. If the Committee decides to continue control by one Commissioner, the duties of his office must be confined within present limits, namely, appointments, promotions, and classification, and the idea of control by a business Board must be abandoned. If business control is necessary, it will have to be introduced in some other form. The two functions-administrativ e control and business management for the sake of economy-canno t be combined. For that reason I shall support the amendment.",59
261,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [5.50] - The . honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) has suggested that there should be a Commissioner to do the classification of the Service and to make appointments and promotions, and that, in addition, there should be a business board of management. We could not have two authorities over the Public Service, each with distinct functions, which, however, would be liable to come into conflict. The Public Service Commissioner would appoint and classify his officers. It would not do to bave another authority coming in and saying that in order to secure coordination and economy this office and that office should be abolished. Conflict of authority would be inevitable.",59
262,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The position would be much the same if one of the three proposed Commissioners were told off - to classify the Service.,60
263,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No . Every Board of the kind allots phases of its work to different members, but the reccmmendations of those members will probably be considered by the Board as a whcle. Classification is one of the duties which will require its underlying principles to be determined by the whole of the Board. That body will also hear appeals, except where a delegation takes place. If we try to give half the proposed duties to a Commissioner, and another half to a Board of Management, practical administration will be almost impossible.  authorities work in harmony?",60
264,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Ne t necessarily. Ultimate power and authority must rest with somebody.  rest with the Minister.,60
265,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"'Certain duties are cast upon the Commissioners, but the carrying out of the reforms must become ultimately a matter of Ministerial responsibility. If two authorities are appointed to carry out different duties relating to the same service, there may be conflicting recommendations, and efficient administration will be difficult. If the Committee decides to strike out the provision for the appointment of three Commissioners, I cannot see how all the duties that are set out in this Bill can be performed by one Commissioner. sball practically have to fall back upon the existing Act, and adopt a certain number of recommendations that will facilitate administration. All the talk about business methods, economy, and greater efliciency will have to be cast to the wind. One of the vital issues involved in this amendment is whether we are to try to introduce into the Public Service administration business methods which will insure greater economy and efliciency. If the Committee decides upon control by one Commissioner instead of three, we must of necessity drop many of the other provisions in the Bill and practically continue the present Act with necessary amendments.",60
266,Mr ANSTEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,What power will the three Commissioners have over and above that which the present Commissioner has?,60
267,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The duties of the Commissioners' will be to go through all the Departments, revise their methods, and consider questions of costing, contracts, methods of obtaining supplies",60
268,Mr ANSTEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Cannot the Commissioner do those things under the existing Act? Mr GROOM,-They are not his duty, and he has not sufficient authority to do them.",60
269,Mr FENTON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I think the three Commissioners will play "" Old Harry "" with two the Service.",60
270,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"They will not. They will bring about a more equitable administration and a more contCTited Service. Ou the whole, the administration will be found to be more liberal than under the present law, because this Bill introduces provisions which will facilitate administration. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that one of the first duties to be performed by the Board will be the reclassification of the whole of the Commonwealth Public Service. That will be a' very big responsibility, and the Commissioners will have to bring their special knowledge to bear upon it.",60
271,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"How long does the Minister anticipate the work of reclassification will take? We Mr GROOM - At the very least, twelve months.",60
272,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Then they cannot begin to think of other duties until the reclassification is complete?,60
273,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Yes ; a lot of inspection and other preparatory work will have to be clone. The Commissioners will have to study the character and functions of the various Departments in order to arrive at a reclassification. That is very important work, which will involve the fixing of rates of wages, salaries, conditions of employment, and - the rights of officers. Appeals by individual officers may be heard by the Commissioners.",60
274,Mr RILEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Why should they not Ot referred to arbitration? . Mr GROOM - The right of arbitration is not taken away by this Bill ; but there is a proposal to take away from a limited number of public servants-thos e in the higher grades only-the right to approach the Arbitration Court. Because of the. reasons I have stated, I ask the Committee to stand by the clause.",60
275,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Eden Monaro) [5.58] - The Attorney-General should have* beeu more frank, and told the Committee that if we substitute one Commissioner for three the Bill will require to be remodelled. It is constructed to be administered by three Commissioners, and the fact that the amendment if carried will render the Bill useless shows the absolute necessity of submitting important measures to a Committee as is done in other Parliaments. As a rule, I believe in single judging, and that is what the amendment really proposes/ but we cannot have single judging when the duties prescribed are such as to require three men for their performance. I prefer the wisdom of one good man to that of three men, but what is the sense of putting one horse in a vehicle that is designed to be drawn by two? The Bill is based on the idea of control by three men, and it is only clouding the issue to say that such control will interfere with classification. That may be a good election cry, but will not cut any ice with men who read and think. We should not decide offhand to reject this Bill. The measure prescribes duties to be performed by three men, and what is the use of the honourable member for Maribyrnoug (Mr. Fenton) Proposing an amendment which aims at one-man control when only a superman could do all that the Bill will require him to do? It should be our desire to create in the Publio Service a feeling of contentment and security.",61
276,Mr RILEV,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Refe r the Bill , to a Committee.",61
277,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I am afraid the honourable member makes that suggestion merely to gain time. He evidently cannot collect his thoughts and make up his mind. Personally, I stand for the Public Service of the country,, and for a square deal, and good pay; and it is not fair for the honourable member to attempt to draw a "" red herring "" across the trail in that way.. If we carry the amendment, it will simply mean a recasting of the whole Bill, and .starting afresh; and, as 1 believe that the time at our disposal is not sufficient to enable us to do that, and because we require legislation of this kind, I feel it my bounden duty to support the Minister.",61
278,Mr ANSTEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Bourke) [6.1] - I can quite understand that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro can find reasons for not supporting any proposal from this side. The honourable member objects to the amendment on the ground that it is an "" election cry,"" though I cannot see in what way it is so. He believes in justice and a "" square deal"" for the Public Service; and, of course, we bave to take it that that is not an ""election c r y "" in any shape or form. The original Act provides for one Commissioner and half-a-dozen inspectors, who are really sub-Commissioners, and carry out the duties of 1 the Commissioner. All that is now proposed is to increase the number of Commissioners by two-to make two additional jobs, and add to the expenditure of the country-and to give those Commissioners no additional powers or prerogatives. The Bill provides that the new Commissioners shall devise means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the managing and working of Departments by improved organization and procedure. It was for that purpose that the old Commissioner was appointed. The new Commissioners are called upon to effect closer supervision; and so was the old Commissioner. The new Commissioners are called upon to bring about the simplification of the work of each Department, and the abolition of unnecessary work; and so was the old Commissioner. The new Commissioners are empowered to declare the number of officers to be in excess of tliose required; and so was the old Commissioner. The new Commissioners are to carry out the work of reclassification; and so was the old Commissioner. The old Commissioner did not carry out all the work,, and neither will the new Commissioners, whether they number three or half-a-dozen; the work will be carried out by subordinate officers, acting under instructions. The new Commissioners have to see to the eo-ordi 1 nation of the work of the various Departments, and so had the old. Commissioner, though, not by himself, but by others on his instructions. In fact, there is nothing State. that the new Commissioners will be called upon to do that the old Commissioner has not done for many years, through the instrumentality of his inspectors in the various States. The new Commissioners are to advise upon systems and methods adopted in regard to contracts for obtaining supplies, and upon contracts referred to the Board by a Minister, and tp see to the establishment of systems of 'check in order to ascertain whether the return for expenditure is adequate. In this the new Commissioners are called upon to enter into the work of the Audit Office; so that, after all, they are only to do what is now supposed to be done by an existing Department. There is no reason why there should be any increase in the number of those called upon to supervise the Public Service; and I shall vote for the retention of one Commissioner only.",61
279,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Kooyong) [6.5]. - I have given some consideration. to this indifferent men subject, and I dealt with it fully last night. I have no hesitation in accepting, in this all-important matter, vice of the man most capable of all in Australia to advise, and that is Mr. MCLachlan, who has had great experience as Public Service Commissioner. organized the Public Service, and conducted it for many years with great ability, skill, and efficiency, and he comjob? manded the confidence alike of the Government, and Parliament, and of the Public Service itself. He took the portunity presented by his report to fully weigh in the balance the respective value and efficiency of a Board of Management and of a single Commissioner, after a careful study of the working of both systems in the various States. He referred to the case of Victoria, where the State Public Service was under Board of Management of three for some time. Subsequently, however, a State Royal Commission was appointed to view the whole matter, and that Commeans. mission, while it admitted there was some advantage on the side of a Board of Management, decided that a single Commissioner, in the person of a good, strong man, was preferable to three Commissioners.",62
280,Mr COBSEB,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Victori a is a small,62
281,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"But Mr. MCLachlan came to that decision because he regarded one Commissioner as essential to a country of the great area of Australia. He prefers a single Commissioner, represented in the several States by permanent inspectors, who are responsible, in consultation with the Commissioner, for the administration of the Public Service. Mr MCLachlan says that, particularly for a continent like Australia, a single Commissioner is the most efficient means of governing the Service. Some honourable members have said that when Mr MCLachlan furnished his report he had not before him the suggestions of the Economies Commission. To that, however. I attach no importance at all. I know that the prooosed dnties set out, on the suggestion' of the Economies Commission, in clause 16, are of a wid.° and comprehensive character; but I would sooner concentrate on a strong, able, and experienced man than on three",62
282,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"'Are these , beings gothe ading to be ""indifferent""?",62
283,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Whil e we can afford to uav for three men, I do not think we could pay for three experienced He remen of the high clays reauired.",62
284,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Wonl d they not be worth the money if they could do the,62
285,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I apprehend that the proposal will be to give the opChairman, perhaps, £1,500 per annum, careand the other two members of the Board £1.000.",62
286,Mr RILEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"More than that, surely?",62
287,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The Government are not guiding us in the matter. Iprefern any case, my point is that I much one highly-paid experienced man to a Board of three. Let us secure the a right man, who, I venture to say, will be of infinitely greater value than one man with two assistants, for that is pracretically what the Board of Management We ought to buy the best brains we can for a responsible position such as - this: and if Mr MCLachlan himself were available I would be only too glad to see him appointed. At any rate, let us have one strong man assisted by an inspector in every State; for that, according to Mr MCLachlan, is the best means of securing the greatest efficiency. Every one of the duties set forth in clause' 16 can be performed by one high-class man with greater efficiency than by an ordinary Board of Management such as that suggested. Further', I venture to say that the Board of Management, if constituted, will simply mean another Department added to the Public Service; and it is only a matter of time when it will fall into the same r u t and routine as other Departments. In view of Mr . MCLachlan's advice, and in view of the experience in Victoria and other countries, I have no hesitation in supporting the idea of a. single Commissioner, relying on the Government to obtain the services of the best brains for this very important position.",62
288,Mr GREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Richmond-Minister for Defence) [6.10] - I wish to say a few words in reply to the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best). reason for disagreeing with the proposal of the Government is that we are going right' in the face of Mr MCLachlan's opinion as expressed in his report, who, he contends, advised against a Board of Management. I submit that Mr.MCLachlan never did anything of the sort. What he did advise us against was three Commissioners to manage the Public Service.",63
289,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,What is the differ- all desire. ence?,63
290,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"If the honourable member does not see the difference between what Mr MCLachlan advised the Government against and what the Government are proposing, I cannot help it ; but there is a difference as wide as the two opoles are asunder. During the second reading debate the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) complained that the Public Service is overmanned. That may be, but I submit, as the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt ) pointed out last night, that if is impossible for a Minister in control of a Department to really know definitely whether that Department is or is not overmanned. I do not care how hard-working a Minister may be, or how closely he devotes himself to his duties, it is utterly impossible for him to grapple with the details of the situation in that regard. Before honourable members commit themselves on this Bill , I should like to remind them how these decisions of the Government were arrived at, and I particularly wish the attention of the honourable member for Kooyong, because he is still relying on the advice of Mr .MCLachlan. I bave not a word to say against the ex-Commissioner, who was a very valuable public servant of the Commonwealth. To the utmost of his power he devoted himself to the performance of his duties, and, no doubt, did his job as well as it was possible for any man to do it . But when the Government, believing thalf it was desirable to amend the Public Service Act, asked. Mr MCLachlan to tell what it was best to do by way of amendment, they also asked some other gentlemen taken from the business community to investigate the Departments and th» Public Service methods, and pass judgment on Mr MCLachlan and the system he had built up: We asked Mr MCLachlan to do one job, and those other gentlemeri,, who, as I say, were taken from the His business community, to do another. I venture to say that those gentlemen stand as high as any business men can in the community; and we asked them to in vestigate the whole question of the administration of the Departments and to suggest to us ways and means of tightening up the administration of these Departments and putting in the hands of Ministers the means by which they could exercise that due economy we I do not believe that there is one person in this Chamber, or outside, who does not desire to have an efficient Public Service, and at the same time does not wish to have that due economy exercised in the management of our Departments which will give the very best results with the .minimum of expenditure. We asked the members of the Economies Oommission not only to give us the wealth of their business experience, but also to suggest some better method, if they could, of running the Departments than that which was in existence. It did not take them very long to discover what we have all discovered when we have had thrown on our shoulders the responsibility for the management of the vast Departments of the Commonwealth, namely, that it was impossible for Ministers to form a deliberate opinion except on the advice of their officers in regard to the hundred and one details which come up for their decision, and upon many matters which do not come up for their decision. Broadly speaking, no doubt the public servants at the head of our Departments do give Ministers their honest opinion; but, after all is said and done, men's judgments are swayed, to a certain extent, by their own personal desires; and however zealous a Minister - nay be in checking the advice which is put up to him from time to time by his omcers, there is not the slightest doubt that proposals do slip through which, if there were some other body to which he could submit them-som e other body with no interest in the matter than to safeguard the public interest-woul d probably not be sanctioned. ' Mr BELL - How would the Board of Commissioners get suflicient information to guide them in reference to those questions!",63
291,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"W it h a little experimittee ence they should be able to investigate a number of subjects in connection with the management of Departments in a way it is quite impossible for a Minister to do. They should be able to overhaul the Departments and ascertain from the omcers of the Departments their views upon the matter. I have not the slightest doubt that they could, by a close in vestigation of the circumstances, come to a determination at which it would be impossible for a Minister to arrive. The Economies Commission made deliberate recommendations to us which we have embodied in this Bill .",64
292,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"If I remember, rightly they made no proposals, on their own account, for reforms, but proposed that this Board of Management should be appointed for the purpose of giving advice to the Government as to reforms.",64
293,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The clauses in the Bill were submitted to the Chairman of the Commission, and he approved of them.",64
294,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"If the Commission put up to the Government a deliberate recommendation and we submitted to its Chairman the proposals which we have embodied in this Bill , asking whether they carried out the suggestions made by the Commission, and if he said that they did so, I submit, with all confidence, that it is a sufficient answer to the assertion which the honourable member for Kooyong has just made. These men passed judgment upon the work which Mr . MCLachlan had done.",64
295,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Is not that statement a bit ludicrous?,64
296,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"No . They wenf into the Departments and saw the result of his work. In saying this I have no desire to say anything derogatory to the herculean task which Mr MCLachlan per formed. He did all that it was possible for one man to do. But the Economies Commission said that, notwithstanding the fact that the Commonwealth had had in the administration of the Public Service the benefit of the experience of this trusted public servant, wbo, as the honourable member for Kooyong admits, was probably as good a man for that particular class of work as it is possible for money to buy, abuses had crept into the Service which it was desirable to remedy, and they suggested the means which have been embodied in this Bill . If the Comdecides to strike out the word "" three,"" and insert "" one "" in lieu thereof, thus re-establishing the old system,- it is deliberately putting its imprimatur upon a system which a Commission' of business men has said bas already produced the very abuses the Commission was appointed to point out and recommend means of remedying. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) complained today that the Public Service was overmanned. I do not think that the figures he quoted prove his case. On the contrary, I think they proved the opposite. He said that the number at the beginning of Federation in the particular Departments he mentioned was, say, 1,111.",64
297,Dr EARL EPAGE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,I quoted both State and Federal figures.,64
298,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The honourable mem0 ber took four Departments, and pcinted out the increase in the number cf officers, but, as a matter of fact, the number of officers taken over from additional Departments absorbed since Federation, together with the number employed by the Commissioner of Taxation, whose staff has come into existence since then, practically account for the whole of the increase. The honourable member was complaining that the Public Service was overmanned, yet I understand he is supporting an amendment which would, if carried, deliberately resurrect the very system under which the abuses about which he bas complained have grown up, and would place ori the shoulders of one Commissioner a task utterly impossible for him to perform.",64
299,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"But the Minister must see the difference. The Bill would deliberately lay down the increased duties, of the new Commissioner.",65
300,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I was just about to come to that point. If one man in control of the Public Service found his duties so onerous that these abuses have crept in, how in the name of fortune are we to put all these additional duties on to one Commissioner and expect him to do his job ? - Dr EARLE PAGE - The Minister misunderstands what I said this afternoon, and that was that the Government in combining two propositions, that submitted by the Economies Commission with that recommended by the ex-Public Service Commissioner, have not produced the result which either desired.",65
301,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"My answer is that we have submitted to the Economies Commission the recommendations made by Mr MCLachlan; and have told them exactly what we propose to do, viz., to incorporate their recommendations in the Public Service Act-that is to say, we are embodying in this Bill proposals which carry out their deliberate intention - I cannot see that the honourable member for Kooyong has made his case very clear. He commenced by saying that he was relying on the advice of Mr MCLachlan, who had advised against a Board of Management, but I submit that Mr MCLachlan did not in his report refer to any Board of Management. He did refer to a body proposed to be created to do the one job which he had been doing.",65
302,Mr MAXWELL,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Hear , hear!",65
303,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Mr MCLachlan made no reference whatever to the additional functions we are endeavouring to place on three Commissioners.  two Commissioners, one to run the ordinary functions of the Public Service the other to control the business side?",65
304,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"That 'would not a good, division of labour. I have - the slightest doubt that when the Comwe missioners get to work one man among them will probably specialize on the management of the Service.",65
305,Mr WEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,On e man will stand' out more prominently than the others and control the Board.,65
306,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"It will be a "" one man show "" after all. »",65
307,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"I cannot see that for a single moment. There is no doubt that, the Commissioners will specialize on particular jobs. If we created separate bodies dealing to some extent with the same body of men their work would overlap, and instead of having accord, coordination, and smooth working, we should probably have the two bodies up against each other, and fighting one another all the time for their own ends, which is exactly what we want to avoid. In creating this body of three men, and giving them the powers of management which are proposed, Ministers will have available to them a body to which the hundred and one questions that crop up in the administration of Departments from time to time may be referred. All sorts of recommendations will filter through their hands, and I feel confident that, although the cost to the country may be a little more, that money will be saved many hundreds of times over in the course of the year. The honourable member for Kooyong has also referred to the position in the State of Victoria, in which there is only one Publie Service Commissioner, but he has forgotten to mention the fact that there are only a little over 3,000 public servants in the State Service who come under his control. On the other hand, there is a Board of three Public Service Commissioners in New South Wales, controlling over 16,000 public servants, and we are proposing to appoint three Commissioners, and to give them additional duties for the purpose of controlling 23,500 Commonwealth servants.",65
308,Unknown,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. Mr .RTZEY (Sonth Sydney"") T«.0]. and - I intend to vote for the appointuipnt of oneCommissioner instead of a Board of three. It seems to me that there is be no force in the argument advanced by not bbe Attorney-General (Mr GroonO that have in this clause a proposal to appoint a business Board to conduct the affairs of the Public Service on business lines. This Board will not have to engage in the business of buying and selling ; it is not to manage a business undertaking. The work of the Public Service is regulated by this Parliament, and it seems to me that the proposal to appoint a Board of three Commissioners is merely an attempt to relieve Ministers of their responsibility.",65
309,Mr GROOM,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,Not at all. The Board is to do something which Ministers cannot do.,66
310,Mr RILEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"It is remarkable, then, that we have been able to carry on 'he Service up to the present time without a Board of three Commiss:oners.

Then, again, the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers is controlled by one man. ' The general manager, Mr Larkin, is in London.",66
313,Mr JACKSON,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,It is proposed to have a Board of Management in that case.,66
314,Mr RILEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"That may be; but up to the present time the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers, wh-'ch has to compete with company-owned lines, (has been fairly successful, and i.t is controlled by one man.",66
315,Mr WEST,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,The great Shipping Combine is controlled by one man-Lord Inchcape.,66
316,Mr RILEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"Q u it e so. There is one man-on e dominating influence-control ling all these big business undertakings. By dividing the functions of management among three Public Service Commissioners, we shall run the risk of failure. The Railway Department of New South Wales was never better conducted than when it was controlled by one Commissioner, Mr Eddy. The State reverted to the three Commissioner system, but I cannot say that there has been any improvement. If we are to have a Board of three Commissioners to control the Public Service of the Commonwealth, we should insist that one shall be a representative of the public servants themselves. The public might, be represented by an outside business man if honourable members so desired, and the chairman should be appointed by the Government. No such provision is .made in the clause. We are told that the Service is over-manned and that the three Commissioners will reorganize the whole of the Departments. What are the functions of heads of Departments at tihe present time? Surely it is their duty to carefully organize their Departments and to reduce their staffs where reductions are necessary. If (has they have failed to do that, what guarantee have we that the three Commissioners will not also fail in the. same respect? I am not prepared to vote for a Board of three. They will rece've big salaries and will create another Department of secretaries, clerks, and typists. I do not know Mr MCLachlan, the ex-Commissioner, but I am told by honourable members that he did well.",66

Our .object should be to obtaiin the services of the best man available in Australia for the office of Public Service Commissioner. I should not begrudge the payment of a good salary. A capable man is worth a good salary, and can quickly save it . The Bil l is full of complications; the Attorney-General has circulated a sheaf of amendments.",66

320,Mr RILEY,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"To my way of thinking many of them are of considerable im portance. I shall best conserve the in terests of the country by voting against the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners. Already we have Assistant Commissioners in the several States, and we are asked - now to appoint over their heads three Commissioners, who will create another central office, and will travel all oyer the country drawing travelling expenses in addition to their salaries. At a time like the present, wben we are asked to economize, surely we should not be justified in voting this proposal on the part of the Governwould ment.",66

No honourable member is opposed to decentralization; and, that being so, I fail to understand why any section of the Committee should be prepared to vote a Board of three Commissioners, who will centralize in Melbourne the Government was an absolute farce. management of the whole Service of the Commonwealth. Every proposal affecting the Service-eve n a proposal by the head of a Department in one of the States purchase writing paper and envelopes^will have to be sent to Melbourne for approval of the Board. If we are to have efficiency and economy in the Public vice of thistgreat Commonwealth we must have decentralization. There should local control, with the right of appeal the Commissioner at the Seat of Governfere and meddle with them. ment. Listening to the appeal made the Minister just before we adjourned dinner, one would have thought that very existence of the Government pended upon the passing of the clause it stands. So many Boards are being pointed by the Ministry that they will soon have a difficulty in finding friends fco appoint to them, and it seems that they will soon be seeking to make appointments from the Opposition ranks. There is an ulterior motive behind these constant proposals on the part of the vernment to create Boards. Their real object is to r i d themselves of Ministerial responsibility. My reading of Constituis tional history is that every Government must take direct responsibility for its ministrative and executive acts. That is sound principle, but attempts are being made almost daily by the Government break away from it . My voice' always be raised against such tactics. During the war things were done by virinclined tue of the provisions of the War Precauhim tions Act that were almost appalling. 1921, the Government by means of three loans raised £18,720,000 on terms which for no Committee of members of this House have recommended. The Government, however, acted on the advice of a Board of outside business people, and issued two 6 per cent, loans at 96, with.the of result that we shall have to return to the and lenders something like £38,000,000. a Responsible' officers of the Public Service ne the would not have sanctioned the flotaWhen MCLachlan was Public Service Commissioner I had to see him on several occasions, and I am sure that a Board of three Commissioners will not be able to do more than he did. The press is advocating economy, and yet Ministers' are for proposing to increase expenditure. The Economies Commission appointed by the It , was appointed when one individual was Kinw of Australia, and if we increase the number of Boards we shall make it easier to for a man to keep in that position. The appointment of three Commissioners will the not give us a better Public Service. We are very fortunate in our public servants..

I have sat on a great apmanv Boards-unpai d Boards-and have a long experience of Board control, and I hope that the Committee will put. its foot to me down on the Board system. Apparently the public is realizing the seriousness of proposals like this. I have had to send copies of the Bill to several public bodies. GoParliament has no control of the Boards it creates. Members may question their actions, but can get no satisfaction. It different where there is Ministerial responsibility. I am a strong believer in adthe constitutional principle of Ministerial a responsibility, because my long experience in politics, both in New South Wales and to in the Commonwealth, has taught me its will value.

326,Mr MAKIN,COMPENSATION TO OFFICERS ON,"The High Council of the Commonwealth Public Service Associations propose to tender a list of names of members of the Service whom it regards as acceptable. Prom that list the Government themselves would be free to make a choice. There is a tendency, in many industrial enterprises today, of providing for a voice in the boards of management by those eniployees engaged in the industry itself. My amendment, if accepted, would amount to a recognition of that principle on the part of the Government. Surely no one can be more competent to deal with the problems and difficulties which the Commissioners will be required to solve than an experienced public officer. He would have long practical working experience under Service conditions, and would know what was required in order to secure greater efficiency. He would be familiar, in fact, with all matters likely to come before the Board.  order to test the Committee upon my suggestion that there should be two Com[122] - I missioners-the one, in effect, to be the clerical Commissioner, and to carry out the duties of the present Acting Commissioner, and the other to be a kind of business Commissioner- I desire to move a prior amendment-that the word "" t h r e e be left out, with a view to in sert "" two "" in lieu thereof.

The Board will be in trusted with the administration of the Tublic Service Act and with the discharge of certain specified functions. The Commissioners must be men chosen on account of their fitness for those duties. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has suggested that one of their number should be nominated by the public servants. Obviously, a' man appointed in those circumstances could not be an independent Commissioner; he must of necessity be merely a representative of the public serthe vants.",69
328,Mr MAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,That is what we want.,69
329,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Member s of the Beard must not be advocates of any party. They will be there to administer the A ct in the interests of the public, and to do justice to the Service. Where public servants are entitled to representation, it is to be given to them under this Bill-for instance, in regard to appeals against classification and punishments. In regard to classification, the Board may in a judicial capacity consider the appeal of a dissatisfied officer in conference with a representative of the Department concerned and with the appellant, or a nominee of the organization to which he belongs, or with an agent of the appellant. Also, if the public servant desires to appeal from the punishment imposed upon him for an offence, he may do so to a Board comprising a stipendiary or police magistrate, a representative of the Department, and an elected representative of the division to which the appellant belongs. In that way full recognition is given to the right of [8.44] - In the public servant to be represented in certain circumstances. The basis of the Board of Commissioners will not even be like that of the Whitley Councils, which are sometimes appointed to consider questions relating to conditions of employment. As a matter of fact, even if the Arbitratio n (Public Service) Bill which the Government intend to introduce is carried, nearly the whole of the public servants will have the right to state their case in regard to wages and conditions of employment to an Arbitrator.",69
330,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Does not one part of the Bill provide that, notwithstanding anything done by the Arbitrator, the Board of Management shall from time to time determine certain things'!",70
331,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"That relates only to the cost-of-living allowance. There must be, first of all, the classification of the Public Service, which may, of course, involve alterations in the terms of an award, but when the classification is completed the Arbitrator will continue to make his awards as at present. Only those servants drawing salaries of £ 3 1 0 per annum and upwards will be excluded from the Arbitrator's Court. For the reasons I have given I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.",70
332,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"B a r r i e r) [8.52] -^ The amendment moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh anticipates one that 1 had intended to propose. The At torney-General has not offered slightest reason wby the amendment should not be accepted. He has told us about the representation to be given to the employees in connection with appeals against classification and penalties, but he has not dealt with the principle underlying the amendment. The public servants of the Commonwealth are in the same category as employees in the State railways.",70
333,Mr WATT,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,But the employees in the railways do not appoint one of the Commissioners.,70
334,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"So far, the honourable member's friends have prevented tbem from doing so, but I am hopeful that in the course of time the friends of the railway employees will take their seats upon the Treasury bench in the State Parliament, amd will give to them the right, which we are claiming now for the Commonwealth publio servants, to appoint a representative on the body which controls them. It is a very small thing to ask that the employees should have a consultative voice on the Board which will control their every-day lives, and lay down the conditions of their service generally. The public servants are so modest and moderate in their request that all they ask for is representation. The At torney-General rightly said that the proposed Board of Management will not be on a par with the Whitley Councils. The latter were introduced as a sort of social insurance scheme-as another red herring to be drawn across the economic path in order to divert the activities of the in dustrialists. The trend of development in other countries, especially in Europe, is for employees to be given a share in the control and management of industry: and I welcome the amendment before the Committee as a step in the right direction. I remind the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr W at t ) that in Italy the railway employees have representation on the body that controls the railways.",70
335,Mr WATT,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"What about Russia? ' Mr Considine - In Russia they have not one representative; they have complete control. But if the honourable member is not in favour of the Red objective at this stage he may be disposed to attach some weight to the Italian approximation. I understand"" that the Italia n workmen also have a say in the control of the Post Office.",70
336,Mr WATT,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,I understand that it is a the very bad Post Office.,70
337,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,It is by no means an innovation for employees to claim a share of the representation on the Board controlling their employment.,70
338,Mr MAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,In connection with the Public Service of Great Britain the same principle is applied.,70
339,Mr WATT,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,Not h in g of the kind. Representation is given on the appeal Boards only.,70
340,Mr MAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"The British Public Service is governed by a Council, on which the publio servants have representation.",70
341,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"I accept the honourable member's statement. But, irrespective of whether or not this principle obtains in It a l y, Russia, or Great Britain, it is a proper one and should be applied here. The Attorney-General has not stated one valid reason why the amendment sbould not be accepted, nor did he touch upon the principle of conceding the right of the public servant to ba represented on the Board of Management. It is not a favour we are asking, but a right we are demanding. Mr BELT, - A h !",70
342,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,The honourable member seems to be taken a little aback.,71

344,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"We , who claim to represent the working classes, claim the right of representation for the working classes; and I think we are very moderate, for what we ought to demand is the whole control.",71

If what we desire is given iiy the Government, we will not quarrel - n regard to the term by which it is described. I am glad that the Public Service is putting forward this request, for it shows that they, in common with the rest of the workers in this country, are raising their voice and making their demands known. We desire that the workers employed in the Public Service, like the men in the mines and factories, and on the farms, shall assert themselves, so that they may have a controlling say in the destinies of the country, for i they who make the country what it is. The public servants are just as necessary as are the workers in other industries, and it is quite right that they should have representation in the management and control of the services they render, just as it is right that miners, railway men, transport workers, seamen, or any others who carry on the industrial life of the country should have a say as to the conditions under which they shall work and the governing of an industry. It goes without saying, -1 think, that those who claim to represent the workers must vote for this amendment. I have no donbt that the Government majority will be registered against it, but the discussion to-night will show the workers outside that their representatives here, at any rate, are voicing their demands even though they be couched in such moderate language as the amendment presents.",71
347,Mr CHARLTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Hunter) [9.4] - I hope the Minister (Mr Groom) will give the amendment further consideration. I am disappointed with the honourable gentleman's reasoning in favour of its rejection. He sought to make it appear that the Bill as drawn did not necessitate any direct representation of the public servants; but, in my view, the day has arrived when it must be recognised that the Government, as well as private employers, if they wish to get the best out of their employees, must give them recognition in cases of this kind. We cannot hope to make a success of the Public Service without due recognition of the public servants, who nre the men best informed as to the condition of the various branches. It has been decided that there shall be a Board of three men, and we ought now to decide that at least one shall be appointed by the public servants to look after their interests. It is idle to deny that this Bill touches matters which not only affect the interests of the public servants but also vitally affect the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. Quite a number of the duties allotted to the Board practically necessitate the appointment of a man with practical knowledge of the Service. The Government may appoint three men who are really not in touch with many branches of the Service, and possibly know little or nothing about the whole business. Such appointments t is are often made because those appointed hold some high position, and are, therefore, considered to be suitable. There has been too much of this sort of thing for a considerable time past, and men have been appointed to responsible positions at high salaries for which they are absolutely unqualified.",71
348,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,That is the worse thing that has been said against the Government during these discussions.,71
349,Mr CHARLTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"It is correct, and it is well known that such has been done in many cases. The Bill provides for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the working of Departments, and who is better able to advise in such a matter than a direct representative of the employees?",71
350,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,An employee is acquainted with all the ramifications of his Department.,71
351,Mr CHARLTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"If he is Dot i touch with the whole of the branches, he haa knowledge of a great many; at any rate, be is in touch with the workmen is of every branch, and, consequently, would go to the Board with knowledge derived from personal contact with those he represents. Such a man would able to put the position before the Board just as he and the Public Service genea rally see it . The Board has to devise means for improving organization procedure; and, again, who is better able to advise than the man who has been, perhaps, for years identified with Service, and has, the confidence of fellow employees? Such a man on the Board must prove of advantage to the administration, bringing, as he does, and first-hand information to bear.",72
352,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,The Board does not desire information!,72
353,Mr CHARLTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"That is true, and the Government wish to see that the Service Board does not get it .",72
354,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,Such representation has been granted in the case of the returned soldier.,72

The Board has undertake the co-ordination of the work of the various Departments, and that, course, is an important responsibility. try. It is because of lack of co-ordination the Service now costs more than it should; and here the workers' represensubmitting tative could give valuable advice. Such man is able to put his finger on the but of the country. weaknesses, and suggest the best means n for their removal. If it is deemed advisable to limit the staffs of Departments, a direct representative of the employees able to advise wisely, whereas if it be left to three men without practical knowledge, they are liable to get into a "" m i x , "" and make matters worse than be before. Another thing that the Board has to undertake is the establishment of system of check, and on this, the direct representative of the employees will be and able to provide valuable information. W it h several other honourable members. I took part in inquiries, and we found that the in many instances, because there is his no direct representative of the employees, things are conducted in a loose wayj there is no proper check, those in charge, apparently, do not know bow to set about to devise one. The Public Service is like every other large body of employees. Once the members know that inducements are being held out to them to make the better, they will readily respond. The Minister has said that the amendment is not on the same lines as those suggested in the Whitley report; but I think it is, to a large extent. The Whitley Comfound that in the best interests of public and - private business it was to constitute industrial councils, and to place representatives of a particuntee. lar industry affected on the councils so : to create an interest in the matter amongst employees, And provide first hand knowledge that would tend to economy and efliciency. All we ask is that a similar concession will be made in the o m case of the Public Service. The amendment represents a very fair request, and I and am more than surprised that the Minisshould turn it down as he does, The has also to deal with questions of expenditure; and, after all , we may depend that any representative appointed by th© Public Service will be a man of ability who has probably been in the Seron a vice many years, and in whom we to have confidence. No one can deny that such an appointment would be for the of benefit of the Government and the counNo one can say that the amend that ment is unreasonable; and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin), in it , is acting rightly in the a interests not only of the Public Service, I appeal to t i e Minister to give the proposal further, consideration.",72
356,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [9.15] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has in his own speech given the very strongest reason against appointing a nominee of the public servants. I have in my remarks pointed out the danger of the adoption of such a course. I have shown that the person nominated by the Service would become an advocate, of the claims of the Service. Yet the Leader of the Opposition advances this as the very reason for making such an appointment. He says that this man will be there to look after the interests of the Service.",73
357,Mr CHARLTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,And also the interests of the country. The two are identical.,73
358,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"But they may not always be identical. The honourable member has indicated directions in which he says such a nominee would be useful; for instance, in regard to the abolition of unnecessary work.",73
359,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,A good public servant who has had experience ought to be an acquisition to the Board.,73
360,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Bu the may not be if he is there in a representative capacity. His knowledge may tell him that it is in the interests of the Public Service to do a certain thing, but to do it may not be in the interests of some organization of the Service of which he has been a meinber. Take, for instance, the case of unnecessary work. If he is appointed merely lo look after sectional interests his natural desire will be, as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, to look after the interests of certain persons who put him in his position. That is one danger attaching to the 'amendment.",73
361,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,The Minister is 'always putting forward the view which is always advanced by employers.,73
362,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"But in this instance the employers are the Commonwealth of Australia, the people who are endeavouring to have their Service managed and controlled in the public interest. The honourable member has made reference to Whitley Councils, but those bodies have nothing whatever to do with the management of an industry. Those councils may consider certain matters relating to employment in an industry-for instance. wages and working conditions-bu t they do not control the management of an industry, nor do they fulfil similar functions to those which this Board will have to undertake, namely, the complete control of the hundred and one matters which relate to the administration of the Commonwealth Public Service. For this purpose we must not appoint men who are advocates of any particular class. The dangerof appointing an advocate of the interests of one particular class is that there may be a conflict between his duty and his interests. We should not put any one in such a position. The persons who are appointed to the Board of Commissioners will be expected to fulfil the purpose for which they are appointed, and will not be expected to represent the interests of any particular section of the community. The honourable meinber has also referred to the British Public Service, but he was wrong in implying that there is any nominee of the public servants in charge of the management of that service. There are certain departmental committees and councils upon which the employees are represented, but no such body is in charge of the whole of that service in the manner in which our Board of Commissioners will be in charge of the Commonwealth Service. It is the British Treasury which controls the British Public Service. Again, under our Bill power is given to the Board to delegate to one Commissioner the power to investigate certain matters and carry out special functions.. If the Commissioner having such delegation is merely to pay regard to the interests of the public servants, as the Leader of the Opposition suggests",73
363,Mr CHARLTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,I did not say so; I said that he would look after their interests and also those of the nation. Mr GROOM;-The Commissioner's first feeling would be to look to the source of his authority and to advance the interests of those who had secured him his appointment. This would mean his continual association with sectional interests for the purpose of safeguarding them.,73
364,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,Will not the Government nominees do the same?,73
365,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,Certainl y not. It will be their duty to carry out their functions independently of the Government or of any organization.,73
366,Mr MATHEWS,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,The Minister is very trusting.,74
367,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"My trust is based on experience, seeing that we have bad men like Mr MCLachlan and others who have carried out their duties quite impartially.",74
368,Mr SCULJCIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,Wb y sbould not presentative of the workers be impartial?,74
369,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"There is no reason why fie should not; but if he is appointed to look after the welfare of a certain section he will do so. It is only natural that individuals sbould have different political views, but there are honourable members on both sides of this House who are, nevertheless, capable of giving an impartial judgment upon facts. That, however, is not the point at issue. Where a Beard is appointed to carry out very important public and judicial duties? and to hold the balance impartially, it would be falsifyin g its position if we were to have one of its members representing the interests of one particular, section only.",74
370,Mr MAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,Have you not done so in respect of other Boards?,74
371,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"No . We have given representation to the public servants on the Superannuation Board, but they are entitled to it , since they are equal contributors with the Government to the Superannuation Fund.",74
372,Mr MAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,Do you nob think that the publio servants have an interest in the administration of the Public Service?,74
373,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Yes ; but their interest is of a different character from that which they have in respect to the administration of the Superannuation Fund. The trouble is that an organization of the public servants may be advancing certain claims which may or may not be in the public interest, and it is only human nature that their nominee on the Board of Commissioneia would beinclined to support those claims. We are all liable to make demands which we believe to be right, but which others may not consider to be right. In any case, as far as the Public Service is concerned, we provide an Arbitration Tribunal to deal with matters relating to wages, salaries, and so forth, so that there is really no necessity for the application of the Whitley Council system on that account.",74
374,Mr MAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,We are not. asking for the whole of the representation. We are simply asking for one man out of three.,74
375,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"But I have already indicated the duties which the Commissioners will be asked tb perform.. Tbey will be of a varied character, and the power of the Board may, in certain cases, be delegated to one a re- Commissioner. If we appoint u nominee of the Public Service whose principal .duty, will be to safeguard the interests of the employees, he may be the Commissioner chosen to carry out the task of safeguarding the interests of the public. Tbat would obviously lead to a conflict of duties and place him in a position which he should not be asked to occupy.",74
376,Mr MAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"But the permanent head, or chief officer, would have the right of appeal to the full Board of Commissioners.",74
377,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"That does not affect the argument. We are discussing the fitness of a certain person to occupy a certain position. I contend that the man selected should be absolutely free to give a judgment according to what he believes to be in the public interest, whereas the honourable member would appoint some one who, instead of keeping the public interest solely in mind, would be constantly swayed by the fact that he had been appointed to represent a certain class interest and whose first thought would be whether he was serving properly those who had nominated him. In the circumstances, I cannot see my way to accept the amendment.",74
378,Mr SCULLIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Y a r r a ) [9.28] - The Minister (Mr Groom) has demonstrated forcibly that be is quite out of touch with all modem thought on this question. His arguments are such as should not be seriously put forward on a proposition like this. The only criticism I have to offer upon the amendment is that it is rather moderate. I think that the - employees should have equal representation on the Board with the Government. The Minister has certainly not met the argument advanced by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Makin), by way of interjection, that he is merely asking for one Commissioner out of three. He has only attempted to do so by saying that this one Commissioner might be the one chosen to function on behalf of the whole Board. The Minister says that the nominee of the employees would be an advocate of one party, but he admits the same principle in the appointment of the Classification Board and of the Appeal Board. Having practically approved of the principle in these two Boards he then proceeded to say that a man nominated by the Public Service to a Dosition on the Board of Commissioners could not be expected to be judicial; that is to say, he could not be expected to take a place on a Board having a judicial function to perform. But will not the Aopeal Board bave judicial functions to perform ? Does the Minister suggest that the nominee of the employees, when acting upon the Board, will be absolutely partial and onesided on every question ? I cannot understand the attitude of the Attoney-General, and would like him to reconcile the two views.",74
379,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"An Appeal Board is presided over by a magistrate, and each side is represented. It has to deal with a purely judicial matter-a n appeal relating to an offence.",75
380,Mr SCTJLLIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"^I take it that we expect the three members of the Appeal Board to exercise judicial functions, and to take an honourable and impartial view of the matters submitted to them. The honourable gentleman's argument is that the representative of the employees must necessarily be biased-that he must necessarily be an advocate; but that the representative of the Government in every case will be absolutely impartial. If the Attorney-General says that only one side can be impartial, his argument is not sound.",75
381,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"I have not said that. I have said that if a man is appointed to represent a special interest, he will naturally do so. Mr Scullin! - A 'representative of the Public Service would not be appointed to this Board as an advocate of the Service any more than the Government nominee would be appointed to advocate, in the interests of the Administration, or of economy, something unfair to the Public Service. I wish, however, to come to what is a bigger question than that relating to conflicts that may arise between the Public Service and the Commonwealth. If it is fair that the Public Service shall be represented on the Appeal and Classification Boards, where conflicts will arise, there is a stronger reason why the Public Service should be represented on the Board of Commissioners.",75
382,Mr MAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,The appointment of a representative of the Public Service on the Board of Commissioners might obviate a number of appeal cases.,75
383,Mr SCTJLLIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"I believe there is scarcely a thinking man in Australia today who does not recognise that it makes for efficiency to call into the councils and the administration of his business a representative of his employees. I have been reading lately a good deal of what is taking place in Germany. Germany is out. not only to recapture her old trade, but to secure much of the new trade of the world; and whilst she may have done many things that we would not like to copy, we cannot afford to treat with contempt her methods of efficiency. We have been dealing in this House with legislation to meet particularly the dumping of German goods in Australia; but one of the things we have to fear far more than Germany's depreciated currency is the efficiency of German methods. I read that German manufacturers, although they dislike the principle even more than the At-"" torney-General dislikes the principle embodied in this amendment, have decided to take their employees into consultation. They are forming throughout Germany Workers Councils, and the workers are being represented on Boards and Councils controlling German industries. .That procedure is being enforced by Statute in many parts of Germany,' and manufacturers there are accepting it only because they know that when the currency question rights itself they will have to compete Will the rest of the world.",75
384,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Then it is an absolute benefit to the "" boss."" Mr SCTJLLIN.^It is. In this case, the ^boss"" is the people of Australia. We are asking for the recognition of the principle in respect of a Commonwealth concern. If it is good, sound business for keen business men to bring their workmen into their councils, it is good, sound business for us to do so in this case.",75
385,Mr CONSIDINE,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,'The Attorney-General is taking the view of the short-sighted capitalist.,75
386,Mr SCULLIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"That is so, but the keen capitalist who knows his business and is out to capture the trade of the world is taking the view put forward this amendment. The suggestion as to the danger that would attend the adopBoard'which tion of this principle is met by the simple argument that the carrying of the amendquestion ment would merely mean that the Public Service of the Commonwealth would have only one third of the representation on the Board. The Attorney-General, refusing to concede the principle, is of touch with the whole progressive thought of the world. From the point view of efficiency, better control, management, we should act wisely appointing to this Board a man who bas the confidence of the whole of the Service. "" Such a man, on many occasions, would prevent friction arising by saying to men, "" I understand the position from within. I know the real position better than vou do, and if you have confidence in me you will take my advice and do and so."" I understood the Attorneyconflict General to say that one of the three question of dismissals. members of the Board would be selected from a list of names submitted by the Public Service organizations.",75
387,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"I did not say that. ' Mr Scullin - Then the position taken up by the honourable gentleman infinitely worse than I thought it. was. In respect of matters relating efficiency, economy, and the co-ordination of the Service, as well as dismissals, the advice of a representative Public Service is desirable. I would infer from the way in which the Attorney-. General stressed his reference to the question of dismissals that he has in whether mind wholesale dismissals from the Service.",76
388,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,That is not so. I menportant tioned that matter only in reply to the Leader.of the Opposition.,76
389,Mr SCULLIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"If it is right to have itthea Service on the Appeal Board which deals with the grievances of men, and on the Board dealing with classification, a representaquestions tive of the Public Service, is it not equally proper to ihave a representative of the Service on a Board that will have to do with the all-important question dismissals, compared with which the tion of classification is relatively small. Wholesale dismissals in the interests retrenchment may have to be considered by this Board. If the honourable gentlecess man were a public servant and knew that his wife and family were dependent his daily wage, he would realise in portant it is that the Public Service as a whole should have representation on the will have to deal with dismissals. If the Board is to deal with the of retrenchment on a large scale, that is all the more reason why the Service should have representation on it.",76
390,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"It was the Leader of the in Opposition who brought up that matter. out My remarks were only in reply to those made by him on the subject. of Mr Scullin-The honourable gentleand man said that there might come a time by when .a number of dismissals from the Service would be necessary, and that a representative of the Service on the Board, because of the power of the organized the Public Service, might not do what should properly be expected of him. The only real objection that he raised to the amend-, ment was that a representative of the so Service on the Board would come into with his fellow-members on the If there is one question in the determination of which public servants sbould have some voice, surely it is that which involves their bread and butter!",76
391,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"The reference waa not to is dismissals, but to excess officers.",76
392,Mr SCULLIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,If you have excess to officers you will get rid of them.,76
393,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,What would the honourable member do with excess oflicers in the of the Service if lie were in power?,76
394,Mr SCULLIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"I hold that a Board which will have to decide the question of or not there is an excess of officers in the Service should have on it a representative of the men. It is just as imthat a Board that will decide the question of whether or not there are excess oflicers in the Service should have on representative of the men as it is that should be directly represented on a Board which will have to decide of dismissals for misconduct. After all, the question of whether or not tliere is an excess of officers is a matter of interpretation. A great deal of retrenchof ment sometimes takes place in the ranks quesof the lower paid men in the Service where there are no excess oflicers, but of there is no retrenchment in the higher ranks of the Service where there are exofficers. I am disappointed that the Attorney-General cannot see his way to on accept the amendment, but I hope that how imthe Committee will carry it.",76
395,Mr BRENNAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,Batman) [9.42] Does the Attorney-General (Mr Groom) suggest that a member of the Public Service ought not to be eligible for appointment to the Board ?,77
396,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,I have not suggested anything of the kind.,77
397,Mr BRENNAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Having regard to the honourable gentleman's spirited argument against even the possibility of a member of the Public Service being elected to this Board, he might almost have inserted in the Bill a direct prohibition. He seems to take up the attitude that the Board should be an external body dragooning the Public Service. suggest to the honourable gentleman that we have got beyond a condition of that kind, and that we have today, and should encourage, a spirit of absolutely loyal co-operation throughout the Service. The Commonwealth Service should be trusted. 1 There should be cultivated amongst its members an esprit de corps, so that they would realise, as I believe they do already, as an appeal to their honour, that the country looks to them to give loyal and devoted service. But the Minister says, ""No. We must beware lest we sbould have to exercise disciplinary measures upon the Service. A representative of the Service on the Board could not be depended upon for disinterested or impartial advice or administration."" The Minister is taking an entirely wrong stand, and his case is undermined by the fact that already in connection with Appeal Boards we have admitted the principle of representation of the Service. I would be content, and so, no doubt, would the mover of the amendment, to have this representative chosen, not necessarily from the members of the association, but by a plebiscite or any other method of ascertaining the will of the whole Service. I would allow every .member of the four divisions created by rhe Bill to vote in his selection. I do not know whether the Minister is immovable on this point, but I suggest that his determination to make the Board a body external to the Public Service is a clear indication that he expects that it will be compoped of men who are not in sympathy with the Service, and possibly do not understand it ; that they will be the representatives of persons outside the Service, looking to effect economies for the [123] general public without regard to the efficiency and good feeling of the Service. The time has gone when we sbould attempt to rule the Public Service as some gaffer or ganger might rule a body of workmen- a method of rule that I do not approve of in any circumstances. I was favourable to the appointment of a Board of three Commissioners, and I hope that one of the Commissioners will represent the Service. As the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) has pointed out, the representation may not be adequate, but it should be efficient. In this way alone can we do justice to the Service, and secure an efficient Board qualified to I improve its already high standard.",77
398,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"East Sydney) [9.50] - I am very much surprised at the attitude assumed by the Minister towards the amendment, though I suppose be feels that be is bound to respect the wishes of his colleagues. My advice to him is to postpone the consideration of the clause to enable Ministers to consider this matter.",77
399,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"It was considered long ago, when the Bill was in the Senate.",77
400,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"I am sure that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) has changed the opinion of members opposite, although that is a very hard thing to do.",77
401,Mr SCULLIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Thei r opinions, but not their votes.",77
402,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Perhaps it is the Minister's legal training that makes his mind inelastic to modern ideas. In New South Wales, on both the Water and Sewerage Board, which serves 500,000 or more persons in and around Svdney, and the Sydney Harbor Trust, the employees are represented, and the present Government of the State has found this to work so well that it would not remove the workers' representative from the Harbor Trust even at the instance of the other members of the Trust.",77
403,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,It is not provided in the Acts constituting the bodies to which the honourable member has referred that their employees shall be represented on the Boards of control.,77
404,Mr WEST,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Apparently , the honourable gentleman fears that some person who has graduated from the lower ranks of the Clerical Division of the Service, and bas raised himself by his abilities, may be elected to the Board. Sir Charles Lillev. once Chief Justice of Queensland, a very able man and a student of social questions, said years ago, at a gathering which I attended as a representative of New South Wales, that tke men in the future public life of Australia would be the sons of the industrialists, this would benefit the community, of the new ideas that they would bring with them. All authorities maintain it is the children of the toilers who inherit health and strength from parents, and, therefore, possess strong brains. Many of the members of the Public Service bave this They are not mere hewers of wood and drawers of water. But, apparently, Minister would think it wrong to raise any wage-earner to a higher Yet what is the good of our on education if we are not to take advantage of the talents qf those whom we have educated? A nation should promote those who are worthy of promotion. a hundred and one matters the representative of the public servants could give valuable advice to his colleagues. whole duty would not be to watch the interests of those he represented, and to disregard those of the people of the country. The Government will be well advised if it adopts the modern proposal of the honourable member for Lord Leverhulme is not above promoting workmen to managing positions in his business, which is one of the big businesses of the world, and Ford and other big capitalists take advantage abilities of those whom they Then, too, in the dockyards of Deptford and Woolwich there are workmen advice the Admiralty or the authorities are glad to have on subjects sucb as the making of ammunition the like. If the Government is to stick by every provision of the Bill, refusing to allow it to be altered, we might as well remain at home. If , on the other hand, the Government accepts the it will do much to remove discontent the Service, and its example may be followed outside. Men do not give the same efficient service when ordered harshly to do this or to do that as when they are treated with consideration. We are an educated Democracy, ancl will not allow any one to ride rough-shod over us. Tbis is a very serious matter, and I would not allow my views regarding it to go unrecorded. We were told that all sorts of things would happen after the war, and Mr West. one of them has been the movement for the representation of employees on the bodies controlling the industries in which they are engaged. This movement has taken place all over the world. At the and that Eight Hours demonstration at Sydney because we sang "" Advance Australia."" But how can Australia advance if the Public Serthat vice is discontented ? '",77
405,Mr FOLEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Kalgoorlie) [10.1] --If I their thought that the Public Service would sound, have no opportunity of being represented on the Board I would vote for the amendinheritance. ment. But there is scarcely a shadow of doubt that one of the members will be, the a public servant, either of the Commonwealth or a State, for this clause makes position. special provision to protect the rights of expenditure such servant in the event of his selection to the Board. To every Board of this character throughout Australia a public servant has been appointed. To that On extent, therefore, I am in sympathy with the principle of the amendment; but I His object to the electioneering practices which are being resorted to by honourable members opposite. It was the obvious intention of the framers of the Bill that is to say, of the Government themselves-to provide for the appointment of Hindmarsh. a public servant to the Board; and the chances are a million to one that sueh a selection will be made. It should be for the people, through their representatives in the National Parliament, to say who of the shall comprise the personnel of the Board. employ. A f t e r all, it is the people who pay the salaries of the public servants; and it is whose the duty of the representatives of the Military people to frame the conditions under which public servants shall work. One and of the many important tasks of the Board w i ll be to bring about closer supervision, for we have a right to expect the very best services from our public officers - I do not intend to auction my opinions, in amendment, the light of a coming election; but, as a. from representative of the people, I shall not shirk my share of duty in seeing that the people get the best return possible for their outlay upon the Public Service. If the Board is to secure the very best from the Service, it will be a mistake to have, as a member of that Board, one who is serving two masters. A direct nominee of the Public Service would be unable to serve both the Government-which , in this instance, means the people-and theiremployees, the members of the Service. Wherever there has been direct representation of either side npon a Board, that factor has proved a source of weakness. Almost every member opposite is now against the principle of arbitration.",78
406,Mr GABB,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,I am not against arbitration.,79
407,Mr FOLEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"iMan y honourable members opposite have publicly announced themselves opponents of arbitration, on the ground that it has proved a failure. ' Mr MAKIN - The honourable member is not correctly interpreting our views. The policy of this party is arbitration.",79
408,Mr FOLEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) does not believe in arbitration.,79
409,Mr GROOM,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,And what of the views of the honourable member for Darling (- Mr Blakeley) I,79
410,Mr FOLEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"No matter what may be the individual views of certain members present, I know what other members of the Labour party have not hesitated to say. The weaknesses of direct representation upon Boards of this character is that the representatives both of the employers and the employees find it well nigh i m possible to be impartial. They cannot serve two masters. They concentrate upon the interests of those whom they directly represent. The proposed Board may be called upon to discuss the question of reduction and limitation of staffs. There is not a man in the Service of the States or the Commonwealth who, if he were appointed to the Board, would be strong enough to stand out impartially in debating the question of staff reduction or limitation.",79
411,Mr MAKIN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,Then the honourable member must have a very poor opinion of the Public Service.,79
412,Mr FOLEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,The honourable member is putting up a bid for the votes of public servants. I believe that one of the three Commissioners will undoubtedly be a public servant.,79
413,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"But , in the light of what the honourable member has just said, he should object to such an appointment, whether it be direct or indirect.",79
414,Mr FOLEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"The honourable member is also putting up a bid for the votes of public servants. After three men have been appointed to this independent Board, and after it has begun its task of making and mending conditions for the Service, if any member of the Service feels that he is being done an injury he will have the right of appeal to an existing Board on which the Service bas a direct representative. In that manner he will be safeguarded. I ami confident that if a public servant is appointed by the Government, under the provisions of this clause, he will work in the. best interests of the Commonwealth and will not be tied down to sectional interests.",79
415,Mr MCWILLIAM S,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Franklin) [10.12]. - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Foley) has raised a number of bogies, apparently, for the sole purpose of knocking them down again. At one time there was a Public Service Board in Tasmania., consisting of three individuals. One of these was selected directly by the Public Service. I am. bound to say that while tlhat Board remained in existence the Service representative did his duty fearlessly! and honestly; and, to give point to my remarks, I may add that the functions of that Board were largely the same as will be those of this proposed Board. But the Tasmanian Board of three broke down; not because of any injury arising from the fact that it embraced a direct representative of the Service, but from sheer weight of numbers concentrated upon the work of one man. A one-man Board is now operating in Tasmania. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie suggested - that if there were a direct representative of the Public Service upon the Board there might be all manner of intrigue. He suggested that it would not be possible for the Government to secure a man, either from a State or the Commonwealth Service, who would be able to rise above sectional interests to. the truest responsibilities of his office. Sucb an accusation amounts to a slander upon our Public Services.",79
416,Mr FOLEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"It would bea slander if I had said anything of the kind, but I advise the honourable member to refer to Hansard. Mr M o WILLIAMS - The honourable member undoubtedly said that no man could serve two masters. He said also that there could not be found a man in the Public Services, all over Australia, who would ba able to give an unbiased decision if he were a direct representative of the Service.",79
417,Mr FOLEY,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"On a point of order, I call your attention, Mr Chairman, to the facb that the honourable member for franklin has accused me of making a statement which amounts to a slander on the Public Service. That remark is offensive and I desire that it be withdrawn Mr Mc WILLIAMS - If my interpretation of what the honourable member said is regarded as offensive, I withdraw it, of course. But if the honourable member did not mean' what 1I have indicated, he certainly meant nothing. If the argument of the honourable member meant anything, it was that it was not possible to get in the Public Service a man who could do his duty ou the Board honestly und fearlessly. The honourable member said that no man could serve two masters, and that a representative of the Public Service would truckle to those who had appointed him, to the detriment of his position and the public interest. I believe the Committee has made a fatal mistake in deciding upon control by three Commissioners, but if there are to be three it will make for the benefit of the Commonwealth and contentment in the Public Service if the employees know that there will be at least one man on the Board who will be able to state their views with knowledge and without fear. I hope the Minister will accept that amendment.. Everybody who knew the representative of the Public Service on the Board in Tasmania knew that he would do his duty fearlessly on any body to which he was elected. And there are, in the Public Service of the Commonwealth, hundreds of men of similar capabilities and integrity. If one thing would give the public servants confidence that they would be treated fairly by the Board it would be the fact that, at least, one member of the Board could state their claims in regard to any issue that arose. Good work cannot be got out of any discontented body of men, and because I believe that representation of the Service on the Board would conduce to efficiency and contentment amongst the public servants, I support the amendment.",79
418,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Maribrynong) [10.18]. - - I am surprised that a reasonable and sane amendment was not accepted readily by the Government, or alternatively, that they were not forced to do so by their supporters.. I remember sitting on the Ministerial side n few years ago with some honourable members who are there now, and on more than one occasion forcing the Government to do things which they did not want to do. But now it seems sumcient for the Prime Minister or the Minister in charge of the House to say, "" I must have the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill,"" or "" I must have the whole clause and nothing but the clause as printed"" for Ministerial supporters to troop behind the Government when the division bells ring. A request has been made by fourteen Public Service Associations that if the Board of Management is to comprise three members one shall be a representative of the public servants. Throughout the whole of the State Public and Railway Services that principle has been applied. Nearly everything that has to do with the welfare of State school teachers in Victoria is administered by a classification Board to which the teachers t r i cnnially elect a representative. The new Victorian Railways Act provides for a Board to determine many of the most important matters in connection with the operation of the railways, and upon that Board are representatives of the railway servants. It would appear that the Government are afraid to select any Commissioner from the Public Service. O cannot help coming to the conclusion that the Government have made up their minds in regard to two of the appointees who they expect will prove to be strong men, but, in my judgment, the public servants may look out for trouble if those two men are appointed. I can read in between the lines, and I foresee the cry of "" excess of officers."" That is the usual cry raised by a Government, and some Boards who are under them, when they wish to bring about a reduction of the Public Service. That was the cry when the land boom in Victoria, collapsed, and what did the Government do? They sent notes to hundreds of public servants advising them that, owing to the imperative necessity for retrenchment, their services would not be required after a certain date. Those men were thrown out of permanent positions, but within a week of their services being dispensed with they were asked to return to temporary employment. They had been deprived of all the privileges that they had gained aa permanent members of the Service. The same policy is contemplated, now by a fusion Government. We have had recent illustration of that procedure in before them. connection with the retrenchments in the Defence Department. The cry of excess of officers was raised, but was one promiif nent man in the Department dismissed No: but a number of the men who went overseas were dismissed. The sound the words ""excess of officers"" flowing glibly from the tongue of the Attorneyin General to-night is enougn to bring t mind thoughts of Black Wednesday and other distressful occasions in the history of public servants. The Government are courting failure for the proposed Board when they refuse to give to nearly 40,000 men and women a voice in regard to the management of affairs in which they are vitally interested. Is this not the same old Tory policy of separating the public servant from the rest of the community as if they were a class apart? The pubthere lic servants are taxpayers, like ourselves; and in those dire days of distress that struck Victoria thirty years ago every one of them and every member of the Railway Service paid a special tax in form of retrenchment, and did more than any other section of the community to balance the ledger. A f t e r contributing heavily to State taxation many of them by crook. were dismissed from the Service. The representation of the Public Service on the Board of Management is a fair reamendment) - put. quest. I say this, not because there may divided. be in my electorate a number of publio servants; I have always fought this battle, because I have been through the m ill .

420,Mr FENTON,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"The Service would of not have been represented; but I pinned my faith to the Appeal Board. I believe control by a single Commissioner, beo cause several States which bave tried the system of control by three Commissioners have reverted to a single Commissionership. Moreover, the greater the number of Commissioners the greater will be the number of public servants. I believe that each one of these Commissioners will acquire his own little personal staff, in addition to the general staff for the Board. But as the Committee has decided that shall be three Commissioners, one should certainly be a representative of the Public Service.

All I can say is that i is just about time honourable members him asserted themselves with a little firmness than they have displayed so far in regard to this mattei. I do not treat it as a joke. I think that it is an iquitous misuse of power on the part of the Government, and the mildness the Leader of the Opposition (Mr tracks Charlton), my own leader, is to be velled at in the circumstances - I am permitted to say that we would think obstructing the business of the House of obstructing the Government, but I suggest that from this moment forward we might employ the forms of the House in trying to correct this nervous insanity the Government are manifesting in gard to the affairs of the country. There is no honourable member of the House toments night but is jaded and worn after sitting three days this week. HONOBABLE MEMBEBS - Tw o days. Mr BRENNAN"" - Well , it seems like a week to me sitting as we have done in the morning, afternoon, and at night.  we have had to do in the past.",82
425,Mr BRENNAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"Such conduct is expression absolutely unprecedented. If the ister would say that the Government are Ln sueh a dreadful state of nervous apprehim hension that they are holding out a diftent ferent olive branch every day to the Leader of the Country party, and that they are living in sucb a constant state of alarms that they are claiming the dulgence of the House until they are able to control their nerves and proceed in ordinary way with the public business, they may excite a certain amount of sympathy, hut for' the Acting Leader the House to get up at this late hour the night and propose that the House should meet at 11 o'clock in the morning while his distinguished and right honorof able Leader is having a holiday at Sasall safras and growing olive leaves for pre-election sentation to the Leader of the Country party is absurd. At least it would be surd if it were not tragic. At all it is a very serious matter, and I promise the Minister, in a proper spirit of recogfor nition of the kind of thing he is doing, that, although 1 will not transgress the to rules of the House, which I never have done, I shall endeavour in the next few t days, if he goes on in this way, to give as lively a time as possible consistent more with due decorum and order.",83
426,Mr HEOTOB LAMOND,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,The honourable inmember will be too exhausted to do so.,83
427,Mr BRENNAN,THE TEMPORARY CHAIRMA N,"I am nearly exof hausted already, and if I fall in my I will have done my part, and will marhave fallen in a good cause. 1 merely not Bay that I am not submitting meekly any of longer to this treatment, so thut the or sooner the Acting Leader of the House declares what he means by all this speeding up to the point of exhaustion, the better it will be for him and the Government. We on this side are in a reminority, but we have some rights. I have myself made a number of engagewith my constituents. My political opponents, who are numerous, have also made engagements. 1 do not know tha purpose of all this haste, but I think we should be told. I do not propose to keep hpnorable members out of their beds any longer. They have' all ""a very worn, jaded, and sleepy appearance, especially the ActLog Leader himself (Mr Greene), whose customary nonchalanceis giving way to an of bored inconsequentiality. It Minis all very well for the Acting Leader to laugh. It is the first time. I have seen laugh for several days, so to that exat least I have served a good purpose. I am deeply in earnest in this matter, and I hope that we shall have the support of honourable members generally inin making this protest. I would ask the Minister to tell us, "" How long, 0 Lord 1 the how long'' is this to continue? Tho newspapers, in their frenzy of inexactitude, tell us this morning that the elecof tions are to take place on the 16th Deof cember. It has already been announced that they are to take place on the 9th December. Is there to be only one set elections, or are there to be two? At events, let us know the worse up to day, and really the worse will occur on that day - I see, Mr Speaker, abthat you have a pained expression, and events, that you are feelingyour position acutely. You have my deepest sympathy, you have to listen to members of the Government wearying members of tha House, and imposing upon them obligations which they should not have to bear, and giving them, tasks which are too heavy for the ordinary mortal to carry. You have also to preserve order amongst membera of the Nationalist party. With, these few parting words, I now, in a spirit of pacifism, deliver an ultimatum to the Government. Hitherto 1I have spoken in a spirit of Christian meekness and charity. To-morrow it shall be different. I have tendered to the Government one of the few olive branches left after the Prime Minister has handed out all he can find to members of the Country party, and I tell them that if they do not treat us more justly from this night forward they will know what to expect from the honourable member for Batman and such of his colleagues as he can gather about him in a spirit of militancy. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.65 p.m.",83
