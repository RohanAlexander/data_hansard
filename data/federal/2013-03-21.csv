First of all, the purpose for the process by which this measure has been is regulated is anxious about this measurepoor process. Secondly, the evidence which has of this cost shortfall raises serious questions. that this is yet another instance of a desperate has lost control of the budgetary and fiscal has been very poor and that, as a result, the The Parliamentary Joint Committee on I sit held a hearing on this bill last week. We particularly the Self Managed Super Fund evidence was very interesting. Amongst other as to whether the changes to collect the which is one of the measures contained in the method of collecting the levy through the SMSF of the Australian Taxation Office later in the change the current collection methods. That is however, that it took until the occurrence of this hearing for that information to be communicated surprising and concerning that this degree of reforms was allowed to fester in It is also noteworthy that the Self highlighted their concerns as to the basis of case had been made out that the increase was there has been absolutely no consultation between organisation about this increase. I will quote from the submission of Association of Australia. In paragraph 5 they say: We believe that an increase in the SMSF levy cap-and consultation between the ATO and the SMSF industry. for the ATO to justify any need for They go on to say in their submission that they increase in the levy which is to occur as part have this to say: The increase to $259 represents a 35.6% increase levy since it moved from $45 to $150 per year justification to SMSF trustees why increased So it is clear that we have here yet another inadequate consultation with the regulated adequately explained, there has been anxiety which observers can look at with any degree of confidence.
