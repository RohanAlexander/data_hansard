2,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Is the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories yet in a position to answer the questions I asked on the 12th March, regarding the use of imported material in the furnishing and equipment of Parliament House, Canberra?",14
3,Mr MARR,Unknown,"The honourable member asked what products used in connection with the construction, equipment, and furnishing of Parliament House and other Government works and buildings at Canberra had been imported from (a) Great Britain , and (6), foreign countries. The following particulars have now been received from the Eederal Capital Commission : (a) Bituminous roof covering, special sanitary fittings, rubber flooring, carpets, glassware, chinaware and linen for the dining-room, partly finished cutlery (h) Oregon timber, special white cement, Trinidad asphalt roofing, and some special cylindrical locks- a email percentage of the total requirements. On the same date the honourable member asked1. Is it a fact that a contract for rubber floor coverings for Parliament House at Canberra has been let to a British firm? 2. Is the flooring to be supplied under such a contract to be made in Australia or Britain t 3. Did Australian rubber manufacturers tender for such floor coverings! 4. Was any Australian tender recommended . for acceptance by expert omcers? 5. What was the reason the contract was let to an overseas manufacturer 7 6. Havo proper comparisons been made between the quality of the accepted British covering and the Australian-made covering? The following are the answers to those questions: 1. Yes. 2. Britain. 3. Yea. 4. No. 5. The quality of the oversea article was much superior to that of the article specified in lowest Australian tender, and the price was very much lower, after allowing a reasonable margin of preference to the Australian-made article. 6. Yes.",14
4,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Has the Government come to any decision regarding the date of the official opening of Parliament House, Canberra ?",14
5,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The matter is receiving the urgent consideration of the Government, because it is essential that an announcement shall be made as soon as possible in order to allow ample time to complete the arrangements for the ceremony. Mr E. RILEY - Does the Government intend to invite any distinguished person to perform the opening ceremony, or will that be done by the Prime Minister ?",15
6,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I do not think that, in any circumstances, the Prime Minister would be the proper person to open a session of Parliament at Canberra. No definite decision as to who will perform the opening ceremony has yet been made, but at the earliest possible date I shall make an announcement to the House on the subject. Mr E . RILEY - Can the Minister representing the Minister for Home and Territories inform the House of the progress that is being made in regard to the construction of the secretariat building ? I understand that the services of a number of building tradesmen are being dispensed with. If the secretariat building were proceeded with, their employment at Canberra could continue.",15
7,Mr MARR,Unknown,"The secretariat building was referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report. The Government desires to proceed with the erection of the building as speedily as possible, and would be glad if the commit/tee would expedite its report. Mr E . RILEY - I ask the Minister for Works and Railways what steps the Government is taking to improve the railway connection between Canberra and the southern States? I understand that visitors travelling to Canberra from Melbourne have to make an unnecessary detour of 90 miles.",15
8,Mr HILL,Unknown,"The honourable member's - question relates to a matter of Government policy, in regard to which an announcement will be made in due course. ADMINISTRATOR OF NAURU .",15
9,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister whether General Griffiths has been reappointed Administrator Nauru. Have not the three countries that share the mandate for that island in their - places, the right to appoint the Administrator alternately? Has New Zealand approved of the reappointment of General GrifI fiths?",15
10,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The arrangement by the three countries that share the mandate for Nauru is that each in turn shall appoint the Administrator. Australia appointed the first Administrator, General Griffiths. His term expired in June last, but he had done such admirable work during his period of office that the mandatories agreed that it was desirable to renew his appointment. That has been done. S.S. WOTAN.",15
11,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,Is the Prime Minister yet able to make an announcement regarding the claims for work done at Newcastle on the ex-enemy vessel Wotan?,15
12,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I regret the delay that has occurred in connection with this matter, in which the honourable member has taken such a keen interest. The Commonwealth Government communicated with the British Government in regard to one point that must be cleared up before a final decision can be reached, but received no reply. A few days ago, a further communication was sent asking for a reply, but so far none has come to hand. COCKATOO ISLAND DOCKYARD.",15
13,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,Will the Prime Minister say whether it is true that the Government contemplates interfering with the Commonwealth Shipping Board's administration of Cockatoo Island Dockyard ?,15
14,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The answer is in the negative. COAL MININGINDUSTRY . FORMAL MOTION OF ADJOUIJNMENT. Mr SPEAKER announced that he had received from the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) an intimation of his intention to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely:- "" The necessity for the appointment of local boards to expedite the settlement of industrial disputes in the of coal-mining industry."" Five honourable members having risen Question proposed.",15
15,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [11.12] take this course for the purpose of drawing the attention of the House to the unsatisfactory conditions that prevail the «oal-mining industry. In right honourable member for North Sydwas ney ;(Mr Hughes), ""who was then Prime - Minister, recognizing the necessity for special tribunals to deal with the troubles in the coaJ-miniaig industry, through this House the Industrial Peace Act. The coal miners have worked continuously under that legislation., has given eminent satisfaction, in - so far that the supply of coal, which is so vital to the industries of Australia, has been held up by disputes in the boards. mines. During - the last two years, however, experience has shown that one..triwere, bunal is incapable of dealing with the and Southern. lar,ge number of disputes that have arisen. ; The Industrial Peace Act provides that, - in addition to the main - tribunal, special hoards may - be appointed to 'deal with amd have asked me to local disputes. Because of the large num-ber of - cases that - await hearing the miners representatives have been advothe cating for some time the appointment .of gates had been field in such boards. One has been appointed Viotoria, - but for some reason, of I am not aware, it has not functioned. In New South Wales, many disputes have occurred during the last two or three years, and the determination of 'some of them bas .been unreasonably delayed. instance, eighteen months elapsed before the tribunal was able to deal with a disprevent pute in the coke industry. Industrial legislation, to be successful, must 'provide Tor the - prompt redress of grievances. That is essential in the coal-mining industry, because of its peculiar circumstances. The industry differs from others in 'that the miners are employed on contract and paid according to their output. There is JIO other industry in which the workers' earnings vary so much. day, men may be working on a clear at which they can make good wages, but within a few days water may intrude, faults may occur, or impurities may encountered, in consequence of which disputes may arise. Notwithstanding .the attempts made to settle such disputes some of them are not - easily adjusted, and, consequently, the men to go to a tribunal. For a considerable time the coal miners in New South Wales procrastination. have been advocating the appointment of local boards, and some weeks ago daiced a deputation ito the Tight honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) asking Mr Charlton. in - him to have local boards appointed. The the right honourable gentleman said that 'he considering the proposal, and ""would see what could be done. Subsequently, I received a reply to the effect that, owing to practical difficulties, the Government piloted could not see its way clear, at that particular juncture, tG appoint 'local boards.",15
16,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,For what districts were .and it the local boards required?,16
17,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Tih e Newcastle district in particular, but other districts not in the Commonwealth require local Ma*. HiEU.CE - The districts concerned,, I think, the Newcastle, Western,",16

I noticed in the Sun Pictorial today a statement 'to .effiect that a meeting of delecamera, in and it is rumoured that, as - a rewhich sult of a dispute that has arisen in regard to the payment for safety lamps, there is a likelihood of a Jhnld-.up in .the coal-mining industry in the near future.

20,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If that is so it Toshows that it is necessary for something face, to be done immediately to settle it. - It will be generally admitted 'that - the men at the head of the - organizabe tion, in common with most industrial leaders, wish to do all in their power to prevent industrial trouble.

21,Mr HUKHES,Unknown,"Hav e the men any .other I intromeans of - obtaining redress ? Mr - CHAKLHON - No . In - these circumstances honourable members wall realise how necessary it is that something should be done, at onee. It may be' contended by some that local boards cannot be constitutionally appointed, and I think that,, in the letter L received I r o m the Prime Minister, therei waa a h in t to that effect. Since the Industrial Peace Act was passed in. 1920 the special tribuna l appointed under it has. been functioning; and has dealt with mining disputes in a manner satisfactory to both parties, as there have beenno complaints, from the employers or the employees. Both parties have accepted the decisions of - the t r i bunal. Provision is made in the Indust r i a l Peace Act for the appointment of local boards.",16
22,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,In what section of the act is provision made for such appointments?,17
23,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,Sectio n 21.,17
24,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Yes , section 21 provides for the appointment of local boards; but the special tribuna l was appointed under sections 13 aud 14, which readThe Governor General may. appoint a' specialtribunal or tribunals for the prevention of or settlement of any industrial dispute or disputes. A special tribunal slSaill consist ofan equalnumber of representatives of employers and employees respectively,, together with a chairman. Section 21 provides for the appointment of local boards, because it was realized at the time the act was passed that one t r i bunal could not deal with all the disputes that would arise in the coal-mining i ndustry in consequence of the changes of conditions to which I have referred',, in an industry f n which 25,000' men are employed in the different States. Section21 of the act, under which local boards are appointed, readsIn relation to any special tribunal, the Governor General may appoint a local board or boards tooxercise jurisdiction, wiiiuh such limits', as are prescribed oras are denned by the special tribunal for the settlement of any industrial dispute or disputes or for the prevention or settlement of disputes which have arisem or which may arise in any industry. That provision was made as it was realized' at the time that i't was necessary to appoint local board's. Section 22 provides foT the constitution of local boards, in this way(1') A' local board sliallconsist of a chairman, and an even number (not loss than four nor more than eight) of other members. (2.) Of the members otlier. than, the chairman,: one-half shall be representative of employers, and' one-hatf shall be representative: of recognized organization? of employees. . . . Mr G. FRANCIS - Hav e applications been submitted for the appointment of local boards?",17
25,Mr CHAHLTON,Unknown,"I think I am correct im saying that application has been made onseveral occasions, but the re1 quests have not been acceded to. Legis1 lation has been passed to provide for the appointment of: local boards,, and; up to the present its constitutionality has not been questioned. Local boardscan work only ire conjunction with thespecial' t r i bunal,, which has the right to> accept or reject the decisions arrived at imconnexionwith local disputes - The tribunal 1 exercises' full control. 'The coal miners' organization' controls an industry the operations of which extend beyond the limits of one State. The Industrial PeaceAct was passed as' the r i g M honourable member forN o r t h Sydney (Mr Hughes) knows, becauseprior' to its passage^ the coal miners experienced great difficulty in gettingtlieir grievances considered. They have been waiting for two years to have their cases dealt with) by the Arbitration Court. Honourable members will admit that if a dispute which, arises today is. not dealt with promptly, conditions may have altered considerably within twelve months or two years, or at least by the time, the Arbitration Court is able to consider it,, and no useful purpose is* served' in having, the case considered after such a lapse of time. In recognition of the difficulty surrounding the situation,, thelegislation to which I have referred' was passed. It has given satisfaction to the mining industry, and has been in operation ever since the' act was passed. I think I can say that there have been no strikes in the coal-mining industry since this legislation was enacted. To-day, however, there is' dire distress in the industry through no fault of the miners, but owing to the supply of coal being in excess of the 'demand. When disputes arise, we should do everything we can to settle them. In view of the action recently taken by Parliament in passing theCrimesAct,, it is essential that we should do everything possible to provide adequate machinery for settling disputes of this character. If there is trouble in the coal-mining industry, our transport services and trade and commerce will naturally be interfered with, and if such a position should arise, the Government must administer the law on the statute book. It is provided in the Crimes Act that the leaders of industrial organizations who, after the issue of a proclamation, continue to carry on industrial fights, may be tried and, if found guilty, sent to gaol, and if not born in Australia, deported.",17
26,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,That is not,18
27,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I hope such a thing will not happen, but I am warning the Attorney-General that there are possibilities of action beng taken in the direction I have indicated. Attorney-General had a knowledge of the coal-mining industry, he would know that immediately there is a cessation in the supply of coal, which is the life-blood of commerce, industries dependent upon it for a continuance of operations, and all steamers which are not oil burners, are affected, and the trade and commerce of the country is seriously interfered with.",18
28,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,That is so; Crimes Act deals only with those actually engaged in transport and not with those employed in the various industries which affect transport services.,18
29,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,The Attorney-General is now apologizing.,18
30,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"The point I have mentioned was made clear during the debate on the second reading of the bill , and the provisions in the measure are also clear in that respect.",18
31,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If that interpretation is correct, the people of this try will be staggered to hear of it .",18
32,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If the Crimes Act not deal with them, with whom does i deal?",18
33,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If Attorney-General has said is not a subM terfuge, it shows that, notwithstanding the statements of the Prime Minister and of other members of the Government, that they would deal with these disputes, the Government has had legislation torney-General passed which is no good. Although do not possess legal knowledge, I venture to say that there could not be a big heaval in the coal-mining industry withview out the provisions of the Crimes Act the applying to it .",18
34,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,There could not be a more serious strike in Australia than one in the coal industry.,18
35,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,No . Such a strike would have a very serious effect upon the industrial life of Australia.,18
36,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,There has never been a coal strike that has not interfered with the trade and commerce of the country.,18
37,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,No .,18
38,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If those engaged in the coal-mining industry do not come within so. the purview of the Crimes Act, the measure is of no use.",18
39,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so. It may as well be removed from the statute-book. The statement of the Attorney-General If the shows that the people have been misled, because they understood that it was passed with the object of dealing effectively with big industrial upheavals.",18
40,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Yes , so far as there is power.",18
41,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,If there is no power to deal with disputes which interfere with our transport services and Ihe operations of industrial undertakings but the the act will do nothing.,18
42,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"During a coal strike in New South Wales, in 1910, the Government of the day took the coal by force.",18

44,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If a coal lumper refused to place coal on board a ship, would not that come within the act. The coal lumpers and the wharf labourers would be involved.",18
45,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown," I ask honourable members not to interject, as by doing so they are docs occupying the time which is allowed to t the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) under the Standing Orders. what the Mr Charlton - It is interesting, r . Speaker, to have these interjections,, because they clearly demonstrate that there is a big difference of opinion on both sides of the House in regard to the Crimes Act. If the contention of the Atis correct, I foresee that I very little will be done under that legislation. If a big industrial disturbupance occurs the Government will , in of the mandate it has received from people, have to give effect to its legislation. That is what was intended. We all wish to avoid such a position, and that is the reason why I have tribunal, moved the adjournment of the House. I would be recreant to my trust and to whole industry. my constituents if I did not place the facts fairly before honourable members, and point out the position in which industrial leaders will be placed i big upheaval occurs. I repeat that here. there are no more loyal men, and that there are none who strive more to prelocal vent industrial trouble than the leaders associated with this organization. I not think there are any men who could handle the difficult position with they are confronted from time to time with more tact than do the leaders of this organization. If trouble arises of the mines the workers are practically forced into a difficult position; and delay that occurs in dealing with the situation is serious. The Prime Minister would be well advised to take steps mediately to ascertain just what trouble the miners are facing. If he did so, i would probably allay the feeling of rest. I have had no private information as to the matters discussed at the meeting of the coal miners yesterday, but the fact that they met in camera and supable. plied no information to the press, tells grievances. me that the situation is serious. Nothing irritates the coal miners more than delay in dealing with the disputes that arise piece-work ? from time to time. I wish to make it quite clear that I am making no commember plaint about Mr Hibble, or the coal tribunal. The decisions of Mr Hibble from time to time have given genebe ral satisfaction. But it is quite possible for his tribunal to deal with every minor difficulty that arises. Some honworking orable members do not seem to realise that coal mining conditions are different from those of every other industry. Miners are paid not by the day or the week, but according to the amount of coal they grass. In such circumstances every impediment to production is serious. It is necessary that there should be local authority, acceptable to both emprinciple. ployees and employers, to deal with disputes immediately. The local boards are composed of representatives of the miners and their employers and their proceedings are more in the nature of a round table conference. The decisions that they give are generally satisfactory. Their reapmember pointment would render it unnecessary submit every .minor trouble to the coal and would leave it free to deal with the major disputes that affect the",18
46,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,When the shipbuilding tribunal was established provision was made for local authorities to deal with f a minor disputes; and that is what we want,19
47,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That is so. The boards really operate on the principles set out in the Whitley report. They do do not call numerous witnesses, for they are practical men who understand the which conditions of the industry.",19
48,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,Why does not the Prime Minister apply the principles of his in any Rotary speech to the case?,19
49,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"It is of little use any to argue whether local boards are constitutional or not. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) imestablished them, and their validity has never been questioned. Since they were t appointed there has not been a coal shortunage in Australia. The coal miners are not willing to submit their disputes to the Arbitration Court, for the delays very that would result would be interminThey want ready redress for their",19
50,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,What causes the trouble amongst them? Are they not on,19
51,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The honourable does not seem to* realise that the conditions under which coal miners work are always changing. The coal seam may six, seven or eight feet high, and clean, imone day, and the next day it may be narrow, or water may intrude, and hinder operations. Then again you may have an unsafe roof, ""and have to timber it righ t into the face in order to make it possible to work. A f a u l t may develop in a seam, or ' ' brass "" may be encountered. Any one of a hundred difficulties may arise in a few minutes.",19
52,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,The coal miners knew some this when they accepted the piece-work,19
53,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I was about to conclude my remarks, but that interjection renders it necessary for me to make the position still clearer. I have a lively recollection that some honourable members opposite, and particularly the honourable for Franklin (Mr Seabrook), to have constantly advocated, in this chamber, the adoption o l the pieee-work, instead of day-work, principle. complain that when daily wages aTe p a id without regard to output, the workers go slow and do riot work bonestiy. But - those honourable members are not prepared to do the f a ir thing when piece-work is adopted. The honourable member's in terjection shows that he would be ready, in any time of difficulty, to say, "" Oh , the workers knew all about it .

55,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"The working conment ditions are making it , not the coal miners. The honourable member did not hesitate, some time since, to give a vote that may have the result of making these men criminals for protesting against unfair working conditions - I feel sure that honourable members",20
56,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"He would refuse the coal miners a tribunal of any sort, and even trial by jury, in the event of trouble occurring.",20
57,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,I wish the honourable member to understand that the coal miner is just as reputable a citizen as is.,20
58,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The circumstances of coal mining differ very rapidly. A may be working in a good place today, but tomorrow it may be a bad place. Mr CHARLT ON That is so. I can before - quite understand that it is inevitable that some honourable members must be settling disputes. ignorant of coal-mining practice, but should be willing to be advised by those who do understand it ; and they should pay some respect to the opinions of men who have worked in coal mines. U n t i I came into public life, I had spent a my time in the coal mines, and I claim to know something about the industry. My experience leads me to aay, without hesitation, that the appointment of local boards for the redress of local grievances is absolutely necessar}*. If the miners are fairly treated, as they have right to be, they are as law-abiding as any section of the community. have no desire to see industry disorganfor ized and men unemployed. That is true of the workers in every industry. The men who hold official positions in the various trade union and labour organizaThey tions are the last to wish for industrial disorder. I urge the Prime Minister to agnee to the proposai that local disputes should be referred to local boards. I have n o doubt - wiatever that if the right honourable member for North. Sydney (Mr Hughes), were Prime Minister, be would not hesitate to do so. He established the special tribunal during his term of office as Prime Minister, - because his personal knowledge of the coal-mining industry told bim that it was necessary to do so. It is impossible for the coal tribunal to - deal with .every minor dispute that arises, for it is kept busy - with the big disputes on general principles that affect the whole Coirnmonwaalth. I trust that the Governw ill get into touch with the representatives .of the coal miners, ascertain the nature .of the difficulties that they axe at present facing, and take every possible step to avoid another coal crisis.",20
59,Mr WATKI NS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [11.39]. generally will - realise that the sole purpose of the Leader of the Opposition in moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this matter was to avoid serious trouble among the coal miners. I agree he with him, that the best way to ensure harmonious working is for the Government to appoint local boards to deal with man local disputes. I have had a long experience in the coal-mining industry. . 1 was connected with it many years ago, the colliery owners would agree to adopt any reasonable method of I know of the coal they miners' unsatisfactory experiences in the Arbitration Court, and of their hearty desire for the appointment of local boards for settling local disputes. l It is idle for honourable members to say l l that the conditions under which coalminers work are similar to those governing all mining operations. The Leader of the Opposition put it mildly when hesaid that conditions might change in two or three days. It is because they change coal so rapidly and frequently that there is a difficulty in providing a just method of paying the miners. All sorts of circumThey stances may arise to make it impossible the coal miner to grass a normal quantity of coal in a day. Ag we have already been told, water comes in sometimes, and at other times ""brass""' is struct. ""Brass"" was the cause of one of the biggest strikes I have known. The pointat issue on that occasion was payment for what is known as "" jerry."" Stone. 2 feet thick was encountered in the seam, and miners determined to have a fair rateof pay fixed for quarrying it. I ean well rememberalso the conditions under which men were obKged to work at Coal Creek. That was the most troublesome seam of which I have any knowledge. The face altered! from day to day. One day it rolled up and the next it went down. In endeavouring to settle the disputes of the miners who were engaged in mining it, I drew up fiv& agreements before we were able to make a satisfactory arrangement. The basis of the agreement that was ultimately signed was that a local board should be appointed, on which both the employers and the employees should be represented, tosettle troubles as they arose. The coal minersaire frequently iinfairly blamed for stoppages of work that occur on the mines. One .of the troubles that has arisen now has relation to workingwith safety lamps in certain mines. I well remember a similar trouble occurring at the Stockton Bore Hole. In my opinion-, there should be safety lamps in every mine; but payments for hewing where safety lampsare used should be adjusted. When one compares the convenient aaid safe lamp that is now used, with the naked light that the miners used to stick in their hats when working in the terminals, it seems to me to be ridiculous that tliere should be any question aa to the wisdom, of using safety lamps everywhere. Men are able to work much more freely with naked lights than with safety lamps. It is impossible to refer every small difficulty to the coal tribunal, and I assure honourable members that it is absolutely essential that local boards should be appointed This matter is so important that it should be dealt with at once.. If act-ion were taken immediately, the Government would be doing something towards establishing a. basis for the settlement of disputes in their early stages. I admit that the loeal boards should not give awards which would conflict with the general rates, but prompt action in small troubles might prevent, serious consequences. This act has heen operating for some years, and no objection bas. been, taken to. it. The local board system-, would prove to be more satisfactory to. both sides in a dispute than any other system. I shall not refer to the Crimes Act further than to say thati t seems idle to contend that a stoppage in the coal industry would not interfere with trade and commerce.",20
60,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,I have not suggested that.,21
61,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"The coal-mining industry lies at the very foundation, of our trade and commerce. Should tha coal miners cease working, our other industries would soon be in difficulties.. Therein lies the danger. Before it is too late,, the Government should establishlocal boards to deal with the little troubles which arise from time to time.",21
62,Mr BBTJCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [U.4S] - I appreciate the motives that have actuated the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) in moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this question, and the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) in supporting the motion. At the outset I wish to make it clear that neither any member of the Government nor myself has any objection to the system which has. been established for the settlement of disputes in the coal'-mining industry. Nor are we lacking in sympathy with the views put forward this morning. I have discussed this matter at length with th© representatives of the men engaged in the. industry, and I understand their desire to have the disputes which arise, from time to time settled promptly. Difficulties which in themselves are not of majpr importance sometimes contain elements of irritation and annoyance; and if settlement is long delayed, the men become restive, and it is extremely difficult for their leaders to hold them. In this connection I bear testimony to the work of the men's leaders in this industry; they have done their best to maintain industrial peace and to assist the operationof the Industrial Peace Act. That act was passed shortly after the war, and in some respects was emergency legislation, dealing with an industry which is fundamental, and on which the trade and the commerce of the country are largely based. It provides for the coal-mining industry a method for the settlement of disputes different from that which operates in other industries. Not only was it necessary to deal promptly and effectively with disputes in this industry at that time, but reasons have been advanced to show that at all times special means of dealing with such disputes are needed. I do not propose to discuss that subject now, except to say that the principle embodied in the Industrial Peace Act has been more generally adopted in Australia recent years, and I believe that part of the community which considers that the principle underlying this legislation provides for probably the most effective means of ensuring industrial peace, is increasing in numbers. There are many phases of this question with which the House will have to deal when the industrial legislation foreshadowed in the Governor General's speech is before us, but I shall not refer to them today. It is hoped that that legislation will be introduced shortly after the Easter adjournment, and we shall then have ample opportunity to discuss it at large. I propose to confine my remarks today to the coal-mining industry, and to point to some of the difficulties in the operation of the act, and some of the reasons which have led the Government to postpone the appointment of local tribunals. ""When at Lithgow about twelve months ago, a deputation representing the employees in the coal mining industry in the western district of New South Wales waited on me with a request that a local tribunal should be appointed for that district. Subsequently,  Baddeley in conference, and we discussed the matter thoroughly. It was, however, allowed to drop, until, in November last, representations Avere again made to the Government for the establishment of local tribunals. Some months ago another deputation, which was introduced by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) waited on me. The appointment of local tribunals Avas then discussed thoroughly. While I believe that the most effective way to deal with disputes in the coal-mining industry is probably by appointing local tribunals, there are great difficulties in the Avay of taking that Mr Bruce. course. There are constitutional difficulties, and also those which would arise from the Avide extension of round-table conferences. Let us consider first the constitutional difficulties. Although the constitutionality of the Industrial Peace Act has never been challenged-and possibly it never will be challenged, because the appointment of the special tribunal which deals with the coal-mining industry falls Avell within the poAvers conferred on the CommonAvealth by the Constitutionin difficulties might arise so soon as local that boards were appointed, because tlieir appointment Would not come Avithin the scope of our constitutional power. Local tribunals have not been established under the act; but unofficial local tribunals have been operating, and have accomplished much good. In one case, liOAvever-in which the matter in dispute concerned the pillars left in mines-the right of such a tribunal to deal Will the case Avas challenged. Negotiations had proceeded amicably, and it appeared that at last a long-standing dispute was about to be settled. Only the final speech by the OAvner's representative remained to be made, Avhen the negotiations ended abruptly. The owners sent their representative to Western Australia, Avhere the High Court was sitting at the time, and had the conference stopped. Similar action might not occur often; but it Would always be possible for it to happen when disputes Avere being dealt Will by local boards. No tribunal for the preservation of industrial peace could function satisfactorily in such circumstances. A further difficulty is that there is no poAver to compel either side to a dispute to appoint representatives to a board, or to compel the attendance of such representatives when appointed. Local tribunals can function only Avhen there is absolute agreement betAveen the two parties as to the method of settling a dispute.",21
63,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Would the right honourable gentleman expect the representatives to defy the laAv?,22
64,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"There is nothing in the laAV to compel them to attend a conference. Before an unofficial local tribunal can function the two parties must be desirous of coming together. Unfortunately, at the present time, there is not unanimity between the employer and employees in this matter. The miners' reserious presentatives say that, in the interests industrial peace, local tribunals arc desirwere able; but the mine-owners are satisfied with the special tribunal which, they say, is operating satisfactorily. They do want the local tribunals. They contend that their attitude is justified by the that, in four years, there have been only the moment. two disputes, and that local tribunals would tend to cause disputes. I make no comment upon that; my point is that, present, there is not unanimity, and that therefore local tribunals cannot function. So long as one party to a dispute can up proceedings by applying to the court, or by withdrawing its representatives, no satisfactory basis for the settlement disputes by this method exists. We months' time. should consider whether it is not possible to place our tribunals on a surer foundaevaded tion. This is the main reason that has influenced the Government to express the belief that it would be a mistake, the present time, to do what has been suggested. We are, however, considerWhen ing what can be done to meet the situapassed tion, and, as I have indicated, there be an opportunity within the next six weeks or two months to discuss these dustrial problems from every angle. I would be unwise to appoint local triter bunals unless there was complete unanibeen mity, and while there was doubt as to their constitutionality. I have, of course, confined myself to the position New South Wales, whence this request has come. I am aware that boards exist in Victoria and Queensland. wide expansion of local boards, functionreports ing in different districts, difficulty be caused by different decisions, and, possibly the establishment of different standards. If we are to have round-table conferences, there must be some central co-ordinating to prevent conditions and decisions varying in accordance with varying opinions of the different tribuwas nals. It would be well, therefore, wait until we can discuss the promised industrial legislation, which will be troduced in the near future. As a pracstand-point. tical solution of existing difficulties, propose to approach Mr Hibble, and ask him to take the earliest opportunity ascertain what are the particular disputes which, if not dealt with promptly, may lead to the stoppage of work and cause trouble. In any case, the estabof lishment of local boards-if that course adopted-woul d take a little time; but if Mr Hibble can deal with those disputes which contain the greatest elenot ment of danger to the community, I think that that will be the most satisfact factory way of meeting the difficulty at",22
65,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"Werriwa) [12.5] I am keenly disappointed with the stateat ment made by the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) that the Government does not intend to appoint the local boards to deal hold with miners' disputes. He has told ua that we must wait until the whole industrial position is dealt with in legislation, of which will be introduced in two or three In his concluding remarks the right honourable gentleman the issue by intimating that he would ask Mr Hibble to deal with one or two of the most serious matters in dispute. at There has been trouble for several years in the South Coast mines, in my district. the Industrial Peace Act was in 1920 I asked the right honorwill able member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), who was then Prime Minister, inif the Government would appoint the t local boards, and T was told that the matwould have consideration. There has a persistent demand for the appointment of these boards for many years, in and it appears to me that, in refusing to appoint them, the Government is in the position of Nero, who, we are told, fiddled With a while Rome was burning. If newspaper are true, there is a great deal of might' unrest in the coal-mining industry, and there is every possibility of a wide-spread industrial dispute which will affect other industries throughout the Commonwealth. In the circumstances it is futile to sugbody gest that we should wait until we are revising our industrial legislation two or the three months hence. The Primo Minister coldly analytical of the request made to by my leader (Mr Charlton). He emphasized that the Government had to coninsider the question from the constitutional If the right honourable I gentleman had analysed similarly one of to the bills that was rushed through Parliato ment earlier in the session, to deal a blow at trade unionism, the statute-book would not have been disgraced with that piece of legislation. Now, when it is a question of acceding to the request of am important industrial organization, we are told that any action which the. Government may taike must be within tha law; that the Government must take no risks. The organizations concerned want to keep the wheels of industry going. Any man who says that the average coal miner is. anxious to cease work is saying something that is absolutely untrue. Thefollowing letter, which was sent to me under date 19th June last, sets out the position very clearly:The pillar question. That is the bone of contention. aH along the line in the southern district. I can give you, briefly, what the men want, and have wanted since 1914. When Mr. Hibhle framed his award for the southern district, not under the Industrial Peace Act, he - forced differential rates upon it, namely: Headings, which is now 4s. l f d . ; boards, 3s. lOJd.; pillars, 3s. 7d. per ton. The majority of the work in this district now is pillar work. Mr. Hibhle has been asked repeatedry for a definition of a pillar-working place since 1914, but, up to date, has refused to do so. The proprietors, taking advantage of this, are getting the biggest part 3f their output from pillar working, and you will see the difference of rates as above; and they are the final arbiters on the definition, and are getting the majority of the hord work cut at pillar rates, and part of the narrow development work, usually 4s. lfd., cut for3s. 7da ton. The deficiency trouble is largely due to this defect, and most of the stoppages are due to it. Men have to hole and shoot pillar work, which is a standing joke to any practical miner in the country. The sole object of the agitation is to get some tribunal to sit and hear the arguments against this legalized robbery. Until something is done on these lines there will always be trouble in this district, especially on the deficiency question. You see the scientific way our wages are being reduced, and we have no redress, only the old, old way. The writer of that letter is not looking for industrial trouble. He has always done his best to get disputes settled amicably, and he now says definitely that, as the men have no tribunal, there is no other way of settling a dispute, except to strike. There are fourteen or fifteen pits in my district, and there is a great deal of trouble over deficiency claims. The men's complaint is that there is no tribunal to which they can readily appeal. Very often a strike is caused because a trouble has to spread through more than one district before, under the existing system, the original cause can be investigated and possibly settled. The original intention was to appoint local boards. As the Industrial Peace Act is being adMr Lazzarini. ministered I am afraid that, instead of conducing tcindustrial peace, itcause* trouble to spread. The trouble that oocurred at the Mt. Kembla mines,, not so long ago, was due to deficiency claims. The proprietors of the mine deducted dirt, with the result that many miners were only making 13s. and 14s. a shift, instead of 19s: 9d., the. minimum hewing rate. They endeavoured unsuccessfully to obtain redress. Eventually they went on strike, and were brought before ihe court under the Masters and Servants Act of New South Wales, and fined. In default they were ordered toundergo fourteen days' imprisonment. In this way men are being oppressed to the breaking point, and it appears that they have now reached that stage in New South Wales. In many of the mines dirt and varying conditions will be encountered. They may persist for three, four, or five days, and the men may continue working, knowing that in. time the conditions will alter. Because these tribunals do not exist to give ready redress, grievances are not remedied until the men, being unable to tolerate them any longer, throw down their tools. If the creation of these boards would be unconstitutional, the whole act is unconstitutional. It has, however, continued in operation for a long time. It would be an almost perfect piece of legislation if the boards were functioning. If the Government wishes to overhaul the industrial machinery of this country in two or three months' time, that is its business; but in the meantime it should appoint the boards. If the boards prove unsatisfactory amending legislation may be introduced, but something must be done immediately to keep the men at work. It is of no use telling the men that Mr. Hibble will deal with these matters. They know that Mr Hibble cannot do so. The Prime Minister may regard certain matters as being important, but Mr Hibble may think that other matters are more important. While Mr. Hibble is deciding] something of importance in the south, his presence may be needed in the north or the west. If it was worth the risk of violating the Constitution to pass an. act to deport trade union leaders and make them criminals, it is worth the risk of doing something that may be unconstitutional to keep the wheels of industry turning.",23
66,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown, The honourable member has exhausted his time.,25
67,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"North Sydney) [12.20]. - The honourable the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has called the attention of the Government, the Parliament, and the country to a possible industrial conflagration, and asks that something be done, so that should the fire break out it may be kept under control with little effort. It would not become me to speak with the same assurance as the honourable gentleman on the subject of the coal mining industry, since I have no first-hand knowledge of it. But, as he knows, I have spent a great deal of time among the coal miners, and have heard both parties in the industry state their views. It was my misfortune to be associated with the coal miners in, perhaps, the greatestindustrial upheaval that has taken place in this country. On that occasion I heard their case in detail; and as Attorney General and Leader of the Government, the troubles of the industry have been set before me on very many occasions. Prom my experience I should say that once this threatened strike starts it will be beyond the power of auy man or any law, no matter how framed, to stay it. Like some malignant disease it will run its course. But now it is compassable-it may be dealt with. I do not say that the miners have a case. I know nothing about it ; but I accept the Leader of the Opposition's assurance that they are dissatisfied. Speaking as an old trade union leader, although never a leader of the coal miners, I have never known an occasion when they were not dissatisfied. That, however, by the way. Dissatisfaction among coal miners is not purely local; it is world wide. Only the other day we were told in the press that the greatest industrial upheaval that America has ever known had just terminated by a sort of modus vivendi, after inflicting almost incalculable loss upon the industry and the community generally, and we know that Great Britain stands on the threshold of a monstrous upheaval which may shake the country to its very foundations. The honourable gentleman says that in the coal-nrining industry in Australia there is dissatisfaction, that it is widespread, and that there is no remedy outside the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act. I am sure the House will allow me to say with what great satisfaction I learned from the lips of the honourable gentleman that the act has been most effective, as I said it would be, when introducing it, in dealing with industrial troubles. My honourable friend says that outside the act there is no means at the disposal of the miners for a peaceful and legal redress of their grievances, and he demands the appointment of local boards. He says that if I had been in office I should have granted his request. My attitude has been rightly interpreted by the honourable gentleman. ""Without committing myself to an endorsement of his statement, that there are good grounds for the dissatisfaction, I say that the facts must be faced. The greatest factor in industrial troubles is not material, but psychological. Half the troubles in the coal trade arise out of the nature of man. If they say there is a dispute, there is one. If they say there are good grounds for a dispute in this instance, they make out a prima facie case, and theiT request for legal means of redress ought to be granted. The act provides, in sections 21 to 26, for the appointment of local boards. The scope of those boards is limited, their functions duly set out in the sections dealing with them. The honourable member for Werriwa (MV. Lazzarini) says that some time after the act was passed he asked me to appoint one of these boards. I do not remember the incident, but I accept his statement. The act, however, had only just been passed, and I naturally fell back on its machinery, which in effect provides that local boards shall be the creatures of the special tribunal.",25
68,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,I instanced that fact only to show that there was a demand for the local boards as soon as the act was passed.,25
69,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Sectio n 23. sub-section 6, provides that the special tribunal may remit certain matters to local tribunals. I think the honourable the Leader of the Opposition has made out, subject to any constitutional difficulties that may exist, a case for ihe appointment of local boards. must accept the honourable gentleman as the mouthpiece of the miners, and when he says that there is dissatisfaction, that it is likely to grow, and that there is no legal redress outside the act, he makes out a case for the appointment of boards, and they should be appointed. understand that the Government says there are constitutional difficulties in the way. 1 do not know whether there are. There may be. But when the act was being drafted, I naturally discussed such a possibility at great length, and provided in section 2 for saving out of the wreck whatever was possible. Section 2 readsThis act shall be read and construed subject to the Constitution, and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth, to the intent that where any enactment thereof would, but for this section, have been construed as being in excess of that power, it shall nevertheless be a valid enactment' to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power. No one knows what the constitution means. And there is only one way of finding out. If you wish to find out what the powers of the police are, the most effective way perhaps is to go up to a policeman and put the matter to the test. In that way you may find out what an assault on the police means. Why listen to long dissertations on the law ? the matter to the supreme test. go outside, strike an inoffensive man, and you will learn all about And so I say the only way to ascertain whether this provision of the act is or is not constitutional is to put it in force. Create the boards asked for. If that is done either of the parties, or both, under section 27, may submit the matter to the High Court. The High Court or a Justice of the High Court may determine whether in fact an industrial within the meaning of the act exists; - whether a dispute is impending or whether a board has exceeded its jurisdiction. these things are referable to the court. In my opinion, if a local tribunal is outside the scope of our powers, a special tribunal is in the same category. Government should appoint the boards, and see what happens. I have practised in the Arbitration Court, and have amended the arbitration law, I do not know how many times. I have advised unions to appeal to the court, and know something about the arbitration law and Mr Bughes. We industrial matters generally. My experience is that the most effective machinery is that which is most flexible, and the most flexible is the machinery set out in the Industrial Peace Act. It contemplates the creation of district councils, composed of members of the workers' and I employers' organizations, dividing the whole Commonwealth into districts in which employees and employers would have quasi-legal powers, and, in fact, legal authority to deal with certain matters. They would be overlords of industrial matters within the Commonwealth. The Industrial Peace Act, in my opinion, is framed on right lines, and the boards asked for by the Leader of the Opposition should be appointed. In expressing a doubt as to the constitutionality of the act, however, the Government strikes a most serious blow at it . For its creator or the inheritors of its creator to declare the act ultra vires of the Constitution, is to create an almost insuperable difficulty. The Government says, in effect, "" This act is no good, and so we do not, we dare not, put it into force."" That is an invitation to challenge its validity. If those who have to administer it said, "" We believe in it , "" then in all probability their action would not be challenged. I do not know that the employees in this case Put would challenge a reference to a local Just board. They might, but I should not police- care twopence if I thought that the it. appointment of a board was the best way to find an outlet for the grievances of the employees. I would let them see that the law really provides them with some sort of remedy, and would do what they ask. There is one other subject about which I wish to speak, and it is this: Although time flies very rapidly, it may not have dispute escaped the memory of honourable members that we went to the country on a matter very similar to that which the All Leader of the Opposition has said is likely to arise if the unrest in the coal industry is not allayed. The condition of affairs then existing arose out of The a firb which at one time could have been covered by a bushel basket. But by judicious fanning, and through other causes about which I do not wish to say anything just now, it grew into a conflagration that covered the whole industrial heavens. We went to the country to see whether, above everything else, we could not ensure industrial peace. As a result we have the Crimes Act, which says the people, "" If you break the peace regard to matters of trade and commerce, transport or industry, then you must look out!"" We have made a new law to' punish those wbo break the industrial peace. That is all we have done since elections to ensure industrial peace. Leader of the Opposition this morning asked the Governmenb to do something else. He says, ' ' If you do not do what I ask there may be trouble which may bring certain people under the Crimes Act."" The Attorney-General says, "" No the coal-miners will not come under it."" He may be right, but if requires he is it is the most complete conof demnation of the act that could possibly be conceived. The position is most motion ? serious if a monopoly or a scarcity of coal can be brought about. Let us remember that if the coal-miner says, "" That coal is black,"" it is black, whether it is brown or any other colour. If he says that "" black,"" then every engineman on our Question put. railways, every man wanting coal to run his ship or his factory, will be affected. If that is not a blow at commerce, industry, and transport, do not know what is. So I say the that if the act does not deal with kind of thing it ought to be amended without delay. I know what a strike of this kind means. Strikes aimed at transon port are most deadly and insidious. was drawn into such a strike when the organization with which I was connected had nothing on earth to do with the pute, and, in my desperate efforts maintain industrial peace, I subsequently became almost the head and front of the offending.",25

My answer to him is that the Leader of the. Opposition has assured us to the contrary, and he is the spokesman",27
78,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The Government of New South Wales could appoint a local tribunal, but the miners are a Federal organization, and will not subscribe to",27
79,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I was coming to that.,27
80,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If we had a Federal controlling the whole of the general conditions, and in addition a State organization, the two would clash.",27
81,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Quite so. With the honourable gentleman's qualification and the Prime Minister's explanation, the position is that a reference to a State tribunal would not be effective, because the coal-miners are members of a Federal organization. I say, from my own experience, that the miners of New South Wales will not accept it. That is wby we made provision for these local boards. Why the miners will not acccept the Slate tribunal I do not know.. more I say that the basis and real foundation of half our industrial trouble is psychological. Men have inherited traditions and hatreds, and have memories of wrongs done to them which they cannot forget in a minute or in a year. In my opinion, the Government ought to take action. Their attention has been called by the spokesman of the miners to a condition of things which he declares to be grave. We are shortly to have a recess which may last for some weeks. If in the interim this little conflagration should become a mighty industrial fire, there will rest upon us a terrible responsibility, because, as I have said, no law can put out an industrial fire once it reaches a certain magnitude. I have led strikes when more drastic legislation than any we bave passed was directed against strikers. I refer to the Wade Act of New South Wales. I know what I am talking about. Once the trouble goes beyond a certain point we cannot stop it. The fire must burn itself out; the disease must run its - course. It is a simple thing for which the Leader of the Opposition asks. He asks for the appointment of local boards under the Industrial Peace Act. The Government says that that would not be constitutional. I do not care two straws whether it is constitutional or not. If the Government will act by appointing local boards it will have done all it can. do. It will not be placed in the position of giving men wbo ask for bread, a stone. It will not be merely talking about law when men ask for the redress of their grievances. If it is not constitutional to do what I suggest-if our powers do not enable us to deal with such a matter as this in the way for which the act provides^-tben we must amend the constitution to give this Parliament ample authority. If we have no power to preserve industrial peace, then we must get Mr Bughes. it, and without delay. The Government have a majority, and should at once pass sucb an amendment and put it before the people.",27
82,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra) [12.43] - I do not intend to delay the House long, as I wish to give an opportunity to the Attorney-General to say a few words in reply Once to the debate. The discussion has emphasized one or two very important general points. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has asked that a pending dispute, which may be of great magnitude and. involve this country in conditions such as we have experienced in the past as the result of a coal strike, should be referred to a board. The Government turns a deaf ear to the request. The Prime Minister has said that what the Leader* of the Opposition has proposed is the proper way to deal with the question. He gave it his blessing, but he refused to give it his consent. Tbat is the kind of thing which leads from one difficulty to another. Tbis wolicy of inaction by the Government is the cause of mucb trouble. It went to the country, as the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) has said, with a flourish of trumpets, and claimed that it was the one and only Government to bring about industrial peace. It bas returned from the eountry, and has done nothing yet for industrial peace. It bas provided punishments for strikes, but nothing to prevent tbem. One of the most serious things which the bead of a government ean do is to challenge the constitutionality of an act wbicb it bas been called upon to administer. Tbat is practically what the Prime Minister did today. He said that a local board appointed under a section of the act would be unconstitutional, and that, indeed, if-the act itself were challenged, it, or a large portion of it, might be declared to be unconstitutional. Yet that measure has done more than any other legislation passed by this Parliament to preserve peace in the coal mining industry, which, of all industries, was considered one of the most difficult to manage. I dissent from the statement of the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) that the bulk of the disputes are of psychological origin, and are based on old hatreds and memories of past wrongs. My answer to that is that existing wrongs-rea l grievances that occur in the every-day lives of men working' in the bowels of the earthare the causes of friction and enmity, and unless these real and immediate wrongs and grievances are remedied quickly they develop into serious disputes. The Prime Minister advanced two reasons for the non-appointment of local boards. Firstly, he said, such boards would be unconstitutional. As the right honourable member for North Sydney said, the only way to test - whether or not the legislation is constitutional is to put it in operation. The law providing for ' the appointment of boards is on the statute-book, and it is the duty of the Government to test it in practice. I submit, however, that if a board, created under the act, would be unconstitutional, the act itself is unconstitutional. The Prime Minister's second excuse for not putting the Industrial Peace Act into full operation was that the Government proposes to submit to Parliament legislation upon industrial matters,, and the miners are urged to wait until this, new panacea is evolved. This policy of waiting may land the country in serious trouble. When, on another occasion, we asked that the problem of unemployment be dealt with by the Government, we were told towait until the Royal Commission on Insurance had submitted its report. Thiscounsel of delay is futile when problems of industrial unrest and unemployment are so pressing. The Prime Minister told the House that, twelve months ago, a deputation waited on him at Lithgow, and made the same request that was .put forward by the Leader of the Opposition today. Yet we are asked to wait another two months while the Government further ponders the problem. I warn Ministers that there is trouble looming on the coal-fields, particularly in New South Wales, and if it develops in that State it will quickly spread to other places. If trouble does break out, the Government already has the Crimes Act with which to punish the workers. The Attorney-General said that no employee in the coal-mining industry will be affected by that legislation. Technically, the honourable member's statement may be correct; I do not dispute his interpretation, of the law; but if it is rigbt it emphasizes those absurdities in the Crimes Act, to which the right honourable member for North Sydney drew attention. If trouble occurs on the coal-fields, and the miners go on strike and declare the coal black, they will be immune from any punishment under the Crimes Act; but an engine-driver who, in loyalty to his comrades, refuses to handle "" black"" coal may be put in jail. What justification can be offerecT for such illogical discrimination? This legislation was only makebelieve, intended to save the faces of the. Government after a stunt election. Honourable members opposite went before the electors and talked of industrial peace, although they represent those forces in this country that have resisted every effort by the workers to establish machinery for the peaceful settlement of industrial troubles. If honourable members will cast back their memories a quarter of a century to the inception of wages boards and arbitration courts, they will find that every request for the establishment of pacific tribunals was fought and resisted in every possible way by the employers, and the arbitration machinery was put on the statute-book only by the strength of organized labour. Even now, only when the workers strike, or threaten to strike, can they get redress by constitutional means. Rut during the recent election the press was filled with lies about the workers flouting constitutional means, anddeclining to submit their grievances to peaceful arbitrament. Every request by the workers for the estabKshment of constitutional tribunals has been denied. Yet the Crimes Act has been placed on the statute-book in order that men who go on strike to secure justice may be declared criminals. The Industrial Peace Act bas been in existence for years. Its purpose is to ensure industrial peace. But its operations are limited, and, in many cases, nothing is done to remedy long-standing grievances until something serious happens. Unions have spent thousands of pounds in trying to get their plaints heard by the tribunals established in accordance with the law of the land, and the employers have raised all sorts of dirty, mean quibbles in trying to prevent their reaching the court, or, if they got that far, incontesting the legality of the proceedings. And still the workers are told that they are the law breakers, and that they should abide by constitutional means. The aefion of the Prime Minister today was merely a repetition of old history.",28
83,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [12.50] - The importance and urgency of the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition must be recogthe nized by every honourable member. Government earnestly desires to do thing possible to utilize existing mato its functioning. chinery for the maintenance of industrial peace, but some honourable members apputes pear to bave misunderstood the explanainterstate tion given by the Prime Minister. The Industrial Peace Act cannot function without the co-operation and consent both sides in an industry. Both ployers and employees must appoint retionally. presentatives to sit on the special tribunals and local boards. Although those boards are appointed by the Governor General General they must be composed of reprecould sentatives of employers and employees, and no meeting can be held unless a statutory quorum is present. Accordingly, if either the employers or the employees fuse to appoint representatives to the board, or to allow their representatives function, the board cannot operate. The employers in the coal-mining industry have been requested to join in the apthe pointment of boards; but, unfortunately, pute. in the northern, southern, and western districts of New South Wales, they have, for reasons which they set forth, and which I shall not attempt to canvass at this stage, declined to have anything to do dispute. with local boards. Therefore, it is possible for the Government to appoint such boards.",30
84,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Does the Attorneyemployers General suggest that if boards pointed either party would abstain from attending ?,30
85,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Undoubtedly . Governor General may appoint a board coal consisting of persons nominated by parties, but unless a quorum attends the board cannot function. The employers have stated definitely that they will act or appoint representatives to act them on local boards.",30
86,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,If they adopt/ that attitude it is time the Government did something to put them in their place.,30
87,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I am discussing now the powers of the Government under existing legislation, and I am pointing out that the co-operation and consent of the two parties are the first essentials. In the absence of the consent of the employers, it ' is impossible to appoint a local board. The constitutional difficulties mentioned by Prime Minister do not directly arise The at the present time; they relate, not to everythe mere appointment of the board, but The power of this Parliament in relation to industrial disis restricted to disputes which are in character. The Industrial Peace Act necessarily provides that local boards shall deal only with interstate of disputes. If such a board does deal with eman interstate dispute it acts constitu",30
88,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Does the Attorneysay that the Arbitration Court not appoint a local board to inquire into and Teport upon a dispute?,30
89,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"I am coming to that repoint. A dispute affecting a particular mine is the kind of matter with which local to boards are intended to deal. If a board's jurisdiction were challenged by one party, the question would arise as to whether trouble was part of an industrial disI f it were, it could be rightly dealt with by the local board, as many such matters are dealt with by the Arbitration Court, but only because they are part of or incidents in an interstate The constitutional difficulty imassociated with the Industrial Peace Act does not appear on the face of the statute, but is incidental to its operation. That was illustrated recently when the obtained an injunction or prowere aphibition from the High Court.",30
90,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Does. the AttorThe ney-General know of any dispute in a mine which might not so extend as the to become interstate in character?,30
91,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"A dispute in a mine as to, say, the working of a particular not seam by the men employed in that mine, for is not in itself an interstate dispute. There may be, however, an interstate dispute involving a particular local dispute. In each case the nature of the dispute is a question of fact to be determined by the court. The matters with which local boards are intended to deal are essentially of a local character, and that brings us face to face with the real difficult}', namely, that the Commonwealth powers are limited to disputes extending beyond the limits of one State. We have to face the facts as we find them. The employers refuse to appoint representafor tives to sit on a local board; therefore; no board can be appointed, or, if aporable pointed, it cannot meet with a quorum. low:The act contains no provision for compelling persons appointed by the Government to sit on a board; it is therefore impossible for a board to be appointed under existing circumstances. The Prime Minister has said, however, that the Government will take steps to utilize fully the existing machinery by asking Mr . Hibble to arrange for an early hearing by the special tribunal of the disputes which are at present causing irritation amongst the coal miners. Fortunately, both sides have accepted the jurisdiction of the special tribunals, and it is hoped that they will continue to function. The Prime Minister's proposal offers an immeCommission diate means of dealing with the situament tion, aud is much preferable to plunging into difficulties which would probably lead to litigation, delay, expense, and disits appointment. I submit that the Governplete ment is adopting the wisest course in available. seeking to use to the full , and immediately, the existing machinery, which is acceptable to both sides.

(6) To report to the Treasurer the amount of compensation, which, in the opinion of the board, should be paid to the various claimants, and to suggest the method by which reductions should be made in the event of the total compensation proposed being greater than the sum available to meet it. It was further indicated to the board that the bases of assessment should conform with the principles laid down by the British Royal appointed to deal with the assessof similar claims of British nationals resident in the United Kingdom. 2, 3, and 4. The board has not yet completed investigations and assessments. The cominformation asked for is, therefore, not 5, 6, and 7. As indicated in my reply to question Jfo. 1, compensation is being assessed in accordance with the principles laid down hy the British Royal Commission. The documentary evidence furnished by the claimants, in Standing the majority of cases, was sufficient to enable those principles to he applied. In a few cases, however, it was necessary for the board .to seek additional evidence. 8. The claimants had no legal claim for compensation against the Commonwealth. Any payments made are purely ex gratia, and it is that the method of assessment adopted secured to the claimants full consideration of their claims. 9.

107,Mr MARR,Unknown,"On the 11th March the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman), asked whether consideration had been given to the series of grave charges made by Mrs N ; Francis in the Aussie magazine, and by Mr Robertson, concerning the alleged maltreatment of aborigines by Japanese and others in the northern parts of Australia, and, if so, what action had been taken or was proposed to be taken in connection with the matter. At the time of the honourable member's inquiry the articles in question had not been seen by the Minister for Home and Territories, but an opportunity has since been afforded him of perusing them. The articles demonstrate clearly that the allegations made are as to the treatment of aborigines in 'Queensland. No reference whatever is made therein to the aborigines of the Northern Territory, unless one vague reference to "" the No r t h "" could be construed as such, but, even in this case, no particulars are given and no evidence connecting that reference with the Northern Territory is furnished. As previously stated in the answer to the honourable member's question, the care of the aborigines within the various States of the Commonwealth is the responsibility of the respective State Governments, and it would appear that the allegations made by Mrs Francis are the concern of the Government of Queensland and not of the Commonwealth.

109,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,"On the 18th March, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) asked the following questions:1. Were certain ex-soldiers removed from civil State mental hospitals during the year 1918, and placed in a military mental hospital? 2. If so, why? 3. Did the Commonwealth bear the cost of maintenance, medical, and other treatment of such patients in the No. 16 Australian General Hospital? I am now in a position to furnish the f o l lowing replies:1. Prior to the opening of No. 10 Australian General Hospital, the soldier mental patients were admitted to State institutions, including the overseas ward for service men at Royal Park. It then became the policy of the Department of Defence to concentrate its mental patients in a special ward in No. IC Australian General Hospital. 2.

110,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,Unknown,"On the 17th March the honourable member for Hume  ravages of the borer in Australian timber and asked whether the Government would cause an investigation to be made with the object of eliminating the pest. I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that this question concerns the Department of Health only in this way: The Quarantine Act is designed to prevent the introduction into the Commonwealth of plant diseases and insect pests, including such things as timber borers. It is probable that many kinds of timber have their own specific parasites, while other parasites are common to different countries or to different classes of timber. New phases of this question, therefore, are constantly arising and have to be dealt with as they arise through the detection of these borers in imported timber. Each new variety of parasite has, in its turn, been dealt with when discovered, but it is to be expected that others will from time to time be found under one of the many conditions in which wooden articles arrive in the Commonwealth as imports. No general principles can be formulated adequate to cover all possibilities, but the greatest care is being taken to detect new channels of danger and to deal with these as detected. The major portion of the borer problem today, however, is the occurrence over a wide area and on a considerable scale of borer insects, either indigenous to or long established in Australia. As stated by the Prime Minister in the House on the 22nd instant, the whole question of carrying out investigations regarding white ant and borer pests will be referred to the Institute of Science and In dustry when reconstituted. KYOGLE TO BRISBANERAILWAY .",34
111,Mr HILL,Unknown,"As a number of questions have been asked in the House from - time to only a time in connection with the construction of the Grafton-Kyogle-South Brisbane Railway, I desire to state that the work of connecting Sydney and Brisbane by a standard gauge railway is governed by an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales aud Queensland, dated 16th September, 1924, which agreement was in that year ratified by the Parliaments of the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Queensland. Under the agreement the work i9 vested in a railway council, consisting of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, the Chief Railways Commissioner, New South Wales, and the Commissioner for Railways, Queensland. The council has entire control of the work, and determines the order and the terms and conditions under which the works are to be carried out. Under the agreement, the cost of the works is, in the first in stance, provided by the Commonwealth. The States of New South Wales and Queensland pay their quota on a population basis, the Commonwealth contributing one-fifth, and, in addition, for the time being bearing the quota which, had Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia been parties to the agreement, would have been borne by those States. The work consists of re-laying and strengthening of the railway between Grafton and Kyogle, and the construction of a railway from Kyogle to South Brisbane. The work between Grafton and Kyogle, which is being carried out by the Chief Railways Commissioner for New South Wales, acting as agent for the council, is now well in hand. Considerable work has also been done by the Commissioner for Railways, Queensland, acting as agent for the council, in the vicinity of Rocklea towards South Brisbane and also towards the border. Last year the Railway Council invited tenders, which closed on the 1st September, 1925, for the construction of two portions of the railway, 26^ miles being in New South Wales, and 60J miles in Queensland. One tender was submitted for the work in Queensland, and two for the work in New South Wales. At the time of the closing of the tenders, sealed estimates by the railway construction engineers of New South Wales and Queensland were also submitted. The total of the two sealed estimates was considerably lower than the total of the two lowest tenders. The council proposed to arrange that the work be undertaken by the Bailways Commissioners of New South Wales and Queensland respectively, and advised the parties to the agreement accordingly. These proposals formed the basis of negotiations between the Commonwealth Government and the States of New South Wales and Queensland. A conference of the representatives of the three parties was held in Melbourne in January last, resulting in an understanding that the sealed estimates of the chief railway construction engineers should be regarded as a firm tender, subject to the following stipulations: 1. The payment to be on a quantity basis according to measurement, &e., at rates shown in the schedule of quantities and prices in the sealed estimate of the Chief Railway Construction Engineer. 2. Provision to be made for adjustment for or against the State authorities in the event of increase or decrease in wages, or decrease or increase in hours of work as may be fixed by award of Arbitration Court or industrial tribunal, or in sueh other manner approved by the unanimous decision of the council. 3. Contract documents to include sueh other provisos as are usual in railway construction contracts regarding carrying out of the work, &c., as determined by the council. After several conferences between the Railway Council and the Crown Solicitors of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, and Queensland, contract agreements have now been signed by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth, and the respective Premiers on behalf of the States of New South Wales and Queensland, whereby the works will be carried out at the rates shown in the sealed estimate. If the total of the two lowest outside tenders is compared with the total of the amounts for which the respective States, on behalf of their Chief Railway Construction Engineers, have now contracted to do the work, it will be seen that a considerable sum of money is saved to the Commonwealth and the other parties to the agreement. The lowest public tenders, including departmental supervision, which necessarily bas to be incurred, and which must be added wben comparing with the State contract price, were as follow:New South Wales. Tender .. . . f 1,011,975 Departmental supervision 32,000 £1,043,975 Queensland. Tender .. ...£1,293,941 Departmental supervision 40,000 - £1,333,941 £2,377,916 The prices submitted by States wereNew South Wales .. .. £1,045,806 Queensland .. .. 1,130,142 £2,175,948 The saving on the lowest public tenders is therefore £201,968. Compared with the lowest public tender in Queensland, the contract with the State represents a very large saving. Compared with the lowest public tender in New South Wales, the contract with the State represents an increase of approximately £1,S00, and' in this latter case the council bas not accepted the lowest tender, but has decided that the preferable course would be to have the work carried out in the same way that it is being done in Queensland. The estimated cost of the whole work was £3,500,000, - and under the Grafton to South Brisbane Railway Act .1924 authority is given for that sum to be advanced by the Treasurer to the railway council in control of the work. The estimate of £3,500,000 was prepared by the Royal Commission on the Uniform Gauge in 1921 without proper surveys; but, wben the tenders and sealed estimates were received, the railway council prepared a full estimate based on reliable data, and the work is now estimated to cost £4,000,000. A bill will be introduced to Parliament shortly to provide for the extra £500,000. In conclusion, it might be emphasized that the agreement recently made with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, and which will later be placed before this Parliament for ratification, places those Governments in the same position as private: contractors, and they are bound to carry out the work at the rates stipulated in their contracts.

I draw attention .to the reduction made in this item, and also to the Government's policy in - connection with British - preference. In the last tariff the duties .imposed on silk piece goods were 15 per cent., 15 per cent., and 20 per cent. Britisb, intermediate .and general, respectively. In the proposals now submitted they ane I'O per cent., 12\ per cent., and l=7i pelcent, respectively. .In otber words, - the general duty has been reduced by 2 | - per oent., and the British duty by .5 per cent., which increases the British preference. MT . € . RILEY (Cook) [SJ]. - Tb e 1-921tariff provided for .duties of 15 per oent., 15 per cent, and 20 per cent., - British, intermediate, and general respectively. W it h in the last two years a silk weaving m ill 'has been ^established in Sydney, more than £10,000 capital beimg employed in it . It seems - strange itbat just - at the time that the f actory bas 'Overcome its in it i a l difficulties it should be further hampered by having the duties reduced. Rather should they be lef t «s they are, not only to encourage the m i ll to which I have referred, but also to assist in establishing further silk weaving mills in Australia. I admit that the argument wbicb - has been used in «onnexion with Australian cotton and wool - spinning and weaving factories does not - apply to silk weaving factories, because we - do not grow the raw material in this country. Nevertheless, we sbould do all we can to promote the establishment of factories to deal with silk - from the spinning stage onward. Even if tjbe Minister is determined to reduce the British tariff from 15 per cent, to 10 per cent., there is no justification for a reduction of the duty - on foreign goods. Australia imports, chiefly from - Japan, silk goods to the value of £5,000,000 per annum. We should encourage our own industries rather than import Japanese goods. I suggest that this matter be referred to the Tariff Board, with a view to assisting the local industry by allowing the raw material to enter free of duty. There is little justification for proposed reduction of duty.  Trade and Gustoms) [3.5] - The Tariff Board has investigated this matter, and these reductions are made in accordance with its report. I am aware that there is a small silk-weaving factory in New South Wales, but I do not know whether it makes one special line of silk only. The Tariff Board in its report stated that no local industry would be affected by this proposal. "" Mr Watt (Balaclava) [3.6] - I ask the Minister whether the 15 per cent. British duty which it is now proposed to reduce to 10 per cent, was not merely a revenue duty, and not one imposed to protect an Australian industry. Apart from its effect, I understand that the duty was imposed because silk clothing was supposed to be a luxury. If the object of this reduction is to give the British manufacturer a greater proportion of our silk trade, the Minister sliould not reduce the whole of the three columns. I think that he should give the committee some further explanation, apart altogether from answering the question raised by the honourable member for Cook (Mr. C. Riley), whose desire is to still further protect the industry to which he has referred. It would appear that we are throwing away revenue for no apparent purpose.",37
116,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [3.8] Although the Minister said that the intention was to increase the British preference, the additional advantage is only 2-t per cent. It would be better if he would - agree to the general tariff remaining at 20 per cent., instead of reducing it to 17-J per cent. That would give a preference of 10 per cent, to the British and more protection to the Australian manufacturer. Most of the competition is in - connection with the general tariff.",38

123,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"It may not always remain inoperative. I hope that the Minister will accept my suggestion.  port the suggestion made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton), as to give effect to it would not make much difference to the consumer, and would provide additional revenue. There is no need for a great difference between the Britisb and intermediate tariffs so far as silks are concerned, because the silks, made in Great Britain are different from those made in France, and there is no great competition between tbem.  Trade and Customs) [3.12] - In view of what is practically the unanimous desire of the committee, I am prepared to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton). I therefore move That sub-item D be amended to read :""And on and after 25th March, 1026, (D) Silk, or containing silk, or having silk worked thereon, except piece goods enumerated in sub-items AA and F ad valorem 10 per cent. British, 124 per cent, intermediate, and 20 per cent, general. The intermediate tariff is at preseut inoperative, and it will continue to be so until proposals are brought before Parliament. Amendment agreed to. Mr J. FRANCIS (Moreton) [3.13] I desire to refer to item lOoif. For a long time the industry concerned has been subjected to unfair competition from countries where cheap coloured labour is employed. If we are to maintain the high standard of living which we have set up, we must make it possible for industries to pay Australian rates of wages. Before this tariff was introduced, many of the mills in Australia found great difficulty in carrying on. But the amended tariff has benefited them considerably; some Queensland mills have now six months' work ahead of them. The Australian mills have been handicapped greatly because of the importations, mostly from Japan, of large of inferior material. Some of it was almost rubbish, yet it was got up in such a way that it-was purchased in large quantities by Australian housewives, who realized later that it was not so good as it was represented to be. I wish it to be understood that I am not opposed to protection, especially so far as this industry is concerned; but I hope that this tariff will not mean that the Australian consumer will be called upon to pay more for materials not manufactured in Australia. I refer to alpacas, silesias, mchairs, and lustres. These goods are not manufactured in Australia, but they contain wool. I have made careful inquiries, and have ascertained that there is not the slightest prospect of them being manufactured in this country, manufacturers having their hands quite full with other work. I should like to know if the articles referred to come under item 105F (3), dutiable at 15 per cent. British, 20 per cent, intermediate, and 25 per cent, general. ",38
124,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Perth) [3.17] - In view of the vote taken yesterday on cottonBy omitting the whole of sub-item (B) and inserting in its stead the following sub-item :"" (B) Trimmings and Ornaments n.e.i. (excepting Buckles, Clasps, and Slides, of metal set with nets, Hats, Shoes, or wholly of gold n.e.i.; Fringes n.e.i.; ings ; Ruchings; Tinselled Belting for apparel not elsewhere cut to lengths for belts tweeds, and the very obvious determination of the committee to support the extra textile duties, I do not propose to speak against any of the remaining textile items in the schedule, but I wish to make it quite clear that this does not in any way indicate a change of opinion on my part. I am convinced that the imposition of these duties will bring about a revulsion of feeling, and, eventually, a demand for their withdrawal. I hope that the committee will give careful attention to the extra duties imposed in the quantities division relating to metals and machinery. I intend to take every opportunity to secure a revision of the extreme protective duties.  believer in the future of our woollen industry, the British preferential duties imposed under sub-item 105F (1) and (2) have my unqualified support. I hope that as the result of these duties the woollen industry in Australia will go ahead by leaps and bounds. Lustres or alpacas are used extensively as linings for the higher grade ready-to-wear and measure garments for men. Manufacturers of this class of goods come into direct competition with manufacturers of imported readyto-wear suits. Alpaca or lustre lining is used because, unlike cotton lining, it is uncrushable, and gives the finished garment a better appearance. The manufacturers wisb to be in a position to compete with the imported article, and they have asked me to see if it is possible to have the material admitted duty free, if they enter into an engagement to use it exclusively for linings.

Trade and Customs) [3.20] - Unde r the 1921 schedule a great deal of difficulty in administration was experienced in connection with items 105E and 106. Cases had to be opened on the wharfs in order to ascertain if items under 106 were included with items under 105E. Both are now dutiable at the same rate.  altered duties will do away with the difficulties mentioned by the Minister, and obviate the opening of packages and cases on the wharfs, it will be of great advantage to the trading community. Item agreed to. Item 107By omitting the figures ""40"" appearing in the second last line, and inserting in their stead thefigures"" 48.""  have been requested by a number of representatives of friendly societies to see if it is not possible to have friendly societies' regalia admitted duty free.  Trade and Customs) [3.25] - Represen tations have been made to the department to admit friendly societies' regalia free, but there are reasons why that course should not be adopted. I had inquiries made, and found that practically every big draper makes regalia' of some sort. The department felt, therefore, that if regalia were admitted indiscriminately duty free, we should not only inflict an injustice upon a section of the trade in Australia,' but also involve the department in all sorts of administrative difficulties. For that reason, I am unable to do as the honourable member suggests.  1921 tariff provided that woven materials in the piece or otherwise, including ribbons and galoons having not more than 40 ribs to the lineal inch, and not more than 3£ inches in width, should be dutiable, ad valorem 35 per cent. British, 40 per cent, intermediate, and 50 per cent, general. It is now proposed that ribbons and galoons shall not have more than 48 ribs to the lineal inch. The object is to protect the Australian industry. Galoons are manufactured for hat purposes principally, but under this bald definition a number of other ribbons may be included. Let me give a few illustrations. I am sorry that I have no samples of ribbons, but they aTe valuable, and I do not wish to hand them round for honourable members to experiment with. A watch-guard is usually a black ribbon, and, in addition to being ribbed, it has a .moire finish. It is not made in Australia, nor is it likely to be made bere, but it comes within this definition. There are also a number of faille ribbons in light colourings which are used for hair ribbons and millinery purposes. Their importation can in no way interfere with the ribbon industry in Australia. A number of fancy ribbed ribbons are used for lingerie.",39

126,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Is the honourable member arguing that all ribbed ribbons are subject to duty? MT. PARSONS - I am arguing that a large number of ribbed ribbons, which it is not intended shall be dutiable, are dutiable. I have mentioned instances of ribbons upon which duties have been collected during the last few months. I have been shown another ribbon used for lingerie. To come under this item, a ribbon must have no break from border to border; but under - the departmental interpretation this particular ribbon, because it came within 48 ribs to the inch, although it had a fine satin or silk thread near the border, and a pico't edge, was treated as dutiable. I suggest the addition to the item of the words "" and not made in Australia."" Tbat would give the Customs Department a clear indication of what was meant, and if in future those ribbons were made in Australia, they would automatically come within the provisions of the schedule.",40
127,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra) [3.35]-- I am glad to see this item on the schedule, because it re-establishes for the ribbon industry the protection that was denied under the 1921 tariff. Before the 1921 tariff the item was asi t is now, but in 1921 the duty was applied only to ribbons up - to 40 ribs to the inch. The effect was that college bands, which were being successfully manufactured in this country, were admitted free. Tbat provision was made with - the - object of allowing millinery ribbons to be imported free; it does not affect tbem to any appreciable extent. When the item applied only to ribbons up to 40 ribs to the inch, the importers 'were able to import, free of duty, college bands with 41 ribs to the inch. I have samples with 32 ribs, 40 ribs, and 44 ribs to the inch; and I venture to say that no honourable member, without measuring and counting the ribs, could distinguish between them. In. Melbourne there are two well-equipped mills making these ribbons. I invite honourable members, as a matter of interest, to inspect those mills. When I saw them first they amazed me. to thank the honourable for Kennedy' (Mr G. Francis) for pointing out to me that this industry existed in my electorate, and, apart from the knowledge I gained, I have to thank him, also, for the entertainment a visit to those factories provided.(This industry is not a parasite on Australia, for almost immediately after the 1921 tariff was passed its price list was lowered. I should imagine, from the information I have received from experts, that all the ribbons referred to by the honourable  be made with a larger number of ribs to the inch than 48. They are of the finer class of ribbons. Watcbguards, for instance, can be made with 49 ribs to the inch. The duty applies only to ribbed ribbons that have up to 48 ribs to the inch. College bands are not made with over 48 ribs to the inch. Mr MANN!-Do the Australian factories referred to by the honourable member make all widths and kinds of ribbons up to 48 ribs to the inch ?",40
128,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I dc not think so. They are specializing largely in the lines I have mentioned. By omitting the whole inserting in its stead the following item :"" 109. Artificial Flowers, Grains, of all kinds and materials - ad val.",41

130,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,Such ribbons would not be suitable for college bands.,41

134,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,".The committee would be well advised to pass the item I have as it is.  honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) has not grasped my point. I speak with the knowledge of an expert, for I had two and a half years' experience in a wholesale ribbon department, and am still able to judge the value of silk within l d . or l | d . a yard. This question of ribbons does not appear to be understood by honourable members. If the committee will postpone the item for a quarter of an hour I can obtain some specimens of ribbon to illustrate my point. I reiterate my previous suggestion that the difficulty could be overcome by adding the words "" and not manufactured in Australia.""  Trade and Customs) [3.45] - I ask my honourable friend to accept my assurance that this is a rectification of a wrong done in 1921.

I should like to ask the Minister further to say whether the employees in this industry are male or female.  Trade and Customs) [3.47] - I obtained full particulars of the industry in Australia some time ago, and speaking from memory I think there are about seven small factories making artificial flowers and employing 200 employees, principally girls. So far as the Government is concerned it will do nothing to starve this small industry out of existence. This item has for years been a source of worry to the Trade and Customs Department. The old tariff levied a specific duty on ""sprays, trails or posies,"" and in order to effectively protect the revenue it has been found necessary to open up almost every case of artificial flowers imported and go through it in order to collect the different duties on the two varieties of imports. The department and the Tariff Board considered this matter very carefully. Something has to be done to protect the local industry against the importation of cheap artificial flowers at the ends of seasons. The little industry that has already been established has many difficulties to face owing to its products being dependent upon seasonal trade. I have said that the item has been a source of worry to the department because of the necessity of opening up cases of artificial flowers on the wharfs, and this has also been harassing to importers. It was felt that it would be a fair compromise to simplify the item and impose an ad valorem duty covering all imports under this item.",41
135,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,"HUGHES (Boothby) [3.50] - Althoug h I do not pretend to have made exhaustive inquiries into this matter, I was given some figures concerning it two years ago, and they have remained in my memory. That is why, when speaking generally on the tariff, I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs to supply the committee with exact particulars concerning this industry in Australia. I was told that there was but one artificial flower factory in Australia, and that it employed 35 girls. In view of the Minister's assurances to me I think it is regrettable that he is not today in a position to give the particulars for which I asked. He says he thinks that there are about seven factories employing about 200 persons, principally girls. It appears to me that under the new form in which the item is drafted, artificial flowers will include "" sprays, trails or posies."" ",42
136,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,HUGHES - Then there is no point in the omission of those words.  two different duties imposed under this item.,42
137,Mr DUNCAN,Unknown,"HUGHES - This item is one which affects nearly all the women in the Commonwealth. Under it they may be called upon to pay unduly high prices for artificial flowers. The interests of 200 employees, principally girls, should not weigh against those of all the women of Australia.  ing last week-end I made inquiries into the artificial flower industry. I do not vouch for their absolute accuracy, but I give the facts as they were given to me. I have tbem from the manager of the millinery department of a very large company, and they are confirmed by my own experience. During the war period an artificial flower company, known, I think, as the Australian Flower Manufacturing Company, was started in Sydney. It manufactured a certain quantity of artificial flowers, but got on to the rocks and was reconstructed from time to time in different bands.",42
138,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"That is why the duty is HGGCLGCI.  artificial flower trade is a very peculiar trade. First and foremost, it is a fashion trade. Flowers are in fashion in one season, and out of fashion in another. During last winter season, with the exception of a few celluloid trimmings, flowers and trimmings were scarcely used at all. The ladies of Australia, for some reason, probably because of the fashion of shingled hair, went in for close fitting felt hats in conformity with the straight lines of their costumes. The result was that people who imported artificial flowers and millinery ornaments, and I was one of them, had to scrap the stuff. The industry is dependent entirely upon fashionable trade. What is going to be worn is decided, not here, but in the fashion centres of Paris, London, and New York. Rightly or wrongly, Australian women follow the dictates of the creators of fashions in those centres. Our seasons follow the seasons overseas, and the artificial flower industry in Australia is for this reason placed at a very great disadvantage. I believe that the best thing to do would be to pay the people engaged in this industry what it is worth, and put them to some more profitable occupation. Honestly, for the reasons I have given, I do not see that there is any future for the artificial flower industry. My informant, who is a personal friend of mine, and a brother member of the lodge to which I belong, told me that the manufacturers of artificial flowers came to him and said, "" We cannot sell you anything original, but we are prepared to copy anything."" He tried to give them orders on those lines, but the trouble was that by the time the copy was delivered it was too late for the season. I bad many years experience of the millinery trade, and I may say that whilst a few years ago fashions in millinery ornaments changed about every six months, today, what is right in January may be wrong in February. The honourable member for Boothby (Mr. Duncan-Hughes) bas pointed out that this is an item which concerns our women folk.. I am not going to move for a redviction of the proposed duty, but I have placed the facts concerning it before the committee so that honourable members may vote upon the item with some knowledge. If the Minister thinks that it would be better to reconsider the item, I shall have no objection to that course being followed.",42

During the period to which I refer, running into nearly seven years, artificial flowers were not imported to any extent for the business which I conducted.. The Australian article was right in quality, in line with the fashions, and was considerably cheaper bhan the imported article. I was not aware that the Australian Flower Manufacturing Qompany went into liquidation, as the honourable member for Angas has said.  structed.",43

Many of the women engaged in this industry may be helping to keep the families to which they belong, or to support widowed mothers.

As he has said, a very fine industry has been established in my electorate, and under the direction of an expert felt maker from England the factory is producing all types of felt, including all wool felt, carpet felt, under carpet felt, slipper felt, cattle ruglinings, saddle cloths and afew other small items. The works are capable of supplying the whole of Australia's requirements in these articles. The increase in duties has been asked for by the company, not with a view to increasing the price in the local market, but merely as a protection against unfair competition from abroad. The works are capable of producing 20,000 yards of felt per week. Carpet felt to about the value of £120,000 is imported annually, and Parliament should encourage a local industry which will retain that money in Australia. I call the attention of honourable members to samples of slipper felts; carpet felts, under carpet felts, and saddle cloths.

When this subject was being investigated by the Tariff Board - I am not blaming the board-thos e controlling foundries were unaware that an inquiry was being conducted by the: board at the request of the Broken Hill' Proprietary Cbmpany. It is in the interests of. the manufacturers and workers of Australia and' our progress generally., that material of thisdes cription, which isrequiredfor manufacturing purposes, shall' not bear this impost. Prior, to the war there was not muoh necessity for a duty on scrap iron and steel, but during the war period, when there was little opportunity of supplies being obtained from overseas, discarded machinery and scrap material was brought from all parts of Australia. In Western Australia such machinery was dispatched hundreds of miles by rail to the various foundries, in which a mixture consisting of 50 per cent, of scrap iron and 50 per cent, of pig iron was used in foundry work generally. Some large and important firms are interested in this question, including C. Monteath and Sons, J . Nixon and Sons, Mephan Ferguson Proprietary Limited, John Danks and Sons Proprietary Limited, P. Laughton and Son, and J. and T. M u i r . dealing with the duty on scrap iron, these manufacturers stateThe imposition of this duty can have no other effect than to increase the cost of production, which, in turn, will be reflected in a falling-off in the demand for cast-iron goods. Honourable members are aware of the extensive businesses co-nducted by manufacturers, particularly in Victoria, who use cast, iron in their work. The statement continues'It is apparent, from the reports which were published in the press at the time of the adoption of this schedule, that the reason for the imposition of the duty in question was in order that there should be a larger consumption of pig iron, with a consequent advantage to the local manufacturers of the latter commodity. It is unfortunate that the matter came 'before the Tariff Board without the knowledge of the ironfounders of Australia generally, and, if the hearing of the case was advertised at the time, the advertisement was not even noticed by any manufacturer or organization of manufacturers, and, consequently, no case was presented on their 'behalf before the Tariff Board. We would, therefore, like the opportunity to take exception at. this stage to certain of the evidence tendered before the Tariff Board, and to emphasize the point that, owing to the increased cost of castings, there has been such a falling-off in demand. I should like honourable members opposite particularly to note the following: That it would be extremely likely that not only will the object of the duty in question fail in its purpose, but, in addition, a number of iroumoulders and workers in this country will be thrown out employment. We can cite instances, partitends cularly in cast-iron pipe foundries, where numbers of hands have already been paid of and there is every prospect of further conpig siderable reductions of such stairs. This tion is being brought about owing to the high cost of production of cast iron pipes in Ausbut tralia, which is not only holding up many Mr Gregory. schemes which engineers have in contemplation, but is forcing them to the adaption of inferior substitutes, and rendering possible the importation of cast-iron pipes from abroad at a lower price than that for which they can be locally manufactured. Honourable members will doubtless recall that in many large tenders recently accepted in connection with water supplies, cast-iron pipes have not been used owing to the excessive cost. The report proceedsWe take i i that the amended tariff schedule was adopted for the purpose of further protecting Australian industries, and not from the point of view of increasing revenue. In order to accomplish this end, we understand it is the policy of the Govermnent to admit from abroad (free) raw materials which are to be used for In purposes of manufacture in Australian factories where such raw materials are not obtainable within Australia. It is the policy of the department to allow goods which are not manufactured in Australia to come in free under item 404.",47
145,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,Is the honourable member dealing with the duty on scrap iron ?,48
146,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Yes . A duty is being imposed principally at the request of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, which claims that it can produce at a slightly higher cost an article which will enable smelting to be done without the use of scrap iron.",48
147,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Does not the Broken Hill Proprietary Company use scrap iron ?,48
148,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"I do not think so. In further dealing with this matter, the manufacturers stateCast-iron scrap is an absolutely essential raw material commodity used in all iron foundries, and supplies of this material in anything like sumcient quantities for foundry purposes are absolutely unobtainable. During the war period all the available scrap iron in Australia was collected to enable foundries to carry on their operations, because it was impossible to obtain supplies from other countries. The stateimposition of the ment continuesSpecifications of cast-iron work almost invariably provide for the admixture with pigof iron of previously melted iron. This course to purify the mixture, and, unless the ultimate cost of the commodity is going to be f , vastly increased by two separate meltings of ""iron, the end is attained by the-use of posimachinery scrap. The use of scrap in iron foundries* is universal and practically essential, it is not obtainable in Australia in sufficient quantities to meet the demands of Aus-. tralian foundries, and must, of necessity, be imported. During the war, when it became impossible to import supplies from abroad, dealers in cast-iron scrap scoured the length and breadth of the country for all descriptions of disused mining and other machinery which previously it would have been unprofitable to break up and transport to the iron foundries. Prices of this material rose to an exorbitant figure, but the imperative necessity for its use compelled iron foundries to purchase it irrespective of price. Thus scrap, which immediately before the war was selling at about £3 to £3 10s. per ton, rose in price to as high as £14 and £15 per ton, hut still found purchasers. Throughout Western Australia, old stamp mills were brought from long distances and sold at high prices in Perth, simply for scrap iron. Some were brought from far beyond Kalgoorlie. The prices received for them ranged from £ 1 4 to £ 1 5 per ton. The iron founders must have scrap iron to mix with pig iron if they are to make proper castings for certain work. The report proceedsConsequently all available cast iron scrap, even to the remotest parts of the various States, was well cleaned out, so that today within Australia there is no dependable supply of this material, and only on odd occasions are small lots of a few tons offered. In addition to dealing with other phases of the question, the report points out that the figures submitted to the Tariff Board, to show the importations of pig iron into Australia over a period of years, were not quite fair. It statedThe case for a duty on cast iron scrap as presented to the Tariff Board by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, was, to say the very least of it, somewhat misleading. Referring to the importations of scrap iron, that company quoted figures from the Commonwealth of Australia official statistics of overseas imports, their quotations being as follows :Year. Quantity. Value. 191819 ... 374 ... 1,464 191920 ... 960 ... 5,863 192021 ... 2,028 ... 14,366 1.921-22 ... 18,942 ... 98,888 192223 ... 24,282 ... 102,033 192324 ... 17,461 ... 82,195 For 9 months ended March. 1925, 17,242 tons. The impression was created that prior to 1919 our importations of pig iron were very small, and that because, in 1922-3, more than 24,000 tons were imported, the interests of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company - were being adversely affected. Even if more comprehensive figures were not submitted to the board by the witnesses that it examined, I submit that it should have taken steps to obtain them. Had it done so it would have found that as far back as 1906 we imported more than 16,000 tons of pig iron annually, and that in 1914-5 a good deal more than that came here. In the period 1906-1915 the figures varied from something over 22,000 tons, to about 14,000 tons. It will be seen therefore, that for very many years, u n t i l the war dislocated all our industries, the Australian iron founders imported large quantities of scrap iron. Honourable members should realise that a mixture of pig iron and scrap iron is necessary to obtain a first-rate casting for making stoves and other similar articles. The importations of scrap iron in the war years were small because it was quite impossible for them to be large. Great Britain needed all the scrap iron that she had for her own use. In the interests of. good workmanship it is a false policy to attempt to force iron founders to use more pig iron than is desirable. For water hydrants, stoves, and a good many other articles that 1 could enumerate, a special quality of casting is necessary. The manufacturer says in effect, "" If I am obliged to use more pig iron than is necessary to make a good casting, I sball have to turn out inferior work."" If a duty is imposed upon imported scrap iron, the founders will have to use iron pipes in its stead, as they have already done in some cases, to obtain the proper mixture of materials to make good castings. The imposition of this duty can only result in the unemployment of many men who are now working in iron foundries. It is not necessary for the protection of the industry, and I urge honourable members to vote against it . Ton's. £.",48
149,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [4.38] This duty is being imposed because scrap iron has been dumped in Australia, to the detriment of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. I r o n founders are using it instead of locally-manufactured pig iron. I am certain that our iron founders could find in Australia all the scrap iron that they need, if they would search for it . The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has to use scrap iron, and it is able to obtain it locally, and so could every other engineering company that needs it , if it cared to search far ""it. We 3hould not allow scrap iron from other countries to be 'dumped here, and so lianrt the use of our own pig .iron..",49

151,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Hav e I Bet already pointed out that the Broken Hdli proplies locally. prietary ^Company must itself mix pig iron and scrap iron? I trust that honourable orable members will support the duty, and - so encourage the use of pig iron made from our own ore. Jar.

I regret that .misleading figures were submitted to the Tariff Board by the persons in favour of the imposition of this duty.; but that does .not relieve the the - obligation - to satisfy itself that the wise presented .'to it was based >on a foundation. The figures quoted by the honourable member for >Swan (Mr pig Gregory) jjhow that tfrom 1906 to 1914-5 Australia made large importations of scrap iron. The ""figures fell ofi during the war years, because of circumstances over which the iron founders bad mo conand trol; but as - soon as the dislocations caused by the war - were overcome, large importations were - again made. But the importations in 1923-4 totalled - ori'ly method; 17,000 tons, as against 16,000 tons in 1906, in spite of the development that had occurred in the meantime m the tralian engineering industry. That shows conclusively that scrap iron is not being dumped bere. If honourable members in sist on the imposition of this duty they will be adopting a short sighted policy, of the penny-wise pound-foolish descriptries tion, that will frustrate ""the achievement of their abject Tie Broken Hill Prowas prietary Company is making very good progress with 'its ironworks, a""nd reasoniron able and regular advances are shown its production of pig iron.

The recommendation of the Tariff Board is based on a one-sided vestigation'; and on the facts before it , the committee should vote against this sub-item. It has not been shown that there is an abnormal influx of scrap iron into this - country, but, on the other hand, it has been shown that our manufacturers have been unable to obtain adequate sup",50
152,Mr MANN,Unknown,Perth) £4.45] - The honmember for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) has stated that scrap iron 'enters this country in competition with Australian pig iron. I point out that scrap e iron is used in the foundries in conjunction with pig iron ; if pig iron only were inused it would have to be melted .twice to unable to get the same results..,50
153,Mr YATES,Unknown,Nonsense. !,50
154,Mr MANN,Unknown,It all depends upon the purpose - for which the iron is required. M-r. YATES - I bave seen it .used both board of in chills .and in sand.,50
155,Mr MANN,Unknown,"For many purposes, .sound such as the manufacture of cast-iron pipes, the specifications require that the iron shall be melted with a certain amount of scrap iron .to get the proper composition.. The physical properties of pig iron are peculiar; in - certain conditions they have to be modified. To melt tie pig iron twice is obviously 'expensive, consequently the general .practice is to mix it with scrap iron.",50
156,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"That was the old but .we have improved on it during - recent years. . Mr MANN - A method which enables us to use our waste material 'to economic Ausadvantage appears to me to be a good one. Sbould scrap iron be unobtainable, and the pig iron bave to be melted twice, - the cost of cast-iron pipes will become so great that substitutes will be used, or cast-iron pipes imported from other counwhere the cost of - manufacture is less. During the war period Australia scoured for sources of scrap iron. I know that every available piece of scrap ontbe Western Australian gold-fields in wbicb - could be economically used was tba t gathered up and used; but in spite of : what was then done, the local supplies We have now, howcastever, got back to normal pre-war conditions. There has been no unduly in the creased importation in recent years, and that no competition with pig iron. On the contrary, the importations of pig iron inhave dropped from 150,000 tons to about 50,000 tons annually. That shows the enaxmous increase im the business done by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, owing to the absence of competition and the protection, which has been accorded it in other directions'. If the importation: of scrap' iron isprohibited:, seriousin j u ry will be done toa fundamental industry which,, because in is capable of decentralization:,, is found in all paicts of the Commonwealth, and. gives employment to many men.. The iron founders throughout Australia,, who are already experiencing, difficulty, view this matter with alarm. They state that they could cite instances of numbers of men having already been put ofi,. and that there is every prospect of furt&er reductions of their staffs beingmade. I asked at representative of' the firmof Mephan Ferguson, of Footscnay, to give me a specific* instance. Mesaid that in his ownfoundry fifteen menbad already been put off, and> that more would follow tbem' later besause of insufficient supplies of raw material. He added that the cost oS smelting pig iron, twice had prevented his firm, from obtaining orderswhich it might otherwise have received!.. absence of scrap iron is seriously handicapping this industry and causingunemployment. Conditions during the coming winter will beserious enough, wtithout increasing the number of the unemployed-. Imported scrap iron can be obtained in Western Australia for £ 6 5s.. a ton. whereas pig iron from the Broken Hill Proprietary Company cannot be landed there under £ 1 0 5s„ a ton.",50
157,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,T b at may be due to the shippingcombine.,51
158,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Whateve r the cause, we ask for relief. The existing difficulty should not. be increased by the imposition of higher duties. I am not certain as to the proportion of pig iron and cast iron irn. the admixtura generally used. But let us' consider what these costs mean if the materials are mixed in equal quantities",51
159,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"The proportion pends on the quality of thematerial reage quired. Usually thereisless* than, pig iron.",51
160,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Let us suppose that the mixture contains equal quantities of pig iron and scrap iron. In that case the cost of the raw material would be £ 8 ' a ton. If , however,, the people of ern Australia are forced to use pig. iron only, the cost w i ll Be £10' 5s. per ton, in addition to the expenses incurred in connection with the second smelting of the material. Should the proportion of the scrap iron in the admixture be reduced, the position becomes worse. The iron founders are in a very grave position, and their position will soon be reflected on that of other sections of the community. The Tariff Board's recommendation was based on in accurate and misleading information in that it took into consideration only the changes in the importationssince the war and disregarded, the pre-war figures. The embargo on the export of metals from England during the war period was entirely responsible for this Australian industry being so seriously handicapped owing to. the shortage of scrap iron.",51
161,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Will the honourable member. telL us why scrap iron is exported, to the East I",51
162,Mr MANN,Unknown,"I do not know the reason. It may be that it pays those in the eastern States: better to. ship their scrap iron to. the East than to send it to Western Australia. Theremay be some-, local The handling of scrap iron i a the: manner in dicated by the honourable member., but that does not necessarily represent the movement in Australia, as a whole.. I am credibly informed that at the present time suflicient quantities of scrap iron cannot be obtained in Australia. I repeat that thisis not acentralized industry; it iaestablished in every State. It should, therefore, be possible to draw upon l'OGal' suppliesi n each State. If Australianfounderscould get their' requirementsi n Australia wonldthey import them from abroad ? Let me now refer to another aspeet of thisquestion. The greatest demandfor. this material is probably in. connection with the manufacture of cast-iron pipes.",51

164,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Probably more of this material is used in the manufacture of decast iron pipes for irrigation and drainschemes, and water supplies thaai in scrap iron any other direction.",51
165,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"It is used in the manufacture of all classes of iron and steel. Mr MANN . - I did not say that it was not. But more of it is used in the manu5s. facture of cast-iron, pipes than in any Westother individual instance. The additional cost of these pipes resulting from, these higher duties will fall upon municipalities, trusts, and' other public bodies which are supplying public utilities. The additional cost will, therefore, haye to met by increased taxation. I believe that sinuation ? common sense will prevail in connection with this item, that honourable members will realise the force of the arguments that have been put forward. I hope that no undue obstacle will be placed i way of reducing these duties.",51
166,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [4.56] I point out to the honourable member Perth (Mr Mann) that the reason that those engaged in the iron and steel trade as ironfounders are able to obtain the item. imported scrap iron is that quantities of this material arrive here as ship's ballast. Many of the railway companies lenge the statement of Great Britain practically give away manufacturers. their discarded railway chairs to the ping companies to be used for ballast years, purposes. On arrival of the vessels Australia, the material is unloaded. Manufacturers here naturally desire obtain it , as the shipping companies prepared to sell it at a low price, seriously menacing our own Australian iron industry and trade. Consignments of. scrap have been sent from Australia to Japan; some of it , I regret to say, from Government railway workshops.  or for Australia?",52
167,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"It is not a good policy to export material which could be used in Australia, and for our own manua facturers to use material which has been brought here as ballast. Tbat source of supply may be cut off at any time, we should, therefore, conserve our own supplies, and learn to be self-reliant. favour using in Australia all the material that can be made available for, and Australian industries.",52
168,Mr MANN,Unknown,Can the honourable memcost ber explain why we both export and imI port? Do we sell to Japan at a price than we pay for the imported material ?,52
169,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"That would be a commercial transaction by dealers, conducted for the purpose of securing a.profit, without a moment's thought of the future and the internal requirements of nation. Honourable members with freeone trade tendencies take full advantage of castings. every opportunity to belittle Australian industries, and in connection with this item I challenge their bona fides.",52

He has done everything possible in this debate, and in the debate on other mean the sures to retard and strangle Australian industries. The figures quoted by the honourable member for Porrest  for conclusively that the local supplies are sufficient for our requirements, so the Minister is justified in standing by",52
172,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Adelaide) [ 5 . 4 ] - I chalmade ' by the My factory life exshiptended over a period of seventeen and although casting was in not my j o b - I was a japanner-for the sake of physical exercise I ' spent to many hours breaking up pig iron for the are cupola, and I saw many castings in the thus chill and in the sand. At no time do I remember seeing a great quantity of scrap iron mixed with pig iron for use in the cupola, though a good deal of it was used for small castings, notably bedsteads. As the honourable member for  which employed me did a great deal of stove casting, and were practically the only people who did bedstead casting. Usually pig and scrap iron are used on fifty-fifty basis to secure the required tensility for water piping. This mixture gives a quicker, and therefore a better, and result from the stand-point of cost. We used to start the cupola early in the I morning, but would not be able to cast until about 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock. If by, pig iron is broken into small lumps naturally it melts more quickly, and the of the operation is reduced. This, think, is one of the reasons why scrap higher iron is used with pig iron.",52
173,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Use d by itself, pig iron produces a very brittle article.",52
174,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I am aware of that, but I understand that iron founders use and a suitable alloy to obviate brittlcness. Por certain classes of goods they use this aluminium. There are a hundred and ways in which they produce different",52
175,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,A large proportion of scrap iron has to be used in the making of cast-iron pipes.,52
176,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Possibl y the honourable member for Swan is right, but I doubt if the use of scrap iron is imperative. I am inclined to think that it is used becauses it produces a quicker flow of metal. Every one who has had any experience of casting knows that a mixture of metal that has been already smelted with pig iron will induce a more rapid flowthan if pig iron has to be fired down by itself.",53
177,Mr MANN,Unknown,That is not so in principle.,53
178,Mr YATES,Unknown,"I do not question the technical knowledge of the honourable member for Perth, but I think that scrap iron is used because it is the cheapest mixture. It is gathered generally by bottle-gatherers or marine-store dealers, who have to accept the price ruling at the various foundries. As stated by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin), a certain quantity has been exported to Japan from South Australia. That subject was ventilated in the South Australian Parliament. The Premier, when asked if the successful tenderer was sending the scrap iron from the Islington workshops to Japan, replied that he had no knowledge of the transaction. Apparently the contractor, like the average business man, was not concerned whether the interests of Australia were affected. Japan paid the highest price, so he sent the scrap iron to that country. As the honourable member, for Hindmarsh stated, scrap iron is brought to Australia as ballast. It pays ship-owners to ballast with that class of material instead of sand or stone, because it is a marketable commodity, and revenue from its sale is offset against the cost of the voyage to Australia in search of cargo. The figures relating to the position indicate clearly that we should take definite action. For the three years prior to the war, the importations were approximately 22,000 tons a year. The honourable member for Perth has stated that we are now getting back to normal. Our importations in 1921-2 totalled 18,942 tons; in 1922-3, 24,282 tons; and 1923-4, 17,461 tons. These figures amply justify the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Ironmoulders naturally have to advance a reason to justify their opposition to the duty; but, unless I have a definite assurance from a practical ironmoulder, I shall refuse to believe rhat castings from pig iron, and without the admixture of scrap iron, are too brittle. Though I was not an ironmoulder, when employed in an Adelaide factory I could do, and did, a little bit of everything. I was familiar with the ramifications of the entire establishment. I cannot accept the statement circulated to honourable members unless a qualified person will prove 'that the admixture of scrap iron is necessary in order to use the pig iron produced in this country. The figures show that unless prompt aotion is taken the local industry will be ruined by the ballast that is brought from countries where scrap iron is plentiful. One honourable member has suggested that scrap iron collected from the fields of war is being sent all over the world. I ' do not know whether that is right. Our object is to protect and develop Australian industries. I said, in the case of whisky, that as we had the raw materials and the workmen in this country, it did - not require any further evidence to induce me to vote for the duty, and my attitude is the same on this item.",53
179,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Perth) [5.17] - The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates) appears to argue on the same lines as the Tariff Board. He has an opinion, and is going to stick to it unless he hears from practical men wbo understand the business; but he is not prepared to listen to what practical men may say. The statement that has been put before the committee is clear, moderate, and reasonable, and it is made by practical men in the industry. They have been obliged to state their case to this committee because the Tariff Board had not their evidence before it. It has already been explained that these persons, for some reason, did not know of the meeting of the Tariff Board. If it was advertised, they did not see the advertisement. The consequence is that the recommendation of the Tariff Board was made after hearing only one side of the case. Honourable members are.surely not satisfied that that was just. It was all very well for the honourable member for Adelaide to pour out an unceasing niagara of words, and to refuse to listen to a demand that he should elucidate certain points. He spoke of imports and exports, and apparently argued that, while selling scrap iron to Japan at a reasonable price, we were importing it ' from Europe. What harm is there in that? If we can bring scrap, iron from - other countries for less than we can sell it for to Japan, is it not to our advantage to do so? Should we not be fools, and worse than fools, not to do it ? Is it not to the economic advantage of this country to do it? Yet the honourable member contends that we should not import scrap iron because we are exporting it . The whole question depends upon where we export it to, where we import it from , and what prices we pay and - obtain for it . In this trade - the - demand for scrap iron is well known, and the price has risen far above what it was in pre-war days. The price increased from £3 to £14 a ton during the war. The Australian requirements feeing known, is it likely that men* would send scrap iron - out of the country for .a price lower than they could obtain here, or for any but a greater price? The honourable member for Adelaide has taken an utterly absurd and one-sided view. He seems to think that scrap iron is used to facilitate melting m tihe cupola. That is not so. It is used to produce the correct and proper quality of metal in the final casting. He spoke of adding aluminium to p ig iron for making water pipes. The idea is absurd. When engineers and responsible men who are carrying out public works specify the mixing of scrap iron with pig ir-on, they are acting in accordance with the best experience, and with a knowledge of the subject which, I venture to say, is even greater than that - of the honourable member for Adelaide.",53
180,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [5/20] I am afraid that some honourable members, in their anxiety to concentrate manufactures in the eastern - States, overlook the fact that they are destroying manufactures elsewhere. It is well known to the most ""uninformed person that the making of pig iron is one of the most elementary and primary processes in the manufacture of iron. It is just the extraction of the iron from the ore. names of the manufacturers wbo bave protested against this duty are bonsebold words all over Australia. Tbey areC. Monteath and Sons, J. Nixon *nd Son, Mephan Ferguson proprietary Limited, John Danks and ""Son Proprietary Limited, P. Lawghkm and Son, and J. and 'T. Muir. Tbese men are of bigb repute in their businesses, and they have circulated a .statement which has been in the hands of honourable members quite long - enough for opposing interests, if they could do so, to refute it . Nothing of the kind bas been attempted. These men have saidCast-iron scrap is an absolutely essential raw material commodity used in all iron foundries, and supplies of this material in anything like sumcient quantities for foundry purposes are absolutely unobtainable. That is a definite statement regarding the technical - requirements of the trade. ""While I accept the opinion of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) - on many things connected with iron work, I maintain that about the foundry business 'these men have made a 'statement ""that cannot be challenged. We have to determine whether it is better to manufacture pig iron, which the savages of Central Africa did hundreds of years ago by most prinutive means, or to save indusitries which manufacture pipes and similar things for local use. It would seem that one of the two must be sacrificed. The Governments of Western Australia and some of the other States, bave got into hot water for buying from abroad pipes that could be manufactured in Australia, But why were they not manufactured in Australia'? It was because of the high cost of obtaining the raw materials. Montea'th's, at Subiaco, and Mephan Ferguson's, at Maylands, both suburbs of Perth, have had to shut down from time to time because they were unable to meet - competition from abroad. They stated that their difficulty was that they could not obtain cheap raw material. Their position, bowever, was better then than it will be under this tariff. Certain representations have been made to the Minister by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. I admit that that company, in establishing the iron industry at Newcastle, witli its many ramifications, has done something that Australians must be proud of. But we have to balance the value of manuThe factnring a few hundred tons of pig iron against the value of manufacturing pipes and similar articles. If this duty is collected, the pipe-making industry will be extinguished. Even from the point of view of the Minister for Trade and Customs, a duty that destroys an industry is economically unsound. One honourable member said, with a wave of the Irand, that the figures quoted to the Tariff Board satisfied him that the industry needed protection. He quoted the figures submitted to the Tariff Board hy the Broken H i i l Companj. On page 2 of the-circular sent to honourable members it is stated that in the year 1918-1919 only £1,464 worth of .scrap iron was imported, and that in 1323-1924 .£82,000 worth was imported. That statement, on the face of it, must .have impressed the Tariff Board. I regret that the board bas been so busy that it bas not been able to go further into this matter. The circular also statesIt is u .striking tact timt the importations - of scrap io 1323-24 were only very slightly jnore than .they were in 1906. 'The figures - quoted before the Tariif 'Board ^applied to the period when it was impossible to obtain scrap iron from Greax Britain. The importations increased as scrap iron, wbicb was ao longer necessary for war purposes, was released in tha* 'Country. The figures were calculated to make the Tariff Board believe, and the Tariff Board's report was issued to make honourable members believe, that we were importing an enormous amoant of scrap iron in increasing quantities, and that it was therefore necessary to impose the duty. The increased amount imported in l 923-1924, as compared with that imported in 190G, was negligible. In those circumstances there is no necessity that a ""very prosperous company sbould be benefited by placing an impost on other industries of greater importance than the manufacture of pig iron.",54
181,Mr MAJOT,Unknown,"There is no ""live and let live"" about it.",55
182,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Tba t is so, and-that is why I ask the thorough-going protecmigbt tionists in this committee., who are anxious to establish highly specialised indntstries, 'ratter than those that employ primitive methods, to take the figures to heart. The people wbo supplied this document did so with a - view to pitting tion as they ifind it . We know from oar own experience that their isadustry bas certain. been a struggling one. Imports, from Germany particularly, before the vr-ar swept the local manufacturer off his feet, yet today the Government promine poses to plaee the industry in a twenty still worse position, and protectionists in this chamber are prepared to assist the Minister for Trade and Customs to do that, on faked evidence. A duty on serap iron will affect another very important industry, and that is the copper mining industry. On this subject. I have received a letter from the manager of the Pilbarra Copper Fields Limited, a company which is carrying on its - operations at Whim Creek, away in the north-west of Australia. In ordinary circumstances the difficulties of making copper mining pay in sucb a remote district, far removed from the seaboard and other portions of Australia, where wages and stores are necessarily higb, and where it is difficult to obtain supplies because of - costly transport, are bad - enough, without the imposition of a duty on the raw material that is essential for the extraction of copper. Tbis item is a two-edged sword. It - will-serionsly affect certain industries we are trying to establish in a small way in Western Australia, and it will destroy this copper mining industry in the north west of that State. The letter to which I have referred, dated the 18tb December, 1925. I sent on to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and received the departmental reply, Communication forwarded with your letter is returned berel with. The representations made in oonnexioiu with the mattewill receive due - consideration/' The due consideration they bave received is the tariff before us this afternoon.  the departmental letter? Mr A. GEEEN-The date is the Sth January last. I can quite understand the Minister overlooking the matter. He be excused for doing so, because the passing of a tariff involves a tremendous amount of work, and the honourable gentleman bas nay sympathy in the task he has in hand. In his .letter to me, Mr - Sleeman, the manager of thcithe posiP.iibarra company, says The future programme of this mine is not As. the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) eould tell the committee, the has been struggling for the last years, and this duty on scrap iron is likely to prove the last straw on the camel's backI t is, however, probable that it will try to find its salvation through a certain form of heap-leaching that I have evolved here. An essential-indeed , the biggest-facto r in the treatment is iron. The copper is precipitated on iron, and it consumes about l i tons of iron to precipitate 1 ton of copper. The cost of iron, therefore, becomes a leading consideration, and on it will perhaps depend whether we can achieve our end or not. The iron may be used in three forms-(1 ) Scrap. If we wanted only a small quantity, our best would be tin scrap-fro m canning works, old tins of all sorts, &c. We used this in 1920, when we used under a ton a day. It does not seem that we can possibly secure enough of this without going too far afield, i.e., without it being too dear. Heavier scrap is too dear as to transport; its shape is against it, i.e., making bad handling and big measurements (freight). (2) Sponge iron. would be made wherever offered the lowest cost as delivered on the mine. position re making it is not perfect. It will be seen that these people are trying to make, sponge iron on the mine, and that shows how enterprising they are. The letter continuesWhere cheap'fuel and ironstone occur close together it will be all right. On this mine the cost may be too high; and the making is a specialty. (3) Pig iron. We may therefore be forced back on this. It is commonly used-Ri o Tinto, some United States of America mines, &c. But it would be impracticable to use Australian (Newcastle) pig. The cost would be far too high. It could be imported at a cost that would probably be workable if duty were exempted. It is about 70s. to 80s. a ton in Britain now, and probably very low freight could be obtained for it. Even then the cost here would be high, but not so high as to prohibit the business. The question is : If we have to fall back on pig, could we get it in duty free? would be no possibility of it being put to any other use than that described, there being no other use for it for a radius of hundreds of miles Could you advise me provisionally as to whether, in such circumstances, we would be able to secure exemption from duty. If I have hot given enough information above, I shall be happy to supply more. I quote that letter to show that whilst a duty is being imposed on scrap iron, Australian industries dependent upon its use are likely to go to the wall unless they are given a fair deal. In the circumstances I trust that the Minister will defer the item. Sumcient evidence has been brought forward this afternoon to show that there is no danger of increasing the importations. I - t r u st that the Minister will listen to the representations made to him. Ifr. A. Oreen. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [5.36],- I do not profess to know anything at all about pig iron, but I remind honourable members who have opposed this duty that during the war the industries for which they have spoken were deprived of scrap i r o n ; and, .notwithstanding that, they carried on their business as moulders and supplied all the wants of the Commonwealth. I understand that Mr . Hoskins, who has a large foundry, in which he employs a great many moulders and turns out a great quantity of work, uses pig iron. That castings can be manufactured direct from pig iron has been demonstrated by Mr Hoskins, who has one of the biggest foundries in New South Wales, fro m which he turns out hundreds of thousands of tons of This castings. If an honourable member were an employer, and had put money into the But the Broken Hill company, as numbers of the general public have done, he would not expect the Government to allow scrap iron to be imported duty free to compete against the article manufactured by the company in which he was interested. It would not be fair to the people who put their money into this business to allow scrap iron to be imported duty free to compete with the manufacture of pig iron. The industries referred to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) and others were carried on without scrap iron during the war period, a time when there was a greater demand on the resources of this country.",55
183,Mr MANN,Unknown,"Not a greater demand. Mr E . RILEY - Yes , because nothing could then be obtained from overseas. There Mr WATKiNS - r-During that time the Newcastle company sent steel rails overseas. Mr E . RILEY - That is so.",56
184,Mr MANN,Unknown,"What about public works during the war period ? Mr E . RILEY - Publi c works were carried on during the war period. No company treated Australia better ihan did the Broken Hill Company during that period. It stopd in the breach, supplied all the Commonwealth requirements, and assisted the.Empire by sending steel rails to the Old Country. Now we are asked to do away with the duty on scrap iron and allow ships from all parts of the world to bring scrap iron as ballast to Australia, where it will be used in competition against the products of the great industries that have been established here. I congratulate the Government and the Minister for Trade and Customs upon the appearance of this item in the schedule.",56
185,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Darling) ,[5.41] As this item concerns very cl'psely the basis of the iron and steel industries, I also am in agreement with the Government in its endeavour to place those industries on a solid footing, by allowing them to provide our own raw materials. We bave, throughout Australia, great deposits of iron ore as good as any to be found elsewhere. We have deposits of several kinds of iron ore, which, when brought together, produce iron and steel 'of the necessary texture required for castings. I cannot understand representatives of Western Australia decrying one of the greatest iron deposits we have, up at Yampie Sound. There are two deposits there, one owned by the Queensland Government, and the other by a Western Australian company, which, for many years, has been endeavouring to secure the capital to exploit it. For Western Australian representatives to tolerate the free importation of scrap iron, which would prevent the starting, let alone the flourishing, of that great industry, is something I cannot understand. If scrap iron is imported free, there will be no development at Yampie Sound.",57
186,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Every ton of scrap irjon imported displaces a ton of Australian material.,57
187,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"TEa t is so, and it displaces, also, the labour involved - ih the production of the Australian material. If we desire to put the iron and steel industries of this country on a basis, we - must start from the bottom and not from half-way up. We must develop the base of those industries, which is iron. We have the iron ore, and the necessary machinery for its manufacture into iron. All that we need is protection to enable our iron and steel industries to be soundly established. The iron and steel industries are the # basis of a nation's industrial development, and no nation which has not advanced them to a very high standard can become truly great. They are also essential to national defence, and for our preservation we are compelled to foster them.",57
188,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Eeid) [5.46] - Al though an ardent protectionist, I confess that the representatives of Western Australia, particularly the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green), have made out a case which calls for an answer from the Minister. I would like him to explain to what extent the production of pig iron to replace the scrap iron now used will promote the development of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company. Of course, I realise that the arguments advanced by the Western Australian representatives in opposition to this duty will be equally applicable to any other protective duty in the schedule. I sympathize with the State on account of its economic disadvantages, which this Parliament has recognized by the payment of a subsidy. However, on this item I have an open mind. The iron and steel industries are of fundamental importance to the defence of Australia, and my vote will be determined by the information given by the Minister as to whether the production of pig iron, to take the place of imported scrap iron, will increase employment, or have an important bearing in other respects upon the development of the iron and steel industries. I am informed that every tariff in the world imposes a protective duty on scrap iron. ",57
189,Mr LAMBERT,Unknown,"West Sydney) [5.48]. - I am astonished that members of the Labour party'should desert their protectionist principles by supporting the importation of iron, of which this country has such enormous resources. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) said that some little company in Western Australia will not be able to produce copper if it is not allowed to use imported scrap iron. After it has passed sound through the batteries, copper ore is treated with iron and sulphuric acid in tanks, in the same way as gold in tailings is precipitated in cyanide vats.. It is not necessary to use pig iron or scrap iron for that purpose; there are enough old tins in this country to precipitate hundreds of thousands of tons of copper. I shall never vote for the free admission of any article that can be produced in Australia. No vote of mine will be cast to rob Australian workers of their livelihood. To the limit of our capacity we should manufacture everything we require, and protect ourselves against the selfcheap products of Japan and otber countries.  Trade and Customs) [5.52.].. - I am surprised that there should beany opposition to this item, which merely places imparted scrap iron, which comes i-ntto/petition with pig iron, on exactly the same footing as imported pig. ironi. I . alsopuzzled by the periodical outbursts of antagonism to the magnificent iron and. steel industry afc Newcastle.

It converts caw material from the soil infto> finished; products, aind but fox its operations', the Australian community would be heavily penalized in regard to the prices, of iron and steel. When the 1921 tarifi was before the House the iron masters, complained grievously of unfair competition througb the importation of scrap iron, and I believetbey were promised that this material would be placed cm exactly the same footing as pig iron. The promise was not honoured. committee now has an opportunity tohonour it by imposing a duty that is reasonable and consistent with the poficy of protection. The representations made by the users of scrap iron are not altogether ethical, or above suspicion-. The manufacturers are protected in respect of the goods they produce, and I bave no sympathy with any man who, while enjoying reasonable protection for his own products, objects to the producers of the raw material' be uses getting similar assistance. The Tariff Board's report upon scrap iron shows that in 1923 Australia imported 10,279 tons of cast iron chairs and 14,003 tons of cast iron scrap, or a total of 24,282 tons. In 1924 the total importations of the same material were 17^61 tons, and, for the nine months ended 31sfc March, 1925,. 17,243 tons, an average during the last three fears of over 20,000 tons per annum.  1911-13. were much greater.  Newcastle works, were not producing pig iron. I i manufacturers musthave tain amount of scrapiron for their industries, they can get plenty of it in traha. The United States of America, Canada, and Prance imposefcri-psame duty oa scrap iron as on pig iron, because obviously those commodities come; into com- competition with each other. The honourable member for' Kalgoorliesaid that am- scrap iron was required in the precipitation of copper. The process to which he refers needs, no iron chairs and cast iron scrap, but sheet iron. Will the honourable member inform, the committee bow muck copper is produced annually by the company to which he referred? Mr A GREEN. - I cannot.  of scrap iron to collect one ton of copper,, it is easy to see that a duty of £ 1 per ton on scrap iron will not necessitate any mine closing down. As the protectionproposed in this instance is reasonable, I ask the committee to support the item.",57

That that is not the policy of the Government honourable members will see in connection with, item 174-ma chines, machine tools, and appliances. Under that - item the Minister has power to permit goods not made in Australia .to come in free if manufactured in Great Britain, and subject to a duty of 10 per cent, if made in foreign - countries. The coal-miners are probably tibe best-paid workers in Australia, and it is ""well^nown that the mine-owners make substantial profits every year, and - axe - among the wealthiest section of the conaMunity.

Although it is known that there are big copper deposits in Queensland, Western Australia., and the Northern Territory, any machinery required to develop those deposits is subject to a duty of 55 - per cent, should it eome from foreign countries.

My objection is that sometimes it is subverted by special powers being given to a Minister whose decisions may not bear scrutiny. I should like to k-now if the Minister thinks that the item ought to remain in the tariff schedule, or whether it sbould be dispensed wibh altogether.",63
209,Mr COXEMMT,Unknown,"Reid) [S.17] - I hope that when the Minister brings the item - before the - committee again he will be in a position to give honourable members in formation as to its administration.

Mr MAUN .'(Perth) p . ^ l ] - T be M in ister, wben redrafting .tihis item, - should - give special attention to the (difficulties experienced under it in the 1921 schedule. I think I am rigbt in saying that when an item sucb as this, dealing with machines, machine tools, and appliances, is passed, honourable members have not a very clear understanding of its technical difficulties. We all bave a general 'conception of machines and machinery. I suppose that the average person will include many varieties of electrical machinery in his definition of an electrical machine. In one case an electric transformer was dutiable, whilst an electric alternator was allowed in duty free. The ordinary man in the street would include both in his definition of an electrical machine, and would be puzzled if any distinction were made between them. The Customs authorities informed me that they had consulted the Crown Law Department, which, no doubt, referred the matter to a technologist in order to get a technical definition of a machine. To be perfectly safe, they say that a machine must have moving parts. An electric transformer has moving parts, whilst an alternator is stationary, but, like a transformer, it transfers electrical energy, and is essentially a machine.",63
211,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,It would come in as an appliance under that definition.,64
212,Mr MANN,Unknown,"No ; the rulings given, as the result of consultation with the Crown Law Department, have entirely altered the interpretation. An alternator is not regarded as a machine, and, therefore, it is not dutiable, whereas a transformer, being classed as a machine, has to pay a high duty. This fine distinction, although it may be technically correct, savours a little of pedantry. It is desirable that we should aim at uniformity By omitting the whole of sub-items in their stead the following sub-items :"" (B) Log Band Sawing Machines and Band Reaawing Machines, but not including Carriages for either ad vaL (c) Cylindrical Cement Driers drical containers (D) Cement making Machines, n.e.i.; Boad making Machines; Stone crushing Machines with jaws up to and including 30 inches Ropeways exclusive ling and Portable Cranes; Coal Conveyors and Ash Handling Plants exclusive of motive power equipment - 00 Mining Machinery n.e.i - (It) Machines and Machinery n.e.i.",64
213,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) move That the item be amended by adding the following to sub-item n "" and on and after 25th  the honourable member. Mr MANN"" - I am glad that the Minister is in agreement with me. I understand that the question which I have raised will be dealt with when the new item is again before the committee. I suggest, therefore, that the position should be more clearly defined, and that the Minister should take a broader view. It is unfair that the department should be bound down by a legal decision. I admit that the position of the Minister is somewhat difficult. Necessarily he has to refer to some authority; but, in this I have shown, the scientific definition of the machine is something which Parliament did not take into consideration at the time.  weeks ago I addressed an inquiry to the Minister, at the request of Messrs G. Gramp and Sons, of Rowlands Flat, South Australia, with reference to a remission in the duty on a machine known as Coffey's still. I now remind the Minister of the request, in the hope that he will give it further consideration before the item is dealt with.

The natural protection afforded on such machines must be extraordinarily heavy, and should be sufficient. The proposed additional duty will be to the disadvantage of distant States like Queensland and Western Australia. We read of magnificent roads in the United States of America. We are spending enormous sums of money for the building of roads throughout the Gommonwealth, and these machines are essential for that class of work. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [8.30] - I have some knowledge of the manufacture of cement. I have participated in several inquiries into that industry. If there are any manufacturers in this country who can afford to pay for Australian machinery, they are the manufacturers of cement. Why should not these wealthy manufacturers pay for Australian machinery? The industry is in a very flourishing condition.  support the amendment. The honourable member for . South Sydney (Mr E Riley) gave some information that is interesting to one who knows differently. A recent royal, commission, of which I was a member, took evidence in Queensland, and was told that the cement works there could, without any additional duty, compete with foreign manufacturers within a certain radius of Brisbane, but that to do so at distances along the coast a further duty was necessary. They appealed to the then Minister for Trade and Customs, and obtained an increase of duty. Mr E. RILEY - This item does not relate to'the duty on cement, but to the duty on cement-making machinery.  ber said that the cement manufacturers were making fortunes rapidly. If that is so, the Minister should take some of the existing duty off cement. The honourable member cannot have the argument both ways. Australian cement manufacturers are trying to compete with foreign cement manufacturers, but the Government is hobbling them by taxing their machinery. Honourable members seem to be concerned about roads. agree that they are as important as ways, particularly in the large States. This Government has accepted some of the responsibility for road making, and has advanced money to the States for that purpose. It never should have obtained that money, but it is receiving so much revenue through the Customs that it does not know what to do with, it, and members and supporters of the Government are making themselves good fellows by handing it out. Mr E. RILEY - The Government gave a lot of if to Western Australia.  it is the taxpayers' money, nevertheless. Roads must be made, and yet we tax road-making machinery. It is Gilbertian. We should regard roads as more important than road-making machinery. It is difficult for some of the roads boards to obtain machines, and they do not want to hand large sums of money to the Treasurer for the privilege' of importing them. I feelingly support the amendment. I should be willing to vote for the complete removal of the duty.",64
214,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"North Sydney) [8.35]. - I do not understand why the duty has been raised on these items. It is not often that I find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Forrest  so striking that it ought to convince the Minister that he is in the wrong. Certainly this country wants good roads, more, almost, than it wants anything else. It seems to me that 27£ per cent, is a reasonable protection in the circumstances. I have recently travelled over Australian roads that are simply indescribably bad. No words that I can use would express my feelings about them; and if I have to couple with the names of the responsible shire councillors the name of the Minister, my mouth will be very full. The duty on cement-making machines, road-making machines, and stone-crushing machines should remain as it was.'",65
215,Mr SEABROOK,Unknown,"Franklin) [8.36] I support the amendment on the ground that increasing the duties will hamper development in Australia. Some time ago I approached the Government to try to obtain a remission of duty on a cement making plant that was being purchased I by a firm starting operations in Tasrail- mania. That company invested a large amount of money and tried to purchase the machinery in Australia. It then went to America, where it obtained quotations, but the Americans would not give a guarantee* that the machines would stand up to the work.. MCPHAITBN;. - Ts ; the honourable' berspeaking of Maria Island? Mr SEABROXD'E: - Yes , The company then went to Eaigland,. and! a ffom from Denmark was. apparently the only norm in the world that would guaraaatee its machines! Australian norms said could make the maehinery if the company would supply the plans and specificaany tions.. That was a most, extraordinary demand. The company made arrangeroadi ments to purchasethe machineryfrom the firm in England, which sent out an pert to erect it., at a cost of £100,000'. The duty that the company bad: to. pay was nearly £3'0-„000. It is a serioushindesirable drance todevelopment to charge- £30,000 bouses. duty on machinery that can-not be made m Australia. Ceanent-ni'akmg machinery is wanted in. this country for roads, buildthe schedule as: it stands. ings, and many other purposes-. I should not. object to the duty if the machinery could be made in Australia ; but when, cannot, the duty should be as light possible..",65
216,Mr HANK,Unknown,"Perth,). [8,40.] - One the difficulties-about this item is that refers, to. many aa?ti©les whioh have lation ta one another. I do not whether the Crown Law. Department given, the Minister a definition of '"" Aerial ropeways exclusive of cable."" Tbat is curious thing, and why it should, be .the same category as road-making machiI nery is hard to understand. The duty should not be increased on cement-maksome ing,, road-making, and stone-crushing machines, for the very good reason no grounds have been given, by the Minmachinery ister for the increase, ts a large number of these machines being imported ?. any Australian industry being injured? I understand that the facts are quite the reverse. In Queensland, Australianmachinery made machines have been in use for years-; in fact, the cement-makers there never use anything else . Speaking genetofind rally, I . should: say that road-making machines, such as road rollers, could net profitably be imported, in view of the portionately. heavy freight and duty.' .1 cannot undercompel stand why the duty should have been tutions raised unlessit was that the Minister saw am item that had not been raised, and give it my support. iradsed it. Nothing is of more importance to this country than the improvement of transportation. We are trying to improve it, but under this item we put art obstacle in. the way of the first step towards; making good roads. I am strongly in favour memofthe amendiment,. which I hope the Minister will; accept. Mr ©0©X (Indi)- [8.42],- I hope the Minister will: agree to r-evert to theold duty. I agree with previous speakers that good roads areessential tr> the de1 they velopment of tbisi country and I am iircl-iiied to believe that in some places; at rate, they arei more important than railways.

The purpose Is Oifi the duty is to prevent unpatriotic muaaicipal councils and other representative bodies placing their orders for this outside Australia wben they could obtain what they requirewithin theirown boundaries.

I shall Mr Rodgers' (Wannon) [8.47] - The first machinery referred to in this group is cement-making machinery. In my opinion, the cement manufacturing industry of Australia is sufficiently protected and in a position to be asked to stand up to its shaTe *of the protection necessary for the machinery with which it makes its product. Tne cement manufacturing companies are among3t the most prolific dividend payers we have. 'One of the drawbacks to the industry referred to by the honourable member Ior Forrest {Mi*. Prowse) is geograpbical. It is remarkable wben one goes round tie icoast-line of the Commonwealth to find that .the same industry flourishes in one part and languishes in another.  gation Act.",66
217,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"That may bave something to do with it. I had an opportunity of examining the - cement-making industry in Queensland, to wbicb the honourable .member referred. It was in a bad way, but that was - due to its geographical position. In Yictoria we have some <of the most prosperous .cement inamirfacfeuriiig <coaaoerns iai the Commonwealth.

I am confronted in the same group with another item, which it is imposing a very great strain on me to as'k me .to .support. It is asking me to go very far ito agree to the duty on road-making machines. The improvement of means of transport is of such .paramount importance to the Commonwealth that the Government has pledged its revenue for ten years to the extent of £2^,000,000 a year for the making of roads.

RILEY (South Sydney) [8.58]. - I have listened to members of the Country party trying to bring the sity for the construction of good roads into the consideration of the duties which should be imposed on the machinery cluded in this item. I have the honour to represent a part of the City of Sydney, and I can inform the committee that when the Sydney Municipal Council called for tenders for machinery with which to make good roads, it received are being made. tenders from importers, and also from local manufacturers. The council encrease gineer himself, an imported man, testition fied that the locally-made machines the best offered.  with the matter? Mr E.

They are not going to be made of cement. The hondebate  said that I knew nothing at all about the manufacture of cement, and that knew all about it. I had the honour a seat on the Arbitration Court in New South Wales, and inquired into cement-making and other industries. Because of the information I thus obthe tained about the profits made in the cement-making industry, I know that is one of the most prosperous in Ausany tralia. Therefore, I object to a reductralian tion of duties on cement-making chinery which the wealthy companies The engineering trades are experiencing a very bad time, I do not know of any skilled artisans t who are suffering more at the present time than the engineers, hundreds of ; in ;'.v whom are out of employment.

Australian engineers have patented a concretemixing machine which has helped substantially to reduce the cost of concrete roads and buildings. That machine necesis being made in Balmain, and why should not the manufacturers be protected? The Minister is doing right in inencouraging the engineering trade to make all the machinery that Australia requires. The statement by the honourable member for Franklin that concrete mixers cannot be made in Australia is incorrect. I know where such machines The mechanism is simple, and the only obstacle to an inof local production is the competiof cheap importations.

The question before us is, whether there is a case for the imposition of this duty or not. In my judgment there The changed conditions of the last few years bave made the previous tariff sufficient.

If the Minister thinks it advisable to reduce the British preference to 30 per cent., shall be willing to support him, but in no circumstance will I vote for duction of the intermediate tariff from 45 per cent., or the general tariff from 50 per oent. The honourable member Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) said that to get good roads he would get chinery from anywhere. I could agree with his statement if he added to it, Australia.""

I am surprised that honourable members who saw the wisdom of supporting an almost prohibitive duty on cotton tweeds are swallowing the bait of the free trade members of this and opposing the duty on road making machinery. I say quite definitely that I shall refuse to support any reduction of the general and intermediate tariff on this item, although I am prepared to support a small reduction of the British preferential tariff.",72
250,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [9.36] - I see the logic of the stand taken by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackbut there is sometimes a conflict between logic and merit. Tbis proposed duty ranges higher than the average duty a on agricultural machinery, which is reprogarded as adequate. There are many involved types of agricultural machines. On the merits of the case, I favour the proposed reduction. As to the question of road construction, I should like to see is. every penny of the Commonwealth grant of £20,000,000 for Australian roads go to inAustralian workmen and Australian industry. I am aware that the spending of of the money will be vested chiefly in our local governing bodies, and that, in the main, they have a conscience which leads to give a preference to local indusTwo or three cases which indicate a reverse attitude have been given a good deal of ' publicity in this debate, and probably rightly so, but nevertheless I I believe that the bulk of this money will be spent in the interests of Australian a reworkers and Australian industry. There is a point in regard to the duty on textiles that the honourable member for Bass for should remember. The tax on that item is levied on the whole community, but mathe tax on road-making machinery is really an additional burden on local rate"" in payers, who, as land-holders, are already in heavily taxed. The cost of road-making in Australia today is outrageously high. It is nest to impossible to make roads bere that are worth the money spent on them, and every road that is made involves an additional heavy expense for maintenance. This is a stupendous question that has been pushed right to the forefront of both Federal and State programmes. I urge that we should use common sense and moderation in the expenditure of our public money.  I should not bave participated again in the debate on this item but for the remarks of certain honourable members who represent city constituencies, and who are not at all careful about the terms in which they refer to honourable members wbo differ from tbem. A conflict of two ideals causes strange things to happen at times. Let me quote, as an illustration, an experience of the Western Australian Government. It had decided to purchase another ship to replace one of the fleet of the Government line. Of course, it desired to bave the ship built in Australia, but it called for tenders in Australia and England. Wben they were opened, it was found that a ship built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard would cost nearly twice as much as a ship built in England. The Government then had to decide between two ideals-one , the development of its State shipping line; and the other, the encouragement of Australian industry. The problem was rendered the more difficult of solution by reason of the fact that the Government shipping line was losing from £70,000 to £100,000 a year. Mr A. GEEEN - The honourable member ought to state that the British quote was only made possible because of the assistance given to the British shipbuilders by the Britisb Industries Preservation Act, by which it was possible for them to work on borrowed money without paying interest for years.  cided that it would save its shipping line, and have the vessel built in England. After the decision was announced, a deputation from the Trades Hall waited upon the Premier to request bim to alter it. Wben the members of the deputation stated their case, the Minister laid all his cards on the table, and asked them to say whether, on the facts, it was possible to have the ship built in Australia, and the deputation decided that it could not honourably say that it was. On the definite matter of road-making machinery, we ought to bear in mind that good roads are essential to the development of Australia. If this duty is ratified, heavier burdens will be placed upon local governing bodies which are charged with the responsibility of road-making, and it will be impossible for tbem to operate satisfactorily. Some of the roads boards in Western Australia are trying to co-operate in the purchase of up-to-date road-making machinery, but the imposition of this duty will render it almost impossible for them to do very much. Surely a 27^ per cent, protective duty is sufficient for the Australian manufacturers. If they put their shoulder to the wheel and work hard they sbould be able to compete without a duty. . As far as cement-making machines are concerned, all I desire to say is that if the Australian manufacturers could market their cement at alittle lower price, the output would be increased tenfold. It is all very well for the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) to say that cement is cheap around Sydney. The reverse is the case at places distant from the capital cities. In the north of Queensland, for instance, where they need cement for making channels, dams, roads, and a hundred and one other things, it is too expensive for the people to think of using it. It is a heavy commodity, and the freight from the capital cities to the distant parts of the Commonwealth, makes the price of it almost prohibitive. The only way that the people who need t.he cement most can get it at a reasonable price is to establish small cement works in their own localities; but the imposition of this higher duty on cement-making machinery will make it more difficult for them to do even that. Are we never going to give any consideration to the requirements of our outposts ? It is less costly to ship cement from England than from Sydney to the north Queensland ports. I trust that the amendment of the honourable member for Swan will be carried.  Trade and Customs) [9.44] - I had intended to reserve my remarks on the general question. of machinery until the next item was before us. I have listened carefully to the arguments that have been advanced during the last hour for and against, this duty, but before embarking upon my m contribution to .the debate, I wish to remind honourable members that they still bave a good deal of work to do in order to complete their consideration of this schedule Perhaps the few observations I have now to offer may .clarify the position. am prepared to meet the committee to some extent in this matter, but I first want to say - most seriously that in no circumstances, unless by farce majewe, will the Government agree to reduce the general tariff rate on machinery. Industries Preservation Aet, - during the past two or three years, bas been operating in a good many instances against German goods because of the depreciated German currency. The Prime Minister stated .about nine months ago that tihe - German currency was no longer depre-ciated. But while rtbe .gazettals remainamd I refuse to lift tbem- I - am afraid that we must admit that, Tirade? present - circumstamces, we have no 'legal .power ton collect dumping duties on that section. For that reason, the Government will not agree to reduce the duties imposed upon foreign machinery. This is our rampart .against undue competition from countries from wbicb 'competition may rapidly come. I think that all honourable members are sympathetic towards the Mother Country, and to show bhat the gesture of preference which has been made still remains, in spite of all that 'has been said, I am prepared, on behalf of the Government, to accept an amendment reducing the British preferential rate on road-making machines n.e.i., and stone-crushing machines from 35 per cent, - to 30 per .cent.; but I am. not willing to Teducethe duty on foreign goods.  making machines?  ing machinery because it is being made successfully in Australia.

253,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [9.50] - I suppose that I sball bave to be satisfied with the Minister's proposal, but, before I withdraw any amendment, I must express m y disappointment with the nature of the debate. W it h Ibe exception of the honourable member foT Y a r r a '(Mr. Scullin), .one honourable membeT after another was prepared to agree to .any duty without submitting any reason for doing so. The honourable member for Yarra certainly clarified the position, and explained his reasons for supporting the duties, but other honourable members were prepared to stand behind the Australian manufacturers .and to impose any duty, irrespective of ifs virtue, or the necessity for its imposition. I should not be surprised if in the near futune the Minister and many honourable members demanded - something in the nature of prohibition. The 'honourable member for Yarra told us that in 1921, just after there bad been am extraordinary increase in the duties, there were thousands more men employed in - this industry than are employed in it today. The natural corollary is that if .the - duties are furthe r increased, no persons will be employed in the industry. That is the direction in whch we are drifting. We had a magnificent export trade in agricultural mawould chinery before high duties on that machinery were imposed. We bave now lost that trade. For the same reason we amd have lost the trade which we previously ashbad in - superphosphates. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) cannot - see why - the duties on - cement-making machines should be reduced. Does he know that the cement companies of Australia are making enormous profits? Does he desire that any new companies which may engage in this business shall be handicapped in their competition with the older companies? It is only about two years ago that these companies, which are now so wealthy that they have to hide their profits, got the Minister to impose a special dumping duty on cement landed here at less than certain freight rates. The price of cement in Australia is approximately three times the price in the United States of America.",74
254,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I am not proposing to increase the duty on cement, but on cement-making machinery.",75
255,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"There is a great demand for cement throughout Australia. If some companies are making such enormous profits it would be wise to allow other companies to enter into competition, with them. If necessary, the cement duties could also be reduced. I object to honourable members being prepared to impose additional duties when there is no justification for the increase, and when the higher duties will only mean extra profits to the manufacturers. It is heart breaking to find honourable members willing to go to any extreme in the imposition of duties, regardless of what the people will be called upon to pay. I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment (by leave) withdrawn.  posed That the item be amended by adding the following to sub-item D And on and after 25th March. 1926 : 176 D (1).

256,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [9.57] - I must express my surprise at the action of the Minister in proposing this amendment. It appears that, having accepted the suggestion of certain members in the Ministerial corner, he has got what he deserves, because be had no sooner expressed his willingness to reduce the British preferential tariff than the honourable member for Swan (Mr . [80] Tanff. [24 MARCH , 1926.] Gregory) immediately found fault with him. I submit that these machines are in exactly the same category as other machinery manufactured in Australia. There is no difference in principle. We are all desirous of having good roads in Australia; but we are not justified in refusing to have the machinery necessary for constructing those roads manufactured in Australia. The Minister said that he would not agree to an alteration of the duty on machines imported from foreign countries. He also pointed out that there was a possibility of some of these machines coming from Germany. I have no objection to giving preference to Great B r it a in ; but our first duty is to our own manufacturers. If we can manufacture any article here, and by its manufacture give employment to our ownpeople, we are not justified in giving an undue preference even to Great Britain , although we are justified in giving that country an advantage over foreign countries. Can the Minister say that tbese machines will not be taken from Germany to England unassembled, and, after assembly there, sent to Australia? I have a lively recollection of what happened a few years ago when I moved a censure motion because of the Government's attitude towards the iron and steel industry. I pointed out then that iron and steel goods from Germany were sent to England, where they were put together, and afterwards shipped to pro- Australia, the Britisb exporter claiming that he was entitled to British preference because the machinery was 25 per cent. British manufacture.. As a result of the importation of iron and steel into Great Britain , British workmen were displaced, and many iron and steel works in the Mother Country were closed down.",75
257,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The honourable member knows that there bas been a revision of the principle of British preference in our tariff.,75

Mr Charlton ' - No ; but otber countries besides Germany manufacture these heavy machines. The statement which I made in this House several years ago was disputed at the time, but I had the satisfaction, three years later, of hearing the Minister say that everything I had said on the occasions referred to was absolutely true.  servation Act operates in regard to any country with a depreciated currency.",75
259,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"As far as dumping is concerned, yes; but the Minister has missed my point.",76
260,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The alteration to principle of British preference now makes dumping impossible.,76
261,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not agree with the honourable member. ' Tbere is nothing to prevent iron and steel from being imported into Britain from Belgium or Prance, assembled in Great Britain, and sent to Australia under the British' preferential tariff. When I was in England this was being done, and the franc had not then fallen to its present level.  the Opposition was away this Parliament passed a measure which provided that to secure the benefits of the preferential tariff, goods from Great Britain must contain at least 75 per cent. Britisb labour or material.",76

263,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,I doubt if the depreciation of the franc affects the position in any way.,76
264,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"When I was in England many British iron and steel works had closed down owing to continental competition, and there was practically no demand for British coal. It was complained that much of the unemployment then prevailing was due to the importation of iron and steel from France, Belgium, and Germany. position is no better today, so we sbould hesitate before we do anything that might give preference to iron or steel products from countries with a depreciated currency. After the complete exposition of the case for the Australian manufacturers given by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), there is no need for any honourable member to traverse the same ground. I am surprised that the Minister has backed down. This is the second time be bas weakened this evening during the debate on the schedule.  last.",76

267,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If the Minister gives way like this, honourable members on this side who stand for the policy of protection will have to do a little fighting.",76
268,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The honourable member knows very well that no tariff goes - through without some compromise.,76
269,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not mind compromise, but when I see a disposition on the part of the Minister to give way too readily, it is about time for us to protest. We stand for the encouragement of Australian industries aud the employment of our own people. That the majority of honourable members are declared protectionists was clearly shown in the division last night, when 46 members voted for a certain item, and only eleven were opposed to it. There is only a small minority opposed to these duties, and I regret that the Minister has, in a moment of weakness, given way on this item. It will not affect our road-making policy one iota. Even if it did, in view of the fact that the Commonwealth is providing so mucb money for road-making, we bave every right to see that our own people secure employment in the manufacture of machines for road-making purposes. Those honourable members wbo object to The these duties are inconsistent. They are in favour of borrowing money to bring immigrants to this country, but will do nothing to encourage industries that will provide employment. The only way to provide employment and develop this country, and increase its population, is to foster its industries. The development of the secondary industries creates a market for the produce of the man on the land. There is no escape from that conclusion, ancl I am surprised that representatives of country constituencies cannot see the force of the argument. Without a home market, the man on the land is doomed to failure. Dozens of settlers, many of them Teturned soldiers, are in difficulties today because they have not a home market.",76
270,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,The honourable member's policy is killing the home market.,77

272,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"This tariff will not increase the cost of living to preciable extent. A gentleman interested in motor accessories was speaking to this evening. He said that, prior to the amended by a reduction. recent duties being imposed, certain accesme sories cost over £8. A factory for the clamation manufacture of them was started in tralia, and the Australian-made accessory was placed on the market at a price less than that of the imported article. mediately the importers brought their price down to £4, a reduction of 100 per cent. The price of the Australiau is now within 5s. of the price of the imported article. That shows how the porters exploited the market before there was protection. The greater the output night. of an article, the lower is the cost of production. If there is not a market for large output, it is usually impossible produce at a cheap rate.

We ought to be able to increase our lation more rapidly than we have done during recent years. I am surprised the Minister giving way to the opposthat tion on this item. If he is going to give feared. way on other items that we still have to consider, honourable members on this side will bave to put up a fight. These machines can be manufactured in this country just as well as many otber things with which we have been dealing.",77

275,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I do not say that he has not, but the honourable member should remember that members of the Oppostion have stood by it, too. I am protesting now because the Minister bas commenced to weaken.",77

We have had the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) advocating increased duties on coal-cutting machines, any apand the spectacle of the ""man of iron,"" the Minister for Trade and me Customs, allowing the schedule to be It seems to that the dreary drip of free trade detbat we have bad from the Ministerial corner has worn away the Ausprotectionist stone. I stand bebind my leader (Mr Charlton) in objecting to this alteration of the schedule, and I Imhope that every honourable member on this side will protest against the weak action of the Minister in yielding to the article representations from the corner.",77
277,Mr MANNING,Unknown,Tb e honourable memimber stood behind the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) once to,77
278,Mr COLEMAN,Unknown,"Tb e honourable a member is misrepresenting me. I said to that there was something in the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's argument which required answering by the Minister. Later the Minister answered it to promy satisfaction. I claim to bave been I should like to know what increased cost will be incurred in the construction of roads by the slight increase proposed in British preferential rate on this item. The arguments put forward in favour of The inhonorable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) has pointed out that our most dangerous competitor in the engineering popufield is Great Britain. Any honourable member who has visited Australian enat gineering shops will have been informed English competition is most to be The general manager of the Broken Hill works, and the manager of any engineering works in any of the States, will confirm that statement. It is not an anti-British sentiment; it is brought about by the depreciated wages in that country. I showed the other night that while prices of certain electrical and engineering requirements had fallen by 70 per cent., wages had fallen by only 30 per cent. We have just as much to fear from dumped goods from England as from any otber country. A - duty of 35 per cent., in view of all the facts submitted during the second-reading debate and in committee, is hardly sufficient to meet the competition of English manufacturers of roadrmaking machines. I strongly object to the proposed alteration of the schedule. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [10.20] - I should like to know if the Minister has reconsidered this matter. Does the Prime Minister agree, after this item bas been debated for the whole night, with the IMinister's proposition to go back upon the original proposal of the Government because a member of the Country party who never supports the Government has moved for a reduction of the duty 1 Directly the M in ister gave way on one item, the members of the Country party demanded another reduotion. That is probably what will be done in connection with every remaining item of the schedule.",77
279,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Countr y party members have been encouraged to do it . Mr E. RILEY - They have been encouraged by the weakness of the Minister. The Cabinet adopted this schedule, and the party opposite agreed to it . We have been trying to do the best we can for the industries in this country, but the Minister in a weak moment backed down. Country party members, assuming that they had the Government on the run, immediately moved a further amendment.  ber started it himself on coal-cutting machinery. Mr E . RILEY - I bave pointed out before that the engineering industry of the Commonwealth is in a deplorable state. Thousands of men were walking about the streets hoping that the duties to be imposed on machinery would lead to their re-employment. A reduction of 5 per cent, in the duty on road-making machinery is not going to lessen the cost of making roads. I have said before that a reduction of the duty on cementmanufacturing machinery will not lead to the construction of good roads in country districts. In most country districts the roads have not yet reached such a stage of development as to make the use of steam road rollers possible. I think the Minister would do well to report progress now, and wben we bave slept on the matter we shall be able tomorrow to dispose of it very easily. Did the reasons given by the honourable member for Stwan (Mr Gregory) convince the Minister that he was wrong when he submitted these duties in the tariff schedule 1  saw how the honourable member for Swan impressed me by his proposal for a return of the old duty on coal-cutting machines instead of allowing them to come in free, as provided for in the schedule. Mr E . RILEY - No , it was I wbo suggested that alteration. Honourable members on this side are not prepared to see the manufacturers of this country brow-beaten by members of the Country party, who do not believe in the establishment of secondary industries. What they want is a high price for maize, a good market for wheat, a duty of £ 4 per ton for potatoes, cheap freights, cheap labour, and good roads. If they get these things they have no care for any one else. The division which took place on the duties on cotton goods showed that this committee is protectionist to the backbone.",78
280,Mr STEWART,Unknown,"Prohibitio n to the backbone. Mr E . RILEY - A majority of 46 to 11 in favour of'a protective duty is surely an indication that the committee stands for the encouragement of local industries. The engineering industry is crying out for more protection, and yet it is proposed to go back to the old duty, which was found to be insufficient to effectively protect the industry, and led to numbers of men being thrown out of employment.",78
281,Mr MANN,Unknown,"The imemployment argument is one to which the honourable member never listens when it ig submitted from this side. Mr E . RILEY - If we import all the machinery required for the development of this country, we shall have many thousands of people unemployed. I have been returned to this House as a protectionist. I see that our reinforcements are arriving, and I may take advantage of an opportunity to speak again later on.",78
282,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"Macquarie) [10.26]. - I have no doubt that before agreeing to submit the amendment suggested to him, the Minister for Trade and  considered the matter. I am absolutely confident that he has the interests of the country at heart. He would not have moved the amendment if he did not think that the industry is sufficiently protected. I do not think that the schedule as printed cannot be improved. I was one wbo yesterday asked the Minister to withdraw a certain item in order that the proposed duty might be increased, and I should do the same to-night if I thought that should be done. I am esseutially interested in primary production in this country. As a primary producer, I consider that a protectionist tariff is in the interests of primary producers. As the Leader of the Opposition bas said, the best market we can get for our primary products is our home market. I want to see that market increased as much as possible. Last year a friend of mine was starting a new industry, and told me that be had brought out sixteen Britisb expert operatives, with their families to work in it. He said to me, ""Do you not think I bave done more for the country in bringing tbese men out to work in a secondary industry than I should have done if I had brought tbem out to start growing fruits for drying for a market that is over-supplied?"" I had to admit that I thought be had done rigbt. It is only a little over twelve months since I was in Western Australia, and a royal commission was taking evidence on the disabilities of that State as a partner in the federation. Either honourable members from that State, wbo are taking such a prominent part in this debate, and not representing the views of the people of that State, or a most remarkable change in public opinion has occurred there. I was in Western Australia when the royal commission was taking evidence in regard to the disabilities of that State uncier federation, and the fact impressed upon me by witnesses and conversations with citizens was the handicap imposed upon Western Australia by the removal of the interstate tariff barriers that existed prior to federation. They pointed out that their young secondary industries were not able to compete against the larger and betterestablished industries in the eastern States, which had a bigger local market and could produce on a large scale.  evidently beard more than the commission. Mr MANtNTNG - I am relating what was told to me by many people, including the honourable member ""for Porrest. Yet be and others representing Western Australia are trying to break down the existing tariff barrier and thus bring about in the eastern States a condition of affairs the existence of which in Western Australia induced the Commonwealth Government to make a grant of £450,000 to that State. ",79
283,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"I am giving the honourable member a little of his own medicine. Wben the Western Australia Grant Bill was before the House we were told that the condition of that State was so pitiable that it must have £450,000 from the Commonwealth Treasury. Onp. sees no evidence of poverty amongst the residents of Western Australia.",79
284,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, Does the honourable member propose to connect tbese remarks with the item before the committee ?,79
285,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"Yes . The. duties on this item will help to keep going an important secondary industry, and, if they are reduced at the instance of Western Australian members, the secondary industries in the eastern States will suffer as those in the west through the loss of tariff protection. By supporting the secondary industries we are acting in the best interests of our country. In my own electorate there is an iron foundry employing 3,000 men. ",79
286,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"My personal political interests would be better served if that industry were in the honourable member's electorate, but I am voting for a policy that I consider beneficial to Australia. A ' few miles from the iron foundry is a cement factory employing 900 men, and nearby is a town of 5,000 people who are entirely dependent upon that factory. Any one who has seen that town, entirely supported, as it is, by one factory, and does not realise the value of the market thus provided for our primary products is lacking in judgment. I feel sure that the Minister agreed to the amendment with his eyes opeD, and I , as a primary producer, will support him in giving such protection as he thinks necessary to enable the secondary industries to develop and so increase the home market for primary products.",79
287,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [10.31]. - This is only the second occasion upon which a tariff schedule has been introduced with the endorsement of the Tariff Board, after full investigation of all the duties proposed. The amendment involves a reduction of the duties recommended by the board, and every true protectionist must oppose that on principle. If the Minister had realized the trouble that would result, he would not have accepted the amendment, bub would have allowed the question to be decided by a vote of the committee. The Minister may have thought that, by making a small concession, he would overcome a little opposition, but he has encouraged the fighting spirit of honourable members in the Ministerial corner. They have tasted blood, and will clamour for more sacrifices. I do not object to those shandygaff free traders, or advanced revenue tariffists, fighting for principles in which they believe, but eleven ""members must not be allowed to think that they can override the protectionist sentiment of this committee and the people. If the electors oould vote on this issue, they would declare for a protective policy, possibly equalled only by the tariffs of the United States of America and Japan. The extent to which Germany protects her interests is indicated by the fact that a amall phonograph, a typewriter, or a pocket pedometer has to pay a duty of £12",80
288,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown," I remind honourable members that the general debate on the tariff is completed, and I ask them to confine their remarks to the specific item before the committee and the amendment thereon.",80
289,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I have not - the amendment moved by the Minister before me, but if you, sir, will allow me to this peruse it, I shall endeavour to make my remarks relevant to the question before the Chair. The amendment proposes to reduce by 5 per cent, the Britisb preferential rate.",80
290,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"It should bave been 45 per cent, in the original schedule, instead of 35 per cent.",80
291,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It should have been increased. The Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, in referring to machines and machinery, locomotives, road roller, and motive power machinery included in items 176, 177, and 178, state- *- 1 Those might be termed the general engineering items, and, therefore, at the outset, it is desired to stress the importance of the engineering industry to Australia from the national stand-point, and the necessity for having thoroughly well-equipped engineering shops fully manned in the matter of defence will appeal to all. It is regrettable that in recent years this industry has been through a period of severe depression that almost crippled it, but it is gratifying that a timely .rescue was brought about by the introduction of the new tariff schedule. The Tariff Board, after an exhaustive inquiry, was unable to see its way to recommend duties to the extent that had been applied for, and their recommendations are the duties included in the new schedule. _ Two of the disabilities that Australian engineers have to contend with are the high cost of raw material, and that of labour, compared witli those of the United Kingdom, apart from the position obtaining in foreign countries. For these reasons it has been impossible to obtain a fair quota of the trade, which is reflected in the number of large orders which have been sent overseas. One of the large engineering firms kept a record of tenders submitted during the period 1st July, 1923, to 31st March, 1924.; which totalled f2,428,921, but all the business they secured was 6.6 per cent., the largest proportion of the balance being placed overseas, the difference in Australian quotations with tenders from other countries ranging from 25 per cent, to 77 per cent., after allowing for duty, freight, and all landing charges. It might be pointed out that, with regard to efficiency, the firm referred to is recognized as being one of the most np-todate and efficient shops in Australia. Taking all things into consideration, and the special conditions the workmen enjoy in Australia as compared to those in Great Britain, by reason of the fact that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court award provides a weekly wage, payment for holidays, and sickness, and restricted juvenile labour, it is safe to say that wages in Australia are fully 100 per cent, higher than in the United Kingdom. It cannot be denied that the skill and ability of the Australian engineer is quite on a par with those in competing countries, and the work turned out compares favourably, so that all that is necessary is for the industry to be sufficiently protected to place it on an equal footing in regard to all the circumstances with its competitors seas. To show the importance of the industry, according to the returns of the Commonwealth Statistician for the year ended 30th June, -1924, in connection with engineering and foundries, it may be noted that there were 1,343 factories, employing 33,052 hands, and {paying in wages £6,049,295, with value of plant and buildings £10,918,919, and the value of output £24,151,439. It may be said that for Australian requirements there ni'e classes of machinery which are not made in Australia, in many instances because of the limited demand it is not a commercial proposition to produce them here. Attention is therefore directed to item 174, which provides for the free admission of such. II is urged that tlic items and duties in the schedule be ratified as of great necessity to - the well-being of Australia. Such a statement from the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia the statement. must appeal to every honourable member. While I trust that Great Britain will continue to prosper, I hope that she will wipe out that infamy wbicb permits her to receive a preference on the basis of quarter. goods beiug 100 per cent, of British manufacture, whereas in many cases they consist of only 75 per cent, of British manufacture, the balance being imported from Germany or some other foreign country. The Minister, I believe, in answer to a question I submitted some time since, said that the proportion of Britisb manufacture required to secure the benefit of the British preferential tariff, in respect of imports from Great Britain, had been increased from 25 per cent, to 75 per cent. Even this is not fair to the British workman, and in justice to Great Britain I am I anxious to see an alteration made. lb. The Minister agreed, I suppose, for the sake of peace and quietness, to take 5 per cent, off the British preference, but if he persists in that practice he find himself engaged in the most lively tariff debate that he has ever known. After all, honourable members who are trying to reduce the tariff are only shandy-gaff free traders. I have no jection to German manufactures coming here under reasonable conditions. A few years ago the phrase ""Made in Germany"" rang throughout the world. I believe price per cwt. that similar prominence could to the phrase "" Made in England"" if the British people set to work. I conversed with a good many English people, ft year or so ago, when I bad the pleaoversure of touring South Africa in the company of the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Hill), and Conservatives and Liberals alike told me that they thought it was a blot on the escutcheon of Old England that she should, by a subterfuge, introduce into Australia manufactures that were said to be British, but which, in fact, were not. For many years Australia has elected huge majorities of protectionists to this Parliament with the object of developing a really sound protectionist, policy. The honourable member for Swan, . in the course of this debate, said that a certain machine cost three times as much in Australia as in the United States of America. I sbould like bim to give me proof of In conclusion, may I say that the glove has been thrown down. If the Minister attempts to whittle dowa his tariff, we shall understand that he bas picked it up; and we shall fight without Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. THE PRICE OF BUTTER. Motion (by Mr Bruce) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",80
292,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [10.56]. - I sball not delay honourable members very long. I merely wish to say that wben I ask a question in this House with the object of ascertaining the price of Australian butter bere and in England, expect a plain answer to it. If every householder in Australia who buys 'a of butter - is contributing 3d. to a fund to enable butter to be exported oa a profitable basis, let tbem he told so in unequivocal language. I asked the Minwill ister representing the Minister for Markets and Migration a question oa this point, and I hope he will not be offended when I say that I got a fat lot of information from him. When I inobquire, for the purposes of comparison, the price per lb. that butter is being spld at in London and in Melbourne, on a given date, I do not desire to know the I only want a plain be given answer to my question.
