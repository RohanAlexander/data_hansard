4,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"I have received a telegram from Mr John Fletcher, M.H.A. for Gambier, in which he asksWhy are tons of cigarette papers bein« pulped into wrapping paper at Cellulose Snuggery?

Mr HARRISON - Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the warning issued by Mr Justice Brennan in theQueensland Criminal Court, and published in today's press,, that defiance of the Arbitration Court, and direct action mean nothing less than bloodshed and bloody, revolution, and that since the war certain influences havearisen and are trying to disrupt and' ruin the country by overthrowing the normal' form of government? Did His Honour issue this warning when imposinga fine of £100 on a striker for a vicious assault upon a. volunteer labourer at theMura'rr'ie bacon factory, near Brisbane?"" Does the Prime Minister concur in theview expressed by Mr Justice Brennan? If he does, what action does he propose to take with a view to - avoiding thethreatened revolution which His Honour forecast ? Mr - CHIFLEY - I have, not seen the statement attributed to Mr Justico Brennan. Knowing something of HisHonour, I can say thatoccasionally he is prone to make rather exaggerated statements. If he has made the statement attributed to him, I do not accept it as an expression of the truth. I am not aware of any action that I need take beyond what the Industrial Court, of Queensland is empowered to take in. connection with ""the trouble. ARMED FORCES.

6,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"I assure the honourable member that the Government desires that the young men in the Army, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy shall be demobilized the earliest possible date. Betwepn 1st October, 1945, and the 22nd June, 1946, 283,000 armed personnel were demobilized. With Cabinet approval, I set up a special .committee, composed of the Secretary of the Department of the Army, Mr Sinclair, as chairman, and . Mr. Norman Watt, representative of the Treasury,- and the Adjutant-General, members, to make a special survey of all army establishments, with, a yiew to ensuring that everything possible is being done to discharge men immediately they become surplus.

10,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"A question on this subject was asked while the Minister for External Affairs was in the House. He then said-and this represents the views, of the Government-that he believed that at the Government ought not to be asked to the make a judgment until the facts had been investigated. I understand that the subject has been investigated by a committee, and that certain recommendations have been made. . The final decision will, of course, he taken by the United Nations.

14,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say whether the supply of wheat for local stock has been cut by a further .5 per cent.? If so, what is the reason for this further reduction in addition to the drastic cut already in operation, and will the Minister see that the former ration is restored?",13
15,Mr SCULLY,Unknown,"I did not know that a further cut had been made. The honourable member has repeatedly interviewed me on behalf of poultry-farmers in his electorate with a view to getting more wheat for them. I shall order an immediate investigation, and if it is at all possible, .as I think it is, this most recent cut of 5 per cent, will be restored. NA CIVIL AVIATION. CRITICISM AND REPORTS.",14
16,Mr WHITE,DEPARTMENTS OP AIR AND,"In order that the Parfair liament may be better informed regarding the criticisms of the administration the Royal Australian Air Force made by Air Vice-Marshal Bostock, will the Minister for Air lay on the table of House the Barry report on discontent among members of the Royal Australian graph ? Air Force in the north, and also the Slater committee's reports and the partmental report on civil aviation, of which have yet been presented to House?",14
17,Mr DRAKEFORD,DEPARTMENTS OP AIR AND,"The honourable member's question covers - a number of subjects embracing a wide range unrelated subjects. The Barry report which was clear and concise was made available to the press immediately it into my hands. The press allegedly that analysed the report and presented a very muddled story to the public, so much that two newspapers had to write addiProceedings tional articles to explain the original versions they had published.",14
18,Mr FRANCIS,DEPARTMENTS OP AIR AND,"Why should the pressParliament, get a report which is denied to members of this House?",14
19,Mr DRAKEFORD,DEPARTMENTS OP AIR AND,"I have no tion to tabling the Barry report. I have not been asked previously to table it. Whatever reports are given to the press should certainly be available to Parliament. The Slater committee's reports were made to me for my own consideration on subjects [80] which I considered required investigation, and consequently I do not propose to table them. As to the report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Civil Aviation, the honourable - member has asked for its presentation at least half a dozen times. The answer has invariably been "" No "" ; it still is "" No "" . NA BROADCASTING BILL 1946. NEWSPAPER REPORT OF DEBATE.",14
20,Mr HAYLEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Has the Minister for Information seen this morning's edition of the Daily Telegraph in which only the speeches of members of the Opposition are reported on the bill to broadcast the proceedings of this House? As it is well established, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), that a and accurate report is required of the proceedings of this House,"" is not the of Daily Telegraph report a gross breach of privilege? If so,' does the Minister consider that the New South Wales' the Crimes Act should be invoked to deal with the proprietors of the Daily Telede Mr Calwell - I take no notice of none what appears in the Daily Telegraph, the nor do I take much notice of the opinions of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) when he 3peaks in either his legal or his political capacity. I am of not aware whether the Crimes Act of New South Wales could be invoked in respect of the breach of privilege alleged came by the honourable member. The very fact the Daily Telegraph printed only the speeches of members of the Opposition so during the debate on the Parliamentary Broadcasting Bill proves to me that this chamber was right last night in extending absolute privilege to those ""who broadcast the proceedings of the because the people will now hear both sides of a debate when the press of Australia deliberately prints only the objeccontribution of one side. DROUGHT RELIEF.",14
21,Mr BERNARD CORSER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"In view of the devastating drought over much of the rural area of Queensland will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, in conjunction with the State Government or otherwise, secure an early report on existing conditions there so that drought assistance may be extended to those in necessitous circumstances % Will the honourable gentleman also secure a report as to the possible value of water servation schemes in providing an assurance against such loss and hardship in the future?",14
22,Mr SCULLY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Since this Government took office it has consistently adopted .the policy that when drought is only partial and limited to certain areas relief is primarily a matter for the State governments, though when overtures have been made to the Commonwealth by State governments for assistance in providing drought relief, in no case has the Commonwealth refused to contribute on a £1 for £1 basis. If the Queensland Government makes an approach to the Commonwealth in this connection, I have no. doubt it will be treated in the same way as have other State governments seeking similar assistance. Water conservation is primarily a' matter for the States. The financing of water conservation projects is a matter for the Loan Council. REPATRIATION . "" MONTEVIDEO MABU "" : PENSIONS FOB DEPENDENTS OF VICTIMS.",15
23,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"In view of the published decision to pay war pensions to the dependants of the victims of the Monetevideo Maru disaster, will the Minister for Repatriation say whether the pensions will be paid from the date of the decision or from some future date?",15
24,Mr FROST,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"That is being investigated, but I feel sure that the pensions will be paid from the date on which the decision was made. In conjunction with the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward), I am trying to get complete information with regard to the persons who were on the vessel. HIGH COURT.",15
25,Mr FALSTEIN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Has the Acting Attorney-General seen the report in the Sydney Morning Herald, of today that the President of the United States America has taken the most unusual course of inviting four judges of the Supreme Court of the United States of America to resign? Having regard to the age and incapacity of at least two Justices of the High 'Court of Australia, would the Acting Attorney-General care con- to follow a similar course here?",15
26,Mr MENZIES,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Chair , chair! No honourable gentleman is entitled to reflect on the judiciary.",15
27,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,A reference to age is not a reflection on the judiciary.,15

29,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,""".Incapacity"" might mean "" illness "".",15
30,Mr HOLLOWAY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Yes , I did notice the statement alleged to have been made by President Truman. The lessons that we might learn from it will take some time to consider. ATOMIC BOMB TESTS.",15
31,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"In ""view of the great public interest in the development of atomic weapons, I ask the Prime Minister whether he has received reports from the Australian observers of the atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. If so, will he make a statement to the House with regard to the contents of the reports and as to the results of the tests?",15
32,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"No reports have yet been received, but as soon as they are, I shall see what information can be made available, to the House as the result of the observations. MEAT INDUSTRY. PIG MEATS: APPOINTMENT OF INSPECTOR IN VICTORIA.",15
33,Mr SCULLY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS," by leaveYesterday, the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) referred to the appointment by the Controller of Meat Supplies of an inspector in Victoria to supervise pig sales, and'mentioned that the officer appointed was. also a buyer of pigs. The facts are that, owing to the excessively high prices which were being paid for pigs in Victoria in May and June of last year, representatives of certain sections of the industry requested the of Controller of Meat Supplies to police markets in order to ensure that prices were related to the prices determined by the Commonwealth Government under the pig-meats plan. The. Controller of Meat Supplies endeavoured to obtain the services of a competent independent man to carry out these duties, and ultimately accepted a recommendation from a committee of bacon-curers and exporters that Mr J. M . Wilson, a pig-meats exporter, be appointed. Mr Wilson began duty on the 10th June, 1945, and ceased duty on the 19th July, 1945, a period of less than six weeks. He carried out his duties to the complete satisfaction of the Controller of Meat 'Supplies, and at a financial loss to himself. I confess that I am at a loss to understand the reason why the honourable member raised this matter twelve months after the person concerned ceased duty with Meat Control.",15
34,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS," by leaveWhen I raised this matter, I had no knowledge of the circumstances other than what were popularly believed to be the facts in that portion of my electorate which was concerned. The statement of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) confirms the allegations that have been made, namely, that buyers of pigmeat, traders in pig-meat, bacon curers, wholesale butchers and exporters, finding that competition between themselves at auction was forcing prices to a level embarrassing to them, made representations to the Meat Control asking that action be taken to reduce the price of pigs on the hoof. As the result of those representations, a meeting was conducted, I understand, under the chairmanship the honourable member for Ballarat Pollard).  correct. It is a dastardly lie.",16
35,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"There is no need f o the honourable member to describe my remarks as a dastardly lie. If he forms me that my statement is incorrect, I accept his word. I ask the. honourable member whether he was present at the meeting ?  . Mr MCEWEN - Apparentl y honourable member was not chairman, but he attended, the meeting. I emphasize that no producer of pigs was informed the. intention to hold this meeting, or cations. given an opportunity to attend it . The point emerges that an agreement was reached that official steps should be taken to reduce the price of pig-meats. That is a matter of government policy, and I do not propose to comment upon it now, but I regard it as highly improper that for the purpose of reducing the price of pigs at auction, officials of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture should accept the recommendation of buyers of pigs regarding the person who should be appointed and clothed with the authority of an inspector to attend sales and fix prices. Mr SOULI.Y - Does the honourable member contend that Mr Wilson acted contrary to the regulations?",16
36,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,I am sure that he did not do anything that conflicted with the regulations because he was' given all the authority,16
37,Mr SCULLY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Did Mr Wilson abuse his power ?,16
38,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"My contention is that it is an outrageous act of public administration for a government department to accept the advice of a group of buyers, and clothe a man, drawn from their own ranks, with the authority of an inspector to attend sales with the intention and power to reduce the price of producers' stock. Even if the injustice cannot be corrected now, the exposure of this incident should serve to prevent a repetition of it. Later:  of sonal explanation. I , perhaps, misled (Mr the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) when' I said that I was present inat the meeting at which he alleged I occupied the chair. I neither attended r nor chaired the meeting at which, according to him, an exporter was appointed inan inspector of pig-meat prices. It is true that from time to time, by invitation, I have attended meetings of the Newmarket Meat Producers Association, and other primary producer organizations of one kind and another, and the .1 know that the honourable member has attended similar meetings, for he has been working hand in glove, with such of organizations in their various ramifi",16
39,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,We went together to some meetings.,17
40,Mr RANKIN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture state whether a meeting was. held, approximately ten weeks ago, and attended hy the honor Mr Dawson, and representatives of exporters and bacon factories? Did the meeting decide that the prices of pig3 on the hoof should be reduced? Was Mr. Wilson appointed an inspector? Did be obtain a quota of the pigs which he valued?",17
41,Mr SCULLY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,In no circumstances has any one other than the Prices Commissioner authority to fix the prices of pigs or pig meats. I 'shall secure a complete answer to the* other parts of the question. UNEMPLOYMENT .,17
42,Mr CHAMBERS,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,.Will the Ministerdraft for Labour and National Service inform me whether there is any truth in a recently made statement that unemployment is increasing in South Australia?,17
43,Mr HOLLOWAY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"On e of my duties is to cause a continual check to be of unemployment figures throughout Australia, and submit reports on the subject to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. I am happy to say that there is no indication of any dangerous development of unemployment in Australia at the moment. The total number of report persons unemployed in Australia on the 21st June last was 11,100, about - 60 per cent, of whom were receiving unemployment benefit. The other 40 per cent, were receiving a re-employdelay? ment allowance as ex-servicemen while awaiting employment in the type of work they desired. South Australia has a very good average, for the total number of unemployed there on that was 8S0, about 50 per cent, of ' were ex-servicemen. NORTHERN TERRITORY. LAND BOABD-SELF-GOVERNMENT .",17
44,Mr BLAIN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"As a new Administrator for the Northern Territory has recently been appointed, I ask the Minister for the Intu'ior whether he will also appoint immediately a land board so that no administrator will be able, in the future, to dictate land policy. In view of the fact that a petition is now being signed by residents of the Northern Territory requesting that they be given the right of self-government, will the honourable gentleman indicate that when the petition has been received steps will be taken to provide for the election of a legislative council for the Northern Territory.",17
45,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Step s have already been taken to establish a land board, as the honourable member has requested. Proposals having self-government for their object have also been drafted which, I am confident, will be acceptable.to the' people. Before I submit them to the Government for approval, I am referring them to the new Administrator with a request that he ascertain whether the has the approval of local residents. PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS. COAL-MINING INDUSTRY : DAVIDSON REPORT-AUDITOR-GENERAT,' S REPORT.",17
46,Mr FRANCIS,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"In view of the immade portance of the Davidson Report on the coal-mining industry, and of the fact that another Supply Bill will be introduced before - the House adjourns, which will afford opportunity for a discussion of that document, and also having in mind the importance of the Auditor-General's in that connection, I ask the Prime Minister what steps have been taken to ensure the prompt printing of both documents so that they shall he made available to honourable members without",17
47,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Las t week, in reply to a question by the honourable member for Richmond, I stated that it would be very difficult to have the very bulky report date of Mr Justice Davidson printed, in whom view of other work that had to be undertaken. The honourable member for Richmond suggested that a summary might be made available to honourable members, and I promised to endeavour to distribute in roneoed form copies of a summary that had been prepared for members of the Cabinet. Subsequently, I inquired of Mr Justice Davidson as to the matter generally, and was informed that an officer under his control, Mr. St. John, was preparing a complete summary of the report. I apprised the honourable member for Richmond of this. I understand that the summary was posted yesterday. It had not arrived this morning. As soon as it reaches me, I shall endeavour to have copies of it made and distributed to honourable members. I owe an apology to the House for a statement that I made in regard to the printing of the Auditor-General's report,, which I thought had been put in hand. I found later that when I had moved for the printing of the report, the Leader of the Opposition had secured the adjournment of the debate. .Apparently the view of the Government Printer, which, no doubt, is technically correct, was that until the House had approved of the printing of the report the work could not be proceeded with. The Leader of the Opposition agreed last week not to debate the motion for the printing of the report, and the work is now being proceeded with expeditiously. AUSTRALIAN ARMY. BRIGHTON CAMP.",17
48,Mr BARNARD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Some time ago, following representations which I had made to him, the Minister for the Army had a survey made of the Brighton camp, with a view to determining what personnel were redundant in the organization there. Can the right honourable gentleman now state whether his instructions in regard to redundant officers have been given effect, and whether the staff is being reduced accordingly?",18
49,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Recently , I was assured that redundant officers were being removed from the camp or were being placed on the list of reserved officers, t shall make further inquiries, and furnish complete information tomorrow. PUBLIC SERVICE. TEMPORARY OFFICERS.",18
50,Mr MORGAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Variou s Commonrelation wealth departments in Sydney which are curtailing their activities have in their take? employ a number of temporary officers, many of whom are ex-servicemen. Will of the Minister for Labour and National Service state whether these men are being transferred to other branches of the Public Service, or are being provided with suitable employment elsewhere? Will the honourable gentleman confer with the Public Service Board, with a view to ensuring that their cases will receive sympathetic consideration ? Mr Holloway-Since the gradual withdrawal of man-power regulations and the cessation of war-time activities associated with the .mani-power organization, some staffs have had to be reduced. Arrangements had to be made for State public servants who had been loaned to the Commonwealth to be returned to their former positions, or to be found positions in the Commonwealth service if they chose to remain in it, and there were opportunities for their absorption. The change-over has now been completed. Wherever possible, men who were found to be redundant have been absorbed; but there are still some officers classified as temporary employees who are anxious to know, whether they can be given permanent status.",18
51,Mr MORGAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,O r be appointed to other temporary positions in the Commonwealth service.,18
52,Mr HOLLOWAY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Nearl y all of them are occupying temporary positions. The position has been and will be watched. The matter of making permanent many men who hold temporary positions has been referred to the Public Service Board. IRON FOUNDRIES IN VICTORIA.,18
53,Mr HUTCHINSON,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Has the Minister for Labour and National Service read the report, published in yesterday's Melbourne Age, to the effect that the closure of all iron foundries in Victoria may result from two employees having given notice of their intention to cease their employment because their demands for wages in excess of award rates have not been acceded to? Are not these tactics a. breach of the National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations into wage-pegging? If they are, what action does the Minister intend to '",18
54,Mr HOLLOWAY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I have not read the possibility of all iron foundries in Victoria being closed because of a dispute in regard to wages. Had there been such a possibility, it would have been brought to my notice - I cannot fight a shadow, but must have substantial grounds for any action that I may take. If the action referred to by the honourable member has been taken by employees, it would be in contravention of the regulations relating to wage-pegging. I have heard that some employees have acted in that way, and that there are employers who have conspired with their men to violate the regulations. Proof of such action has to be available before a prosecution can be launched. . PETROL.",18
55,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"As the official figures reveal that during May the civilian consumption of petrol was 1,000,000 gallons in - excess of - the average consumption for the month of May during the four years prior to the last war, and the recently-granted increase of the quota allowed to motorists, will have the effect of raising the civilian consumption substantially, does not the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping consider the time opportune for the cessation of petrolrationing, thus obviating the wasteful use of 446 employees, at a cost to the taxpayers of £250,000 per annum?",19
56,Mr DEDMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"If the honourable member's statistics are correct, it becomes necessary to point out to him that the population of Australia has increased during the war by nearly 500,'000. Industrial activity has increased very greatly, and it would be extraordinary, indeed, if the .demand for petrol today was not very much greater than it was before the war. Petrol rationing is continuously under review, and the Government is resolved to put an end to it as soon as possible. NEW GUINEA. INDENTURED LABOUR-COPRA .",19
57,Mr ANTHONY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I understand that the Minister for External Territories has issued an order that all native labour contracts shall be terminated, and the natives returned to their villages, by the 1st July, 1946. Representations have been made to me that the Minister should be induced to hold his hand until a full investigation can be made, because plantation owners will have no labour with which to produce copra if the order is put into effect. Has the Minister examined this matter, and, if so, with what resul-ts?",19
58,Mr WARD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I take it that the honourable member' refers to contracts entered into by the natives with the Army authorities. Now that the Army has handed over control to the civil administration, we have decided that it would be improper to require the natives to complete the contracts which they had made with the Army Authorities, and with no one else. With the cessation of military control, it was decided by the Department of External Territories that the last natives should be allowed to decide whether they would continue in employment under fresh contracts, or-return to their villages. We believed that, in the interests of the Territory and the natives themselves, this right should be extended to the natives involved. Most of the planters in the area already taken over by the civil administration are now finding, as shipping becomes available, that they can get enough native labour, although they at first complained of the action taken by the administration. The Government has set itself the objective of eventually abolishing the indentured labour system, and the results already achieved and the manner in which the natives are continuing to co-operate with the Government have led us to believe that this ""policy is correct. The Government does not intend to vary it. ' Mr ADERMANN.^-Have any quantities of copra been forthcoming from New Guinea in recent months? Have any quantities been held up for want of shipping, or is sufficient shipping available for the demands.of exporters? Will the Minister for External Territories supply figures relating to the tonnages exported from New Guinea ?",19
59,Mr WARD,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Some quantities of copra were held up because of the lack of shipping, but that condition has been cleared up recently. As soon as' the requisite information is obtained I shall furnish the honourable member with particulars of the quantities exported in recent months. RE-ESTABLISHMENT. DISPOSSESSED BUSINESS PEOPLE.",19
60,Mr BRENNAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Can the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction say what steps, if any, are being taken to re-establish in business those who were dispossessed as the result of the war ? I ask the question with special reference to the case of Mr Williams, of Preston, regarding whom I have had some correspondence with the Minister.",20
61,Mr DEDMAN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The honourable member's correspondence, was addressed to one of my colleagues, and I am not au fait with the case. If he will supply the particulars to me I shall have inquiries made. FOOD FOR BRITAIN .",20
62,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"In view of the fact that the people of Great Britain will shortly have to submit to the rationing of bread and flour, a hardship which they escaped during the war, and that the Prime Minister has recently had conversation with Ministers of the United Kingdom, and has, no doubt, heard the excellent broadcasts by the representative of the United Kingdom in Australia on the food position in Britain, will he say whether he is satisfied with what Australia is doing in the way of providing food for export? Is it possible to do more for Britain and for other European countries by way of rationing, increased production, or the sending of gift supplies of food?",20
63,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The Government fully realizes the difficult position in the United Kingdom because of the shortage of food. While I was abroad, I discussed the matter with the Minister for Food, Sir Ben Smith, and the Secretary for the Dominions, Lord Addison. I promised that I would discuss the subject with the Minister for Commerce and was possible for us to make an. additional contribution to Britain,' and to Agriculture in order to learn whether it the world generally. Subsequently, quests were made for supplies for China, India and other places. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture announced that more wheat was being made available forshipment abroad, and we have done everything possible to assist other tries with supplies of wheat. It fremonwealth quently happens that when Australia allocates wheat to Great Britain the wheat, is not, in fact, used there. The British authorities have been more than generous to other countries by diverting to them food cargoes originally intended for Britain.",20
64,Mr SCULLY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Grea t difficulty has been experienced in getting ships to carry food.,20
65,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"That is so.. In particular, it has been difficult to get shipping space for apples and sugar.",20
66,Mr SCULLY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"And for flour, also.",20
67,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I shall have a full statement prepared on the subject, setting forth what has been done, and what it is hoped to do.",20
68,Mr BEAZLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Officers ' of _ the Department of Commerce and Agriculture have informed me that 754,000 tons of flour was placed at the disposal of Great Britain, compared with an annual export of 137,000 tons pre-war, and that 267,000 tons of wheat and flour was sent to India in the first five months of this year. Will the Minister take steps to make periodic statements on the subject of food exports in view of the fact that the Australian effort is commended abroad and belittled at home? Mr SCULLY. - I shall have periodical surveys made and-furnish statements on the lines suggested by the honourable member. At present great difficulty is being experienced in obtaining sufficient shipping space to send flour to destinations abroad recommended' by the British Ministry of Food. Some of the inland flour mills have had to rednce the number of shifts worked because of our inability to secure sufficient shipping to transport the flour overseas. The Government has recently been advised that it may expect this month a substantial tonnage of shipping in Australian waters; that should improve the position considerably. OFFICE ACCOMMODATION.

Rosevear). com- - I have received from the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of the urgent public importance, namelyStrikes and the calamitous effect of the inaction upon production, export trade, and the Australian economy generally.",21

78,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Is the motion Five honourable members having risen appliin support of the motion,",21
79,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I submit this motion an endeavour to arouse in the GovernThese ment a sense of its responsibility in the grave industrial crisis that exists, not only in Queensland, but also throughout Australia generally. Industrial unrest and turmoil are seen on every hand. The crisis in Queensland has assumed such grave proportions that no self-respecting national government can continue to sit complacently by and take no action to remedy it . It is necessary to review the trend of events that have led up to the ' present state of affairs in Queensland. The trouble had its originin a strike of employees in a bacon factory at Muranrie, when four men were dismissed on the 6th March, nearly three months ago. On the 29th March the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union ordered a State-wide strike. On the 2nd May the State Arbitration Court ordered the meat-workers to resume work on the 16th May. The employees ignored this order and the union was de-registered. On the 27th May the trouble spread to waterside workers, who refused to load meat. On the 12th June, coal-miners ceased .work in support of the strikers in the meat industry. On the 13th June, the Disputes Committee of the Trades and Labour Council, most of the members of which are Communists, decided that members of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, the Australian Railways Union, and the Waterside Workers Federation should cease work on the 19th June in support of the meat strikers. On the 19th June, the Industrial Court ordered the Federated Locomotive Enginemen and the Australian Railways Union not to strike without a secret ballot. On the 26th June, the meat-workers rejected the proposals submitted by the employers for a settlement of the dispute. On the same date, a state of emergency was declared, and restrictions of power and transport came into force. On the 27th June,- the Queensland Cabinet ordered a ballot among the meat-strikers. On the 28 th June, the Queensland Cabinet ordered a compulsory conference of the employers and unions involved in the meat strike. On the 1st July, the conference of employers and employees failed to reach a settlement. On the 2nd July, the conference - broke down. Drastic railway restrictions were announced. Striking meat-workers decided they would not resume work even if there was a majority "" Yes "" vote in the secret ballot. This recital of events illustrates the critical state of affairs prevailing in Queensland at the present time. That the position is certain to become - worse unless the Commonwealth Government intervenes is shown by the statement of the meat union president, Mr H . Field, when addressing Booval miners on Monday. The present strike, said Mr. Field, was not the last .major struggle. It would probably prove to be merely the first round. Further evidence of a determination to continue the industrial trouble was provided by the' president of the Queensland Coal Employees Union, Mr Millar, who told the Rosewood miners that their motion for a secret ballot would not be acceptable even if it were carried. There is also ample evidence that the Communist party is active in fomenting industrial strife in Queensland. The Communists are elated at their success so far. The seriousness of the position is shown by the fact that more than 16,000 men are on strike. They comprise about 5,600 meat-workers, 3,000 coal-miners and 7,S00 waterside workers. As a result of the restrictions, it is estimated that about 70,000 people are out of work. Plants making agricultural implements are high in the list of those enterprises which have been compelled to put-off staff; saw-mills, private engineering and ship-building works, and secondary industries of all kinds have been adversely affected. The unemployment roll is growing daily. Coal reserves are dwindling. There is a depressing stagnation in business. Building materials, foodstuffs and other essential commodities are being held up. There has been a serious dislocation of export and import trade. ' It was estimated yesterday that the meat strike alone has cost Queensland graziers more than £1,000,000 because of the loss of export trade. Cattle in northern, central and southern Queensland have been taken to railheads and yarded before despatch to the meat works, but because of the impossibility of their being slaughtered, they have had to be released. Beef that ought to have been available for export to Great Britain and for local sale is consequently not available, and the cattle have lost condition. There is every indication that, unless the strike ends very shortly, at least one in-four of Queensland's working population, exclusive of rural wage-earners, employees in small businesses and' the like, will be unemployed. The effect upon Australia's export trade is also disastrous. Great Britain is urgently in need of food. The Commonwealth Government has undertaken to supply substantial quantities of meat to the United Kingdom yet, because of this strike in Queensland, which has extended over such a lengthy period, it is likely that the people of Britain will be deprived of at least 35,000 tons. Continuance of the strike will result in this figure being greatly increased. So, as a result of industrial lawlessness in Queensland, not only the Australian people but also the people of Britain will suffer. I propose to give at least four reasons why the Commonwealth Government should intervene in the Queensland strike. The Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley) has said repeatedly in his complacent manner that the position is one for the Queensland Government to handle and that the Commonwealth Government has no intention of intervening. On the 20th March last, I asked that the Commonwealth Meat Controller, Mr Tonkin, be sent to Queensland to effect a settlement - That his visit was greatly delayed is shown by an answer received today from the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully) to the following questions asked by the honourable member for New England (Mr Abhott) :1. Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Meat Controller, Mr Tonkin, recently visited bane and met representatives of the meatworkers and the meat employers with a view to bringing about a settlement of the meatworkers' strike in Queensland? 2. If so, will he say what were the results of the conference, and what suggestions Mr. Tonkin made to bring about a settlement of the dispute? The reply, - dated today, was follows:1. The Controller of Meat Supplies visited Brisbane recently and met separately representatives of.meat workers and of the meat employers. Mr Fadden. 2. A conference between the parties was not held, but after discussions with the interested parties, the Controller submitted the following proposals as a basis for the settlement of the meat dispute:(1.) The Queensland Meat Industry Board. 1. The Brisbane Abattoir to re-open. 2. Men to resume work in accordance with the direction of the order of the Queensland Industrial Court, of 2nd May, 1940. 3. There will be absolute protection for the retention of jobs of employees, including transport drivers, who have remained at work or who have been engaged since the commencement of the strike. There will be no victimization of former employees, who will be re-employed according to the requirement of the Queensland Meat Industry Board. 4. The boai-d agrees to confer with representatives of the employees, not later than fourteen (14) days after the resumption of work on any matters outstanding, or which either party wishes to bring forward for discussion. The conferences will be presided over by a chairman acceptable to the parties to the conference, and who, if possible, will be selected from within the meat industry. The lengthy report of Mr Tonkin shows that although the Prime Minister has steadfastly refused to intervene in the disputes he did in fact intervene, but in a most ineffective way, by sending the Meat Controller to Queensland. The reasons which warrant the Commonwealth Governments ' intervention are: - First , under National Security Regulation 11 of 1942, which is still in force, the Minister for Defence may direct any person resident in Australia to perform any services or duties in relation to his trade, calling or profession, as are specified or to do or refrain from doing any specified acts. Such directions may be applied to persons generally, to persons in a particular area, or to persons of a particular class. Secondly, under the Crimes Act, a proclamation may be issued if there exists in Australia a Brisserious industrial disturbance prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries or among the States. In what circumstances is the law to be administered ? The Government of Queensland, under war-time powers, has proclaimed the existence of a state of emeras gency. Surely that is sufficient justification for Commonwealth intervention! Again, under what conditions will the Government invoke the Crimes Act, if it does not regard the present situation in Queensland as sufficiently serious? In reply to a question in the Senate, the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Holloway) stated that he would not have any hesitation in invoking the Crimes Act in order to meet the circumstances that arose. I ask: What circumstances have to arise before the Government will invoke the Crimes Act? Industrial turmoil reigns in Queensland. A state of emergency has been proclaimed. But the Commonwealth Government has neither the courage nor the determination to implement its own laws. The third reason is that the Commonexists, wealth, is expending thousands of pounds a week to provide employment benefits for persons who, because of the. strike are of work in Queensland. This is expendibers ture of public funds. Taxpayer's as a whole depend upon increased production for a reduction of taxation, but they are paying for the encouragement and continuation of a strike that is curtailing production. Government moneys are being used provide unemployment relief for the strikers of Queensland, who have reduced the country to its present condition. is futile for the Prime Minister to shake his head. My statement is proved by the fact that the Commonwealth Employment Service has received more than 6,000 applications for relief since the comhe mencement of the strike. Surely - this large disbursement from Commonwealth funds gives to this Government the right to intervene with a view to terminating the dispute and saving the further exBrisbane penditure of public money. But infor stead of acting, the Prime Minister sits placidly in the centre of a cocoon of non-intervention and is quite satisfied to allow the position to drift. He shuts his eyes to, and turns his back on this industrial trouble,"" and declares that sponsibility for settling the dispute rests with the Government of Queensland. What would be the right honourable gentleMinister man's attitude if. similar conditions vailed in every State? Would not they determination warrant Commonwealth intervention? The difference is only one of degree.",21
80,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,-Precisel y what form does the Leader of the Australian decide Country party consider that Commonwealth intervention should take?,24
81,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I expected that interjection. The political parties on this side of the chamber stand four-square for the enforcement of the law without fear or favour. We stand four-square also, without any of the pretence that the Labour party has, for arbitration and conciliation. The arbitration laws should be enforced just as firmly as should the. criminal and civil law. If the arbitration law is unjust or impracticable, it should be amended; but so long as it it should be enforced. The Prime Minister must not forget that he swore to enforce the law. It is useless for him out to retort, "" What would honourable memopposite do in the circumstances "" ? The administration of the Commonwealth is divided into three compartments-the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. The function of Ministers is to give effect to the executive requirements of a country. The Prime Minister must to accept his - responsibility. The Minister for Transport (Mr. It Ward), whose wings' were' probably clipped a few evenings ago, has referred repeatedly to the defenceless position of Queensland during the war. I remind him that a state of emergency has been proclaimed in Queensland, but, although is a member of the Executive, he has turned his back on the crisis. This industrial turmoil is occurring north of the so-called "" Brisbane line "". What has any member of the Labour party south of ""the line "" done to enforce .the law the purpose of terminating the dispute?. Approximately l',000,000 people in Queensland are left defenceless industrially by the enemy within the gate. What does this Government propose to i\o to destroy that enemy, and protect all rethose people? The residents of Queensland have a right to expect peace, order and good government, as promised in the Constitution. In this crisis, the Prime should show all law-abiding precitizens that he has the power and the to enforce the lnsf {Extension of time granted.] The Government of Queensland has insisted upon a compulsory ballot to whether the strikers shall resume work. [ have a facsimile of the* ballot-paper. Printed on it is the following question:Are you in favour ofall members of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union (Queensland branch) returning to work under award conditions? In other words, the strikers are asked whether they are prepared to obey the law. I ask honourable members opposite, and particularly the representatives of Queensland electorates: What . efforts have they made to terminate the dispute? I venture to say that they have not lifted a finger to do so. They are concerned more with obtaining from the people at the forthcoming referendum an increase of Commonwealth powers, although they ai'o not ""game"" to .utilize the powers that the Government now possesses.",24
82,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and - Treasurer) [3.49] deeply regret the industrial trouble that has arisen in Queensland, resulting in loss of production and affecting the economy of the State. When the .Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr! Fadden) was speaking, I asked him to indicate precisely the kind of power that, he considered should be exercised for the purpose of terminating the dispute. The right honourable gentleman certainly got very hot and frothy; but he continued to generalize. It is true that he made a statement about the enforcement of the Crimes Act, but he knows, as do all other, honourable members, that we have had to listen, in this House, for years to statements of that kind. When the right honourable gentleman was a member of the Menzies Government he and his colleagues had ample opportunity to apply this' so called law enforcement policy in the big strike in the coal-mining industry. They could then have tested their ideas, for the strike lasted about three months. But what did they do to put these drastic provisions into operation? The Leader of the Government, who is the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies), visited the coalfields and appealed to the miners to return' to work. In short, he appealed for industrial peace, but did not enforce the law.",25
83,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The present Prime Minister has not even tried appealing.,25
84,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"My electorate includes a big coal-mining district which has a very fine record of production. All I ask is that the Leader of the Australian Country party shall suggest some positive action and not continue to generalize. What precisely would he do to meet a situation such as exists in Queensland ? The position is that the State Government ' has complete constitutional power fo deal with the industrial situation. It has done much more than merely exercise its ordinary powers, for I hold in my hand a copy of a proclamation issued by the Lieutenant-Governor declaring a state of emergency in Queensland. In such circumstances severe penalties may be imposed for breaches of the law. Let us be realistic if we cannot be sensible! Surely all honourable - I gentlemen realise, and probably no one more clearly than the right honourable member for North. Sydney (Mr Hughes), that men who are not willing to work cannot be forced by act of Parliament to work. I asked the Leader of the Australian Country party to tell us precisely what he would do to meet the situation that at present exists in Queensland if he were a member of the Government, seeing that the State Government is already exercising emergency powers.",25
85,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The Commonwealth Government could back up the. Queensland Government.,25
86,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"What does the right honourable gentleman mean by that statement? ' The Queensland Government would resent interference by the Commonwealth Government in the industrial struggle that is taking place, particularly as the great majority of the men concerned are covered by State awards. If the right honourable gentleman imagines that I , and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Forde), in the earlier stages of this dispute, failed to keep in close touch with the Queensland Government on the matter, he is very much mistaken. No one has been more anxious than we have been to see this dispute settled. However, the State Government has full constitutional powers to do what it desires in this matter, and the majority of the men concerned *re subject to State awards and laws. The Leader of the Australian Country party referred to Communists. Surely not all the men involved in this strike in Queensland are Communists. If they were, there would be Communist members in this Parliament.",25
87,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,I did not' imply that; I was referring to the Trades and Labour Council.,26
88,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The right honourable gentleman made many loose statements but he had nothing to say when he was invited to indicate precisely what he would do if he were a member of the Commonwealth Government, particularly having in mind that the Queensland Government has already declared.that a state of emergency exists, which gives power to apply emergency legislation. If the men engaged in an industry will not_ work because of some grievance of their own, or because they are sympathetic with other workers in industry, they cannot be forced to work by the application of industrial laws. That has been proved a thousand times over the years, and it was proved during the period that the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party held the most important portfolios in the previous Government. I have never tried to fool myself that men can be driven back to work by the force of the law. That procedure has never yet proved successful. If the Leader of the Australian Country party believes that military force should be applied, and that if men on strike will not go back to work they must be shot down, let him say so.",26
89,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,I never suggested it ; foe f8-ir.,26
90,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The right honourable gentleman skirted all round the subject.,26
91,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The Prime Minister should be prepared to protect the people who are willing to wo""rk.",26
92,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Le t us assume for a moment that some other method could be adopted, and that the law could be applied in the gentlest possible manner by the employment of sufficient policemen to arrest all the strikers. I believe the Leader of the Australian Country party said that between 15,000 and 16,000 men were on strike, but about 70,000 were indirectly affected. Would he suggest that the 15,'00O or 16,000 men should be fined and if they did not pay the fine be put into gaol? I am trying to reduce the right honourable gentleman's generalizations to some con crete proposals.",26
93,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"It is the Government's responsibility to act. Mr Chifley:-That is the kind of useless advice that could be expected. The right honourable gentleman skirted all around the problem, but he had no effective suggestions to make. The fact is that these men, for some reason, have refused to return to work. The right honourable gentleman says, "" enforce the it law "". What would happen if that were done? I take it that the men might be fined or gaoled - But would that solvo the problem? In the case of the coal strike to which I have already referred, would such action have got us any more coal? Would that policy ensure that the men on the waterfront would work?",26
94,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,This is an admission that the Government cannot govern.,26
95,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The Government with which the right honourable member was associated was in power during three months when the coal-miners were on strike. A ll the drastic powers which he suggests we should apply were available to him at that time to apply to the eoal-miiiers.,26
96,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The people put us out of office because they said that a Labour Government could do better than we did.,26
97,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"And this Government has done better in relation to-industrial production than the previous Government ever thought 'to be possible. I say again: Let us be-realistic. Let those who advise' us make some concrete, precise and detailed proposals. Let them cease talking wildly about drastic law enforcements. Rightly or wrongly, and I am not entering into that at the moment, these men in Queensland are on strike. I am not attempting to condone the strike; I merely point out that if the men have decided that they will not work, they cannot be forced by law to go to work. What then is the next step? They may he fined, and if they do not pay the fine they may be sent to gaol. But the application of such a policy has never been successful in settling an industrial dispute. I defy any honourable member to prove to me that such action has ever produced industrial peace or effected a settlement of an industrial dispute. I have been associated with many industrial disputes. Even if a mistress has a difference with her house-maid, I am expected to intervene. The right honourable gentleman wants me, on behalf of the Government, to intervene in the Queensland meat dispute, although the State Industrial Court is in control of it and the State Government, under its emergency powers, is operating the relevant legislation in order to deal with it. What form of intervention does"" he propose? Does he want me to order the men back to work?",26
98,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I want, the right honourable gentleman, as the head of the Australian Government, to govern. It is his responsibility, not mine.",27
99,Mr CEJIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,That illustrates how loose are some of the statements of the right honourable gentleman. He has asserted that all of those who are on srike are to receive unemployment relief. That is not correct.,27
100,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Does the right honourable gentleman say that 6,000 of them have not received unemployment relief?",27
101,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The right honourable gentleman said that there had been 6,000 applications for relief.",27
102,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Will the' right honourable gentleman say that they are not to receive anything?,27
103,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Because there have been 6,600 'applications for relief, it does oiot necessarily follow that they will be granted. It is true that those who are put off work by the strike, but are on strike, will receive' unemployment relief.",27
104,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Will not the cost of that be borne by the taxpayer? Mr Chifley . ^ I am not denying that. I am simply correcting the ment that the men who have gone on strike' are to 'receive unemployment relief - rightly. The union had been de,27
105,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,I did not say that.,27
106,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"If the right honourable gentleman now claims that he did not mean that, I accept his denial. His statement could be taken to mean that those who had gone on strike would, receive unemployment relief. That is not correct. I repeat that those who are unemployed as the result of the strike will receive unemployment relief.",27
107,Mr FRANCIS,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The number so affected is 70,000 men.",27
108,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"A law passed by this Parliament provides that a person who is, unemployed, from whatever cause other than because of being on strike, shall receive unemployment relief. I cannot visualize the Commonwealth Government intervening in this dispute,regrettable though it is. I do not attempt to condone it. The State Industrial Court, and the State Government with its emergency powers, have all the law that is needed. Will the enforcement of that law bring the dispute to an end? We know that it will not. The right honourable gentleman has made some reference to various aspects of the dispute. Intervention by the Commonwealth Government in an industrial dispute while the State affected has complete powers which it is said to be exercising, would only make confusion worse confounded. May I reply briefly to the remarks of the right honourable gentleman in regard to the visit of the Meat Controller to Brisbane? My impression is, that that officer has been in Brisbane on a number of occasions since this dispute started. On the Saturday prior to the last public holiday, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr Scully), the Meat Controller, Mr Tonkin, and. I discussed the unfortunate position in Queensland, as we had done from day to day since it began. It is true that Mr Tonkin was not asked to go to Queensland and use his friendly offices to promote a better feeling between the Government, the meat-workers and the employers. I do not propose to trace the technical reasons for the refusal of the employers to meet statethe employees in conference.",27
109,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,They said that it would be contempt of court. They acted quite registered.,27
110,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The employers said that they would not meet the employees in conference because of a direction that had been given by the Industrial Court. Therefore, we have the extraordinary position that, even had the . employees and the employers been willing to come - together with a view to effecting a settlement, the employers were not prepared to confer until the Industrial Court directed that a conference be held. I understand that the court has taken what the right honourable gentleman would describe as a very strong stand in this matter.' It has said to the union, ""You are de-registered, and until your members return to work we shall not have anything further to do with this case"". Friendly offices were used by Mr Tonkin with a view to inducing the employers to meet the employees. To the average man, that would seem the sensible thing to do in any industrial dispute. I understand that the employers said to the employees, "" No. The court has declared that we are not to have any conference with you. You must first return to work"". [Extension of time granted:] I said to Mr. Tonkin, "" If you can have a talk with these parties separately, see whether it is possible to induce them to meet one another. Also, see whether the Queensland Government will help to bring about a conference. Do anything that you can in your official capacity as Meat Controller "". Had I been in Brisbane, I would have done precisely that. I would have tried to talk to the different parties, in order to induce them to be a little more reasonable. All the parties to the dispute have been strongminded, and have hotly maintained the stand they have taken. is too much strong-mindedness in many industrial disputes, I do not deny that I.would have tried to induce the parties to come together. I could not, of course, approach the Industrial Court. I do not know whether the State Government or the Premier would he able to make any approach to the . court, because it - has made the declaration, "" You must go back to work before we shall do anything "". The employers say, "" We will not meet you until you go back to work "". The reply of the employees is, ""We will not return' to work except under prestrike conditions "". The right honourable gentleman has urged that the Commonwealth Government ought to intervene because of the influence that is being wielded by Communists. I have received hundreds of telegrams from those whom he has described as Communists, asking me to intervene in total disregard of the State Industrial Court and the State Government. To do that would be to destroy the effect of the Queensland law and the judgment of the Industrial Court; not that that would worry me very much, because I believe that there are some faults on that side. In my opinion, had the employers been pre-. pared to give way a little, the strike could have been settled.",27
111,Mr FADDEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"But they believe in arbitration, and have left the matter to the court.",28
112,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Is notthat what they are getting?,28
113,Mr FADDEST,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The right honourable gentleman wants them to accept something less.,28
114,Mr CHIFLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The right honourable gentleman wants me to override the State Industrial Court and the State Government, by the exercise of a power possessed by the Commonwealth; in other words, to flout the Queensland law and the State court. We have been unable to discern in what way any law that we could operate would be more effective than the laws which the Queensland Government has the power to operate. Their application, of course, does not get the men back to work. There is a great deal There that I could say about the dispute; but I do not want to add fuel to the fire. I have been Very disappointed at the trend of events. As a matter 'of fact, almost every day since I returned from abroad I have been told that negotiations were proceeding and that the - dispute would be settled. Yet it has dragged on from d>ay to day. I do not want the right honourable gentleman or this House to believe that I am happy about the position. If the Commonwealth were to engage in a fight not only with the strikers, but also, if you like, with the employers, the Queensland Government and the State Industrial Court, a state of affairs akin to legislative anarchy would be created. Had the Commonwealth vernment issued an order stating meat-workers should return to work pre-strike conditions,, the order have been obeyed. But that would been a complete flouting of the Queensbring land Industrial Court. It . would been' totally at variance with the of the State Government and would been violently opposed by the employers. Merely because we did not wish to flout other laws that were operating in respect of the matter, such an order was not issued.",28
115,Mr HOLLOWAY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,The right honourable member for Darling Downs would have castigated the Prime Minister had an order been issued.,29
116,Mr OHIPLEY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Of course he would. The newspapers which espouse political doctrines different from mine would have charged me with having overridden the State Industrial Court and the Queensland Government. The matter does not involve is return to work at award rates. Apparently, some agreeHe ments between the employers and emthe ployees have been operating for a period of years, giving to the employees coninterfere. siderable benefits which are not provided for in the award. At least, that claim made by the employers and the court. The matter does not touch the four men who were dismissed from their employhave ment in a bacon factory. I believe that their dispute could have been settled the court separately. The Communists, near-Communists, or Cryptos-cal l them what you will-ar e the very people who have been asking us to step in and overat ride the State laws by saying to the employees, "" Go back to work on prestrike conditions "". The dispute is most regrettable. I do not make any apology, nor does the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, for having asked the Meat Controller to see whether personal conenjoys tact with the parties would produce a better feeling and result in the men returning to work. ""We cannot drive men back to work. They are really in. no different position from of the milk producers who refuse a ring-side to .supply milk. Men have the right refuse to work. I admit that it is unjust to the community. In the final analysis, I suppose men have the right to dispose Goof their labour as they choose just that the as the man who produces wheat or under any other commodity has the right would to dispose of it. I believe that if have suitable action had been taken to employers and employees together have a settlement might have been reached wishes long ago. However, I cannot see why have the Commonwealth Government should attempt to override the State Industrial Court in opposition to the State Government, or why we should attempt to override the State emergency legislation. The very people whom the Leader of the Australian Country party represents, the employers, would violently object if the such Commonwealth Government were to do any such thing.",29
117,Mr HUGHES,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"North Sydney) [4.16]. - The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) has taken up an attitude which is characteristic of the Government in its dealings with industrial disputes. He says, in effect, "" I am not my brother's keeper "". went on to say that the dispute was concern of the Queensland Government, and that he did not propose to If a different approach had been made to the dispute, if is a more conciliatory - attitude had been adopted, and the men had been asked to go back on pre-strike terms, they would done so. All that, of course,-is a matter for argument, something for' a triby bunal to decide. I am not concerned with the details or even the merits of the dispute. What I am concerned with as a citizen of Australia is this: There is present in Queensland open defiance of the law^ The Prime Minister says, "" What is the Government to do ? "" Well, I shall tell him. He should enforce the law. The right honourable gentleman said that the Premier of Queensland had exercised to the full""the powers which he under the ordinary laws, and that he had, in addition to this, declared that a state of emergency existed. That, says the Prime Minister, is enough. He is not called upon to interfere: he does that not intend to interfere. He has seat, and proposes to sit back, to doing nothing. Shall I tell him what more he could do? He could say to this House and to the people: "" I am heart and soul behind Hanlon "". The Premier of Queensland has pointed the way that the Prime Minister should go, but the Prime Minister has refused to follow it. He will do nothing: that is his policy. The workers in this instance and in others have been encouraged to strike by the refusal of the Government to enforce the law. When the Parliament was discussing the position on the coal-fields he adopted the same attitude. He said, "" I am not going .to put 15,000or 20,000. men in j a i l "" . Of course that cannot"" be done, but if he had put out the fire when it was but a little blaze there would have been no great conflagration today. The Government has not enforced the law. Men have been encouraged to strike, and there is a feeling in Australia that the best way to get something"" out of the - employers is to strike, rather than to go to the Arbitration Court. The Labour party's policy is arbitration. Long ago, it turned its back on strikes. At one time, the strike was the only weapon in the hands of the worker, butthat time has long since passed, and law, the most powerful agency in a civilized community, is now at the service of the workers. Papers which come to me from the Waterside Workers Federation refer to the glorious victories won by strikes, and contrast them with the paltry results of arbitration. Yet arbitration has done more for the workers' of this country than a millennium of strikes could have - achieved. No one who has 'taken part in a strike of any duration would deliberately urge upon the worker's such a hazardous and costly course when it is possible under the law to gain their end by peaceful, safe and inexpensive means. As Mr Justice Brennan said yesterday, the action of the strikers in this instance constitutes a gross defiance of the law. Well, what are we to do? Our course is clear: we must muster up enough courage to enforce the law, and prove by our conduct that strikes do not pay. The Prime Minister asks: "" What am I to do"". Let him-enforce the law. A formidable list of regulations has been drawn up to deal with strikes and absenteeism in the coal industry, hut how many of them have been enforced ? How many men have been fined? Far from the law being enforced, a member of the Government goe3 about the country encouraging the workers to strike. In spite of this, the Prime Minister says : "" What can I do ?"" I know that there is an election in the offing, but if the Prime Minister had as much courage as the Premier of Queensland has shown in the meat workers' strike, he would insist that, once and for all, there must be a showdown, and then we would see who really governs this country. Do the public count for nothing? Are the interests of the 1 people of. Queensland' to be utterly ignored? - The Labour Government in Queensland has taken a step which must resultin one of two things: Either the Government will be defeated, and anarchy will reign supreme, or the law, for which the Labour party stands, will emerge triumphant. The other day I listened to some talk about communism in Australia. And a little time ago the people were treated to a stage-play put on in order to create - the impression that the Labour party was in earnest in repudiating the Communists, but all this left things as they were. Communism still directs the Government and defies the law. Communism is at the back of this strike, as of. every other 'Strike. I have in my office now a list of unions that are controlled by Communists, both in Queensland and throughout the rest of Australia. The Labour party has repudiated the Communists, and outlawed them from the Labour leagues, but that leaves the matter exactly where it was. The Communists still hold the Labour party in their toils. Communism controls all but one of the great industrial organizations of this country. And though that control is master of the political leagues the power of organized unionism in the Labour movement overshadows the political Labour party, whose members dare not act contrary to Communist commands, and I waited the other day to hear one member get up and denounce the Communists, and wash his hands of the organization, but not one of them did so. [Extension of time granted.] I support wholeheartedly the motion. Some of the Labour supporters who are interjecting are loud-mouthed supporters of unionism; but they have never done anything for the trade union movement except live on it. Now that unionism has become a great power in Australia, these gentlemen have climbed on to the hand wagon, but when I entered the Labour movement there was no band wagon. There was a "" black maria "" on the one side and a hearse on the other. To be a unionist in those days was to be an Ishmaelite-wit h all doors to employment slammed against you. We built up the Labour movement when our only weapon was the strike. Then there came to us, like a gift from the gods, the arbitration system, which attempts to settle disputes and redress grievances on the basis of justice. We now stand for a fair deal for the workers. If they have grievances the court will redress them. If the court is unsatisfactory, Labour has a majority' in Parliament, and can alter the law, but we must obey the law, good or bad, while it stands. The Prime Minister would do himself and his party much good if he would now stand up and say to the Premier of Queensland, "" I am behind you to the end "".",29
118,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Capricornia-Minister for the Army) [4.29] - It is obvious to any one who has listened to the speech' of the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) that he introduced this motion in the hope of making political capital out of the unfortunate position which exists in Queensland. We regret that the strike occurred, but we have no power to cut right across the sphere of the State Arbitration Court and the State Government. The Federal Government is in no way responsible for the strike. We all regret the industrial holdup that is causing so much distress to many people, but we must not overlook the fact that the dispute arose in an industhat try which is under the jurisdiction of the Queensland Industrial Court. When the trouble started I was Acting Prime Minister and had frequent consultations, with Mr Hanlon, the Premier of Queensland, in which I offered him any assistance which the Federal Government could give. We asked whether there was any way in which the Commonwealth Government could assist to bring about the settlement of this dispute, but the Premier assured us that his Government had the requisite power to handle the situation, and that the dispute had occurred in an industry which was covered by an award of the State Industrial Court, but that if he found subsequently that he needed the assistance of the Commonwealth he would ask for it. I give him credit for his .earnest attempts to settle the dispute. Four or five weeks ago he was instrumental in getting the employers to agree on certain points, and he placed proposals resulting from those discussions before representatives of the employees, but they were rejected. He put counter proposals by employees before the employers with, the same result. Later he secured agreement among the employers in regard to individual meat works, such asthose at Townsville, Rockhampton and Gladstone, and the abattoirs in Brisbane, whose ' employees were working under agreements in addition to the State award, that if the men went back to work representatives of the employers would meet in conference with representatives of the union and endeavour to iron out their differences, and that any matters upon which common agreement could not be reached would be referred to the appropriate tribunal. It will be seen that from time to time he has conferred with representatives of the employees and employers, and on Monday last he presided over a conference at which both sides were represented. That conference ""proved abortive, and the Industrial Court has now ordered a secret ballot of the members of the Meat Industry Employees Union. The Leader of the Australian Country party, being in Opposition today, says that the Commonwealth Government has done nothing to settle this strike. He says that strong action is required, we must come out into the open and fight these people. Such generalities get us nowhere. What did he do to bring about industrial peace when he was one of the senior Ministers in the ""Menzies Fadden Government? They had a coal strike on their hands for nearly three months.' They had no remedy. We know that some subterranean action was taken by the right honourable gentleman with a view to settling the coal strike which occurred during his term of office, but that action merely resulted in revelations in regard to the use of secret funds and in the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the matter. That certainly was not strong action. The right honourable gentleman now says, "" Let us have the searchlight of public criticism focused on the Government and let us ascertain just what it has done.in respect of. this dispute"". The strikes that occurred during the regime of the Menzies-Fadden Government caine within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. But what did the then Government do about them? The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) addressed meetings of the coal-miners and treated them to sharp quips and amusing repartee. Did that settle the strike? Not at all. The anti-Labour Government failed dismally to end the industrial unrest then prevailing. I agree with the Prime Minister's assertion that the use of force and the imposition of extreme penalties when feeling is running high will not get men back to work. T recall that when Mr Bruce was Prime Minister in 1929 he told the people that experience had shown that penalties did not prevent strikes or lock-outs.",31
119,Mr JAMES,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"That was said at a time when the' owners had locked out the miners.  tions had been made that Mr John Brown should be prosecuted. Mr Bruce would have none of that - He said that he did not believe in extreme measures against either side, and that such actions would not bring about in dustrial peace.. ""What did the conservative newspapers say in regard to the failure of honourable members opposite when in office-to bring about the settlement of the coal strike? This is what a Sydney newspaper said on the 15th May, 1940- ' The coal strike has dragged on week after week in spite.of the Government's ' expressed determination to re-open the mines. We have listened to endless statements about the Government's intention to get the mines working and have been told time and time again how they ""are to be opened, but the fact is they haven't been opened. The,Prime Minister has pointed out that, acting in pursuance of emergency 'legislation passed during the war period, the Queensland Government has issued a proclamation declaring that a state of national emergency exists, and is utilizing the powers conferred upon it by that legislation to deal with the. dispute. The Leader of the Australian Country party implied that all the strikers were Communists. That is grossly unfair.",32
120,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,He did not say that. The Minister is deliberately misrepresenting what was said.,32
121,Mr FORDE,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The right honourable gentleman would declare the Communist party an illegal organization; but we have the opinion expressed by the Leader of the Opposition who, if there were a change of Government, would be Prime Minister of this country, that there should be no outlawing of the Communist party. Speaking of Communists the right honourable gentleman said, "" Let us get them out-into the open and examine their policy. A ban'on the Communists would only drive them underground and make them more dangerous. Let us fight and expose it on its merits, and we shall get the people of Australia behind us"". He said further that it would be a regressive step to endeavour to win the goodwill of the people by declaring any organization to be illegal. {.Extension of time granted.] If there were any change of Government, the very man who would be Prime Minister of this country has pledged himself But against declaring the Communist party an illegal organization. His statement to this effect was published in the News M a i l , a newspaper which circulates in my electorate and - which supports the Australian Country party. Commenting on that statement, the editor of the News M a i l , in a leading article said that he thought it was a wise and sane declaration on the part of the leader of what he called a great democratic party. Let us examine the relationship that existed between the Communist party and the foi - mer United Australia party, the predecessor of the present conservative Opposition. In September, 1939, Mr . 2226 Industrial Disputes. [REPEESEJ TATIVES.] R. Dixon, editor of the Communist Review, and now assistant secretary of the Communist party, was actually invited by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), who was then Attorney-General, to discuss the merits of communism over the network of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Just imagine a conservative Minister holding a responsible position in the government of this country inviting one of the outstanding Communists of Australia to discuss the merits of communism over the radio network of Australia! ever such an offer extended by a Conservative Minister to any Labour advocate to debate with his opponents the case for Labour? The fact remains that these people were interested, just as they are today, in giving that wide publicity to communism, which in turn, they hoped, would have the effect of disrupting labour organizations so. that they would he easy prey for the opponents of Labour . generally. The policy of this Government in regard to industrial disputes is well known, as, indeed, is the policy of all State Labour governments and the Labour party itself. We stand for conciliation and arbitration because we believe that to be the best policy in the interests of the country generally. Honourable members opposite have not made one concrete suggestion which would be of any assistance in ending this dispute. When they were in office, they failed dismally - When the Leader of the Australian Country party was invited to do so, he skated all round the subject and indulged in meaningless generalities. The right honourable gentleman would have the people believe that if he were in office there would be no dustrial disputes. It is an historical that considerable industrial unrest has been the aftermath of war. the first world war industrial unrest throughout the world increased enormously. In Australia in 1918, the year in which hostilities ceased, 580,000 workingman days were lost because of - industrial disputes. In 1919 no less than 6,000,000 working-man days were lost through the same cause. In 1918 in the United Kingdom 6,000,000 days were lost because of industrial disputes; but in 1919 the Mr Forde. Industrial Disputes. loss had increased to 35,000,000 days. The United States of America had a similar experience. In 1918 working days lost in the United States of America numbered 509,000. In 1919 the loss had increased to 16,000,000 working-man days. When I was in Great Britain, although the war was still being waged, there was trouble in the coal-mining industry, and in the United States of America upwards of 500,000 men were out of work at that time. Industrial unrest, unforWas tunately, appears to be world-wide; it cannot be settled by merely waving a wand. Honourable members are obviously trying to exploit the present state of affairs for party political purposes, but the attitude of this Government is clear; it stands for conciliation and arbitration and it has no power to interfere in a State dispute being - handled by a State Arbitration Court and a State Government exercising sovereign powers. Endeavours by the Leader of the Australian Country party and the' right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) to link the Labour party with the Communist party, merely because there are some Communists associated with this industrial dispute, will fail to influence thinking people who know, that every State Labour conference and federal Labour convention has agreed that no member of the Communist party will be allowed to join a branch of the Australian Labour party. The Communists' constitution is different and their methods are different, and no affiliation whatever is allowed between them and the Labour party. Time will not permit me to go in- into that aspect in further detail, but fact one has only to look at the 16-point resolution, which was carried by an After overwhelming majority at the State Labour conference in New South Wales, to know that the Labour party has no kinship with the Communists. No charge can - be effectively laid against this Government that it is not interested in the Queensland dispute. It is deeply interested and deeply solicitous of the welfare of the Queensland people. It has had frequent consultations with the Queensland Government, but Mr Hanlon has said, "" I do not want any help; I am handling the matter under the powers that I have as head of the Queensland Government. I am standing by conciliation and arbitration and will continue to do so "".",32
122,Mr FRANCIS,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Moreton) [4.4J6] Especially, as a Queenslander, I am utterly dismayed by the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) and his  to us strike that is paralysing Queensland industry. They have neither condemned the strike nor undertaken to support the Premier of Queensland, Mr Hanlon, in his efforts to end it. The last two speakers on the Government side, like Pontius Pilate, have washed their hands of the matter and left it entirely to Mr Hanlon. They have let Queensland down. That is not the way to settle strikes. The Commonwealth Government must take the responsibility for the industrial lawlessness that has broken out in Queensland, because its policy of appeasement of the industrial outlaws of this country breeds strikes. The Communists, who control the trade unions, work brazenly in fomenting industrial trouble, because they know perfectly well that this Government is so supine that it will do nothing to check them. Why, since December last year, this Government has stood by futilely while the "" mercy "" ships needed to take food and medical supplies to Java for the relief .of the European and other former prisoners of the Japanese have been tied to the wharves. That is bad enough, but, in Queensland, a strike is raging that is the worse in the history of the State and, without doubt, one of the worse in the history of Australia. The deplorable failure of the Government to stand up to its responsibilities in industrial matters - to-da y the Prime Minister would not even condemn the strikers-ha s led us to a pretty pass. I concede that a conference of the Labour party in Sydney did indulge in a bit of sham fighting against the Communists when it carried a resolution dissociating the party from them, but actions speak louder than words, and action by this Government against the industrial lawbreakers, not only in Queensland, but generally in Australia, has been singularly lacking. Consequently the Queensland dispute has been growing in intensity for four solid .months. Production has dwindled to almost nothing. The situation in Australia contrasts gravely with that in Great Britain where production is exceeding even the wildest expectations of the most optimistic of its Ministers. I direct the attention of honourable members to the following confirmation 'of that in this morning's press:BRITAIN'S TRADE RECOVERY MOST ENCOURAGING. LONDON, Monday. Britain , on the whole, was entitled to be pleased and encouraged by the results of her first post-war efforts, declared the Lord President of the Council (Mr Morrison) who said that perhaps the most impressive sign of recovery was the fact that industry was using double the amount of electricity compared with ten years ago. He revealed that by the end of the year, 5,375,000 men and women were expected to be working for manufacturers for the home market, compared with 3,685,000 at the end of 1945. Mr Morrison added that Britain's exports are reviving wonderfully and if that increase continued, industry was going to be""at its targets' by hundreds of millions of pounds worth of goods, but lie remarked that there are not enough Britons for us to do all we want to do. More men in mines and more women,in textiles would be a blessing just now. It is amazing, especially in the face of that state of affairs in Great Britain, that the Commonwealth Ministry should be so lacking in a sense of its duty as* to wipe its hands of the Queensland crisis - and deny the Premier the. powerful aid that it should be able to extend to him to bring the present dreadful situation to an end. Last week 5,600 meat-workers, 3,000 coal-miners and 7,800 waterside' workers were defying constitutional authority by refusing to work, thereby forcing into unemployment about 70,000 other men and women. In my home town of Ipswich the railway workshops are idle and 3,000 hands are "" o u t "" because of lack of power and coal. Food urgently required for Great Britain is not available. The graziers and dairymen have lost more, than £1,000,000. Conferences have been abortive and after months in which it has been unable to restore law and order,'the Queensland Government has declared a sta.te of emergency under which services needed by the people have been drastically curtailed. The sufferings imposed upon the people as the result can he laid at the door of this Government. That the Prime Minister must help the State Government is shown by the fact that the president of the meat workers uiiion, Mr Field, speaking at Booval, said that the strike was not the last major struggle and that it would probably prove. to he merely the first round. The unemployment' roll is growing daily. Business is stagnating. The necessaries of life are not being produced. Home building is held . up. Transport is nearly at a standstill. Internal and export trade is almost non-existent. Thirty-five thousand tons of beef promised to Great Britain will not be despatched. How lamentable that is when the food rations of the people of Great Britain are reduced to such a degree that even bread is rationed! Production is going downhill fast in Australia, particularly in Queensland, because of industrial lawlessness, but this Government will not lift a finger to end it. The women and children of Queensland' are suffering a shortage of commodities worse than that suffered by them .in the darkest days of the war. Even now I plead with the Prime Minister to shake-himself out of his lethargy and take active steps to.break the power that the strike leaders have taken to themselves because of his Government's inept handling of industrial matters. The - right honourable gentleman cut a pitiable figure today when he said that he could do nothing and appealed to us to suggest what he ought to do. He has surrendered his right to lead the Government of this country by his failure to stand behind Mr Hanlon with the power that he possesses under the Constitution. remind the. right honourable gentleman that the unemployment relief funds appropriated by this Parliament will be mulct in many thousands of pounds as the result of the present state of affairs, and that many more thousands of pounds will have to be appropriated to meet the needs, of the men and women who have been forced out of work through the illegal activities of the Communist-led strikers, unless action is speedily taken force the strikers back to work and thus end the need for the rigid restrictions on Mr Francis. production that have been made necessary by their defiance of authority. No political party that allows itself to be cowed by industrial anarchists into allowing them to deprive men and women of themeans of living, can claim the right togovern the country.",34

124,Mr JAMES,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Hunter) [8.0] - The genesis of the industrial dispute in Queensland is not difficult to discover. The workers are endeavouring to uphold the principle of seniority that workersthroughout Australia have supported for many years. If employees must be dismissed, those who were the last to be engaged should he the first to be discharged. The trouble occurred in Queensland because the employer dismissed men without regard to seniority, and,' naturally, the employees resented it. Only the strenuous efforts of the Commonwealth Government have prevented the spread of the troubleto other States, with a further loss of production. The Leader of the Australian. Country party (Mr Fadden) derives considerable satisfaction from this disputeMembers of the Opposition always welcome industrial turmoil at the approach of the general elections. They invariably blame the workers; .they never criticize the employers. But employers, as a class, are capable of ""pin-pricking"" the workers into striking, as happens in the coal- . mining industry. The coal-owners know that they have a diminishing asset. Because of the heavy taxation at the present time, they are not able to make substantial profits from that asset. Therefore, they do not favour maximum production. until taxes have been reduced. I The Leader of the Australian Country party exhorted the Government to intervene in the meat industry dispute in Queensland.' The right honourable gentleman considered that the strikers should be punished with the utmost rigour of the law. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) answered the Leader of the Australian Country party most effectively. He asked, whether the right honourable gentleman considered that the workers should be put to in gaol. Of course, that would lead only to an extension of the dispute. Before the Government could put all the strikers in gaol, it would need to call out the armed forces, and that would result in serious disorders. The attitude which the Leader of the Australian Country party adopted this afternoon reminded me strongly of the attitude adopted by a former member of his party a few years ago, which earned for him the nickname of "" Shoot 'em Down "". In future, the right honourable gentleman will be entitled to the name of "" Shoot 'em Down Artie "".",35
125,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,That is only the honourable member's interpretation of the remarks of the Leader of the Australian - Country party.,36
126,Mr JAMES,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,It is not.,36
127,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,It is a malicious interpretation.,36
128,Mr JAMES,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"In 1940, the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, tried in every possible way to appease the coalminers. He went to the coal-fields, and the representatives of the men endeavoured to negotiate with the men. He had arranged for the proceedings to be broadcast, but he. was not prepared to allow the miners to state over the air their case in reply to his submissions. As he knows, his meeting was sabotaged. The hall at which he was to speak was empty. I grant that the right honourable gentleman was courageous enotigh to address the men at the park in which they were holding a meeting, but he was obliged to rely on appeasement. In response to their demands, he appoined the commission that awarded them the pension which they now enjoy, and a shorter - working week. Honourable members opposite accused the Government of not being prepared to co-operate with the Premier of Queensland, Mr Hanlon, in settling the dis' pute. That is not correct. The Commonwealth was told, in effect, to ""keep its bib out of it "" , because the dispute 'was a State matter. The Government of Queensland has now proclaimed a State of national emergency. I believe that if the Commonwealth possessed the necessary constitutional powers, it should intervene. But when, at the last referendum, we sought such power, the honourable members opposite opposed the granting of it. When they occupied the treasury-bench, they supported constitutional reform, but when they are in Opposition, they sabotage any proposals for granting to the Commonwealth increased powers. In my opinion, the Commonwealth should have complete authority over industrial matters, and I hope that at the forthcoming referendum the people will confer upon it that power. In what I am about to say, I do not desire to be misunderstood. The Communist party is probably stronger in my . electorate than in any other constituency in Australia; but being a democrat, I cannot agree to the suggestion of the Leader of the Australian Country party that the Communist party should be declared an illegal organization. In a democracy, every individual, has the right to express, without fear of the consequences, his political opinion. Shortly after the outbreak of World War II . , the then Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, declared the Communist party an illegal organization. What was the outcome? .The Communists then used as their mouthpiece in New South Wales the State Labour party, headed hy the HughesEvans group. That was the only occasion on which their candidates did not forfeit their deposits at an election. In my opinion, the Communist party is blamed for many thing3 for which it is not responsible.",36
129,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Order ! The honourable member has exhausted his time. Motion (by Mr MORGAN) negativedThat the honourable member for Hunter be granted an extension of time!,36
130,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Indi) [8.11] - The purpose of the motion is to focus attention upon the serious unrest in . industry, not only in Queensland, but throughout Australia. Every one realizes that a serious drift is occurring in industrial matters. The delay in overtaking the housing shortage is largely attributable' to this widespread industrial unrest, and the Commonwealth and State Governments are incapable of grappling with the problem. As the result of strikes, Australian citizens are enduring serious inconveniences. People in Great Britain are hungry because 35,000 tons of beef has not been treated in Queensland since the commenceniBTit of the dispute in the meat industry. Livestock cannot be transported by rail from New South Wales to Victoria because of the shortage of coal."" Indeed, the whole general movement of goods on the railways is breaking down. When the matter was raised in the House this afternoon the Prime Minister was compelled to break his silence to indicate where the Government stood. What did he' say? He'made a puerile speech pointing out that strikes occurred in other countries as well as in Australia. He referred to the division of constitutional authority in this country. He said that he was sorry about what was happening, and that he had no doubt that if the employers were willing to do something the strike could be settled. He proceeded to say that the workers of Australia had a grand record. Such statements have been made from time to time by gentlemen sitting on the ministerial bench, and they are, in themselves, an incitement to strikers to defy the law. So long as such speeches are being made hy the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister we shall have industrial unrest in Australia. Not one word fell from the lips of' the Prime Minister' or the Deputy Prime Minister, who is himself a Queenslander, in condemnation of the strikers for defying an award of the Queensland Industrial Court. They did not in any way castigate these people who are dislocating industry and many public services. Not a word was said by either of the right honourable gentlemen which could give the people of Brisbane any hope that they-might soon have something better than candle-light to see their way about their homes. No expectation was given to them that they might soon have improved tram and train services. All we heard was a puerile diatribe against the employers.",36
131,Mr BKYSON,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Of course the employers are never wrong!,37
132,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"If the employers are wrong they will be condemned by the appropriate judicial authority. The point is that this Labour Government, which declares that it stands for arbitration, has absolutely refused to enforce our industrial laws. The position, in short, is that a Labour government is inherently ""' incapable of dealing with industrial unrest because of the association of the political Labour party with the industrial Labour movement. Because of. this relationship no present occupant of the treasury bench has any inducement to take a strong stand on an industrial matter. The Prime Minister himself reminded us that he represents a constituency which includes a big coal mining district. The right honourable gentleman knows that if he took a strong stand in regard to industrial unrest in the coal-mining industry he would lose all hope of winning his pre-selection ballot, and if he could not win that ballot he could not remain Prime Minister of this country. The continued presence of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway) in this House is dependent also upon his winning a preselection ballot. All the members of this Government depend upon the result of pre-selection ballots, and they are not likely to do anything drastic against striking unionists. It is just as well for the Australian people to realise that for this reason Labour governments are utterly incapable of taking a strong stand on industrial matters - If the people want industrial peace they will have to turn the Labour party out of office. A Labour >government will never exercise the strength necessary to deal with industrial unrest. The Prime Minister fell hack upon the ancient political trick of saying to the Opposition, "" What would you do about it ?"". But the party in office should have its own plan for dealing with such a situation. It should not need to solicit advice from the Opposition. I remind honourable gentlemen opposite that a non-Labour government which was faced with industrial unrest, first in the ranks of the seamen and next among the waterside workers, took strong action to terminate the disputes and its actions were endorsed by the electors in 1925 and in 1938. Honourable members interjecting.",37
133,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"I repeat, amidst a babble that is so loud that I can scarcely hear my own voice, that it is vital for the Australian people, if they desire industrial peace, to dismiss this Government which is incapable of dealing with a strong hand with those who are causing the present industrial strife.",37
134,Mr HOLLOWAY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Ser-. intervene. vice) [8.21] - I deprecate the statements and innuendoes of the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) concerning the' - courage of the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley). The people of Australia are the best judges of the courage of the honourable gentleman, and they will shortly have the opportunity to express their opinions. It is more than strange that this motion should have been launched during a week in which we have got nearer to peace in industry than we have been for a considerable time. remind honourable gentlemen that the long-standing dispute at the explosives factory in Victoria has been settled this week, and the men have gone back to work. Another long-standing dispute volving the employees of Poole and Steel Limited has also been settled, and the are back at work. All through this week conferences have been sitting with the object of settling the dispute in bane which is specifically mentioned the motion before the House. Represencancelled, tatives of the parties concerned, under the chairmanship of the Premier of Queensland, have been sitting for periods, and onlythis morning the Premier issued a statement to the effect that, although the parties did not reach - complete agreement yesterday afternoon, the door to settlement had not been closed,, - and the parties could again meet round the conference table. This motion has been launched because honourable members opposite fear that might miss an opportunity to make stateCourt ments derogatory to the workers of Aushimself, tralia. Let us compare the statements that have been made by honourable gentleavailable men opposite during this debate with - actual facts of the case. The Leader of the Australian Country party charged Government with failure to use its power to intervene in the dispute, but everybody - who knows anything about the matter aware that the organization 'involved it is registered with the Industrial Court of Queensland, and that the workers engaged in the industry are covered by an award of that court. The Commonwealth has no jurisdiction in the dispute, no Commonwealth industrial machinery - exists under which the Government could Mr MCEwen - The Minister no doubt remembers the rebuke he got for attempti n g to intervene in another dispute.",38
135,Mr HOLLOWAY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"1 did not interject while the honourable member for Indi right was speaking, and I certainly do not intend to become hysterical now. The honourable gentleman knows very well that the Commonwealth has no constitutional power to intervene in the dispute. The Queensland Government has taken action to deal drastically with the men who are I on strike. The union concerned has already been deregistered, which means that its members have been deprived of the protection of the court. That is a most serious matter. In Queensland, it inshould be remembered, the principle of preference to unionists is in force. Every men worker who is employed under an award of the Queensland Industrial Court is entitled to preference in employment. BrisBut not only has the registration of the in Meat Industry Employees Union been but also preference, which is of vital concern to trade unionists, has been withdrawn. No reference was made this long afternoon hy Opposition speakers to these very important facts, and nothing was said about the heavy penal sections of the Queensland industrial law. The fact 'is that the Queensland Government has taken drastic action to enforce the law. These men were working under a State law. Had they been working under a Commonwealth law I have no doubt that Acting Chief Judge Drake-Brockthey man of the Commonwealth Arbitration would have taken cognizance of the dispute and would have intervened or detailed one of his brother judges to do so. Had no judge been for the purpose, one of the the Commonwealth industrial commissioners would have been instructed to take charge the of the matter. However, as the men were working under a State and not a Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth had is no authority. The men have broken the in State law and they have been punished severely by the deregistration of their - union and the withdrawal of preference. One would have gathered from the and remarks of honourable gentlemen opposite that nothing had been done to attempt to settle the dispute, but only the day before yesterday the ham and bacon section of the union, the representatives of the Queensland abattoirs, and also other parties to the dispute who were meeting in conference, agreed upon a formula for settlement, but because the men in the exporting group refused to accept the formula, the conference broke clown. However, as I have said, the door is still open for a further conference. In the meantime, the State Government has taken further action, for it has seized the membership roll of the union and ordered that a secret ballot be held. The ballot-paper shows on the face of it that it was prepared by the State Industrial Registrar for issue to members of the union, who were requested to vote upon the question of whether they were prepared to return to work under award conditions on the understanding that, after their return to work, the four men mainly concerned in the dispute, which involves the interpretation of the seniority rule, should have their grievances investigated at a round-table conference under the auspices of the Industrial Court. The secret ballot is proceeding.",38
136,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,Is the honourable gentleman in favour of it?,39
137,Mr HOLLOWAY,PARLIAMENTARY PROCEEDINGS,"The honourable member for Indi, who presented such a poor case, will have to get much sweeter bait if he wishes to catch me. Those who raised this matter today were aware of the difficulties of the situation and of the troubles through which the Queensland people are passing. Therefore, they should not have made extravagant, irritating and provocative statements, which must - enlarge, rather than narrow, the dispute. They cited figures purporting to show that 6,000 persons are drawing unemployment relief payments, whereas not one-half of that number is registered for unemployment relief, including all those who are involved in the dispute. - Mr MCEWEN - My leader said, not that they were drawing unemployment relief, but that there had been 6,000 appliarrangements cations for it. Debate interrupted under Standing Order 257B. NA BILL 1946. Assent reported. NA PROCEEDINGS"" BROADCASTING . BILL 1946. Message received from the Senate intimating that it had agreed tQthe amendments made by the House of Representatives in this bill NATIONALITYBILL (No. 2) 1946.. Bill presented by Mr Calwell, and. read a first time. SECOND READING.",39
138,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration and Minister for Information). [8.33] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a* second time. Under existing nationality law, an essential requirement for the grant of a certificate of naturalization is that an applicant shall have resided for a prescribedperiod within the British Dominions. The Territory of New Guinea does not form a part of the British Dominions for the purposes of nationality law, and residence in the territory cannot, therefore, be counted as residence for the grant of naturalization. This means that the only way open at present to a person living in the territory to acquire British nationality, which will be recognized in Australia, or other parts of the Empire, is to abandon his domicile there and take up residence in Australia or some other part of the British Com1 monwealth. The purpose of this bill is to enable a resident of the territory to qualify for naturalization as a British subject while maintaining his residence in the territory. The right of the Commonwealth to legislate for the grant of naturalization to residents of New Guinea is not in doubt, as in 1922 the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations, in - reporting on the national status of inhabitants of territories under B and C mandate, under which the Territory of New Guinea was classed, statedI t is open to Mandatory Powers to whom V, and C mandates have been entrusted to make in conformity with their own laws for the individual and purely voluntary acquisition Of their own nationality by inhabitants of these territories. The Commonwealth has long realized the desirability of making provision which would enable certificates, of naturalization 'to be granted to persons resident in New - Guinea who have for a considerable period been much more closely associated with this country than with any other country. The matter of amending the United Kingdom Nationality and Status of Aliens Act to permit of residence in B and C mandated territories to count as residence in His Majesty's Dominions for the grant of naturalization was brought before the Imperial Conference in 1923 at the instance of the Commonwealth - Government. The conference recommended that the power of granting imperial certificates of naturalization be - extended so as to cover persons residing in B and C mandated territories and ,.also in protectorates, and a draft bill was accordingly prepared in 1924 for introduction in the United Kingdom Parliament. Although representations were made by the Commonwealth from time to time, nothing was done by the United Kingdom authorities to give effect to the bill until 1926, when a revised draft was submitted to the Imperial Conference held in that year. The revised draft wasapproved by the conference, and also by the Commonwealth Government. The introduction of the revised bill was, however, deferred, as the United Kingdom - Government took the.view that with the passing of the Statute of Westminster in relation to the position of dominion mandated territories, certain drafting amendments of the bill were necessary on technical grounds to secure that (a) where the respective dominion parliaments had made appropriate provision for the grant of certificates of naturalization to residents in their mandated territories such certificates should be duly recognized; and (o) residence in such mandated territories should be treated as residence within His Majesty's Dominions for the purposes of the United Kingdom Act. 'The Commonwealth endeavoured to secure the passage of the bill by the United Kingdom Government, but in 1937 was advised that the matter of introducing legislation on the lines indicated was still under consideration and that a decision in regard to it had not been reached. As it'seemed unlikely that the United Kingdom Government, would introduce this legislation at a comparatively early date, .consideration was given to the amend-ment of the Commonwealth Nationality Act so as to extend it to the Territory, of New Guinea as if that were a part of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the act. Cabinet approved of this in 193S. But the Commonwealth Crown Law authorities have expressed the opinion that it is not possible to grant to residents of New Guinea naturalization which would be effective throughout the British Dominions. The Government has decided that the next best should be given to residents of the te'rritory; that is, that they shall be accorded the privilege of qualifying for the grant of British nationality which will have effect in the Commonwealth and its territories. The bill makes that provision. I am confident that all members will share the Government's belief that residents of a territory which for so long has been closely linked with Australia, should no longer be denied the opportunity of becoming eligible to acquire British nationality. I have no hesitation in commending the bill to their favourable consider a tion.",39
139,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY,Are some of those people stateless?,40
140,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,No ; they retain the - nationality that they brought with them.,40
141,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY,"Supposin g they were Austrians, what then?",40
142,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,They would still be classed as Austrians.,40
143,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY,But Austria has disappeared !,40
144,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"They would be regarded legally as Germans, although they are really Austrians, because it has been the practice in this country to regard as Germans everybody who was in Austria even before the Anschluss effected by Hitler in 1938. The only people in this country who are regarded as stateless are those who were so declared by* Hitler when they were ejected from Germany, or those who have been so classified in consequence of turmoil in various countries in Europe. Since 1916> we have had in this country people who were residents of Czarist Russia but are regarded as stateless because they claim that they have never been citizens of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The number of stateless persons in Australia is comparatively small, if we exclude all of those who were driven out of Germany and were refused German passports. The fact that they were refused German passports naturally made them stateless.",40
145,Mr ABBOTT,PARLIAMENTARY,Who are the people who hold Nansen passports?,41
146,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"They are people whom the League of Nations rescued after the turmoil of World War I . Very few-people hold Nansen passports today. We have had to devise a new system in respect of those who were caught up in the cataclysms in Europe during the last few years. The people covered by this bill are mostly missionaries and planters. Some of them have given 38 or 40 years of their lives to the service of this try, in one way or another, in New Guinea, yet are still ineligible British nationality. During the war period, their lack of British nationality was a danger to them. Had they resided in Australia for five years, of that long term of service in New Guinea, they could have acquired British nationality, which would have been recognized throughout every part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. What Ave propose to give to them is a Certificate of Naturalization which will be effective so long as they remain in Australia or its territories. Should they leave the Commonwealth, they will again acquire the status which they had before their naturalization.",41
147,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY,Are they mostly German nationals?,41
148,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"They may be German, Dutch or Italian.",41
149,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY,"What are they, fact? . Mr Calwell - In fact, there are Americans, French, Germans, Belgians, Austrians and Italians. There are almost as many nationalities in New Guinea as there were nations represented on the League of Nations.",41
150,Mr ABOHIE CAMERON,PARLIAMENTARY,I suppose that some of them were in internment long enough to qualify for naturalization ?,41
151,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"Some of them, unfortunately, were wrongly interned. I have no hesitation in making that declaration in this Parliament in respect of both New Guinea and other places. But that is not a matter for discussion here.",41
152,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY,Does this bill make provision in regard to the German missionaries ?,41
153,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"Yes ; it will embrace all the members of the former German missions., Lutheran missions and Catholic missions. A grant of naturalization is not made to.any person in Australia without the approval of the security service. That is an inflexible rule. The same requirement will be laid upon the security service to approve of the applications of any persons in New Guinea, for naturalization under this legislation, counwhen it becomes effective, before any further consideration will be given to to acquire such applications.",41
154,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY,Coul d the bill apply to a person of Asiatic origin?,41
155,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,No . Technically it could; but actually no persons of Asiatic origin are naturalized in Australia.,41
156,Mr MCEWEN,PARLIAMENTARY,This bill will not entitle such persons to become naturalized ?,41
157,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"This bill will not make effective any such application for naturalization. Technically, any person can be naturalized in this country; but it is' a rule of the department that naturalization shall be granted only to persons of European origin or descent. Persons are admitted to this country if they are substantially of European origin. By "" substantially "" I mean that persons who are more than' one-half of European extraction-for example, an Eurasian who in is five-eighths of European extractionwould be admitted to the Commonwealth and would be treated as though they were persons of European descent. That is the practice of the department, over which the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) presided for a portion of his ministerial career, and over which the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison)' held sway in the long, long ago when he was a Commonwealth Minister of State.",41
158,Mr BLAIN,PARLIAMENTARY,"Will this bill be sponsored by the Summer School of Political Science, as a first wedge?",42
159,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"I do not propose to answer the honourable member's aberrations in regard to summer schools, or any other subject. I am presenting a bill that has been considered from time tp time by many governments of the Commonwealth. It is a measure designed to do in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea precisely what has been done by the Parliament of the United Kingdom for persons who have resided in Palestine for the required period of five years. Such persons are entitled to naturalization certificates which, while they continue to reside in Palestine, give them all the rights and privileges of British nationality, but once they leave Palestine the certificates no longer have any effect. In this bill, we propose to grant certain limited rights of citizenship, and 90 per cent, of the .persons who will benefit deserve to do so.",42
160,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY,Are there not some known Nazis among these people?,42
161,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"There may be, and of if so they will not get naturalization certificates.",42
162,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY,Is the Minister sure of that?,42
163,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"I am sure of it, because I am the Minister who administers our nationality laws. Any gets past me has to get up pretty early in the morning.",42
164,Mr WHITE,PARLIAMENTARY,But those girls got back to Manila.,42
165,Mr CALWELL,PARLIAMENTARY,"Yes , with my permission. As I have previously said no application for naturalization considered by me unless it has been approved by the security service. I repeat that that is an inflexible rule. , an application is so approved, I then consider the other, aspects of the ings, application which affect the suitability of the person ,for naturalization. The security service has approved of many applications for naturalization which I 'have rejected, not because the applicants were subversive or constituted a menace to the security of the Commonwealth, but because they were anti-social in their activities, and had flagrantly disobeyed the law. Most of those who apply for naturalization are given their papers, but the grant of citizenship is not lightly made. I am not concerned with an applicant's political views. I have no doubt that, under our immigration scheme, we shall have an influx of tories who may be nearly as bad as the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron), but that will not prevent their being naturalized. I trust that, by this digression, I have been able to enlighten honourable members regarding a subject which is fairly involved, and of great importance. I should like to add that it is not the Government's intention that this shall be the final word on the subject. It is proposed to hold a conference of representatives of the United Kingdom and the Dominions in the near future to discuss certain nationality questions. It is intended to raise at that conference the matter of making provision that residence in New Guinea shall be regarded as a qualification for the grant of a certificate naturalization which will be effective, not only in Australia and its territories, but also throughout the other countries of the British Commonwealth.

166,Mr HOLLOWAY,PARLIAMENTARY,"Melbourne P o r t s Minister for Labour and National Seris vice) [8.52] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of this bill may be shortly If stated. It proposes to give absolute protection against civil or criminal proceedfor example proceedings for libel, in respect of the publication under the authority of a parliamentary committee of any document laid before the committee or of any evidence given before the committee. The Parliamentary Papers Act 190S1935, which the bill proposes to amend, provides, amongst other things, that no action - or proceedings, civil or criminal, shall lie against any person for publishing any document published under the authority of the Senate or the House of Representatives. The act does not apply to publication under the authority of a parliamentary committee, but where the evidence given before a parliamentary . committee is tabled in either House of the Parliament and ordered by that House to be printed the protection given by the act applies. However, when evidence is tabled and ordered to be printed, a large number of copies must be printed in order to meet the requirements of the circulation list for parliamentary papers. For example, upon the .tabling of the report of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting regarding proposed staff regulations for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the number of copies printed was 660. It is considered that the expense of printing the evidence before parliamentary committees as a parliamentary paper is not always justified. As an instance, the Standing Committee on Broadcasting considers that the number of copies of the evidence given before it which, generally speaking, need be printed is about 40. I feel sure that honourable members will agree that where a committee itself arranges the publication of evidence before it with the object of saving public money, it should not he deprived of the protection of the Parliamentary Papers - Act. It may be that the publication is already privileged either at common law or by virtue of section 49 of the Common' wealth Constitution, but it is considered desirable to put the matter beyond doubt. The hill is 'designed to achieve this object. The bill applies to documents and evidence published after the 23rd September, 1943, which was the first sitting day of the present Parliament, so as to - cover certain evidence before the Broadeasting Committee which has been published by the committee since that date.

Bill presented, and read a first time. SECOND READING. Mr Holloway. (Melbourne Ports - Minister for Labour and National Service) [9.53] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of this bill is to provide that, where a judge of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court has, prior to his appointment, served in any judicial office under a State, his service under the State, up to a period of ten years, shall be deemed to be part of his service as a judge of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court for the purpose of calculating his pension rights. Under the act in its present form, account may be taken of prior service in a judicial office under.the Commonwealth for the purposes of pension rights, but no such provision is made in respect of prior service in a judicial office under a State. In other legislation, for example, the Bankruptcy Act, a limited period of - prior service in a judicial office under a State may be taken into account for the purposes of pension. The idea is to establish a permanent basis for .settling matters of this kind. Recently, several new judges have been appointed, and most of them have served'-in a judicial capacity in a State.

PATENTS BILL 1946. Motion (by Mr Holloway) agreed toThat leave be given to bring in a bill for an net to amend the Patents Act 1903-1935, and for other purposes. Bill presented, and read a first time. - SECOND READING;.",42
167,Mr HOLLOWAY,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Melbourne Ports - Minister for Labour and National Service) [8.56] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. The principal object of the bill is to remove certain disadvantages which have occurred by reason of the delay at' present existing in the examination work, of the Patent Office. That delay has been brought about in part""by the fact that a large number of examiners of patentsrepresenting over 60 per cent, of the staff - were released during the war from the 1 Patent Office for service in the forces and in other departments. The delay has also 1 een partly brought about by reason of an abnormal and entirely unpredictable increase of the number of applications for patents. This increase appears to be largely due to the great industrial de\ elopment which has taken place in Australia in recent years. Many overseas manufacturers discovered during the war that the Australian market was worthwhile, and that they cannot obtain royalties for the use of their inventions in Australia unless they patent them here. In 1939, the number of applications for patents was 5,700; last year it was 7,300; and it is expected that this year the number will exceed 10,000. In passing, I should like to mention that the state of the work in the Australian office is not singular, that the position in the British office is practically the same, and that the state of work in the United States office; is also far above normal. Every effort is being made to obtain the services of additional examiners of patents. It takeSj however, at least three years to train an examiner fully in his work, and it is theref ore evident that some considerable time will elapse before any substantial reduction is made of the arrears of examination work in the Patent Office. Any serious delay in the examination of patent applications has a detrimental effect on inventors, and onindustrial development. In the 'first place, .the delay abridges the inventor's rights in his invention because it abridges' the life of his patent, which commences from the date of application. Secondly, manufacturers who desire to embark on new projects do not know of the inventions which may be lying dormant in' the Patent Office and may ultimately interfere with their own developments. The normal procedure in connection, with an application for a patent is that,, after it has been examined and passed by an examiner,, it is accepted by the Commissioner and thrown open to public inspection. Any person who considers that he would be prejudicially affected by the application, if granted, may lodgeopposition within, three months. If there is no opposition, or' the opposition is dismissed, a patent is sealed on the application, and that patent dates from the dateof. the. application and runs for sixteen years. The inventor, however,, may not commence any action for infringement until his patent has been sealed, and then only in respect of infringementsoccurring after the publication of thecomplete specification, which takes placewhen the application has been accepted. The Patents Act contemplates' that normally an application would be accepted within twelve months and the patent sealed within sixteen months. These times were substantially observed beforethe war. At the present time, however, publication consequent upon acceptancedoes not take place until approximately two years after the date of. application. The rapidity of technical developmentstaking place at the present day is such that the effective life of many patents i * very much less than the period of sixteen years for which they are granted,, so that a delay of even two years represents a greater proportion than one-eighth of theeffective life of the patent. As far as industrial' development isconcerned- a matter to which the patentsystem is primarilydirected-dela y in publication of specifications leaves manufacturers in the dark, and hampers them in theirdevelopmental activities. Under the existing law, a specification remainssecret and is not published until it ' has been accepted. At the present time, this does not, as I have mentioned, take place until about two years after the application is lodged. Inother words, the undue prolongation of the secrecy period is embarrassing to. manufacturers. A partial solution of the difficulties of inventors and manufacturers alike lies in the expeditious publication of complete specifications lodged in connection with applications for patents. This bill, therefore, proposes to amend the law so as to provide for the publication of complete specifications forthwith after lodgement at the Patent Office, and for a patentee, whose invention has been used after publication, to be entitled to damages for infringement committed from the date of publication forthwith after the lodgement instead of from the date of publication consequent upon acceptance. Damages are, of course, only recoverable if a patent is ultimately sealed on the application and only in respect of valid claims. As a corollary to the provisions referred to, the bill also gives protection to persons who may be threatened with infringement actions by applicants on the basis of questionable .or invalid claims, and prohibits the making of false representations that articles are patented or the subject of pending applications. The bill also proposes to make permanent a practice adopted during the war under the National Security Regulations of not examininga provisional specification until the complete specification has been lodged. In many cases, applications are accompanied by provisional specifications only and lapse by reason of the failure of the applicant to lodge a complete specification. The time spent in examining provisional specifications which may lapse will be saved by reason of this amendment. The passage of the bill will not detract from an inventor's existing rights, but will, in fact, also enable his exclusive rights in his invention to commence at an earlier date. On the other hand, the bill will benefit manufacturers by making it possible for them to ascertain at the earliest possible date what inventions have been evolved by others and are the subject of patent applications, thereby enabling manufacturers to avoid .wasteful duplication of developMr Nollo-way. mental activities. 1 trust that the bill will commend itself to the House and he passed without delay.

168,Mr DALY,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Martin) [9.6] - I have a letter which concerns an ex-serviceman in my electorate which I desire to bring to the attention of the Minister for Repatriation (Mr Frost). The letter relates to a man whom I was successful in having discharged from the forces about the middle of last year on medical grounds because of war-caused disabilities. Following his discharge he approached the Repatriation Department for the grant of a war pension. In a reply dated the 10th October, 1945, the department statedW it h reference to your application for acceptance of nerves as due to war service, I have to advise that after investigation the following diagnosis was made: Nervous disorder. The Repatriation Board accepted the above mentioned disabilities as being attributable to war service, and assessed the pensionable incapacity arising therefrom at n i l per cent. The letter goes on to say that should he suffer from further disabilities he should submit himself for examination by another doctor, tendering the letter as proof of eligibility for treatment. Although the department assessed his nervous disorder as' attributable to war service it refused to grant a pension on that ground. A few days ago the man was declared insane and placed in a mental asylum. His father has approached me and complained about the treatment meted out to his son and made grave charges against certain people at the reception . house in Sydney where the ex-serviceman was declared insane. In order to enlighten the House as to the true circumstances of the case I propose to read a letter received from the father in which serious charges are made against several bodies responsible for the welfare of the man concerned. The letter, which is dated the 22nd June, reads as follows:As you did so much in the past to_ help me in the fight to get my son's discharge"" from the military forces last year, I am writin g to let you know the startling developments that have happened since last I saw you. As you know the hoy was kicked in the head playing battalion football and for a long period suffered from amnesia and his papers were endorsed "" B2 : for mainland service only "". You will be surprised to know that when his discharge on medical grounds was ultimately decided on, he was in an operational area in Wewak, New Guinea. The next thing we heard about the boy was when a letter from the Red Cross was received stating that he was a patient in the 114th Australian General Hospital at Goulburn and asking us to call and give them some information. My wife called in and was asked some frivolous questions; I went to Goulburn and was there informed that the boy was suffering from nervous disorder and was having shock treatment. When I asked why it was we were not notified that he had been there for at least a month, I was told that the Army did not inform relatives unless it was a matter of life and death. The Officer Commanding also told me that my boy was discharged on man-power grounds, and it took your letter to his wife to make him realise that he did not know what he was talking about. The boy was discharged in.August in a very bad state of nervous disorder, without a pension. He secured a position with a firm in Sydney, where he gave great satisfaction. In January last he was knocked from a lorry down an embankment and fractured his elbow. He was under treatment by compensation doctors for about sixteen weeks then a bone specialist was called in and it was decided to operate. Although it should be known to the medical profession that the giving of a general anaesthetic usually had a deleterious effect on a patient who had had shock treatment, and although it was pointed out to them that he was such a patient, he was given a general anaesthetic. The operation was a success physically and a fair amount of movement of the joint has eventuated, but as I anticipated, his mental condition was worsened and the nervous disorder returned. At this time it was brought to my notice that he had a printed form from the Repatriation Commission stating that he was under the care of the repatriation and a medical man had been [81] 1946.] (Grievance Day.) 2239 appointed locally, and at-any time his'services were to be available. As my son's condition did not improve, I took him on the 7th June to see a doctor and he decided to place him in a repatriation hospital. Late in the afternoon he was taken by ambulance to 113th Australian General Hospital. From now on what I am going to tell you would be what you would expect to read in the pages of a Frankenstein horror magazine and would not be expected to be enacted in this so-called democratic country. On the Sunday morning, the 9th June, at about 1 a.m. his wife was disturbed and on going to investigate, found her husband outside in the bitter cold clothed only in a pair - of pyjama trousers and an overcoat, and without any foot covering at all. She clothed him suitably and naturally, considering she is seven months' pregnant and greatly upset by this latest development, persuaded him to go back to hospital. When you consider that he said he had walked from the hospital without any foot covering and then walked back again after being suitably clothed, you can imagine what condition he must have been in . His aunt visited him at 113th on 10th June, and was informed that he was to be moved to 101 Australian General Hospital at Punchbowl the following day. The distressing feature connected with 113th is that his Returned Soldier's Badge (his most treasured possession) was stolen from his coat; he asked that it be recovered and returned to him, .but up to date we have heard nothing of it ; also some of his clothing that he took to 113th is missing. On Wednesday morning, 12th June, his wife rang Punchbowl and was informed that she could see her husband at the Reception House that afternoon. Even in the condition she is in she went to the Reception House at. Darlinghurst, and was informed that he was to be sent to Callan Park; she came home and told me on Wednesday night. Knowing that, the repatriation have a lot of patients in the cottages at Callan Park I was not too much disturbed, but all the same did not like the admission to the Reception House at all . On Thursday, 13th June, I visited the Reception House at 2 p.m. I saw my son and was - informed by him that he had told the staff he wanted to get in touch with his'father; they ignored his frequent requests. I made inquiries and was'told that the boy had requested to see me, but they did not believe him. I then asked both Mr Kelly and Mr Hoskins had he been certified; they both told me that my son had been certified and would be transferred to Callan Park the next day. I expressed horror and asked why I was not sent for before he was certified, especially when the young man was able to tell them where I was employed. They told me that it was not their business and at any rate it was now too late to do anything in the matter. I went to Callan Park to see the boy on Wednesday, June 19th. I saw the Medical Superintendent and he assured me, the same as the staff at the Reception House did, that the young man had not given the slightest trouble, in fact had only been kept' in bed one day instead of the customary three days. He looks well and is well cared for. He reiterates that hehad repeatedly asked the staff at the Reception House to get in touch with me and they told hi into keep quiet. I ' called at the Reception' House on June' 10th-, and to my amazement was told that my son had not been certified until the morning of the l'4th, and immediately taken to Callan Park. According to this letter, although the father was told at the Reception House on the 13th Junethat hisson had been certified as insane, he was not certified until the. next day,, the 14th June.. The letter goes onThe point I wish' to raise is this^-that although 1 was at the Reception House on the afternoon of the13th, and' even if a mistake had been lhade in telling me that my son had been certified, when such was not thecase, it H-mounts to criminal negligence oil the part of the head of the Reception House*, in the fact that knowing the horror that I expressedoff the afternoon of the 13til instant, and also knowing that if I had. known in time. I would have prevented it , they allowed) my son to Be certified' as insane; they had my address and I would have goneimmediately to assert my rights as a father and citizen to appear on my son's behalf and. make other arrangements. Had I the opportunity I would have made arrangements to have l i i m admitted to Gallam. Park as a voluntary patient in the repatriation block for returned soldiers. I say this because I would prefer to see my son under the care of the officers and staff tft Callan Park than in any hospital under the control of the military authorities. Knowing of your great work in the Wilson case and other things you have doiie; I appeal to you, Mr Daly, tojoin with me in a fight to have the certificate of insanity recorded against my son, both at the Darlinghurst court and Reception House-, expunged from the records, and that he be classed as a voluntary patient at Callan Park Repatriation Hospital. I also demand that an investigation be held into the conduct of the Reception House, so that a repeatal of the criminal negligence be not allowed to be perpetrated. I claim to lie the person responsible for my son's welfare, because I placed him in the hand's of the repatriation doctor, and no move should have been madewithout my approval. I would definitely not have sanctioned the certification of my son under any consideration, had I been informed in time to prevent it . The f a the r appears to have a grave comp l a in t against the persons associated with the issue of the certificate of in s a n it y in respect of his son, p a r t i c u l a r l y as o n l y a f e w months ago' the r e p at r i at i o n doctors certified that the son's nervous disorder did not e n t it l e him to even.a 5' per cent, pension. It is amazin g that he s h o u ld have been certified' as insane with out the knowledge of his parents, having regard to the fact that within, at the most, a. couple of hours, contact with them could have been made by telegramor a - message sent by taxi. It appears that he has been the victim of gross negligence if he has been placed in an asylum as insane without anything having been done to notify his family of what was contemplated. His family has given magnificent service to this country. Tn.e-father fought overseas in the 1'914-18 war and the four brothers in this war. They can look with pride on their achievements. They are entitled' to every consideration,, not the thanklesssort of treatment that this boy has apparently received from the authorities. I ask that the Minister order an immediate investir gation ©f all the circumstancesof theissue of thecertificate. The doctorsshould' be asked to explain on what : grounds they issued the certificate, in view of the patient's medical record. The authorities at the reception liouse should also be asked to explain their part. I am interested! particularly because of the splendid record of the family, which entitles them to 1 the most courteous treatment, not treatment like that described, which has been a tremendous shock to them all.",45
169,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Wentworth) [9,20]. - ^ I consider that the matter that I now bring before-the House is very serious. I am one who believes that the prestige of this House and of honourable members is sohigh that, if imputations are made against an honourable member, the matter should be thoroughly ventilated and, if possible, answered by the member concerned. That is why yesterday I asked questions on notice about the importation of Swiss watches. I asked' them because I had received most disconcerting information, as honourable members will realizeas I relate what I was told. It was represented' to me that the Government had agreed to give to ex-servicemen licences to import annually a quota of Swiss watches to the value of £2,700. As the object was to assist in the re-establishment of ex-servicemen the issue of the licences was commendable. However, itwasstated' that a member or members of this House; who Could not he considered as legitimate importers of watches and had no base year on which a quota could be fixed, had been given licences to import a number of Swiss watch movements. I intend to read some of the questions I asked and the replies thereto in order that honourable members may know the facts. The questions were directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs, Mr . Forde. The first wasIs it a fact that, in order to assist the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen, the Minister, on the 10th September, 1045, approved of a scheme whereby ex-servicemen, applying for permission to import Swiss watches might be granted licences on an annual basis, not - exceeding in any case 1 per cent, (i.e., £2,700) of the total value of the base-year importations? The House wil l see that if that question was answered in the affirmative, - ipso facto, the only persons to whom licences could be granted are those who had established quotas by their previous trading in Swiss watches. The Minister replied- Yes, the Minister did approve of the grant of quotas up to '£2,700 per annum to assist in rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. The answer makes it perfectly clear that a quota based on 1 per cent, of the baseyear importations was to be granted to ex-servicemen. The House could not cavil at that because it is designed to help ex-servicemen to re-establish .themselves by getting stock to resume their trade.",47
170,Mr RUSSELL,CONCILIATIO N AND,He is an ex-serviceman.,48
171,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,"I have not mentioned any one yet. Let me develop my case. The next question was question No. 4Were any such licences issued to any member or members of the House of Representatives or the Senate? If so, to what member or members, and what was the value of the licence or licences? To that question the answer wasMr S. M. Falstein-(<i ) Member of the House of Representatives; (6) Quota for £-2,700. - The sixth question in this series of eight wasIs it a fact that the department has evidence - of trafficking insuch licences; if so, what action has it taken to prevent trafficking in import licences? The answer to that wasThere have been statements by quota-holders - that thcr.e has been trafficking in the licences issued'to ex-servicemen, but no instances of this alleged abuse of the licences have so far been detected by the department. Owing to the .precautions which would be taken by traffickers to coyer up their dealings, detection and proof of the offence would be very difficult. Insofar as watches arc concerned, the qualifications of applicants for quotas have been the subject of more intense scrutiny for some months. I have read those portions of the questions and. answers particularly, because I think that the House should be made aware of the disconcerting statements that are being made, and of the answers given by the Minister. If I had omitted them, obviously I should have been doing an injustice to an honourable member. It is true that in the answers to my questions, a number of names-2 3 in all - of others who have been granted i mport licences have been mentioned. My object in asking the questions was that the fullest possible information should be given to ' the House. The questions were placed on the notice-paper, they have been answered,"" and questions and answers are in the records of the House. It is well known that the Department of Trade and Customs has advised merchants that their quotas cannot be in creased because of the exchange rate with Switzerland. It is well known, too, that legitimate merchants suffered a reduction of their quotas for watch* movements by at least 33J,- per cent. The Government's decision to grant import quotas to ex-servicemen may be commendable, but why should a member of the House of Representatives",48
172,Mr FALSTELN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"What , was the quota held by merchants?",48
173,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,"The honourable member will have an opportunity to state his own case. I am endeavouring to place the matter clearly before the House, because it has certain features of which the House should be aware. The honourable member knows that certain statements have been made in regard to quotas and other matters, and I am sure that'he will welcome a clear statement by the Minister. The honourable member knows only too well the rumours that are being circulated.",48
174,Mr CONELAN,CONCILIATIO N AND,Circulate d by the honourable member.,48
175,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,"No ; this' matter was brought to my notice.' The honourable member concerned in this matter is a barrister. So far as I am aware he has never been established in this industry, and therefore could not have had a base year of trading on which the 1 per cent, quota could be established, or a licence to import watches to the value of £2,700 a year granted. I take it that this figure would represent the invoice price of the goods, and that the total sum involved in general trading would be considerably more. . If my' assumption be correct that this honourable member has never been engaged in this line of business, why did he receive, preference over other ex-servicemen ? Mr FALSTET.N - That is not correct.",49
176,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Then my case cannot be sustained, and the honourable member's name will be cleared. I am sure that is what he most desires. I point out that under the Government's re-establishment scheme an ex-serviceman is not assisted to establish himself in an industry with which he was not associated prior to his enlistment. Honourable members know quite well that an ex-serviceman seeking a re-establishment loan must prove to the Repatriation Department - that he has' been previously engaged in the industry. The point is that these - licences were issued under a specific ruling, namely, that the quota should be .1 per cent, of the importations of the base year. Why has the honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein) been given preference over other ex-servicemen, and over legitimate merchants in this line of business who not only have been refused increased quotas, but also have had their quotas reduced ?",49
177,Mr RUSSELL,CONCILIATIO N AND,How does the honourable member know that increased quotas were refused ?,49
178,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,"That is common knowledge. I also know that the quotas were reduced, as the honourable member may ascertain for himself by making inquiries from the department concerned. Compare this case with' the circumstances surrounding the re-e3tablishment of ex-servicemen in industry generally. An ex-serviceman who wishes to become a dental mechanic is_ refused vocational training in this work because, according to the Repatriation Department, there are too many dental mechanics. Similarly, a man who wishes to be trained in the printing trade is told that there is no position available for him because he is over 21 years of age.and cannot join the printing trades union. Also, instructions have been given to the rehabilitation section of the Department of Post-war Reconstruction to the effect that no applications will be granted to enter the. boilermaking, .blacksmithing, electrical, and some sheetmetal trades. On one hand the men are being refused an opportunity to be trained in certain jobs, and on the other this member of Parliament, a barrister by profession, who has not previously been engaged in this trade, . and who is certainly not a merchant, is granted an import licence. I can regard that as only the grossest form of distinction. A member of the Parliament has received consideration far exceeding that extended to any other citizen. I do not know whether the honourable member has been a merchant. By profession, he is a barrister. I do not know whether he proposes to establish himself in business, or continue as a legal practitioner.",49
179,Mr RUSSELL,CONCILIATIO N AND,"As an ex-serviceman, he ""was entitled to that consideration under the Government's, rehabilitation programme.",49
180,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,"The degree of consideration that is granted to an ex-serviceman is not intended to rehabilitate a director of an industry. The honourable member for Watson is a barrister. If he were given a licence to obtain a number of briefs, the matter would be entirely different; but he has been granted a licence to import watches, and that presumes that he was formerly in that particular calling. If he is not a merchant and does not intend to forsake the legal profession, this House should know why he has been granted permission to import £2,700 worth of watches.",49
181,Mr FALSTEIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"In order to set the honourable member's mind at rest, I inform him that I still hold the .quota.",49
182,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,"The honourable member should not object to my directing attention' to th^s matter. The rumours in circulation 'among the trading community of Sydney are such as warrant our giving to the honourable gentleman an opportunity to clear himself. If he can do so, he will have done a good job. But until he can make it perfectly clear that he is no longer practising as a barrister, but has become a merchant and has established a base year upon which his"" quota can be fixed, I believe that the Government should explain why this consideration has been extended to him. Recently, the Government amended the National Security (War Service Moratorium) Regulations, thereby causing considerable confusion in the building industry. The purpose of the amendment was to permit ex-servicemen to apply to the courts for the right to enter unoccupied homes. It was said, and I have no doubt with a great deal of truth, that there were many unoccupied homes in Sydney, and, indeed throughout Australia, and' that homeless ex-servicemen should have the right to seek permission to enter them. Unfortunately, careless drafting of the amendment has resulted in an extraordinary condition of affairs. The effect is that an ex-serviceman may apply for the right to enter any house now in the course of construction, even though the builder is under contract to a buyer. The person who has contracted with the builder for the erection of the home for himself-must appear before a magistrate and state reasons why the ex-serviceman should not take possession of it. Private builders who 'erect homes for sale, are placed in a most difficult position. They are endeavouring to accommodate large numbers of homeless people,, and assist the Government with its housing programme. It is only by the sale of homes that they build that they are able to continue in thetrade. Most of them are "" small"" contractors, and when they sell a home, they are able to establish credit to purchase more building materials. The position now is that before they complete the erection of a home, an ex-serviceman Kpplies for the right to enter it, and, if he is successful, the builder becomes a landlord instead of a vendor.",49
183,Mr MORGAN,CONCILIATIO N AND,Is the honourable member citing a particular case?,50
184,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Yes . One builder in the eastern suburbs of Sydney informed me that he was erecting five houses under contract. He has already received three notices to appear at the Paddington Police Court to show reason why those homes, upon completion,-should not be made available to persons other than those for whom he has contracted to ' build. He informed me, ""that apart from time wasted in attending the court, I have to pay the legal costs, - and may find that I have become a landlord. My affairs are such that I cannot afford to be a landlord. I must either continue to - build homes, or go bankrupt "". Thousands of builders throughout Australia are in a similar plight, and the natural result of this amendment of the regulation will be that home construction will be slowed down. Contractors will not build homes when they may be prevented from selling them. I know that the Government is deeply concerned about the matter, and is inquiring into the situations. It did not intend that - the regulations should ' have this effect. Magistrates are postponing the hearing of applications of persons for the right to enter homes in the hope that the Government will quickly amend the regulations. Therefore, I urge the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Holloway) and the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lazzarini), who, I know, is concerned about the - matter, to grant relief to builders who are endeavouring to overcome the housing shortage.",50
185,Mr FALSTEIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Watson) '[9.44.] The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has made a personal . attack on me, and if for no other reason than that, I should certainly have taken this opportunity to reply to it. The method of attack was particularly despicable. The honourable member said that he had received certain information. I shall inform the House of the source from which he received it. He obtained it from the Sydney Chamber of Commerce.",50
186,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,The honourable member is definitely wrong.,50
187,Mr FALSTEIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"The same information that was supplied to the honourable gentleman was also the subject of a communication to the Comptroller-General of Customs,. Mr Kennedy. The reply was similar to that which the Minister for T l e and Customs (Senator J. M . ra(Fraser) gave to the honourable member.",50
188,Mr HARRISON,CONCILIATIO N AND,J . assure the honourable member that I did not receive any com- mun'ication from the .Chamber of Commerce.,51
189,Mr FALSTEIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"I happen to know the truth, and I shall state it in unequivocal terms. This incident affords abundant proof of the justice of the made from time to time by Government supporters that members of the Opposition are the willing and pliant tools of the Chamber of Commerce and big business interests. The second claim by the honourable member for Wentworth was that, when provision was being made for assistance in the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen in , the watch trade, all members of the trade * had their import quotas reduced by 33-J per cent. That is true, but at that time they ..were enjoying a quota of 150 per cent, of the imports in their base year. The reduction of 33-\ per cent, was made to ensure that they would still be receiving 100 per cent, of their base-year imports. The third assertion of the honourable member, which is totally incorrect, ' although he may not have been aware of it, was that these quotas were given only to base-year importers. The opposite is the case. The quotas were given to ex-servicemen who were not base-year importers. That was the basis of the ministerial ruling in the first instance. With regard to my being a member of the legal profession while also an importer of watches, I have to say that I am a member of the legal profession, but I have been unable, since my discharge, to secure chambers in which I could practise. My plight _ in that regard is no different from that of a large number of the members of the bar in New South Whales. There is a great lack of office accommodation in Sydney suitable for them. I thought it would be desirable for me to enter a trade, as many other members of the' New South Wales bar have done. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) is in no better position in that respect than I am, from the point of view of legal ethics, and certain members of State parliaments who are members of the bar are similarly engaged. I consider that I was not acting improperly in applying for an import licence to assist me in the importing business in which I am engaged. The importation of watches is not the only activity of the business. It is not necessary to obtain special licences or quotas for the importation from the United Kingdom of. such goods as crockery and ceramic ware, and I see no harm in purclaim - suing a. trade of that nature. - The honourable member for Wentworth, who is always pointing to the returned soldier's badge, and saying how much is being done by the Opposition for ex-ser4 vicemen, will, no doubt, make an attempt to justify the bringing into Australia by Mr Frank Packer, managing director of Consolidated Press Limited, of a quantity of furs from non-sterling countries. This was done without application being made to the Department of Trade and  bat"", because he had sufficient money for the purpose. I do not think he would have relied on his war service to be treated as an .ex-serviceman. The honourable member for Wentworth claims to be an ex-serviceman of World War II . , although I believe that his military work was confined to his duties as a liaison officer with the American forces in Sydney. How does he justify the bringing into Australia of furs, which are prohibited imports, unless obtained by importers holding base-year licences? Was action taEen by the department to confiscate those furs, in view of the fact that the regulations provide that if such goods are imported without a licence they must be imme scream head-line in - the press this morning about my activities, and declared that the accusation against me had not, been made because of a desire to gain party political capital from it. The honourable member for Wentworth claims to be jealous of the privileges of this House, and anxious to give honourable members an opportunity to express their, views, if they had any doubt"" in their  headed "" Labour M.H.R. given a Licence to Import Watches"". Had I been an anti-Labour member of this chamber, probably nothing would have been heard of this matter. I shall not allow members of the Opposition, acting on behalf of vested interests in particular trades or industries, to run mo or any other ex-serviceman out of business. When the watches which I shall import reach Australia, they will be sold at a price slightly below that fixed by the Prices Commissioner, as a protest against the black-marketeering which has been practised in this trade. I hope that I have cleared, up any doubt which honourable members may have as to whether I still hold a quota import licence. I do, and I-propose to' avail myself of it as long as I am able to do so. As for the honourable member saying that, as a member of the bar, I ought not to engage in a trade, perhaps he - will explain why a gentleman posing as a barrister has canvassed from door to door among homes and flats at Double Bay. This man canie to my mother's flat, at Double Bay, soliciting subscriptions at 2s. 6d. each from persons willin g to join the Liberal party. If advantages have been obtained by reason of the quota system in connection with licensing, and the continuance of the Division of Import Procurement, firms which support the Opposition politically have mostly derived those benefits. Recently Mr Arthu r Moore, Director of the Division of Import Procurement, after having been as generous' as he could "" get away with "" in his treatment of firms such as Sydney Snow Limite d and David Jones Limited, has now been paid off by receiving employment with those firms. That happened just after he returned from abroad after an absence of several months at the expense of the Commonwealth. I have nothing to hide in regard to this matter, but I believe that some honourable members of the Opposition are not in that position. They have much to hide in respect of their administration of departments when Ministers and in connection with other matters, also. If there are to be explanations, let their explanations be as full as possible so that we shall know where every honourable member in this House stands. Should there still be some lingering doubts in the minds of honourable members opposite regarding the transactions with which I am concerned I shall be glad to remove them at any time. I base thejustification for the granting of this licence to me on the fact that I am an ex-serviceman, and have not been given anything to which other servicemen are not entitled.",51
190,Mr ABBOTT,CONCILIATIO N AND,"New England) [9.56]. - I bring to the notice of the. House the harsh manner in which an airlines company operating in northern New South Wales has been treated by the Commonwealth Government and the Government of - New South Wales. North-Western Airlines Limited commenced an airline service on the 14th March, 1938, connecting Moree, Tamworth and Sydney. The company consisted of between 300 and 400 shareholders in the Moree district of New South Wales. Por three years it operated until it was compelled to close down after the war had continued for about eighteen months. D u r in g the period of its operations the company's machines flew 305,000 miles and carried 2,3S7 passengers without any accident whatever. The company commenced operations without a government subsidy, and conducted a service between the import places mentioned, with three stops on each journey. When the service closed down in 1941 in order to assist the war effort the company was supplying transport to Sydney from Moree, Tamworth, Inverell, Narrabri, Quirindi and Scone, and received a subsidy from the.Government. It had to build its own aerodrome at Moree, and during wet weather passengers had to be transported to the aerodrome by means of a three-horse buckboard, because the local municipal council refused to build a road half a mile in length to the aerodrome. E f for t s' to have a town aerodrome established prior to the commencement of the service met with no success, and therefore the directors decided to provide' an aerodrome. Accordingly, they purchased the necessary land, erected hangars and offices and put down gravel runways, so that a service could be provided in all weathers. Por other towns, aerodromes were provided by government grants, but that was not done for North - Western Airlines Limited . I . understand that when that company ceased operations it was given an assurance that it would be granted a licence to continue the service after the war. Since the 19th July, 1945, the company had been endeavouring to purchase an aircraft and was given an assurance by the De Havilland Company that it could piirchase a new seven-passenger De H a v i lland aircraft in England, delivery to be given at Mascot in four months, but that it was necessary first to obtain ministerial approval. Although the company sent representatives to Melbourne and Sydney and, in addition wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley), the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr . Scully), the Minister for. the A r m y (Mr . Eorde) and the Minister for A i r (Mr . Drakeford), as well as to the Department of Civil Aviation, it could not get any satisfaction; it has not yet been granted a permit to purchase an aeroplane. The Minister for A i r , replying through the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to a letter from Mr R. B . Nott, M . L . A . for the Liverpool Plains electorate in the New .South Wales Parliament, in which Mr Nott had made representations on behalf of the president of the Tamarang Shire Council regarding the resumption, of the air service by North-Western A i r lines Limited, said I would be pleased if you would inform Nott that before the issue of an airline to that company for the operation of the service could be undertaken, it would be necessary for the company to satisfy the Department Civil Aviation that it would meet the ments for the issue of such licence as *.n the Air Navigation Regulations. Butler Air Transport Company, which operates in the area under a current airline licence and which has the necessary organithat zation and equipment, was informed some time ago that, subject to compliance with certain requirements under the Air Navigation Reguwere lations, it would be granted an airline licence to operate a service between Svdney and Tamsion worth. This company holds contracts for the organization. carriage of mails on other routes and the conditions of contract enable mails to be ried by them on the Sydney-Tamworth service"" under conditions .already approved. The Secretary of the Tamarang Shire Council received a letter from the ter for Commerce and Agriculture, in which the Minister said- ' I have fully discussed this matter with the Minister for Air, who informed me that because of a recent High Court decision - challenging the Commonwealth's power respect to civil aviation it has not been sible for the Minister to grant licences for new services pending full examination of the Court's judgment. It is most unfair that after Western Airlines Limited _ had promised that it would be given a licence - Mr Abbott. when the war ended, the Government should deny it ,that licence, thereby preventing it from acquiring"" the aircraft which it wished to purchase from the De"" Havilland Company. The final letter which the company received is further evidence of the bad treatment to which it has been subjected. On the 16th A p r i l , 1946; Mr O'Sullivan, Minister for . Transport in the New South Wales Government, w r it in g to the secretary of the company, said I now wish to advise you that your company's application has been considered by the Director-General of Civil Aviation but in view of the fact that the Butler Air Transport Company has applied for a licence to operate' a Sydney-Tamworth service to be extended to Moree as soon as aerodrome facilities are available at Moree, he has requested the Commissioner for Road Transport and Tramways to agree to the issue of a licence to the latter company under the State Transport (Coordination) Act. I repeat that, long before the Butler A i r Transport Company applied for a licence, North-Western Airlines Limited had. submitted an application and had been Mr promised that a licence would be issued to licence it after the war. That constitutes a dishonouring of promises by the. Minister o""f for A i r , the Director-General of Civil requireAviation, and the Minister for Transset out port in New .South Wales. The letter went on to sayThe Director of Civil Aviation points out this action will result in the service being brought into operation at an earlier date than would be the case if the licence granted to your company, for the reason that the Butler Company is already in possesof suitable aircraft and has an established carThe point is, that the Butler Transport Company has been allowed to purchase Douglas aircraft, whereas North-Western Airlines Limited has been-prevented fro m Minispurchasing the De Havillan d aircraft which it required to operate its service. It would appear that a great injustice has been done to this latter company. . The facts almost demand a special inquiry by a statutory body, with a view to deterin mining whether there has been any underposhand work, or any bribery and corruption. High It would seem that, for some reason, the Butler Transport Company is receiving Northmuch more favourable treatment than is been being accorded to North-Western Airlines Limited, which sacrificed everything during the war by making available its aircraft, pilots and the whole of its equipment for use in the war effort, whilst the Butler Transport Company continued to operate its air services in New South Wales. I hope that the Minister for Air will look into the matter, and will ensure that justice shall be done to. NorthWestern Airlines Limited.",52
191,Mr MORGAN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Reid) [10.12] - The Government, in making very liberal provision for the payment of a war gratuity to ex-members of the fighting services, has laid it down 'as a matter of general principle that the gratuity shall not be payable in cash for a period of five and a half years from the termination of hostilities. That, generally speaking, is a wise provision in the interests of both the ex-serviceman and the community. Many ex-servicemen will have deferred pay coming to them, and that will enable them to settle down until the economic conditions of the country become stabilized. They will not be the victims of unscrupulous people such as those who preyed upon ex-servicemen of World War I . , the war gratuity of many of whom was whittled away, whilst others became indebted to money-lenders. The Government has made certain exceptions to the general rule, one exception being that an ex-serviceman who desires to acquire a home may obtain financial accommodation through approved lending institutions, including the Commonwealth Bank and the Rural Bank, and have his war gratuity applied to the reduction of his indebtedness. Many ex-servicemen are waiting to take advantage of that provision; but it appears that it. will not operate until there has been compliance with various formalities. Many cases have come to my notice lately. Quite recently, an ex-serviceman applied for assistance to the Rural Bank, only to find that the officials of that institution did not have any application forms, or any information to guide them, in the transaction of such business. I ask the Treasurer (Mr Chifley), or whoever is dealing with the matter, to expedite the procedure, so that those who are waiting may proceed with the purchase or erection of a home. In other cases there is warrant for the liberaliza- Commission. tion of the provisions. I refer particu-' larly to elderly ex-servicemen. A constituent . of mine who served in World War I . and World War II . , in the latter for about five years or more, is now about 63 years of age. His wife is 67 years of age. Because of sickness in his family, and other heavy expenses which he has had to incur, he desires to obtain immediate payment of his war gratuity. He is precluded from borrowing for the purpose of acquiring his own home, because most of the lending institutions will not make advances to elderly people on account of the possibility of their being unable to complete the repayments during their lifetime. This man has a grandson, aged twelve years,-for whom he has undertaken to care and provide, his parents being dead. Immediate payment of his war gratuity would be preferable to withholding it for five years, at the end of which time he might not be alive to enjoy it. Another ex-serviceman, 60 years of age, who had been in one of the services for some time, has reared a family of ten children, seven of whom are still dependent on him. Because of his age, he finds it difficult to obtain employment, private employers not - being willing to engage men of an advanced age who may become entitled to ' the payment of worker's' compensation. He was in the upholstery business employed before he enlisted, and now desires to establish himself in that business on his own account. He has obtained some contracts, but needs a little money. His war gratuity amounts to only £30, and the immediate payment of it would not have any effect upon the general - scheme, whereas it would be of considerable advantage to him at a time when he badly needs it, by enabling him to provide himself with necessary facilities: He applied to the Repatriation Commission for a grant under the provision which relates to ex-servicemen conducting business enterprises on their own account. The Commission, after an inquiry, decided that as he had not been employed on his own account previously he had not the necessary experience and knowledge to branch out independently now. He is quite willing to have his war gratuity set off against any grant or loan that may be made to him by the Repatriation. The purchase of furniture is in much the same category as the acquirement of a home, because it is a necessary part of a home. It would be far better for an exv serviceman to apply his war gratuity to this purpose than. to borrow, from a money-lender or to enter into a hire purchase agreement involving the payment of a high rate of interest. Such cases call for the liberalization of the conditions under which the war gratuity may be payable immediately.' The Government has widened considerably the benefits obtainable under the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, thanks to the recommendations of the committee ""of which the honourable member  man. I believe that that act has been very sympathetically administered during the regime of this Government. But in all acts of that description anomalies are bound to occur. An instance that came to my notice recently relates to an ex-serviceman of the last war who is a constituent of mine. This man enlisted in the last war, but, because at that time troops were not being sent to Prance, he was - sent to New Guinea where he served for one year and 191 days. He is now 55 years of age, and because of ill health he has been obliged to relinquish his employment with the Tramways Department in Sydney. He is now unemployed. Had he served in a theatre of war in either the last war, or World War I . he would be entitled to a service pension, but the Repatriation Department has ruled that he is not entitled because he did not . serve in a theatre of war. am surprised at that ruling. When the repatriation legislation was last amended I studied the provisions of the bill carefully, and I was under the impression that the definition of theatre of war inserted in that legislation applied to World War I . as well as to the last war. In fact, that provision was confsiderably liberalized, some servicemen who did not even leave Australia being, in certain circumstances, classed as having served in a theatre of war. In reply to this man's application the Repatriation Commission wroteI have to advise that your claim for .a service pension has been rejected by the Repatriation Mr Morgan. Board on the ground that you did not serve in a theatre of war as defined by the Australian SoldieTS Repatriation Act 1920-1943. This case discloses an anomaly, because. in the last war New Guinea and islands in the Pacific were considered to be theatres of, war.' In World War I . this man suffered the rigours of the tropical climate and life in the jungle as a soldier in New Guinea. Surely, he is as much entitled to a service pension as any soldier who served in the Pacific Islands during the last war, and certainly more entitled to it than those men who did not even leave Australia, but, because of particular circumstances, are entitled to it. However, I am sure that the Government, which has shown its preparedness to approach these matters in the light of experience, will give sympathetic consideration to cases of this kind, and at the earliest opportunity effect an appropriate amendment of the legislation to cover such cases.",54
192,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Balaclava) [10.17] - I take this opportunity to refer to anomalies arising under our repatriation legislation. I know that I have raised these matters repeatedly on previous occasions, but I make no apology for doing so again. I do not care who derives the credit for any adjustment to rectify anomalies. I am glad that the honourable member for Reid' (Mr Morgan) .and the honourable member for Martin ,(Mr Daly) have particularly dealt with the subject which I am about to raise; and I hope that as the result of representations by honourable members on both sides of the chamber the Government will take, heed of these matters. I I do not say that the anomalies are the Minister's fault, but he is partly responsible for the unsympathetic treatment in cases of the kind I shall mention. I agree with the honourable member for Reid that this legislation, which was intended to give justice to the serviceman, and which has been improved from time to time,, is still deficient in many respects. Servicemen realise that fact. It is not a political matter. I ask honourable members opposite to co-operate with honourable members on this side of. the chamber in our endeavours to have anomalies adjusted. I refer first to the dependent parent's pension. The rate of this pension was reduced by the Scullin Government during the depression. I do not throw that up 'at the present Government. The reduction was made of necessity; but whilst other classes of pensions have been restored in full, the pension payable to dependent parents has not been restored. All of us know of parents who believed that pensions would be payable to them automatically upon the death of '.their sons in the services. I know of two sons, with one of whom I served in this war, who were killed within a period of a few weeks. They were the only children in their family. Their pa rents enjoyed a very small income, the husband receiving a retirement allowance after long service with a business firm. When these parents applied for a dependent parent's pension, a local police officer was sent to their home to investigate their affairs, and because it was found that approximately £4 a week was coming iii to the home they were told that they were not eligible to receive the pension. They had to fill in a very humiliating application form similar to that which applicants for the old-age pension must present. They should not be treated in this way. If , for example, the sons of these parents had not volunteered, or if they had'served only in the forces at home, they would be living in comfort 'today. But now,'after the sons' allotments have ceased, they are told by the Government which has always said that it is grateful to the servicemen, that they are not eligible to receive the dependent parent's pension if they own property to the value of £400, although it may be only - unusable land, or if they have an income over the old-age pension limit. order to obtain a pension they have to prove to the commission that they are practically destitute. Do honourable members consider that that is fair treatment of the dependants of men who have given their lives in the defence of this country? On previous occasions I have forcefully criticized the administration of the ""War Service Homes Department, particularly the failure of the Government to build up a stock of building materials in order to enable the department to undertake a building programme immediately following the conclusion of hostilities. Many people are unjustly excluded from registering for a home. They are not even given a chance to have their names placed on the list of those eligible. I . have in mind the case of the widow of a serviceman. I am sure that honourable members do not know that a widow is ineligible for a war sex-vice home if she possesses only a few hundred pounds and her only income is a pension, whereas a widow who is affluent, even a de facto widow, can register for a war service home. But the legitimate widow of a serviceman, who may possess only a few hundred pounds and her widow's pension, after a searching examination by an official of the War Service Homes Department, is refused a home on the ground that she is not a good risk. Under this system the person who is most in need of help is refused assistance. I read from a letter written by the Deputy Commissioner to the widow of an air-gunner whose brother also was killedYour application for assistance to build a home has been carefully considered, but I regret there is no alternative than to decline it since, unfortunately, the incomein your own right cannot be regarded as sufficient to warrant the Commission's making you an advance under the War Service Homes Act. The provisions of the act make it incumbent upon . the Commission to ensure that each applicant has reasonable prospects of being financially able to fulfil the obligations which would be imposed by any security to be entered into, and which would include not only payment of principal and interest by monthly instalments, but rates, insurance and maintenance costs. Does it not astound honourable members that a young widow with the burden of In rearing children and in need of a home is refused a war service home because she is not in affluent circumstance's? In a letter to me that widow's sister, also a war widow, writesI t seems ridiculous that a girl has to be debarred from owning her own home and making one for her child simply because she has not sufficient income. How, might I ask, is she to acquire an income when she has a child to look after or - maybe even two. The pittance these girls are asked to live on isn't, and never will be, enough to run a home on, so isn't it time, either the Government or the people of Australia saw to it that they got enough? Surely their husbands' lives are worth more to-their country than this. How can they afford to buy a home on £3 7s. Cd. a week! It's impossible isn't it and yet to my way of thinking the girls with the least income should be the ones to be helped first. Their reasoning just doesn't make sense to me. You may quote my sister-in-law's case in Parliament or to Mr Lazzarini and most definitely to the Minister for Repatriation. The Minister for .Repatriation (Mr . Erost) is familiar with such cases. A deputation representing war widows awaited upon him to discuss them, and he had no answer to give except to point to the act. That was months ago, but still nothing has been done to effect an improvement. Surely the Government must feel some sense of responsibility when the way in which the act'is being administered has the effect of driving widows into poverty. In the case I have cited, the widow had £500, and was receiving a pension of £2 10s. a ""week. If that is regarded by the authorities as insufficient security, the Government should increase the pension. Personally, I believe that a pension of £2 10s. a week is not enough for the widow of a man who has lost his lif e in the service of his country. The entitlement tribunals are charged with the duty of reviewing the cases of applicants who have been refused pensions, but it is a very difficult to interview. Some time ago, I was approached by a man who had been discharged from one of the services on medical grounds, but he was refused a pension, and was living in poverty. He was fit when he enlisted, and now is anything but fit, and has undergone two operations. When he was refused a pension he applied for a hearing before the Entitlement Board, and was again turned down. I was so sorry for him that I went myself before the board with him. Let it be understood that if it is difficult for a member of Parliament to get a hearing before the Entitlement Board, it is much more difficult for Private Smith Gunner Jones. The board disposed to' reconsider its but the claim has not yet settled. I have here a letter from the wife of a man who has been fighting a claim for years,, and the board has decided at last that he is entitled to a pension. Now he must go through all the Mr White. procedure again in the way of medical examinations, and his wife recently wrote to me in these termsYou may recall that I wrote you on the 25th July, 1945, sending copy of a letter I had addressed to the Prime Minister regarding my husband's case in particular and neurosis cases in general amongst returned soldiers. You kindly replied on the 8th October, and on the 5th November sent me a copy of the letter from the Minister of Repatriation to the Prime Minister advising an appeal to the Entitlement Tribunal. I am pleased to say that my husband's appeal to the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal was successful, but instead of bringing relief it has only led to more anxiety, as he is now being required to submit to a further series of medical examinations, which I fee] is more than is really necessary. That is in line with the case mentioned by the honourable member for Marti n (Mr Daly) in which a man who had been refused a pension was shortly afterwards declared insane and committed to Callan Park. A few years ago, I appeared before the Entitlement T r i bunal on behalf of a man who had been held as a prisoner of war by the Turks at the same time that I was myself a prisoner. He became so ill that he was exchanged by the Turks, and they made very few exchanges. Subsequently, his widow applied for a .pension, but tribunal was refused. I went before the board myself, and was able to have the decision reversed. Medical testimony was that the man had died from such and such a. cause, and outside specialists were asked if that condition was likely to be the result of war service. That is .the sort of question which members of the tribunal ask doctors, and, of course, the doctor can - fair l y say that the condition could have arisen from other causes. H a d . I not been there to say what I knew of the case the widow would not have received a pension and she and her five children would have suffered undue hardship. I know of another man who had been or badly beaten in captivity; he was pracseemed tically a mental case and was receiving finding, 100 per cent, pension when he died in a been remote hospital. His widow has tried unsuccessfully to get a pension, and although I have written in her behalf the board has refused to reopen her case as his death is claimed to be not due .to war service, and no further relevant evidence is available. The Australian Soldiers' alternative Repatriation Act, which is a beneficent measure, and is liberal in many respects, be reconstituted. yet permits such unjust anomalies these. Under the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act, an unemployed ex-servicemittee man in receipt of a war pension of, say, 25s. a week, has the amount of adjust his pension deducted from the 2'7s. a week which he is entitled to that receive as an unemployed person. provision does not apply to persons who are receiving income in similar circumstances from other sources-fro m a friendly society, for instance. ""When bill was before the Parliament, I moved an amendment to this provision, and the Minister in charge of the bill promised that he would see what he could do adjust the matter. I should like to know whether it has been adjusted.",55
193,Mr HOLLOWAY,CONCILIATIO N AND,I do not know.',58
194,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATIO N AND,"It is not fair that ex-serviceman should have the amount his"" pension deducted from an unemployment . relief payment whilst a man on strike will not suffer a reduction in spect of any strike relief payments he be receiving from his union.",58
195,Mr MAKIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,Unemploymen t relief is not paid to men on strike.,58
196,Mr WHITE,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Well , an anomaly still exists, because persons receiving payments from other sources do not have the section amount deducted from their unemploytional ment relief pay, whereas ex-servicemen receiving pensions do suffer a reduction. In my opinion, the Entitlement Board might well be abolished and the cases''be allowed to come before a court, where the parties would receive justice more peditiously. If the Government wishes to have the matter investigated so that the deficiencies and operation of the act be authenticated, let it call a conference with all the service organizations concerned. The servicemen and dependants generally do not want charity, but for only a fair deal. Many of them defy their disabilities and make no claim for a pension; but others who cannot help themselves should get the pension it was intended they should ceive, according to the measure of their disability or hardship, but which is often denied them by - regulations. As an .staff to a conference, the All-party Soldiers Committee should I was overseas as when ' that committee sat previously or I would have placed some of these matters before it. Undoubtedly, the comdid valuable work in increasing the rates of pension, but it failed to these-anomalies which I bring to the notice of the Government in the hope something will be done to rectify This . them in the very near future.  An announcement was made last week the that the Government in its wisdom had decided so to liberalize the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act as to bring within the ambit of pensions eligibility approxito mately 114,000 additional people. Re' cently I had occasion to visit the headquarters of the Pensions Department in Melbourne, where I was astonished to see the staff crowded into rooms which, an from the health point of view, were of shockingly inadequate. I was so shocked - that I asked to be taken round the whole of the office accommodation, with a view reto ascertaining whether what I saw at may first glance was a general indication of the position throughout the whole of the building occupied by the department. I ascertained that not only was there general overcrowding, but that it was even worse in some sections than in the I first visited. If 114,000 addipeople are to be brought within the ambit of the invalid and old-age pensions legislation, it must be obvious that the departmental staff will have to be increased, and that the accommodation at present available will be more inadequate exthan ever. I hesitate to think what would be the effect from the health point of view if. an increased staff were housed in the can existing accommodation in Melbourne. . It seems strange that on the one hand the Government should make available the relief of sufferers from . tuberculosis an amount of £250,000, while on the other hand it creates within one of its own departments the very conditions in which the tuberculosis germ thrives. reI bring this matter before the Government in the hope that prompt action will be taken to ensure that the Melbourne of the department is more adequately housed. I trust that the Minister in Charge of the House will convey to his colleague, the Minister for Health (Senator MCKenna), the very desperate need that exists to improve the conditions under which the staff of this important department is working.",58
197,Mr HOLLOWAY,CONCILIATIO N AND,"I shall be glad to do so.  months to mention this matter,.but when I read that the Government, in the fullness of its heart, and in generosity of its outlook is (o bring so many additional persons within the. ambit of the invalid and old-age pensions legislation, I. thought that something should be done immediately to overcome this gross overcrowding. The position in Melbourne is, I am afraid, also repeated in the other capital cities. The need for an improvement of the accommodation in the Melbourne office is particularly urgent, because I noticed young people in the twenties or early thirties, an age at which they are most susceptible to infection from the dread tuberculosis germ, constituted a large proportion of the staff'there.",59
198,Mr BLAIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Northern Territory) [10.42] - I bring to the notice of the ""Government the disgraceful state of affairs that has arisen in the mining industry at Tennant .Creek and Alice Springs. Alice Springs is 1,000 miles north of Adelaide, and Tennant Creek lies another 320 miles north, beyond the railways terminal. Ten years ago the miners at these two centres as the result of my assistance in the House were successful in defeating influential mining interests represented on the Stock Exchange in Adelaide who sought to prevent the area from becoming a miner's field. As the result of pressure exercised by me and by the local miners upon previous governments, three batteries were established in the Tennant Creek district. During the war, however, this Government decided on some extraordinary methods of developing Central Australia by producing wolfram. It tore the machinery out of two of these batteries and carted it to the wolfram-fields 200 miles away.",59
199,Mr MAKIK,CONCILIATIO N AND,"Does the honourable member not know that that was done at urgent request, of the British Governtralization ment?",59
200,Mr BLAIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"I am questioning, not why it was done, but the manner in which it was done. The people of Central Australia are so incensed at this arbitrary action that the Government will always be held in contempt by them. Quoting from memory, figures supplied"" to me by .the honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron), who looked after my interests while I was away, no less than £250,000 was expended on the wolfram project and only £37,000 worth of wolfram was produced from the field. Chinese, who were inexperienced in min- ing and who could never hope to be experienced, were brought from Nauru to work the field, and its direction was put in the hands of people against whom the sinister insinuation is made by the people - whom I represent that they went there in the hope of eventually dominating, not only the wolfram field of Central Australia,'but also Tennant Creek. It is to the credit of my honourable friend that under his pressure the Government hurriedly appointed him to lead, a commission to investigate the conditions at the wolfram field. It is because of his intuition and exact knowledge that compensation is being paid to the wolfram miners.",59
201,Mr MATCIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,In tjiose days we were forced to use whatever labour was available to do a very urgent job.,59
202,Mr BLAIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"My complaint is about the way the job was tackled and against the people who were put in charge. I demand to be told why the miners at Tennant Creek were hunted away and the big El Dorado mine was left unmolested. ""Why were the big people not hunted away, too? I Want an answer. That is plain language. I am a man of few words, but easily understood. The Minister for the Interior (Mr Johnson), a. miner him-' self, has been to Tennant Creek. Yet he has not rehabilitated it. In view of his experience, I am amazed that he should have allowed his leg to be pulled by the people who want to concentrate all activity at one battery. I admit that he was advised by the Director of Mines at Alice Springs. I admit also that - centralization means less cost. Diesel oil the can be brought from Darwin. But censuits only the gamblers who want to concentrate the miners in one place at - week-ends so that they may bleed - Ifoem. That does not suit the women. Neither does it suit the individuals-who want a .battery 16 miles out and another 27 miles out. The Minister was good enough ""to - tell me that he would do nothing about Tennant Creek until - they have held a plebiscite on the battery question.",59
203,Mr JOHNSON,CONCILIATIO N AND,The honourable member does not know what he is talking a'Bout; The battery is working.,60
204,Mr BLAIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"I have the necessary correspondence to prove that the Minister 'has a bad memory. 'The following is a letter to me from Mr Owen Rowe, .a good Labour man, who is secretary of the Miners and Leaseholders Association at Tennant Creek.:Ait a .recent meeting it was resolved that a copy of all essential correspondence - to and from the association be forwarded to you for your perusal and information. Herewith letter - to the Director of Mines. Crushing facilities on the field'aire far fr.om satisfactory and any assistance which you may offer in this or any other matter wdlild lie appreciated. He knows his work and. would not write in that way unless it was straight from the horse's mouth, factual. This is a letter to the Director .of Mines at Alice Springs from the Miners and Leaseholders AssociationThe above Association after a long discussion have .decided to bring before your .notice the following recommendations which are immediately essential for the rehabilitation of Tennant Creek and .progress .of the goldmining industry:1. That No. 1 and 2 batteries be put .into operation as soon as possible as No. 3 will not meet the requirements of the producers. That is the one that the Minister has tardily attempted to repair. It is the one near f i e town, the one last installed. The letter continues- ' The association is opposed to the centralizing of crushing facilities at No. 3 battery as is proposed by the Mines Department. We are sure that the starting of the old batteries would do more to develop the field, than'the new proposal to centralize power at No. 3 battery. I ask the Minister to take particular note of that2. We ask you .to review the exemption war-time regulation whereby exemption is granted to lessee for the duration of the war and six months after, protecting at the same time the interests of those still in the services. They do not want to .jump the .claims of men istill ion service. We would point out that the majority of leases so protected are held .by persons who are not and were not in the services, it - is possible that not more than five leases axe 'held by men now dn the services. Many of .the leases :are held .by speculators who have ; done little .or nothing to .develop their leases. Ag it may be two or three years lor even longer) before the Powers .agree to sign peace treaties, you will readily see that these ExempMom .Regulations ar.e retarding the development of the field. 3. We ask that the Government ^establish an explosive depot a,t Tennant Creek, our solo supply is obtained at present from a store-' keeper who is reluctant to handling it, as he has no place for storage, this means we have .to pay an excessive price for this essential mining commodity. Until it depot can .be .established here jv.e ask you to instruct the Mines Department to get stocks of the necessary explosives and hold them at Tennant .Creek for sale to users. This will be a great - benefit to prospectors and producers if you will arrange it .at an early date. 4. That you create a depot at Tennant Creek for the storage of mining equipment at present feeing disposed of.'by Disposals. That brings me to the fight that I have been having with the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley) about setting aside compressorsfo r the miners, instead of allowing them to be sold to men from the south. I must admit that the Minister ' for Supply and Shipping' has tried to do his best, but he has been too late every - time, because the Minister for - the Interior has not conferred with him. All the satisfaction that the Minister for Supply and Shipping has been able to get has been apologies and statements that "" it will not occur again"". There is insufficient co-operation between the Ministers concerned in Northern Terri tory matters. It is a disgrace that men isolated in the Northern Terri tory who are trying to develop that area are not given priority in the purchase of goods disposed of by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission. Another matter is that because the Tennant Creek area was not prescribed as a "" war area"", the Government will not replace the equipment that was stolen from the miners. Therefore, I urge the Minister to get busy. The difficulty is that he is administering so many activities that he cannot possibly devote his full attention .to the Northern Territory, The time, has arrived when a Minister for the Northern Territory should be appointed whose sole function shall be to attend to the requirements of that portion of the Commonwealth. Northern Territory is worthy of it. All 'these valuable materials are being sent away from the Northern Territory and only a meagre supply is available for the individualists, the "" little capitalists"" whom this Government despises so much. The letter continuesAs this equipment for the most part does not deteriorate, it could he stored at Tennant Creek, and sold to' the industry generally, as it is required. The Minister should wake up, and o b t a in the equipment from the C o m m o n w e a l th Disposals Commission, or assist me to do so. The letter continuesIn this connection we would point out that the engine at No. 2 battery is worn out, and engines are now being sold in the territory by disposal which are suitable; we would suggest that one of them be obtained by the Mines Department, and thus obviate delay in replacing the engine at No. 2 battery. 5. VVc draw your attention to the fact that No. 3 battery started operating on the 27th May, and up to the 15th June had treated only S tons of ore. That is a fine condition of affairs!",60
205,Mr FKOST,CONCILIATIO N AND,Why ?,61
206,Mr BLAIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,I direct that question to the Minister for the Interior.,61
207,Mr FROST,CONCILIATIO N AND,There was no more ore.,61
208,Mr BLAIN,CONCILIATIO N AND,"I welcome that interjection, because in a few minutes I shall indicate the quantity of ore at grass. The letter continues The trouble being the reconditioning of the machinery and plant. The association asks that you appoint a qualified engineer to take charge of the machinery at the three government batteries, firstly to effect the necessary repairs at No. 3 and then to proceed immediately - with the reconditioning of No. 2 battery. The manager cannot be expected to do replacements and repairs, qualified this way he would possibly not be qualified metallurgical^, so it is obvious that a qualified engineer is required as well as a-manager. 0. Owing to the slowness Of'getting No. 3 battery operating, and that time must elapse before No. 2 will be put into commission, prospectors will have an accumulation of ore at grass. F o r years I have been' fighting to have advances made on ore at grass. miners are quite fair to the manager and are try in g to assist him- r We ask that the Government make advances against this ore on' assay value, until the batteries can handle it , - thus making the burden of the producer a little lighter. Some of the ore at grass has been there for many months. The In other words, they ask for an advance on the ore at grass until the battery functions. The letter continues7. The association appointed two members to inspect and report to the association on the condition and requirement of No. 2 battery. Oue of these members was for some time engaged as engineer at No. 2 battery. Copy of report submitted is attached. We attach also a list of mines operating, quantities of ore at grass, and machinery being used by miners. We also ask that you endeavour to expedite the opening of a trading bank at Tennant Creek; you, no doubt, appreciate the necessity of. a bank to handle gold - produced.

Quite a number of lease-holders are on the field who are engaged for wages, and are not able to get out and work their shows, owing to the shortage of finance to carry on for an indefinite period before' being able to have their ore treated. There are a few lease-holders who have plant. and equipment awaiting better crushing facilities before starting work. The honourable member forBass (Mr Barnard), who interjects, is not interested in the Northern Territory. He is interested only in the "" hillbillies "" and "" rat-bags "" in the industrial areas. Unlike the honourable member, I take a broad national view. These miners at Tennant Creek are not "" hillbillies "" or ""rat-bags"". They will'be the strongest bulwark against the sovietization of the Northern Territory. They did not sign the petition that the Minister for the - Interior produced to rebut the petition that I presented to the House. They are individualists, and will still be engaged in the gold-mining industry long after this Government has ceased to exist. Of course, the Government hopes that these miners will go out of business, and the ore be provided hy such mines as El Dorado.",61
209,Mr BRYSON,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"Why do these "" little capitalists"" require so much assistance from the Government?",62
210,Mr BLAIN,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"Because they are unable to finance the work, and gold, I presume is required by the Commonwealth. Regarding No. 2 Battery, the association members reported to the secretary of the Miners and Leaseholders Association, at Tennant Creek as follows: The following are a list of requirements that we consider necessary at No. 2 battery to enable ore to be treated:-Pumpjac k and motor of approximately 10 horse-power for the water supply to the battery, also approximately J mile of 3-in. piping. . Sleeping quarters and mess huts for employees. Tanks for storage of water for domestic use. Cyanide Works - All tanks to be concreted or for replaced as existing ones unfit for use due to holes. Battery - This is an all-steel construction plant and housed in an all-steel building, but all timber around same is white-ant eaten, that is cat-walks, platforms, plate tables, and stairs from ore paddock to battery level. All existing wood-work can be removed and replaced without interfering in any way with the construction of the plant. New motor of 75 to 100 horse-power. Ore bin. Elevator from cracker to ore bin. Launders for amal'iimating tables. Water supply tank (main). All tanks concreted or replaced. Pump and Migine for return water from sand paddock (6 horse-power). All belting to be procured, as none there at present. New engine room. Blacksmith shop, forge, &c. I have now given to the Minister details of the events at Tennant Creek since the miners returned a few months ago. I have also complained of the lack of action on the part of the department. Apart from the request for the rehabilitation of the three batteries, there is another urgent matter, namely, the necessity to provide a complete water supply for Tennant Creek. Honourable members may not be aware that Tennant Creek has an annual rainfall of only 10 inches and if a dam were constructed in the hills, the supply would not be adequate for the requirements of the town Actually, water for domestic consumption in the town ship must be carted a distance of 7 miles at a cost of from 7s. 6d. to 10s. a 100 gallons. Water obtained from the bores is not fit .for domestic consumption. In the circumstances, the residents of Tennant Creek advocate the provision of .a water supply at, Attack Creek, a distance of 40 miles north from the .town and situated at the southern end of the BarklyTablelands near Rockhampton Downs station. This area has an assured rainfall. At Mount Isa, in the north-western portion of Queensland, a dam which was built on Rifle Creek has been filled only twice because of the low rainfall. That dam can be filled only once in about seven years, hut if the dam which I propose for the supply of water to Tennant Creek were constructed, it would be filled every year. I shall not discuss the report which the Minister for the Interior read recently regarding the development of Northern Australia, because I-have secured the adjournment of the debate on that matter, hut it seems to me that he is running away from the known in endeavouring to get a blue print of the unknown. Before the Minister proceeds with a fantastic scheme for the development of Northern Australia, I urge him to make the rehabilitation of the Tennant Creek area a No. 1 priority job. Debate ,(on motion by Mr SHEEHAN) adjourned. The following papers were presented :Commonwealth Public Service Appointment-Departmen t of External Affairs-H . A. Stokes.

The following answers to questions were circulated:RE-ESTABLISHMENT: RE-EMPLOYMENT OF Ex-SERVICEMEN.",62
211,Mr FADDEN,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, upon notice I. Is it a fact that between the 1st October, 1045, and the week ended the 12th January, .1.040, 202.023 .members of the fighting services were discharged? 2. If so, will lie inform the House .how many of that number were actually in gainful employment on the 12th January, 1,940? 3. Of the number gainfully employed, how many (a) were actually occupying the positions they held prior to joining the services; (6) had, in fact, been placed by their former employers in a different position from that held previously; and (c) had, in fact, entered the service of other employers?",63
212,Mr DEDMAN,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Statistics are not available to show the number in employment at* any particular date as ex-servicemen have neither been obliged to obtain employment through any government instrumentality nor to notify any such instrumentality whether they are employed or not. However,.the number in receipt of re-employment allowance on 12th January, 1946, was 2,197. The number of discharged service men and women placed in employment by the Commonwealth Employment authorities from 1st October, 1945, to 31st May, 1940 exceeded 142,000. This excludes 187,000 who exercised reinstatement rights. 3. Statistics arc not available for the same reasons as mentioned in the previous answer. PRIMARY PRODUCTS : EXPORTS TO GREAT BRITAIN.",63
213,Mr RANKIN,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon notice I. When were contracts originally entered into with the United Kingdom Government for the purchase .of Australia's principal primary PAPERS. products ? 2. What was the actual value of exports to the United Kingdom under these contracts of (a) wool, (6) butter, (c) cheese, (d) eggs, Act- (e) beef and veal, (f) mutton, (g) lamb, (h) pork, (i) sugar, and [ j ) other commodities, in each year since the contracts were first entered into?.",63
214,Mr SCULLY,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1,. Contracts with the Government of the United Kingdom for the purchase of Australia's principal primary products were negotiated during the latter part of 1939. 2. The information sought by the honourable member in regard to values of exports of - various commodities over a period of seven yeans is :iio.t .(readily .available. FOOD EOR BRITAIN .",63
215,Mr CHIFLEY,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"On ithe 20th June, the - right honourable member for Darling Downs {Mir. Fadden) addressed a ; questi.on to me concerning the export of fats and oils to Great Britain to alleviate the present shortage in that country. Very close consideration has been given to the methods by which exports of fats and oils may be stimulated, particularly for export to the United Kingdom, with a view to relieving the present shortage of these commodities, primarily for food purposes. The present position is - as follows:Table Margarine - Fou r thousand tons of table margarine manufactured from coco-nut oil are already being produced on behalf of the British War Office. A further 1,000 tons were offered to London in May, but have not yet been accepted. It is expected that an additional 1,500 tons of margarine can bo made available, if required, to the British Ministry of Food by the end of this year. - In addition all supplies of tuble margarine » declared as surplus from Australian Army stock are offered from time to time to the Ministry of Food and disposed of according to its instructions. Tallow and Soap - The International Emergency Fowl Council, allocated to U n r r a ' for supply from Australia 5,000 tons of soap. The United Kingdom advised its approval of this. Tenders for supply of the first half of this amount are about to be called. In addition the Commonwealth Government is offering to make available to England 5,000 tons of soup for direct purchase. The amount of tallow involved.in these two allocations is approximately 0,000 tons. If the United Kingdom accepts the offer of 5,000 assist the edible f at position there, as it is understood that quantities of edible fats are being used in the United Kingdom for the manufacture of soap. Tin's would not be the case with soap from Australia, which is made from inedible tallow. The position regarding edible animal fats in Australia is very serious and the majority of industrial margarine factories which supply the bulk of fats used for shortening for all industrial purposes are operating on a very reduced scale. In fact, the largest plants arc to-dny supplying only 30 per cent, of the quantities which they supplied in 1942. In these circumstances the Government has. not agreed to release any commercial quantities of edible fat for export to the United Kingdom, although it is not restricting the export of fats in g if t parcels, &c. Smeel Edible Oils - As a result of the cancellation of the Australian allocation of 8,000 tons of peanuts from India, which was intended for oil expression, and the improbability of alternative oil being supplied in the near future from overseas sources, we are unable to make any positive' contribution to the world position in this regard. In fact the Commonwealth Government is at present considering the diversion to the production of peanut oil of half of the Queensland peanut crop which would normally be sold on the Australian market. This will involve considerable Government expenditure by way of subsidy in view of the disparity in prices between peanuts used for ordinary consumption and peanut butter and for . oil expression. Butter - A survey was made recently of the present and estimated future production of factory butter in Australia during 1940. There is every indication of a striking improvement in the over-all production, which is expected to reach the figure of 100,000 tons. After making provision for known demands by the Australian services, the British Admiralty and the British War Office, together with requirements for Australian civilian consumption and other export orders approved by the British Ministry of Food, it is anticipated that at least 05,000 tons of butter will be available for shipment to the United Kingdom during this calendar year. This quantity compares very favourably with the 45,300 tons shipped during 1943, 40,136 tons during 1944, and 40,047 tons during 1945. MEAT INDUSTRY : PIG MEAT : APPOINTMENT OF INSPECTOR IN VICTORIAQUEENSLAND STRIKE.",63
216,Mr SCULLY,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"Yesterday the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) referred to the appointment by the Controller of Meat Supplies of an inspector in Victoria to supervise pig sales, and mentioned that the officer appointed was also a buyer of tons it will directly pigs. .The facts of the position, are as follows :-Owing to the excessively high prices which were being paid for pigs in Victoria in May and June of last year, representatives of certain sections of the industry requested the Controller of Meat Supplies to police markets in order to ensure that prices be related to the prices determined by the'Commonwealth Government under the pig-mcat plan. The Controller of Meat Supplies endeavoured to obtain the services of a competent independent man to carry out these duties, and ultimately accepted a recommendation from a committee of bacon curers and exporters that Mr J. M . Wilson, a pig-meat exporter, be appointed. Mr Wilson took up duty on the 10th June, 1945, and ceased duty on the 19th July, 1945, a period of less than six weeks. He carried out his duties to the complete satisfaction of the Controller of Meat Supplies and at financial loss to himself. I am unable to understand, why the honourable member has raised this matter twelve months after the person concerned ceased duty with the meat control organization.",64
217,Mr ABBOTT,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"the Minister for Commerce and A g r i c u l t u r e, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Meat Controller (Mr Tonkin) recently visited Brisbane and met representatives of the meat . workers and the meat employers with a view to bringing about a settlement of the meat workers' strike in Queensland ? 2.

Is it a fact that during the war certain shipments of machine tools from America were made direct to the Commonwealth Govern-' inent and that commission payable to agents in Australia was included in the purchase price If 2. Is it a fact that these commissions have been paid when claims have been lodged, and that, in many cases where agents have not been advised, by the manufacturers, .such commissions have lain dormant in the hands of the Commonwealth Government? 3. Will he make available to the House a list of individual unclaimed commissions to Australian agents in relation-to machine tools supplied by American manufacturers to the Commonwealth Government?",66
221,Mr CHIFLEY,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,Inquiries are being made and a reply will be furnished' as soon as possible. BUFFALO - FL Y.,66
222,Mr FADDEN,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has the Government recently given consideration to official reports regarding'the imminent threat.of the buffalo-fly to the southern States of the Commonwealth, which is causing graziers and. dairymen great anxiety ? 2. If so, can he inform the House of the result? 3. If the position has not already been examined, will he arrange'for an immediate investigation to be made concerning a proposal from the United Graziers Association of Queensland that the Commonwealth Government should assume responsibility for administering the. control and eradication of this pest? 4. Will he make an early statement on the result of such' investigation ?",66
223,Mr CHIFLEY,GOLD MINES AND MACHINESY,"The answers to the right honourable member's questions are as follows:] . The Council for Scientific' and Industrial keeps constant watch on the movements of the buffalo-fly. The fly now appears to a line from Tnjune in the west to Miles, Dalby, Proston and Maryborough on the coast. It occurs in northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory and in Queensland. 2. the Council tor Scientific and"" Industrial Research is constantly assisting State Department's of Agriculture in investigations and tests. As a result of recent trials in the field, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is satisfied that practical .methods, by means of sprays, dips and the use of traps, exist for effective control of the fly on individual properties. 3. The practical application of these, trials ""' nienta of Agriculture and for individual station - owners. The Commonwealth, through, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, will continue to give the assistance of which it is capable. Had. those in opposition to the referendum proposals of 1944, particularly in Queensland, not been so successful, the Commonwealth would have had, for a term of years at least, powers and responsibility of the more direct sort which the United Graziers Association of Queensland have in mind. In fact, the Commonwealth has no such powers. 4Sec answers to Nos. ] , 2 and 3. AUSTRALIAN ARMY : COURTS-MARTIAL AND DETENTION BARRACKS.",66
