2,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State South Australia draws to the attention of the House our strongest objection to any attempt to alter Australia's existing national flag without seeking prior approval from the AustralillIi people by way of referendum. The Australian National Flag has been the symbol of the Australian nation and of our national unity for over eighty years. Throughout history men and women have expressed their feeEngs for their country by showing honour and respect for their country's national flag. This flag must remain our emblem as a tribute to those who laid down their lives for our freedom. Your petitioners therefore respectfully ask the House of Representatives to preserve our current Australian national flag as a symbol of our pride and identity. by Mr Andrew (from 55 citizens), Mr Downer (from 334 citizens) and Mr MCLachlan (from 18 citizens). Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws attention of the House to the following issues: 1. The Australian and Dverseas Telecommunications Corporation (A.D. T.C.) is retreating to ""core business"" when a majority of its Business Units are profitable and providing cost efficient, timely and competitive services. 2. In the current economic situation with extremely high unemployment A.D.T.C. is actively involved in planning further unnecessary job losses through voluntary and involuntary redundancies. 3. A.D.T.C. assets are being auctioned at a time when the markets are at their lowest point for a decade. 4. No real savings or benefits have yet been provided to justify current action being undertaken by A.D.T.C. Senior Management. Your petitioners therefore request the House to seek answers to the above points from A.D.T.C. Senior Management/Board of Directors. by Mr O'Keefe (from 36 citizens) and Mr Wright (from 30 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. of The Humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully l1howeth: that every abortion kills a baby that in 1989/90 alone the Federal Government paid for 69,587 abortions through Medicare that to pay for the killing of unborn children is to endorse each such act of killing that the protection of human life is the first duty of parliament and government Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will act to protect the right to life of unborn babies in Australia by passing the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill and in any other way possible. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. . national by Mr Andrew (from 562 citizens). Medicare: Abortions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights. That the Government's first duty is to protect this right to life. That the most defenceless and threatened lives are those of unborn babies for whom the Government is duty bound to take extra steps to protect. That in 1987/88 taxpayers funds through Medicare provided medical benefits for 61,879 abortions totalling $6.4 million. That in the same year Commonwealth grants to the States indirectly financed the deliberate killing of thousands of other unborn babies in State Public Hospitals. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament carry out its duty to protect the right to life of Australian babies by ceasing to fund abortions through Medicare, restricting grants to the States and by all other means at its disposal. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Andrew (from 53 citizens). Pay TV 'X' and 'R' Programs To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws to the attention of the House their strong objection to the inclusion of 'X' and 'R' programs on Pay TV. Your petitioners therefore pray that the .House not allow this kind of material on Pay TV. by Mr Andrews (from 92 citizens). United Nations Convention on the Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: (1) (a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgement by parents as to what is in the best interests of their children, (b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements. (2) creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding mentioned as valuable in the preamble). (3) will produce closer monitoring by Government agencies of relationships between parents and children. Your Petitioners therefore pray that: (1) By Act, Parliament ensure that all international treaties (excluding national security) are debated by the Parliament. (2) The Parliament take action to have the Convention amended in order to pay the highest regard to the importance of the family unit, and to the rights and responsibilities of parents. by Mr Cadman (from 19 citizens). Human Rights: Syria To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows: WHEREAS: A. The Syrian Government has adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is signatory to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. and the International Covenant on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination; B. In violation of Universal Declaration of Human Rights Articles 2 (Freedom of Religion), 13 (Right to Leave) and 14 (Freedom to Emigrate), the Syrian Government oppresses and discriminates against certain of its citizens on account of their religion and/or ethnic identity and prohibits them from emigrating; C. In further violations of its international obligations, the Syrian government punishes those of its citizens who attempt to exercise their internationally recognised rightÂ· of of the Child emigrations and arbitrary imprisonment without charge or trial and with beatings and torture of the most cruel and barbaric kind; and D. As a consequence of these repeated and grievous violations of international law, the Syrian Government has been censured by the European Parliament and the governments of a number of democratic nations. Your petitioners therefore pray that the Australian Parliament resolve to: I. Condemn the Government of the Arab Republic of Syria for: 1. Its denial of fundamental rights including the right of all its citizens the right to life liberty and the security of the individual: protection against arbitrary arrest and detention; the right of an accused person to a fair public trial before a jury of his or her peers; the right of free expression, assembly and association. 2. Its use of the police, law courts and other state organs to carry out arbitrary arrests, detention, beatings and torture in respect of certain of its citizens and otherwise to exact arbitrary penalties against such citizens solely on the basis of race, religion, sex, national or ethnic origin or political belief. 3. Its use of government-controlled communications media to incite hatred and prejudice against its Jewish and other minorities. ""II. RAISE the foregoing matters for public discussion in the United Nations and other international forums with a view to imposing economic sanctions upon Syria until the aforementioned abuses cease. III. ENCOURAGE AND ASSIST inter-government bodies, non-government human rights organisations and International Jurists to bring political and public pressure to bear on the Syrian Government to honour its international commitments to respect the human rights of all its citizens. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Dobie (from one citizen). Child-care Relief To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members of the House assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully requests: That no changes be made to the administration of child care fee relief and operational subsidy in Long Day Care and Family Day Care until a full and public evaluation has been held. That fee relief for Outside School Hours Care, Vacation Care and Occasional Care be brought into line with that of Long Day Care. That the inequity of gap feesbe addressed as soon as possible by increasing the fee relief ceiling without compromising the operational subsidy. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives should initiate a public inquiry which will report to Minister Staples by 31 December 1992. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Kerr (from 185 citizens). Cambodian Refugees To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament, the petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: That as Australians we draw to the attention of the House the denial of refugee status and the impending forced repatriation of Cambodian refugees currently held at the Villawood and-ort Hedland detention centres. We respectfully remind the members that many of these Cambodians have been incarcerated for two years. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will immediately release and grant refugee status or permanent residence to all of these people and also assist those held in Port Hedland to the destination of their choice within Australia. And your petitioners in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Mack (from 1,437 citizens). Refugees: Villawood and Port Hedland To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the denial of refugee status and the impending forced repatriation of Cambodian refugees currently held at the Villawood and Port Hedland detention centres. We remind the members that some of these Cambodians have been incarcerated for up to two years. Your petitioners therefore request the House to immediately release and grant refugee status to all of these people, also assisting those held in Port Hedland to the destination of their choice. by Mr Mack (from 135 citizens). Pornography: Freedom of Choice The Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives Assembled in Parliament, Local Council and all advertising Agents and Businesses promoting the open display of PORNOGRAPHIC and/or sexually violent or adult only material. We the undersigned strongly oppose the public advertising of the above mentioned material. We believe this material contributes to the breakdown of family values, and therefore theÂ· family unit, having an extremely harmful, compounding effect on society as a whole, particularly in respect to children and their understanding of a loving, stable relationship. We are also deeply concerned with the possible relationship of 'this material in desensitising and influencing sexual attack and child abuse, as in many court cases it has been most prominent in the background of offenders. Inspector Vicki Fraser, Child Molestation Unit says: ""Over 98 per cent of the cases of child sexual abuse that we deal with involve pornography. We STRONGLY URGE that all shops or businesses promoting such material AT LEAST place this material into ADULT ONLY areasgiving FREEDOM OF CHOICE for the Family Shopper and PROTECTION against any visual impact it may have on children. We also request that all elected Government Representatives do all within their power to support the above. YOU THE PUBLIC-please join the growing number of individuals, families and groups that are expressing their care and concern in this area. by Mr Nehl (from 35 citizens), Unemployment: Call for Election To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Bendigo draws to the attention of the House the significant level of unemployment in Australia, and its effect on the well being of the community and the Country. We particularly draw to your attention the increase in the level of unemployment during the past 12 months, which has jumped from 8.1 per cent to 10.6 per cent, and is expected to rise further. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should request the Australian Government to: Immediately call on the Governor General to issue the writs for a general election to provide an opportunity for all Australians to decide upon the economic direction of the Nation. by Mr Reid (from 17 citizens). Transportation of Chemicals To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: Petition of unsigned electors of Corangamite Corio and Lalor. Your petitioners humbly showeth: That the proposal to locate a major chemical facility at Point Wilson poses a threat to areas reserved for Conservation that are subject to international treaties. That the transport of chemicals for over 50km is not safe and could pose a serious threat to other motorists and the residents of Werribee. That no proper environmental study of the site or public consultation preceded the selection of the site. Your petitioners therefore request that the House of Representatives satisfy itself that the treaty obligations of Australia are properly complied with, and that the concerns of the people of the area are fully examined. by Mr Scholes (from four citizens). ABC Television: Investigation By Ombudsman To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled: We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, are deeply concerned by the continued political biases and deplorable disregard for common decency displayed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Further, we are alarmed that the Corporation is able to conduct itself in this manner without accountability to an independent authority. We believe that it is totally unacceptable that a publicly funded body can undertake any action it chooses, free from public complaint and scrutiny. Your petitioners therefore pray that the members of the House of Representatives will act to empower the Commonwealth Ombudsman-either of his own intention or in response to a complaint from a member, or members, of the public-to investigate any action that relates to a programming decis!on of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. by Mr Shack (from 17 citizens). SBS Television: Sunshine Coast To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of citizens of the Sunshine Coast, electors of the Division of Fairfax, draws to the attention of the House the lack of accesS' to the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS-Channel 28) by Sunshine Coast residents. As Australian taxpayers contributing to the funding of SBS, we believe it our democratic right to have access to SBS. ' Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled establish local transmission facilities to receive and locally transmit the Special Broadcasting Service (SBSChannel 28) to the Sunshine Coast Region. by Mr Somlyay (from 49 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives iIi. Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: (1) They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag. (2) They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian crosses, represents the nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901. ' (3) They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. (4) They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. (5) They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will: Propose and pass a motion that ""the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a referendum"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Webster (from 34 citizens). Petitions received. NA Referral of Petition to Committee",10
3,Mr SCHOLES,TRANSPORTATION OF CHEMICALS,"In accordance with standing order 130, I move: That the petition relating to the proposal for a major chemical facility at Point Wilson, Victoria, which was lodged by me today, be referred to the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade",14
4,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the report of the Committee entitled Report on the Visit of the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to Exercise Kangaroo 92, 19-21 March 1992. It gives me great pleasure to present this report. At the invitation of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) the Defence Subcommittee visited Exercise Kangaroo 92 for the period 19 to 21 March 1992. The objectives of Exercise Kangaroo 92 and the conduct of the exercise were communicated to members of the Subcommittee at an initial exercise concept briefing in Darwin. The Subcommittee was then provided with opportunities to visit Headquarters Northern Command, including the Joint Operation Centre and the land, air and maritime component operations rooms, the Special Air Service Squadron, 1 Media Support Unit and 1 Logistics Support Group. The Subcommittee was flown by Caribou aircraft to Timber Creek, where 2 Cavalry Regiment was deployed, and to RAAF Base Tindal to observe the activities of 1 Field Hospital Unit. At Tindal we were also briefed on the 3rd Royal Australian Regiment Parachute Battalion Group and the role of No. 75 Squadron in Exercise Kangaroo 92. The visit, though brief, impressed upon the Subcommittee some of the fundamental difficulties faced by the Australian Defence Force in operations in the north. Temperatures were high and conditions humid throughout our visit. I note the comments of the Chief of the Defence Force on the lessons learnt from the exercise. These include the need for Australian Defence Force personnel to be better acclimatised, although of the 12,000 troops deployed in the exercise less than one per cent were treated for heat stress. Nonetheless, during our inspection of the vehicles and equipment of 26 Transport Squadron and 30 Terminal Squadron, we were told that drivers had had to endure temperatures of up to 58 degrees Celsius in the cabins of vehicles. Conditions inside the tanks and armoured vehicles of 2 Cavalry Regiment were no more comfortable. The nature of the terrain in which members of our Defence Force have to operate was again brought home to the Subcommittee during the visit to Timber Creek. As you are aware, Mr Speaker, the Subcommittee has recently focused its attention on the north through its inspections of northern defence units and establishments in August and October last year. Members appreciate not only the enormity of northern Australia but also the wide variety of terrain in which the Australian Defence Force will increasingly need to operate as significant elements of the Australian Defence Force are relocated to the north. Members therefore understand the difficulties encountered in moving troops and supplies in such conditions and we endorse the remarks of the Chief of the Defence Force on the need for Chinook helicopters to carry fuel and troops. The visit to Kangaroo 92 served to make the Subcommittee aware of several limitations which had to be taken into consideration by the Australian Defence Force in the organisation of the exercise. We were told, for example, that the operations of the Logistics Support Group were affected by State regulations pertaining to the transfer of fresh food, particularly fruit and vegetables, across State boundaries. Consideration also has to be given by the Australian Defence Force to national parks and Aboriginal sacred sites. With respect to areas in which Aboriginal sacred sited exist, the Subcommittee was told that there is no universal approach by land councils to restricting military ac.cessto such areas. Some land councils prohibit specific sites, whereas others impose a blanket prohibition. The members of the Subcommittee welcomed the opportunities provided by their attendance at K92 to inspect equipment which is currently being procured by the Australian Defence Force. Indeed, the visit to Kangaroo 92 served to complement briefings which have been provided to the Subcommittee in other forums. For instance, members have been briefed on the Steyr rifle, and the visit to Kangaroo 92 gave members access to a variety of viewpoints on the capabilities of that weapon. We were also interested to obtain comment on the performance of the Perentie long range patrol vehicle, the Special Air Service water operations equipment and the communications systems such as Raven. From the viewpoint of the Subcommittee there was much to be gained from both seeing units in operational mode and speaking to Australian Defence Force personnel. The Subcommittee was made aware of concerns that low-flying intruding aircraft cannot be detected without the employment of airborne early warning and control aircraft. Again, I note the comments of the ChiefÂ· of the Defence Force that the exercise demonstrated the need for airborne early warning and control aircraft to more precisely target information from surveillance systems such as the lindalee over the horizon radar. I make a plea to the Government that the acquisition of airborne early warning and control aircraft is long overdue and has exposed a dangerous gap in the capability of the Australian Defence Force. At the time of our visit, 1 Field Hospital was packing up to move out of the operational area of the exercise. This gave us a good appreciation ,of the mobility and sophistication of medical facilities available to the Australian Defence Force on operations. We were similarly impressed by the state of the art technology used by the Media Support Unit. I turn now to the 5th Aviation Regiment's participation in Exercise Kangaroo 92. The exercise was the first full regiment level operation for the new unit. Therefore it was the regiment's first opportunity to demonstrate its achievements over the last four years. This regiment now provides substantial air mobility to the operational deployment force by day and by night. For example, the regiment inserted two infantry battalions on Melville Island-one at night in two large scale air mobile assaults using vision devices, which is a first for the Australian Defence Force. It then contributed to the amphibious tactical lodgement of another battalion from HMAS Tobruk and HMAS Jervis Bay landing soldiers and equipment at the rate of one aircraft per minute. It also showed the ability to conduct major repair and maintenance operations in the most remote of bush locations. This exercise proved that a new level of air mobility now exists in the Australian Defence Force. The 5th Aviation Regiment will achieve its final operational objective on 20 November of this year when it demonstrates to the Australian public the ability to carry an infantry company group in one lift. Inspections made by the Subcommittee frequently complement inquiries being conducted by the Subcommittee. This visit to Kangaroo 92 proved no exception. Our itinerary included briefings by 1 Logistics Support Group and 2 Field Supply Battalion, which provided members with opportunities to raise issues which are relevant to the Subcommittee's inquiry into the Australian Defence Force's stockholding policies. Throughout the visit we were highly impressed with the professionalism, dedication and enthusiasm of the members of the Australian Defence Force for the tasks and responsibilities which were entrusted to them. From our own observations we would concur with the Chief of the Defence Force's judgment that the exercise was a very successful one. In conclusion, may I publicly express our appreciation for the opportunity to attend Exercise Kangaroo 92 and for the efforts of those who contributed to the success of our visit. I commend the report to the House.",14
5,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"It is indeed with a lot of pleasure that I support what the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) has said in relation to Exercise Kangaroo 92. Indeed, I am sure that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) will amplify my remarks in a few moments. First of all, I acknowledge once again the professionalism of the Australian Defence Force generally, and in particular the professionalism exercised by those who participated in Exercise Kangaroo 92, as the honourable member for Herbert said, under very trying climatic conditions. I pay particular tribute the ladies of the Australian Defence Force, and we saw many of them during our visit. I particularly want to congratulate them on their contribution to a job well done. I want to acknowledge specifically something that is not mentioned in the report. Before the remainder of the Subcommittee arrived in Darwin, it was my pleasure to fly an 81fz-hour sortie with a P3 Orion crew of the RAAF. I put on the Hansard record my congratulations of and thanks to that particular crew for making my sortie as comfortable as it might be in an 81f2-hour flight and for exhibiting the deep professionalism that we all know exists in the RAAF and, indeed, in the Australian Defence Force generally. I also want to acknowledge the constraints, both financial and physical, under which that exercise was carried out and under which the Australian Defence Force generally perfonns. I think it would be fair to say that, in performing as well and as admirably as it did in the Gulf during the Gulf conflict, had that conflict escalated and lengthened, our contribution would have been stretched to its absolute limits. I know that the right honourable member for New England has had a lot to say about this in the past and I fully support what he has had to say. The Australian Defence Force undoubtedly suffers from a large degree of stretch. It is about time that we in the political arena understood the extent to which that is happening. As the honourable member for Herbert has said, we still await the official wash-up of Exercise Kangaroo 92 but I think it is reasonable for us to make a few personal observations, and some that I certainly had regarding our visit, on some of the obvious equipment shortfalls and inadequacies. 1 completely agree with what the honourable member said about the over the horizon radar, lindalee. It is absolutely imperative, if we are to be effective in terms 'of surveillance, that those AEW and C aircraft be made available as soon as possible. I say to the Government that the lindalee project has the potential to be a disaster without those aircraft. There are very marked inadequacies in terms of high frequency communications, to although project Raven, of course, will ameliorate those problems. In terms of mobility I agree that it is about time we had some firm decisions from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) about the future of the Chinook helicopter which keeps being bandied around the political corridors of this place. I also agree with the honourable member about crew comfort in tanks, armoured vehicles and trucks. Something has to be done about that. In terms of 75 Squadron inTindal, it is pretty clear that the reaction time it had during this exercise was inadequate. Undoubtedly, the ADF will have to look at the permanent basing of the F18 aircraft in Darwin for some of these exercises. Finally, I acknowledge the contribution of the Army Aviation Centre and 7 Signal Regiment in my electorate. I congratulate the aircrew and others, without whom this exercise would not have been the success that it undoubtedly was.",16
6,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I rise to support the remarks made by my colleagues the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). While the US Secretary of Defense, Richard Cheney, was in Australia, he observed the extent to which, with the run-down in the tensions between the super-powers, significant changes are being made within the United States forces. He did remark, however, that a priority is still being given to the training of those forces and to the absolute need for funds to be made available to ensure that, whether it is another Gulf war-United Nations type conflict or whether it is a combat of some other order, the same capacity to coordinate and to provide a well-trained, professional, military response is retained by the Americans. Those words, to my mind, are absolutely imperative to the Australian Defence Force. It is to that end, but within a strategic concept that followed the Paul Dibb premise, that this Kangaroo 92 exercise was designed. It really is not a new concept. It follows a series of Kangaroo exercises that date back at least to 1983. It is a concept which involves a number of basic requirements. I share the views of my colleagues in a number of areas which I do not intend to repeat as time does not permit. There are two, however, that I specifically wish to refer to. In referring to the competence and professionalism of the members of the Australian Defence Force who participated in the exercise, I wanted in particular to identify the contribution of the Reserves, some of whom came from southern States and who, immediately on arrival, were subject to extraordinary temperatures and to work conditions that are quite outside the experience that would be permitted under any industrial arrangement. The conditions of operation need to be remembered by the Government. In some of the armoured vehicles, the new LAVs for example, the temperature may reach up to 55 degrees, which is absolutely unbearable. Something needs to be done to correct that. There is a difficulty with armoured vehicles because project Waler, originated by the coalition Government, was terminated by the Labor Party. As a result, we have an imported, Northern Hemisphere vehicle which is frankly not ideally suited to our climate or our conditions. It is a great pity Australia could not have continued to develop a vehicle specifically for its own requirements. The second remark made by my colleagues that I want to endorse very strongly is the need for an airborne early warning aircraft. It is understood that there were a number of incursions made without detection by the existing Jindalee. Without airborne early warning aircraft, it is quite apparent that Australia is not able to meet the parameters laid down for that exercise, or indeed for the defence of Australia. It is quite imperative that those aircraft be given a high priority. There are a number of other conclusions with respect to equipment; again, I have not time to identify them. But I am concerned at the extent to which the Caribou is getting towards the end of its effective service life. It has been a wonderful aircraft. I just wonder what there is to replace it. Of course, because this was not a particularly wet Wet, the exercise was not really adequately able to evaluate a number of items of equipment under the conditions which would normally apply during that part of the season. The wet season this year, as I said, lacked the monsoons that so often make conditions up north quite extraordinarily ferocious. In conclusion, I wish to raise two other matters. The first is in relation to future commitments of our forces in a peace-keeping role. There is a tremendous logistic capability within the Australian forces; that was demonstrated in Kangaroo 92. This capability would have a distinct advantage for Australia and I am very disappointed that nothing has been done in Cambodia in that sense. The second matter is that because this is the first occasion on which I have been able to speak on defence matters in this House since Lieutenant-General John Coates stepped down as the former Chief of the General Staff, I would like to pay particulartribute to him. It is a great pity that the Government gave him only two years of service. He is a remarkable man and the contribution he has made is outstanding. The CGS exercise recently demonstrated that, and of course on a personal level I would also like to extend to Major-General John Grey my congratulations. I wish him well. (TIme expired) Motion (by Mr Lindsay) proposed: That the House take note of the report.",17
7,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"In accordance with sessional order 102B, the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs Debate resumed from 30 April, on motion by Mr Lavarch: That the House take note of the report.",18
8,Ms CRAWFORD,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the report titled Halfway to Equal, which is in fact the result of .the deliberations Subcommittee of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of which I was a member. I was somewhat disappointed to read in the dissenting report by some members of the Opposition questioning of the time frame and the process in which this report was delivered. Let me set the record straight for honourable members of the House. People may wish to know that this report was two years in the making; public hearings were held throughout Australia. At this Parliament House, it held four very worthwhile two-day seminars at which women and some men from all over Australia looked at four particular issues: women in sport; women and recognition; women in the work force; and the Sex Discrimination Act. So it is somewhat difficult to swallow what the Opposition has said about the process and the time frame. The Subcommittee, which was entrusted with the carriage of this report by that full Committee, went through this report line by line, word by word. So the kind of statements that appear in the dissenting report are at best bleatings and show a total disregard for the way in which that Subcommittee operated for two years at the behest of the total Committee. At the centre of the issue is the whole question of the. status of women within Australia, given the fact that the Sex Discrimination Act has been enacted for five years. Women still, though, are enormously invisible within our history. Very many people here in downtown Canberra give great acclaim to somebody like Burley Griffin, not recognising, in fact, that it was his wife who was the architect and who did most of the work. That is something perhaps interesting that all of us may not know. Indeed, it is just part of the general world of myths that have continued in a society which, being patriarchal and hierarchical, has failed to acknowledge the role of women in our society. Sadly, it continues to do so. One of the other issues that were raised by the Committee is the stereotyping of women-the way in which women are of the stereotyped within the media and advertisements. Of course, one of the other major media issues is sports coverage. One could well ask why games such as lawn bowls, netball and, in fact, even women's hockey, more recently, are not automatically displayed by our media. Rugby league can be televised nationally-and I have to say that I am a great supporter of rugby league-but it is, in fact, played by a very small number of people in comparison with the number of women who play netball, hockey and so on. However, we also must give great credit...:....and the report and the Committee do-to the ABC for picking up the Goal Attack netball coverage and taking it to the people of Australia. As well as that, I think that the Committee recognises that no amount of legislation can change the attitudes of Australian society to women overnight. We need to create an environment in which these attitudes are shown to be what they are-illegal and debilitating to the community as a whole, not just to women. All of us as a community are lessened by that. Indeed, one would have to question why the Opposition would oppose the placing of equal protection before the law as a provision in the Sex Discrimination Act. One has to ask what kind of a political party can possibly oppose the writing in of equal protection before the law for all of its citizens. Members of the Opposition should hang their heads in shame at opposition to such a clause. One wonders what they mean. It is absolutely frightening and terrifying to think that we have members of this House resisting and, in fact, verbally opposing the inclusion of a clause of equal protection for all our citizens before the law in the Sex Discrimination Act. We simply are overwhelmed by this, and I have to say that while attitudes such as this continue to pervade our society we as a community are very much lessened. I also draw to the attention of the House a number of facts which show the kinds of outmoded and outdated views which the look Committee found obtained throughout much of our community. As many people now equal know, women constitute 51 per cent of the population. So rather than being a minority issue, we are, in fact, a majority issue. Indeed, for members of this House, the gender quesrole tion should be considerably more important because we are, after all, 54 per cent of voting public. Those parties and members of parliament who fail to address the needs women in their community do so at their own peril. One should not need to point out that tee. sort of issue because we should all be compelled by the moral imperative that drives all in believing that we are all equal and should all be treated equally. One of the other parts of the Opposition's dissenting report deals with the exemption the defence forces. One has simply to ask: is the Opposition not aware that there are now very important. women in the Australian forces serving in Cambodia under the UN flag and that we had women serving within the refugee camps of the Kurds? Women have shown that, in a more technological age and because of the nature of the defence forces, equal opporcurrently tunities are not based on gender but rather merit. So if people try to tum back the clock when we already have women serving in our armed forces, one must ask where they are actually at. One of the other issues which we need to look at, and which are covered very definitely by the report, is the nature of the changing role of women. Indeed, the report states quite clearly that there is a whole range of work force practices which need to change because, after all, our work force is largely made up of women. More than half of those women who are married are also in the paid work force. Indeed, the image of the male as the breadwinner with a dependent spouse, usually a female, at home, represents only 19 per cent of households in Australia. So to have the kind of view shown in the Amott's biscuits advertisement of the picket fence, with dad going off to work and mum sitting at home, is an absolute travesty and a nonsense with regard to what society is about. It is imperative, as this report suggests, to at the whole range of issues which must be addressed to ensure that women are given status and equal opportunity. Within the workplace, it is imperative that flexible working hours, award conditions and so on take note of the changing role of women. The of women in terms of income support, sole parents, carers, old age pensions, the superannuation and the demands of women within the work force to be part of superanof nuation schemes is important, and is addressed in recommendations by this CommitAnother area in which women have played us an enormous role is in the area of voluntary work. Despite the fact that many women are in the paid work force, they still do an enormous amount of voluntary work. We recomof mend that that be acknowledged through inclusion in the national accounts, and that is What this report attempts to address and seeks to acknowledge is the changing role of women in our society. We have attempted to make recommendations to ensure that the structures and the structural barriers that are in place, which are. really the on heritage of a society which viewed women in a very different way, are changed so that we as a society can gain from the talents of more than half of our community. We should not as a society discriminate against individuals. Also, we as a society are enriched by including in history an acknowledgment of the contribution of women in our society. We need to ensure that everybody, irrespective of gender, will have and should have equal protection before the law in this country which embraces democracy.",18
9,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I make two observations to the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), for whom I have great respect and affection. The first is that all of us commend the Subcommittee for the work that it undertook. I was not a member of the Subcommittee, although I am a member of the full Committee-the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. My criticism relates largely to the fact that the report is submitted am glad to see the report addresses. on behalf of the full Committee. It is not submitted on behalf of the Subcommittee. I was not present at the only meeting at which the Committee considered the full report. The first occasion on which I was aware that the report was going to be considered in that form was when I received a dissenting report. I am disappointed that there was not an opportunity for the full Committee to have spent slightly more time considering what is without doubt an enormous amount of material that has been received and presented, and which certainly addresses a very important part of human relations in this nation. The criticism that I have is that it was very difficult to make judgments on the full report when I had not read it at the time that I was called on to dissent from it. My second observation is that I note that, with regard to the report that has been printed, it has been necessary to insert an addendum to include the two names of those who dissent from the report. My name is one; the other is that of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). I draw attention to the fact that those corrections need to be added to the report because they were not included at the time the report was printed. I have a number of problems with the report. Let me start by corrimending not only the Subcommittee but also the secretariatfor the enormous amount of work that they put into this report. My trouble is that I think we need to be very careful that we do not make an overly legislative response to such a sensitive issue. Without doubt, if there is only a legislative response we are likely to generate more difficulties for the employment of women. I do not think anybody wants that. Certainly, there are major problems in our community. Sexual harassment, to which the report refers, is one. I have some sympathy for the extent to which there needs to be a heightened approach to redress the problems of sexual harassment. It occurs in all sorts of ways, and it is not peculiar to women. It is a problem which seems to have been heightened in our society in recent years and it is one that certainly disadvantages those who are subject to it. That is an area that I . Several aspects of the report concern me. One of the general social problems in Australia is that we are all becoming more selfish. I think we concern ourselves too much with ourselves and not with society around us. The report, in addressing the problems of children, makes reference specifically to education for girls and childcare. However, we need to register that in trying to promote equality for adults, we need to worry about equality for children. It is for that reason that the reference to education for girls is mentioned. I am concerned that we are perhaps not giving enough education for parenting. We are not paying enough attention to trying to overcome the social and financial pressures on families that can lead to child abuse and child molestation. While I would accept that that is not specifically within the reference, I am concerned that in addressing child-care, women and people issues we do not forget that a family essentially consists of three parts: the man, the woman and the child. We need to ensure that in addressing anyone of those parts, we bring together our recognition of the problems of each. In some of the terms and expressions in the report I would have liked to have seen greater reference to the child and the extent to which child-care and other facilities are addressed. We need to ensure that children are recognised as individuals, their problems are addressed and that we do more to try to ensure that they grow up as equal participants in society. I am certain that many of the difficulties that exist today for women in our community began as a result of the way in which they were treated as children and the opportunities that were available to them. It is for that reason that the report directs added encouragement for the education of girls. I am concerned that some of those social and family problems seem to ignore the difficulty of children and I think that is a pity. There are a number of specific recommendations with which I find it very hard to agree and for that reason I became a willing contributor to the dissenting report. Because the honourable member for Forde referred to this point, let me pick up the reference in recommendation 71 to the Defence Force legislative requirement. There is no doubt, as the honourable member for Forde mentioned, that there are women serving in Cambodia and, indeed, in peacekeeping roles elsewhere around the world. I understand we have had some female police in Cyprus. We have had women in many roles in the Defence Force and I am entirely in favour of that. My difficulty is that there are still, nonetheless, sex-specific areas which I think cannot be ignored. In the Defence Force, they concern me. I think we need to understand the differences between some aspects of a combat situation. I believe that there are problems in accepting recommendation 71 in its present form. I think that it would impose an obligation which, as with changes that some seek in respect of homosexuality and its treatment within the defence forces, should not be legislatively imposed. We need to ensure that those in a command position, particularly the commanders of the respective anns of the Defence Force, have total capacity to determine where and in what way people of either sex can be employed. I mention, for example, the SAS. Many of the duties and roles perfonned by the SAS may not be appropriate for girls. That does not mean that girls should not be in the SAS, nor does it mean that there should not be an increase in the number of women employed in the anned forces. Seeing the contribution made by women in the services in recent years, one can only be impressed by the manner, bearing and capacity they demonstrate. I am concerned that, in the field of these anned forces, we have to keep things in balance. A number of legislative requirements are being suggested. I am quite concerned to see that, in trying to provide equality for women, industrial change and legal change not discriminate against men. I guess that all honourable members, from time to time, have found occasions where discrimination is not gender specific. It certainly has been that way in the family law legislation, where there have been just as many problems for husbands as there have been for women in other families. In trying to ensure equality, we need to address that, and not try to elevate the role or status of one sex over the other. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that at the moment women are still disadvantaged in a large number of areas. It is for that reason that I thought the reference in the first place was essential. I am delighted that so .much has been done to highlight advances achieved. Of course, in highlighting advances, it has also been essential to highlight areas where changes still need to be. made. There are worries about the overemphasis on legislative change; change which I do not think achieves the sort of equality we all believe in. If something is required to be done by legislation I am sure that, in many instances, the result disadvantages rather than advantages .those affected. It is for that reason that I support the reservations that have been made in the dissenting report.",20
10,Ms MCHUGH,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I rise to support this report, Halfway to Equal, which is a magnificent achievement. In case I do not get time at the end of my speech, I say very quickly that people must read it. It has been said very often how much it covers, but I remind people again that there were 634 written submissions of original work, 174 exhibits-that is, reports and previously published material-181 witnesses at public hearings, and over 1,000 people at four seminars. All that came together, as every honourable member has said, to produce a report of great substance. I agree with the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) when he, too, says that. But I strongly disagree with him and the other dissenters who say that there was not time for those not on the Subcommittee to contribute. It is interesting that the speakers this morning-the right honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews)-were not on the Subcommittee, but made contributions as members of the full Committee, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. They were, of course, able to make contributions through their Subcommittee colleagues at any time. That is the usual procedure. The tabling date of 30 April was noted by the Subcommittee at the first Subcommittee meeting held this year. Once that tabling date was decided upon, arrangements to table the report were known, and any member of the Committee had plenty of time to contribute. In fact, I wish I were speaking after the honourable member for Menzies. Having attended that last meeting, I would be very happy to rebut some of the things that may be said. Again, I ask people to read the report; that is the best thing to do. I will take up a couple of the things that the right honourable member for New England said. He spoke, for instance, of the danger of over-legislation and then the danger of only legislation, that is, depending only on legislation to change attitudes. Of course, these were the old arguments raised when we brought up legislation originally to prevent discrimination against women in Australia. We are not talking about over-legislation, nor about only legislation, to get rid of some of the discriminations suffered by half of society. We are talking about the need for legislation as a very substantial mechanism in helping to change those attitudes, and the need for legislation as a support for those changes in society. The right honourable member for New England talked, too, about how society is becoming more selfish. I remind the right honourable member for New England that men have always been selfish. Men have always been selfish enough to do whatever they liked, with a career, a marriage and a family. Men have always depended upon a wife and family supporting them while they get on with what they want and need to do. Men have always been selfish. Perhaps, if two women are thinking of themselves a little more, it is about time. Education for parenting was talked about. That is a magnificent way to speak. I remind people, having listened to a more conservative view, just how far the right honourable member for New England, well representing that view-he is a member for whom I have respect and affection-has come in recent years. He has come a very great way indeed. He has deep concerns about women doing some things in the Defence Force area. I remind the right honourable member for New England that women can do anything, but the fact is that men do not want women to do some things, and women are not allowed to do some things. I want to comment very briefly on a couple of very good things in the report. It notes that women in parliaments are few in number. Women have been in politics in Australia for over 100 years. They have had the vote for nearly 100 years. So they have been in politics by virtue of having a vote-and they usually cast it very wisely and in a very informed way. Women have been involved in political activism and activity in Australia for decades. It was the women who, through the strikes, kept the mining villages going. It was the women who helped lead the struggles, such as the shearers strikes and so on. It was the women who gave stability to the society that was taking on the political struggles. Women have always been involved in those but, of course, usually in a volunteer capacity. The real problem for women in Australia is that we are such magnificent volunteers. The family is the perfect example of that. Let me give you some examples of women actually getting into the parliaments in Australia, remembering that the honourable member for Forde (Mrs Crawford) has told us that we are 51 per cent of the population, and that parliaments will not be representative unless we are there in those numbers; in other words, half the numbers. I make the point that the only reason women should be in the parliaments in those numbers is that the current proportion is not representative of half the population. It has got nothing to do with the fact that women are able to do a dozen things at once, are better managers, have more common sense, are more emotionally stable and stronger. Above all, it is a natural 'thing for us to take responsibility for others, which makes us perfect in parliament. We are perfectly qualified. That is not the only why we should be here. The main reason is that women are half of the population, and parliaments will not be representative until we are here in those numbers. Since Federation, 16 women have sat in the House of Representatives. Ten of us are here now. Since Federation-that is, in 91 yearsthere have been 16 women representatives, and there are 10 of us now. The rate of change, the accelerating rate of our getting into the parliaments, is very encouraging indeed, but the history has been appalling. There are now 19 women in the Senate. Since Federation there have been 34 women in the Senate. We are terribly proud that there are 10 of us now in the House of Representatives. It is a thing that makes tis feel good. We gain a great deal of strength from each other. The male members certainly take fright when they see us assembled together. They always wonder what the sheilas are up to when they see us together, because together we are a formidable force. But we number 10 out of 148 members in the House of Representatives. We have got a long way to go in taking our place in the Parliament. This report certainly refers to that and comes up with many recommendations about how to get more women into the Parliament. An interesting comment was made by Maxine MCKew in evidence to the Committee. The report notes that she cited the fall several women politicians who had incurred the wrath of the male dominated party hierarchies. I cannot imagine who she was thinking of, but she did note that 'while women were in a minority in the Parliament, they had made some significant achievements. The great success, she said, has been in policy. Issues that used to be thought of as exclusively feminist are now regarded as economic ones, child-care being the best example'. I am extremely proud of the record of this Government and the contribution of its women members-in particular, the honourable member for Forde-in the childcare area. I want to assure everyone that we will certainly keep up the work in that area. It is a magnificent example of work by reason women in an area that the men have quite honestly forgotten, or did not think important, and an area that no politician, male or female, would now ignore. I want to speak very briefly about another recommendation that I am very pleased about, that is, recommendation 24. In that recommendation we ask for the removal of the anomaly which still prevents ex-servicewoman who did not go overseas from getting war service loans, which ex-servicemen who did not go overseas but who were willing to go overseas could get. The fact is that those servicewomen at that time were not allowed to go overseas. They were prevented from going overseas no matter how willing they were to go. We had evidence given to us by Mrs June Stone, an ex-servicewoman, who has been leading the fight in this area for a long time. I have previously recommended her work in this Parliament. She achieved the removal of the anomaly which prevented the dependants of ex-servicewomen who went overseas from getting war service loans. At least we fixed that one up. I would like to speak too of the importance very properly given in this report to the work of women at home, which I understand very well indeed, having spent 23 years as a full time worker in the home before getting a paid job-and I am looking forward to getting back there, of course. If society wants properof ly to recognise the work of women at home, work on which our economy depends, we take fright, but we must recognise the equal rights of women. (Time expired)",21
11,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"Menzies)(10.23 a.m.)The report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Half Way to Equal raises some important issues for our society, but unfortunately raises as many questions as it answers. I would like to repeat what was said in the dissenting report. It said that we have not done justice to the report by the ludicrously short time that we were given to discuss the final product, and I would like to take issue on that matter with the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh). In doing so, we have done scant service to the issue under consideration, namely, the position of women in the Australian community. Nor is it possible this morning, I suppose, to raise more than one or two issues that arise from the report. Nevertheless, there are important issues in this report to which we should give our earnest consideration. Society has changed fundamentally, with the proportion of women in the work force now being 52 per cent. Yet the structures that are in place in industry are geared towards the traditional concept of women at home and men at work. For all we talk about bureaucratic reviews of this and that, change is likely to be slow and evolutionary, much slower than we would like or good for the situation of women, who carry such a heavy burden trying to combine career and work. This report, in the section on women in relation to leisure and sport, which was raised by the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford), has much to say about women's participation in sport but virtually nothing about leisure. I suggest that women's participation in sport is purely peripheral and is really part of the vexed area of women's lack of time for leisure, which is not considered in the report. A recent paper by Michael Bittman found that women do 70 per cent of 'hidden' labour-that is, unpaid labour. I quote from his report: Generally labour economists have presumed that the supply of paid labour is the result of a trade-off between the money that can be earned while working and the leisure time forgone in o-der to do so ... Economists assume that the result6f doing less paid work is increased time available for leisure. The diaries show such as trade-off for men. Free time or leisure time can be used to predict the amount of time men spend in paid work with a high degree of statistical confidence ... Moreover, the trade-off is, as expected, one for one. For every hour more leisure one hour less paid work. However the same relationship between paid work and leisure does not hold for women . . . as women increase their paid work their unpaid work does not reduce in equal amount and therefore their total work time (paid and unpaid) increases. By contrast the relationship between paid and unpaid worktime among men is weak. Bittman goes on to say that it is usually reasoned that men specialise in paid work to maximise the family economic return, while their wives specialise in unpaid domestic work. But on examination of the 48-hour diaries used in the survey the conclusion is that, no matter how many hours of paid work their wives did, men worked 18.5 hours per week of unpaid work. Therefore, unpaid work falls disproportionately to women. Men do not carry their weight work-wise in the home. One cannot avoid the conclusion that they actually make a lot more work for women, and more than 50 per cent of them are working outside the home. Single mothers actually spend less time in unpaid domestic activities than any category of women with partners. They spend less time cooking, cleaning and doing laundry than even married women without children. Even on retirement, married men spend 90 per cent of their time in leisure pursuits, while amongst retired women 47 per cent of the time released by the cessation of paid work is swallowed up by extra unpaid work. Looking across the work of women throughout the world, it seems that often women are regarded as the drudges of the world. As to putting the value of unpaid work into a supplement to the national accounts figures, this will change absolutely nothing at all. The essential problem for women is that they lack economic power. It seems to me that there is a contradiction in terms between asserting that women have the right to choose. to stay at home and look after children and the complaint that the workplace is geared towards women being the backstops at home. For an increasing number of women there is no choice about staying at home, and that has become increasingly so in the last decade. Of those women who work, more than half with taxable incomes earn less that $21,000, while two-thirds of men earn more than $21,000. Women are doing part time casual work in large numbers. This has been the growth area of employment in the last few years under the Labor Government, until the recession. Women work fewer hours or just top up the family income. Increasingly it has become the situation that women are being forced, not so much through economic desire as through economic necessity, to go out to work to ensure an adequate family income. It all adds up to no or little economic power, which is all too obvious in old age or in divorce. Is it really right, then, to make women carry the can in regard to the family? We need a massive shake-up in the way we regard work and the way we work. We need more flexibility of working hours and less role stereotyping. This is an area in which it is doubtful whether legislation can achieve anything. A massive attitudinal change is required, especially on the part of men. Pornography, for example, is a serious problem in respect of the way women are depicted, but it receives no consideration in this report. It has nothing to do with being a wowser about looking at naked human bodies, but it is truly astounding that we somehow think that it is all right to see women shown as somehow less than human. We have seen the most recent episode of the soft-porn magazine that is sold in newsagents alongside children's cartoon comics and showing a woman with a diamond-studded dog collar on a leash. And this is relatively mild. The issue of women in advertising, which this Government prefers to focus on, is not nearly as significant but much safer to tackle. Government policy continues to enshrine some of the chauvinistic outdated attitudes to women, as this report has noted with regard to the differing entitlements of female and male war veterans. Another example involves the way in which the Department of Social Security continues to regard women as mere appendages to men, who must provide for the women. A woman on social security benefits loses those benefits if a man moves into live with her, or vice versa. It is then Â·presumed, although there is no marriage, that the man must be supporting the woman. We continue to fail to adequately support the family-by which I do not mean mum, dad and the kids necessarily. The family as a term should be embraced in the broader context of all families. There is a means to do this through the taxation system. While we recognise the family as a basic unit of society-and I include 'family' in various forms-we have a tax system which is actually based on the individual. Governments attempt to accommodate the reality of the family by a series of concessions such as the dependent spouse rebate and family allowances. A more equitable system to all families, including the increasing number of women raising dependent children alone, might involve the recognition of the family as a basic unit for taxation purposes with concessions for the individuals-a complete reversal of the current system. These issues were only touched upon by the Committee, but they deserve greater recognition and consideration by the community, considering especially that the National Agenda for Women stated that women should have a real choice about the form of work which they undertake. A related issue of volunteer work is raised in the report. An Australian Bureau of Statistics survey in 1988 found that almost 25 per cent of the population aged IS. and over undertook some form of community work. It has been estimated that the value to the nation of voluntary services is some $5 billion a year. A Canadian survey estimated the value of volunteer work in that country in 1990 as $13.2 billion-an imputed wage bill equivalent to 53 per cent of the total wage bill of the retail industry in Canada. While the Committee's recommendations concentrate on the economic aspects of volunteer work, we are reminded that many services that governments are tempted to provide can often be provided through the community itself without further burgeoning of bureaucracy. To reduce the status of volunteers to a question of monetary reward would negate the very motivation of many Australians who voluntarily provide their time and services to the community.",23

Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies Debate resumed from 30 April, on motion by Mr Barry Jones: That the House take note of the report.",26
13,Mr ANDREWS,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"It was Trotsky, as I recall, who remarked, 'Old age is the most unexpected of all the things that happen to a man'. Had he been writing in Australia today,' Trotsky may have spoken of women, as old age is, to a very large extent, a condition of women. For every 100 women aged 80 and above in Australia, there are only 47 men. As Penny Kane recently pointed out in an issues paper on women's health, the women are more likely to live alone, both because they have outlived a husband and because it seems that elderly men are considered the responsibility of their families. These old women have higher rates of musculo-skeletal problems and of accidents. Although they are less likely to be hospitalised than men, once they are hospitalised their stay is longer. In a series of reports, the adequacy and appropriateness of health services to middle aged and older women have been marked as a priority for research and for funding. But as the report A Sliver: Not Even A Slice indicated, funding of research into women's health issues represents a minor proportion of health research funding and then is mostly directed to issues relating to reproduction. While the Standing Committee for. Long Term Strategies has rightly pointed to the inadequacy of funding for.preventive health programs, a renewed concentration on health issues affecting the elderly must concede that these issues primarily relate to women. The report of the Long Term Strategies Committee, Expectations of Life, reviews the situation of the elderly generally. It is often said in this country that we have an ageing population which is a problem for Australia. Like many popular beliefs, this is partly true and partly misleading; nonetheless, the belief persists. Academics and others often refer to our aged dependency crisis. The alarmist predictions that our population has reached a situation' where we are not able to sustain our existence if it continues to growa claim that seems to ignore the fact that we are not even maintaining a replacement fertility rate and the current level of immigration would only produce a population of perhaps 25 million people in another 25 to 30 years-ignore the fact that the quality of life of all Australians, young and old included, depends in large measure on the choiCes we make as a nation about both the creation and the distribution of wealth. It is true that Australia's population has aged; the contrary could not be expected. But we do remain a young nation. Even by the year 2005, when it is expected that some 12 per cent of our population will be aged 65 years or more, the age of our population will trail behind 25 other developed and industrialised countries. Hence the popular question, - How can a smaller and smaller work force support a larger and larger retired population?', overlooks the fact that the proportion of the population in the work force is expected to increase in the next two decades. As we point out in the report, changes in work force participation are the consequences not of demographic changes but of economic and social factors. Some of the real issues were indicated by Dr Donald Edgar, the Director of the Institute of Family Studies, during a seminar conducted by the Long Term Strategies Committee. He said: What Australia does face, however, is a system riddled with outmoded structures, outmoded work regulations; outmoded retirement and superannuation provisions, inadequate community-based family support, and a media archaic in its social understanding, stuck in the cult of youth and pushing an image of 'the aged' that denies their status as elders where resources can and should be drawn upon. A number of these issues have been addressed by the Committee. The Committee recommended that the Commonwealth Government abolish compulsory age related retirement in the Australian Public Service and other Commonwealth employment areas and that the Minister for Industrial Relations review industrial relations Acts, awards and other relevant instruments to identify and remove provisions which could discriminate on the basis of age or which make it difficult to introduce more flexible working arrangements. Similarly, we recommended an investigation of the possibilities for phased retirement and other methods of making employment at later ages more flexible. There is little doubt that more flexible work practices must become the norm in Australia if we are to be competitive in the world marketplace. While the refusal of some, including the trade union movement, to consider youth wages, for example, condemns many more young people to unemployment, the inflexibility of our retirement policies equally treats as dispensable the considerable talents, experience and abilities of older Australians. Many older people will be happy to retire from their toil. Others will continue to seek dignity in a continuing interest in their work. As Dr John MCCallum said in evidence to the Committee: Probably around a third of all retirees who are to work would prefer to work longer. The rush to retire during the 1980s has either been more of a 'push', or the retirement experience has not expectations held about it. Although there are major barriers to the re-employment of older Australians who lost their jobs as a consequence of the current recession, a major long term impediment remains our attitudes to compulsory retirement and work practices. As MCDonald's in America discovered with its MCMasters program, a scheme to employ older people, there are many who will relish the new challenges in older age. Faced with a diminishing pool of younger workers, MCDonald's encouraged older people to apply at their neighbourhood MCDonald's for jobs, which the company's blurb said: ... offer a convenient workplace, flexible hours, training with pay, the opportunity to make new friends and meal benefits and the chance to earn money without affecting social security benefits. It produced a national television commercial called 'The New Kid'. These new kids were aged over 65 years. The MCDonald's program may not appeal to all, but it does point to the opportunities for more flexible working arrangements and, more importantly, a review of our attitudes to the elderly. As Pablo Picasso once remarked: Age only matters when one is ageing. Now that I have arrived at a great age, I might just as well be 20. This is our challenge as a nation: to ensure that age does not disqualify Australians from a full and active involvement in the community in all its manifestations. As the poet Tennyson reminded us: ... you and J are old; Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; Death closes all: but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with gods. The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks: The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends, 'Tis not too late to seek a newer world. The world of old age is one to which many able of us will journey. May this report, Expectations 0/ Life: Increasing the Options/or the 21st Century, of the Long Term Strategies met the Committee of this House, assist all Australians-young, old and those growing old-in making their old age fruitful.",26

17,Mr LINDSAY,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"The survival of Australia was in peril during early 1942. The Japanese had launched the Pacific war in December 1941 with a ferocious surprise attack on American forces at Pearl Harbour. The Philippines had fallen. When Singapore surrendered to the Japanese in mid-February, 14,972 Australians had been captured. Japanese forces had landed in New Guinea. Darwin, Port Moresby and Hom Island at the tip of Cape York were under air attack. The resource-rich continent of Australia, underpopulated and in many respects unprepared for war, must have been an almost irresistible attraction to the predatory ambitions of the Japanese. And Japan's ambitions to establish a Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere had now secured for it an empire almost 9,000 kilometres in breadth. Australia was isolated and geographically remote from Britain and the United States. The Japanese Prime Minister, Tojo, warned Australia that resistance against Japan's armed might was useless. Prime Minister John Curtin pledged that Australia would, if invaded, fight to the last man and apply a scorched earth policy. It was a perilous time. On 26 March 1942, General Douglas MACArthur had the privilege of being given a seat in the Australian House of Representatives in the old Parliament House, not far from here, where he listened to the debate on the peril facing Australia. That evening in this city he gave a speech in which he said: There is a link that binds our countries together which does not depend upon written protocol, upon treaties of alliance, or upon diplomatic doctrine. It goes deeper than that. It is that indescribable consanguinity of race which causes us to have the same aspirations, the same hopes and desires, the same ideals and the same dreams of future industry. My presence here is tangible evidence of our unity. I have come as a soldier in a great crusade of personal liberty as opposed to perpetual slavery. My faith in our ultimate victory is invincible, and I bring you tonight the unbreakable spirit of the free man's military code in support of our just cause. It embraces the things that are right and condemns the things that are wrong. Under its banner the free men of the world are united today. There can be no compromise. We shall win, or we shall die, and to this end I pledge you the full resources of all the mighty power of my country, and all the blood of my countrymen. With those inspiring words and the inspiring words of our own Prime Minister, John Curtin, this nation was resolved to fight, to the death if need be, in defence of Australia. Our enemy, the Japanese, wasted little time in preparing to cut the lines of communication between Australia and the United States. They planned to capture Port Moresby in Papua and Tulagi in the southern Solomon Islands. From Port Moresby they would be able to gain control of the Coral Sea and mount sustained bombing of the Australian mainland: Townsville, Hom Island and Cooktown, where aircraft were based. For the invasion of Port Moresby, code named Operation Mo, the Japanese assembled a formidable force: two large carriers, Shokaku and Zuikaku, two cruisers and six destroyers to protect the invading force, and a covering group with a small aircraft-carrier and four cruisers. The invading force itself was embarked in 11 carriers. Once embarked from Rabaul, it steamed south, the Port Moresby invasion group moving through the narrow gap separating New Britain and New Ireland, and the carrier striking force moving further to the east, past the Solomon Islands. The invading force that had embarked from Rabaul steamed south, carrying 4,500 crack assault troops. The Americans had broken the Japanese naval codes and were able to determine that the invasion target was Port Moresby and that the likely date of invasion was 3 May. A naval task force, including the carriers Yorktown and Lexington, were dispatched to meet the threat. The battle began in earnest at about 11 a.m. on 7 May 1942, when search aircraft from the Yorktown located the Japanese carrier Shoho off Misima Island, east of the eastern tip of Papua. American aircraft attacked and sank the Shoho. Several hours later, an Allied force, which included HMAS Australia and HMAS Hobart. came under sustained and furious attack from Japanese Navy bombers. The opposing naval forces continued to search for each other, and the following day two major aircraft-carrier groups finally located each other through their aircraft and attacked. During the ferocious battle that followed, the Lexington was bombed and torpedoed. As the sun set that day, 2,735 crew wererecovered from the burning Lexington before it was sunk by an American destroyer 650 miles east of Cooktown. A total of 216 men who had died defending the Lexington went down with their ship. There was a loss of 35 aircraft. The early loss of the Shoho had proved crucial. It was a devastating blow to Japan. It was the first Japanese ship lost in combat to American forces. On 9 May, the invasion of. Port Moresby was postponed. The Battle of the Coral Sea was a remarkable naval battle, and a turning point in the war. It was fought entirely by air power, with neither side coming close enough to visually assess the enemy or sight and fire their naval guns. It was a lesson from which the admirals, officers and naval personnel were able to learn in great detail and use to great effect in their magnificent victory at Battle of Midway. It was a victory for Allied cooperation, because Australian forces-the two cruisers in Rear Ad-iral Crace's squadron, an Australian-born Royal Navy officer-had played their part in this action. It was alsQ a grim reminder of the capacity of the Japanese military forces at the time and of their determination to pursue their militaristic ambitions to the fullest. It enabled Australia to gain a respite, to build up morale and to join with its American comrades in arms in the eventual defeat of the Empire of Japan. Fifty years have now passed and celebrations are being held Australia-wide to commemorate the Battle of the Coral Sea. In Townsville, in particular, this week a memorial will be unveiled to commemorate the gallant sailors and airmen who gave their lives in the defence of Australia. This motion is a significant motion for Australia, and I commend it to the House. (TIme expired)",28
18,Mr HALVERSON,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"I am delighted and deeply honoured to second this motion, which acknowledges the special significance to Australia and Australians of the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. It serves to remind us all of the importance of our relationship with the United States of America and of the bonds of friendship and cooperation which have been forged between our two great nations over the past half century. This motion also provides members on both sides of the House with an opportunity to record how pleased we are to extend a very warm, sincere and friendly welcome to the American veterans who are visiting Australia to participate in various Coral Sea remembrance ceremonies and celebrations, and to reiterate the welcome previously extended to two members of the US Cabinet-Secretary of Defense Cheney and Secretary of Education Alexander. We recognise them all-and the nation they represent-as our friends, and we are pleased to have them visit us at this important time. Fifty years ago most Australians were expecting and preparing for invasion by the Japanese. We were in a perilous situation. The war in the Pacific was not going well, the the enemy was on our northern doorstep, and an attack on the Australian mainland seemed inevitable. Although I was quite young, and my memories of this period of crisis and uncertainty are, therefore, generally rather vague, I do recall quite clearly the feelings of apprehension which existed in my home, in the homes of friends and, indeed, throughout the whole community at that time. I also remember the relief that was so apparent when the news of the outcome of the Battle of the Coral Sea and, shortly after, the Battle of Midway came through. At last the Japanese advance had been haIted. They were not, as many had thought, invincible. Coral Sea and Midway proved that they could be stopped. The Battle of the Coral Sea was fought off the south-eastern tip of New Guinea on 7 and 8 May 1942. It was an historic and notable battle. Apart from the fact that it marked the first setback suffered by Japanese forces, it was also the first time that a naval battle was resolved without the surface elements of the fleet sighting each other. It is now generally accepted that the outcome of the Battle of the Coral Sea was inconclusive in many respects. The closeness of the encounter can be seen from the battle statistics. The Japanese lost the 12,000-ton light carrier Shoho, 77 aircraft and 1,074 men. The carrier Shokaku sustained bomb damage. In fact, the Shoho was the first major warship lost by the Japanese Imperial Navy in World War II. The United States lost the 42,000-ton carrier Lexington, the oiler Neosho, the destroyer Sims, 66 aircraft and 543 men. The carrier Yorktown sustained some bomb damage. Although from a tactical and materiel point of view the Japanese may have achieved some success, strategically they suffered a significant defeat. There is no doubt that the Battle of the Coral Sea marked the turning point of the war in the Pacific. Therefore, we may quite legitimately claim that in the final analysis, the Allies won the day. It is fitting that we should recall the of some of the ships that played such a vital role in securing Australia from invasion: the carriers, Lexington and Yorktown; the cruisers, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Astoria, Chester, Portland and Chicago; the destroyers, US Phelps, Dewey, Farragut, Aylwin, Monaghan, Perkins, Walke, Morris, Anderson, Hammann, Russell, Sims, and Worden; the oil tankers, US Neosho and TIppecanoe; the seaplane tender US Tangier; and, of course, our Australian cruisers, HMAS Australia and HMAS Hobart. There were also the submarines of the Eastern Australian Submarine Group and the Allied air forces consisting of aircraft based in Australia and New Guinea. Unlike the ships, the submarines and the planes carried identifying codes and numbers rather than individual names, but, of course, this detracts nothing from the significance of their contribution. It is important to recognise that battles cannot be fought or victories achieved by guns or planes or ships or bombs alone. The fate of nations does not necessarily depend on the armaments or machines they may have at their disposal, but rather on the loyalty, dedication, deeds and sacrifices of their citizens. The British historian and scholar, Sir Arthur Bryartt, in an article which appeared in the Illustrated London News in September 1945 summed it up very well. He said: Once, flying over Scapa Flow in the critical middle years of the War, I remarked to the naval officer who was accompanying me that it was strange to think that on those few great ships lying below at anchor the fate of the world depended. 'No', he replied, 'not on the ships, on the men'. So when we remember the battles, we must also remember the courage and commitment of the people who took part, all those who served in whatever capacityÂ· and especially those who died. In addition to recording our deep and lasting appreciation of the contribution made to the security of Australia by the Australian and American servicemen who participated in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the motion we are debating today allows us to reaffirm the continuing importance of names security cooperation between our two great countries and to express our strong support for continued close cooperation between Australia and the United States on economic and security issues in Asia and the Pacific. Australia and the United States have a lot in common, so it is hardly surprising that we have been such good friends for such a long time. Apart from the many similarities we share in respect of our heritage, traditions and culture, we are both committed to and prepared to fight to protect and preserve the ideals of democracy, freedom, individual rights and the rule of law. To this end, we have fought side by side as allies in both world wars, in Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. Under the banner of the United Nations we have also served the cause of peace. Although we already enjoy a very special relationship based on mutual trust and cooperation, we must keep working to develop it and to strengthen and safeguard it . against the pressures which inevitably arise from time to time. We must be ever vigilant to identify and take the necessary action to overcome any existing or new threats which may adversely impact upon our own security and the security of our region. As Australians, we acknowledge that a fundamental, important and necessary factor with regard to our own national security and defence interests and the economic and political stability of the Asia-Pacific region, of which we are a part, is the strong alliance between ourselves and the United States. The effectiveness of this alliance has been tested more than once and each time it has proved its worth and its reliability. But that does not give us any cause for complacency. We live in an uncertain and rapidly changing world and we must be prepared to recognise the consequent changes in the nature of our role and responsibilities, the new challenges we are facing now, and others that may confront us in future. US Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, referred to these changes and challenges in an address he gave-one among many-in Sydney last Friday, 1 May, at a luncheon hosted by the Australia-United States Coral Sea Commemorative Council, the American Chamber of Commerce and the AustralianAmerican Association. In the context of this debate, it is appropriate and relevant to repeat his words: He said: As the Persian Gulf conflict reminded us, the end of the Cold War did not end all threats to the security of democratic nations. Regional ho-.tilities can arise on short notice. And they may demand that we respond rapidly, far from home. Our forces may find themselves facing adversaries that are armed with sophisticated new weapons, and with unconventional capabilities. Moreover, in of our optimism about recent developments in the former communist bloc, we must recognise that real uncertainty remains. We have no way of knowing whether the forces of democracy and reform will succeed in the former Soviet Union. In this new security environment, it is essential that we maintain collective defences to deter potential aggressors and to give our alliance the ability to influence the course and the direction of world events. Nowhere is this more important than here in the Asia-Pacific region. Its economic growth and stability have a global impact. Three major wars here in the last 50 years remind us of what a critical security impact it can have, as well. Even if our nations had no other links to this region, developments here would have a profound influence on all our lives. But we are more than observers. We are Pacific nations, with an immediate stake in regional peace and progress. It is our strategic interest that is at stake-our strategic interest to prevent any single state from dominating the region-and threatening its stability. It is equally important to make sure that potential aggressors understand that conflict would be a losing proposition, and aggression would pose unacceptable risks for them. I believe the majority of Australians and Americans would appreciate and share the sentiments expressed by Secretary Cheney. Finally, in commending this motion to members of both sides of this House, I would like to remind them that we all have a sacred duty to remember that those who sacrificed so much on behalf of this nation, whether during the Battle of the Coral Sea or any other conflict, will have done so in vain if we are not constantly vigilant to protect our freedom and democratic way of life. The best way for us to acknowledge how much we owe them and to attempt, at least in part, to repay some of that debt, is for all of us to commit ourselves to achieving the very difficult but nonetheless worthwhile objective of working together to build a safer, fairer, more compassionate, prosperous and peaceful world.",29
19,Mr GRACE,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"It is with the greatest pleasure that I rise today to support this motion commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the strategically important Coral Sea Battle. I am particularly pleased to be able to speak in support of a motion which pays tribute to the long term spite relationship which exists between Australia and the United States and recognises the very real warmth between the two nations which was cemented in the heat of wartime actions such as the Coral Sea Battle. I say this because it has become very popular to rid'icule and belittle the genuineness of American motives in the international arena and to equate cooperation and friendship with the US with subservience and second-class status. Around the world, it is common fare to hear of the US being spoken of in derogatory terms, the common complaints being of the US fixation with self interest and its penchant for American imperialism. Regretfully, such strident anti-Americanism does not exclusively belong in the domain of Third World dictatorships, but has support in some quarters in democracies such as Australia. Without doubt, the US is not perfect. It has made some foreign policy decisions over the years which I believe have been fundamentally wrong. Also, to my way of thinking, it has not always been overly tactful or understanding in its dealings with its friends. However, it should be remembered that such criticisms can be made of every state, including Australia. It is the way of world that misunderstandings and differences of emphasis between the best of friends can and do arise. The true test of friendship cannot be gauged by whether or not nations agree on each and every issue that arises between them. Rather, it can be gauged by the fundamental ideologies which drive both societies-their aspirations for the future and their willingness to sacrifice for the other when the chips are really down. By such a test, Australia and the United States have a friendship bond which is strong and durable. Firstly, both nations have a commitment to democracy which is all-consuming. We believe in the rule of law; we express our opposition to those who have imposed nondemocracy on their people; and we look to equality between nations and peaceful resolutions to international disputation. Secondly, we both aspire to a future society which is better than the present-a society where wealth is distributed more equitably; human rights are respected; and where society is able to strike a satisfactory and workable balance between our economic needs and our environment. Thirdly, and very importantly, Australia and the United States have a long and proud history of standing and sacrificing together in the face of the hardest test of friendship-the battlefield. I do not believe that there would be a member in this House today who would not say that America's contribution to our survival in World War II was all-important. At a time when Europe was aflame and our traditional allies-the British-were unable or unwilling to help us, it was the Americans who stepped into the breach to assist us against the Japanese. Let us make no mistake: despite their understandable desire for vengeance after the carnage of Pearl Harbour, there was no immutable reason why the Americans had to stop the Japanese from over-running Australia. In fact, there is one school of thought that says, despite what would have been the loss of an Allied staging post and command centre, the fall of Australia would have stretched Japanese supply lines to the breaking point and hastened the fall of the Japanese empire. History shows that the United States made a full commitment to the defence of Australia-a commitment which led to the loss of thousands of US lives in ferocious engagements such as the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. The Coral Sea Battle, in particular, was fought with a tremendous loss to the US with the engagement precipitating the sinking of the pride of its fleet, the US Lexington. What made the loss of this ship all the more horrific was the fact that it was not sunk by the Japanese but rather by a later explosion and fire caused by gases escaping from a ruptured fuel line. This sinking grieved both the US and Australian populations. Historians tell us that the Coral Sea Battle turned the tide against the Japanese; it was the first occasion that their southward thrust had been repulsed. It laid the foundation for the later Battle of Midway which finally put paid to Japan's claim to maritime supremacy in the southern Pacific. In the sense that the Coral Sea Battle represented a turning point in the repulsion of an aggressor and exemplified the spirit of cooperation which is . now part and parcel of the AustralianAmerican relationship, it is fitting that the fiftieth anniversary of this event should be used as the basis for a motion before this House. As honourable members know, Australia and the US have a friendship which has not only survived the .test of time and the comings and goings of conservative and social democratic parties in both countries but also matured on the basis of respect and cooperation. It has been interesting to note that, as Australia has grown and found its own way since the Second World War, our relationship with the US has remained steady and strong. Despite the closeness of our ties with Asia and the changed trading patterns which have emerged as a result of the rapid growth of Asia and the development of other trading blocs, Australia and America have continued to maintain dialogue and cooperation. It is a friendship that will remain strong over the years because we believe in the same things. It gives me great pleasure to be associated with this motion. . Mr DOWNER (Mayo) (11.10 a.m.)-It also gives me great pleasure to give support to this motionÂ· moved by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). I congratulate him on putting forward the motion and on the remarks that he made in moving it. I also congratulate other speakers who have spoken in this House in support of the motion. This motion-as otherS have said-not only commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea, but also pays tribute to those Australians and Americans who served so valiantly in that enormously important battle. I understand that something like 500 Allied sailors lost their lives in the Battle of the Coral Sea. When we talk of that battle, I think first and foremost it is important that we remember the lives that were lost in defence of our country and the things that we so strongly stand for. The Battle of the Coral Sea was also a great landmark in Australian history. I do not think that there is, as yet, a clear enough recognition in the broader Australian community of the pivotal importance of the Battle of the Coral Sea in the evolution of Australian foreign and defence policy. Before 1942, Australia's relationship with the United States was not quite as glittering as I think some people might imagine it to have been, because all of us have grown up with an enormously close relationship with the United States. But prior to 1942, that really was not quite the case. Great celebrations were held in 1908 at the time of the visit of the Great White Fleet. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in his speech welcoming Defense Secretary Cheney, referred to that visit of the Great White Fleet. It was an important event in Australia in the first decade of this century. But following that visit there were some reservations in Australia about the United States. There was a degree of resentment that the United States entered the First World War as late as it did in 1917. There was a view in Australia amongst many that the Americans had to carry the bulk of responsibility for the Great Depression. At around that time, a great deal of antipathy between Australia and the United States developed over trade relations . Indeed, many members would not know that Australia lost its most favoured nation trading status with the United States in the late 1920s or early 1930s as a result of tensions over trade issues. It really was not until the Second World War that this uneasy, although friendly, relationship with the United States became a great bond between two nations. As others have pointed out, that came about following the retreat down the Malay Peninsula, the fall of Malaya and, finally, the fall of Singaporeevents which my own father participated in. Naturally, these events created enormous anxiety in the Australian community. It was really a wonderful thing for this country that, a few months later, the Battle of the Coral Sea not only took place, but also that it was such a great, at least strategically, success. I think that, as a tactical battle, the Japanese came out of it slightly better than the Allies did. But as a strategic battle it was an absolutely pivotal moment in the Second World War. It stopped the Japanese advance to the south and the west. It effectively stopped the Japanese from taking Port Moresby and possibly moving on from complete control of what is now Papua New Guinea, to invade Australia itself. History will never record and we will never know whether the Japanese had, in fact, ever intended to do that. Nevertheless, it was understandably a great cause of anxiety in Australia at the time that Australia would be their next target. The Battle of the Coral Sea stopped that advance to the south and the west by the Japanese. It did more than that. It ensured that Australia was not cut off from its allies-in particular, from its principal ally, the United States. Had the Battle of the Coral Sea not succeeded-or had it not even taken placeand had the Japanese taken the whole of New Guinea, not only would Australia have been in danger of inva.sion from the Japanese but also it would also have been completely isolated from its allies in terms of communications, equipment and so on. This, therefore, was an absolute watershed in Australian foreign policy and defence history. That is why I am very glad that this motion has been moved, that the Parliament has focused its mind on this issue and that there have been such celebrations during the last few days to commemorate the battle. The legacy of the Battle of the Coral Sea, the legacy of that first great, practical step Australia-United States defence relationship, is still very much with us. I think one could say that the Ba.ttle of the Coral Sea was, in a sense, the grandfather of the ANZUS alliance. The ANZUS alliance, which was signed by the Menzies Government, has been the basis of Australian defence policy from that time until today. The ANZUS alliance has been more, though, than just the basis of our defence policy. It has been one of the alliances, one of the arrangements, that have turned the Pacific into a virtual zone of exclusion during the Cold War. It has allowed the Pacific as a region to evolve economically. It has ensured that countries in South-East Asia and also in North-East Asia have been able to achieve very substantial rates of economic growth and overall prosperity. It has also ensured that we have been free from some of the worse excesses of the Cold War which have had such an appalling impact on the psychology of, in particular, Europe. ANZUS, despite the end of the Cold War, is still very much one of the pillars of our defence policy. I was very glad on Monday, during my discussions with Defense Secretary Cheney, that he reiterated the United States view that it remains very strongly committed to the alliance with Australia-and, indeed, more than that, very strongly committed to continuing to be actively involved in our region. Nevertheless, as I pointed out to Secretary Cheney, and as he certainly agreed, there are still great regional security issues which remain. The ANZUS alliance is still, therefore, of very great importance to us, despite the end of the Cold War. We need to keep building the ANZUS alliance. We should not just take it for granted. We need to look at areas where we can make our contribution to the alliance. That is one of the reasons that the joint facilities are so important. We need to look at it in terms of a way of ensuring equipment acquisition. Clearly, a very important part of the alliance is the process of joint exercises and training. We need to play our part in terms of continuing the policy of allowing ship visits from the United States-something in the which has excluded New Zealand from the ANZUS alliance because it does not allow such visits. We need, in areas where we possibly can, to upgrade the alliance by, for example, allowing the United States-should a commercial arrangement be reached-to use the Delamere air combat manoeuvre range, the so-called bombing range near Tindal. As I said to Secretary Cheney the other day, we should try to get the Americans interested in using Australian bases for repairs and maintenance for the United States Navy. In the years ahead the ANZUS alliance will, I believe, remain strategically significant both to Australia and to the United States. I do not think we should ever take for granted the stability of our region. Of course, in present circumstances we can see no immediate threat to the stability of our near region, but changes can take place, and take place very suddenly. It always concerns me to hear people say that there can be no perceived threat to Australia for 10 years or 15 years. We just do not know what political events could take place in countries relatively near or very near to Australia. So ANZUS remains an enormously important backstop to Australia. It gives us a status in a defence sense that we otherwise would not have. As I said earlier, it gives the United States some opportunities in the region as well, which we need to continue to encourage. In conclusion, let me say just once more that this all started with the Battle of the Coral Sea. I am very glad that this motion has been moved in the House. It is with the greatest pleasure that I give that motion my support.",31
20,Mr COURTICE,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"I am very pleased to take part in the debate on this bipartisan motion that is before the House today. I would like to pay tribute to the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) for moving this motion. As fellow Queenslanders, the Battle of the Coral Sea is of even greater significance to us than to people from other States because north Queensland was very close to the action in the Coral Sea and, of course, to the threat of invasion. As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said, there was a very real threat of invasion. That invasion would have occurred in Queensland-in northern Queensland in particular. It is a fact that allied personnel were based in north Queensland and played a pivotal role in helping to destroy the Japanese invasion which was centred on capturing Port Moresby. The text of the motion deserves to be read in full. It states: That, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary the Battle of the Coral Sea, during which a joint Australian and US naval force inflicted the first strategic setback to Japanese aggression, thereby securing Australia from invasion and greatly enhancing Allied morale and resolve, this House: (1) places on record its deep appreciation of the contribution to our security of the Australian and US servicemen who participated in that action; (2) welcomes to Australia surviving US veterans participating in various remembrance ceremonies and the representation of two members of the US Cabinet, Secretary of Defense Cheney and Secretary of Education Alexander; (3) notes in particular the participation of Australian and US veterans in celebrations in Townsville; (4) reafflfffis the continuing importance of security cooperation between our two countries forged at that time; and (5) expresses its strong support for continued close cooperation between the United States of America and Australia on economic and security issues in Asia and the Pacific. This is only a little token, but it is important that we move this motion today because the real action happened 50 years ago. We owe so much of our freedom today to those allied personnel-the United States forces and our own Australian forces. I think it is symbolic and important that, as a consequence, we pay tribute on the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. I think it is important to recognise that the Attack Group-Task Force 17--"":was commanded by Rear Admiral T.C. Kinkaid. It consisted of the cruisers US Minneapolis, which was the flagship, New Orleans, Astoria, Chester and Portland, supported by the destroyers Phelps, Dewey, Farragut, Aylwin and Monaghan. The Support Group, commanded by Rear Admiral J.G. Crace RN, consisted of the HMAS Australia, Hobart and US Chicago, supported by the destroyers US Perkins and Walke. The Air Group was commanded by Rear Admiral A.W. Fitch and consisted of the aircraft carriers US Lexington and Yorktown, supported by the destroyers US Morris, Anderson, Hammann and Russell. It is also important to pay tribute to two of great and outstanding American service personnel, Nimitz and Halsey, who played a massive role under Admiral King, who, as I understand it, was Supreme Commander of Naval Forces in the Pacific. It was Admiral King who indicated that ultimately the victory over the Japanese was as a consequence of sea power and the slow tightening over a period of time on the Japanese war machine. I believe that this was one of the most important naval engagements in the history of the world. We may be biased in saying that, being Australians, but certainly it was the major setback to Japanese aggression. Of course, on land, at the same time, it was Australian servicemen who succeeded in defeating the Japanese at Milne Bay and then subsequently in the Owen Stanleys. It is of such fundamental importance, as I have said, to Queenslanders because at the time of the Battle of the Coral Sea a cane farm could be sold for 2/6 an acre and many families left the north because of the fear of invasion. I would like to place on record the fact that my father-in-law, who is now deceased, travelled to Charters Towers and worked with his family on putting down the airstrips so that the US and Australian forces could utilise Charters Towers as one of the major bases from which they inflicted so much effective damage against the Japanese fleet. So many other farmers at that time in north Queensland volunteered, went out to Charters Towers and worked willingly to help provide for the war effort. Not only our service personnel but also the community cooperated and pulled its weight to help ensure that we maximised the defence of our nation and cooperated with the, United States. Certainly, the United States saved Australia; there is no doubt about that. We should recognise that fact. Today, as allies some 50 years later, we can be proud that, while we may disagree from time to time on trade matters, we stand shoulder to shoulder as believers in the fundamentals of democracy and in the principles that Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln in the United States espoused. We were united in 1942 with the unique arrangements made between our great wartime Prime Minister John Curtin and the great wartime leader of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was a great man of courage and wisdom who saw, well before many other people, the need to prevent the threat of fascism in Europe and in the Pacific. As we now look to the future, with that great strength of development and that great background in alliance, we see there is an important role to play. As our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said-and as Secretary Cheney first recognised this week-the United States is expanding its role in the Pacific Rim. It is important that a nation of such importance and standing as the United States continue to pay an active role in the Pacific, and certainly we should also play an active role. We owe it not only to future generations but also to those men and women who laid down their lives so many years ago to ensure that we had the opportunity to enjoy the freedom that we in the community now, sadly, often take for granted. On occasions such as this we are able to reinforce the sacrifice and the debt that we will never be able to repay to those men and women who gave their lives. I think that almost every family in this nation was touched in some way by the loss and sacrifice of war; certainly mine was. We can be very proud of those men and women of our nation who laid down their lives, and equally as proud of the United States personnel who also laid down their lives so unselfishly for us. Australia was a very small nation at that time, back in 1942, and certainly not on the world stage as much as it is now. I think our thoughts should also go to the families and homes across the United States that paid that sacrifice. The courage, precision and ability of both the US and the Australian services demonstrated that the Japanese were not invincible. That action in the Coral Sea was followed, not much later, by another significant action which actually put paid to Japanese aggression by naval forces. I refer to the Battle of Midway. With both battles completed, the Japanese expansion and aggression on the oceans came to a halt. It then centred on Admiral King tightening the naval grip on Japan and, of course, on the hard yakka done by the RAAF, along with the air forces of both countries and the Navy and land forces. They then had to take on the Japanese at places like Sanananda and Buna, Scarlet Beach, Kokoda, and then later Balikpapan and Tarakan; that is not to mention the battles further up on the islands which the United States navy and any participated in. Those battles were in places like Saipan and the like, and ultimately concluded when Japan surrendered after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That bombing was effective, but it was actually the naval blockade that ultimately sealed the fate of the Japanese.",35
21,Dr HARRY EDWARDS,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"I am pleased and honoured to support this motion brought forward by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). I express my appreciation to him for doing so. This motion acknowledges the special significance to Australia and Australians of this anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. This is, to the day, the fiftieth anniversary of the joining of battle in the Coral Sea between the American and Australian naval forces and the advancing Japanese force. This very hour, 11 a.m., marks the first action of the battle, which was at full pitch when American carrier aircraft from the Lexington and the Yorktown engaged the Japanese carrier Shoho, which was sunk. The course of battle over the two days, 7 and 8 May, has been ably described by the honourable member for Herbert and other speakers and I will not repeat it. What we need to recall is that at this time Australia, in face of the southern thrust of the Japanese, stood in great peril and very much alone. The US help seemed slow in coming, largely because of the great damage that was inflicted on American power at Pearl Harbour in December 1941. But in the Coral Sea, Australian and American forces joined together. In this battle there was the first halting of the Japanese drive to the south. It was followed a month later by the Battle of Midway-a battle in some ways more familiar than that of the Coral Sea because of the celebrated films made; a battle in which Japan lost four of its original 10 carriers, against sinking of one US carrier, the Yorktown. It was indeed a major defeat for the Japanese. It was these two battles-the Battle of the Coral Sea followed by the Battle of Midway-that marked the turning point of the Pacific war. The southern thrust did not end there. As a Sydneysider I recall the midget submarine attack on Sydney. In July the Japanese landed on the north coast of Papua New Guinea and the Kokoda Trail campaign was launched. That was halted at Amita Ridge, and then followed the difficult and costly fight back over the trail. In the month before, Japan suffered a decisive land defeat by Australian troops and RAAF aircraft at Milne Bay. We remember the fiftieth anniversary of all these campaigns and those who fought and died in them as we focus in this discussion on the Battle of the Coral Sea. In my capacity as Vice-Chairman of this Parliament's Australia-America Friendship Group, it has been a great privilege to participate in a series of functions in recent days to honour the men and women who served and died-some 540 Australian and American lives were lost-and to commemorate the forging of the Australian-United States alliance in that battle 50 years ago, since formally expressed in the ANZUS agreement. At this point I add my thanks to the CoralSea CommemorativeÂ· Council for the great and highly successful effort that has gone into the organisation of those events. In these days, there is much talk of the need for an increased Australian orientation towards Asia. In fact, the shift in economic outlook has long since begun. The old Far East is now the fast growing Asia-Pacific region, our Near North of great opportunity. Japan is now a friend and our largest trading partner, by itself taking more than half our merchandise exports-more than the United States and the European Community put together. The six countries of ASEAN buy more than the European Community's 12 countries, which includes Britain. It is a trend that may well accelerate as the European Community preoccupies itself with. its own internal market problems and relations with the post-Cold War eastern Europe, and as America looks to Canada and Mexico. 'Trade bloc' is a dirty term. We would be looking, in this Asia region, at an open and liberal regime. But that puts the wood on us to become internationally competitive-a lot more .than we are today-if we are to succeed and prosper as 'Asia's odd man in', as a recent issue of the Economist put it. To inject a current note, becoming internationally competitive is fundamentally what the Opposition's Fightback package is all about. It is what the Government's One Nation package is not about, but should be. At the same time as we have this orientation, we remain committed to Western ideas and values. This is going to result in some overt differences from time to time between ourselves and our Asian neighbours but all of us have to recognise and accept that. Our national security remains tied in with the Australia-America alliance-forged, as I said, in the battle we are commemorating-and thereby into the emerging world system of collective defence and security. I join in thanking the US Defense Secretary, Dick Cheney, and the US Education Secretary, Lemar Alexander, for their visit to this country to participate in these functions, as well as the US Ambassador, our good friend His Excellency Mel Sembler, for his strong support for the arrangements. Through them, I would certainly express the great bond of friendship between our two countries. I conclude by. referring again to the privilege of participating in the commemorative events of recent days. At the Coral Sea Ball in Sydney last Friday night it was a privilege for my wife and me to sit at a table with, among others, the comparatively youthful 'driver', to use the slang, the Captain of HMAS Adelaide, and a retired service veteran,. American naval pilot, and sometime test pilot in the tradition of the film The Right Stuff. There was something of a shadow over that evening with the severe testing by the riots and troubles in Los Angeles of the very freedom and democracy under the rule of law for which the men and women we are remembering served and died. Again the vast carrier Independence tied up in Sydney and it was a compelling sight. I recall visiting the Forestal, an older sister ship, in Portsmouth in 1957. But for me the most memorable image is that of the commemoration service at the Australian-American Memorial here in Canberra last Monday. Australian and US veterans of the Battle of the Coral Sea were honoured participants in that commemoration service; living links to the actual fighting 50 years ago. I conclude with the ringing words of the l11th Psalm in praise of the God who is sovereign over all the strivings, pursuits and imperfect achievements of men, as read at that commemoration service by the principal chaplain of the Royal Australian Navy. Psalm 111 states: Praise the Lord. I wiJI extol the Lord with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly. Great are the works of the Lord; they are pondered by all who delight in them. Glorious and majestic are his deeds. and his righteousness endures forever. He has caused his wonders to be remembered; the Lord is gracious and compassionate. The works of his hands are faithful and just; all his precepts are trustworthy. They are steadfast for ever and ever, done in faithfulness and uprightness. He provided redemption for his people; he ordained his covenant forever-holy and awesome is his name. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good understanding. To him belongs eternal praise.",37
22,Mr SNOW,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"Eden-Monaro) (11.39 p.m.)Previous speakers have described the devastating Coral Sea Battle and how attack and destruction led to a positive awakening in both Australia and the United States. As the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) said in moving this important motion, Tojo's forces brought peril to the relaxed lives of people of Australia and the United States. Both countries reacted with determination to the ferocious attack from Japan. World War II will, I hope, be the last world war, for it may be the last war in which the best of knowledge and equipment can be used, yet still leaving a world which can gain positively and learn lessons from war. The positives from a war could never outweigh the negatives, but they have been there. I would like to make brief mention of the positive effects on Australia, the United States and Japan of that disturbing encounter. I was a boy of five having a dink-I learnt the other day that that word is an Australian word-with my father on his bike from to Warragul to Darnum. Dad told me that we were at war. Later, he served briefly in the 6th Field Ambulance and, 17 years later, I served briefly in the same unit. Later in the war, we had visits from the United States forces. I can recall being wakened by noise and laughter in our kitchen. I went out to find my cousins-two young women-with a sailor. 'Who is that?', I asked. 'He is the wreck', one of them said, and they all laughed. The fact is that his name was impossible to pronounce at that time of Australia's history. We could pronounce it now quite readily, as we have people from all over the world in many of our electorates. As Kate Darian-Smith said in her book On the Home Front, at that time Australia had one of the most racially discriminatory im. migration policies in the world, and Australians were amazed by the different nationalities in the American Army as they came on furlough from the Coral Sea and other battles. European names provided a ready example of a cross-cultural society and may have contributed to some acceptance of Australian postwar migration policies. Ms Smith went on to describe how a Toorak matron telephoned the US morale section of to invite several officers to a at her home. She indicated that no Jews were to be included in the invitation, but when the day.arrived, she discovered a group of black privates standing on her doorstep. She exclaimed that there must be some mistake. She was told, 'No ma'am, our Major Cohen, he don't make no mistakes'. Such encounters may have contributed to our tolerance of the postwar migration policies and may have been an early positive effect on our liaison with United States. Just as Australians' continuing worry about people from overseas countries was cut back by the US racially mixed armed forces on leave from battle in Australia, the continuing tendency of the US to isolate itself from the world wasÂ· cut back by that war. It showed many in that country that to ignore the world was to flirt with danger. The extraordinary nation of Japan also grew in so many ways, and for them, defeat-the turnaround which followed the Battle of Coral $ea-brought great opportunities. Unlike the United States and Australia, Japan could not !>pend millions, escalating to billions, of dollars in value on defence. That gave Japan an advantage, but, more importantly, contributed to Japan's greatness today. Japan kept the only redeeming feature of fascism-he coordination and planning of private industry. It kept to its work ethic and it used in a better way what it had learnt from nonJapanese teachers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In a book titled Sentinel Hours by E. E. Speight, a professor of English in Japan, and printed in 1912-it is probably out of print now-Lafcadio Hearn, a writer who was in Japan before 1910, said in describing his I>tudents that there were the aggressive, there were the peace loving and all were hard working. Today, Japan, the United States and Australia are all working hard to build on our relationships. May the peace-lovers in all our countries thrive.",38
23,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"Injoining in the debate on this motion I thank the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) for moving it. I join in the debate for two reasons. The first is to speak party On behalf of my electorate of Dawson, from where much of the Coral Sea Battle emanated, and where many older residents remember not only World War II and what it meant as far as north Queensland was concerned but also particularly the Coral Sea Battle. The second is that I am one who remembers the occasion. I was living in the area at that time, and can fondly recall the Americans, what they did when they were on the recreation leave and the manner in which they were treated by north Queenslanders. One has to remember that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the Americans for what was achieved in protecting northern Australia and, in protecting northern Australia, all of Australia. The debt is all the more real because it was General MACArthur who did not abandon northern Australia like the Government of the day was prepared to do. The Brisbane Line lives very much in the minds of those people who lived and worked and saw the war from that perspective, when in actual fact the Government ofÂ· the day was prepared to abandon Australia from the Brisbane Line north and also Western Australia. We must pay that debt of gratitude to General MACArthur and then particularly to those Americans, Australians and all the other nationalities who came and fought from there. In fact, there are some suggestions that even 50 years afterwards there is still a Brisbane Line mentality drawn by southern Australia with regard to where we believe-and I am pretty sure that I can enjoin the honourable member for Herbert in this-the greatest opportunities for the future of Australia lie, that is, in Western Australia and northern Australia, which are what the Battle of the Coral Sea was all about. I was old enough to remember the Americans who used to come to Mackay as a base for rest and recreation. I remember, with my father and mother, taking these Americans for a weekend and showing them the sights and then sending them back to the Coral Sea. I can remember at that stage that there was an aircraft-in fact, it was until just a few years ago the largest military aircraft disaster in the annals of world history-which crashed just outside Mackay while leaving with people after their rest and recreation. We are now erecting a memorial to those people. There are other things. In the practice where I first worked-at G.E. Jones & Co. Chartered Accountants-the wife of one of the partners I worked for knew Eleanor Roosevelt because she organised the Red Cross unit to give the kitchen services and the food and also to try to put up these American servicemen as they came. They came to know Eleanor Roosevelt very well and to respect her greatly. My own wife lived just across from the station and she can recall the troop trains coming in and the manner in which these American and Australian servicemen so generously looked after and gave to the youngsters of that city. Never fear-we do have that debt and we do have a great memory of it. The other reason is that, in spite of what the honourable member for Herbert might say about the Battle of the Coral Sea coming out of Townsville-I acknowledge that as a centre for the attack on New Guinea eventuallyCid Harbour on the Whitsunday Island in the Whitsunday Passage was actually the collecting place for the battle fleet before it went to the Coral Sea Battle. My understanding is that it was joined there by Australian ships. One of them was the HMAS Canberra, so this coming together was actually out of the Dawson electorate at Cid Harbour. As one goes around those centres now, it is great to see what changes there have been. That which had been affected by turmoil and a wartime crisis has now been transformed into the lovely area it remains today. I repeat that we should never step aside from the allegiances that we owe the Americans, the British or any nation with whom we fought and. whom we helped and who came to our assistance at that time. Those allegiances are just as important today as they were during the time of the Coral Sea Battle. (TIme expired)",39
24,Mrs DARLING,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"I rise with others in this House today to remember the hu-an face of war, particularly as it was played out in the Coral Sea 50 years ago. Mr Lindsay-Today.",40
25,Mrs DARLING,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"Today. I thank the honourable member. The young men and women of Australia loyally followed the directions of their leaders in the interests of the national good. Over 1,000 Australians on the ships HMAS Hobart and HMAS Australia fought to ensure that Australia remained free. The chasm between the drawing board and the battlefield is obvious in the recorded history of the Coral Sea Battle as it is in other battles. The drawing board does not resemble the battlefield-far from it. Rear Admiral John Crace, RN, would have borne witness to this, as would the Australian servicemen on HMAS Australia and HMAS Hobart, along with their comrades on the US Chicago and US Perkins. On the morning of 7 May 1942, the commander of the combined force to defend the Coral Sea and head off the expected Japanese assault, Rear Admiral Fletcher, exercised his initiative to respond to the current situation by splitting his force, Task Force 17. He hived off the support group led by Rear Admiral Crace in order for them to intercept the invasion force as it exited from Jomard Passage. The problem for Crace was that his ships were thereby exposed to the possibility of an air attack without them having any fighter protection. With the passage of time the almost inevitable happened and the Japanese aircraft did attack. But this was beaten off by a combination of luck, pluck and extreme skill on the part of Rear Admiral Crace and the support group, notably our capable Australians servicemen in the Jomard Passage area who have been acknowledged as playing a most important part in the battle. The ensuing record of battle shows more than a battle plan, it shows the ingenuity of people having to deal with a series of errors which plagued both the Allied and the Japanese forces resulting in loss of lives on both sides and eventually leading to a situation where both sides, the Allies and the Japanese, have portrayed the Coral Sea Battle as a victory. One thing is certain, it is said that the historic ties of Australia and the US were melded at the Battle of the Coral Sea. Certainly today we honour that friendship without denying our new friendship with our trading partner, Japan. The city of Hiroshima bears witness to the end result, the end cost of the war of which the Coral Sea Battle was part, in a peac.e memorial which spells out graphically the human cost of the atomic bomb blast. In Australia we do not forget the cost of war in human terms and we pay tribute to those Australians who risked their lives to maintain peace in Australia, to their loved ones who followed their course with anxiety, and above all we remember those whose lives were cut short.",40
26,Mr CHARLES,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"I am delighted to have the opportunity to support this motion as an Australian with an American heritage. While I represent in this place the Australian people, nonetheless my heritage came from the United States. I remember well, as a child in 1942, listening to the radio and hearing reports of the war, particularly reports from the Pacific, as the battles unfolded. I recall studying in school the maps of the progress of war and I recall thinking how horrible it must have been for those men and those women caught on those battleships, facing enemy fire, and dying for a cause in which they so rightly and so justly believed. I felt very strongly, even at that early age, that war must surely be the last resort, that we must learn as human beings on this planet to resolve our differences in places like this House of Representatives where we can debate issues, discuss issues, where we can disagree, and where we can resolve our differences without war. But today we come to celebrate the joining together of two great nations in a great battle at Coral Sea. In school, as a child, I learned that Australians were fierce warriors. I must admit that at school I learned very little else about Australia. Our history lessons were steeped in the traditions of Europe and Russia and we learned very little about the history of Australia. But we did know that Australians had a great reputation as warriors. The Battle of the Coral Sea, which we celebrate today, began a bond of friendship between our two nations. It was the cement that held us together. The bond had actually been made on the goldfields in the 1850s when Australia was invaded by Americans who came to chase Victorian gold. We have maintained a great friendship over the years. I hope that following the recent visits by the American President and two secretaries of state that that bond and that relationship will continue and that it will help us to better take our place in this modem world, where communications bring us all so much closer together. I remind the House that there are differences between our countries. Australia is not the fifty-first state of the United States. I am reminded that I, in some respects, became an Australian citizen over that issue. The company that I worked for, owned by Americans, saw us as being so similar to them, with so few differences, that a person here, some 13,000 miles away, should be able to understand attitudes that were felt in that country as people were thinking their thoughts, but not writing them down. Australia is not the fifty-first state of the United States nor is it any longer a colony of Great Britain. Today, we celebrate history. We were once a colony of Great Britain. Fifty years ago, we fought a great battle together with the United States. That battle was a turning point in a great war-a war that we despise the necessity for, but which helped us to preserve our freedom. Today, we, the living, pay our respects and offer our thanks to those valiant men and women who gave their lives for their vision of freedom and independence in this world.",41
27,Dr CATLEY,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"Adelaide) (11.58 a.m.)Writing of the result of the Battle of the Coral Sea in Eagle Against the Sun, Ronald Spector concludes: The Japanese were in no position to take advantage of Fletcher's retirement. (The) Striking Force was left with only one carrier . . . low on fuel with lower than forty aircraft ... half an air group insufficient to provide air cover for the Port Moresby invasion ... The attack on Port Moresby was postponed-as it turned out forever ... The 'vital flank' remained secure. This result led the Japanese to attack across New Guinea and they were, in tum, repelled by predominantly Australian force of arms. It is often alleged that the capture of Port Moresby would not have produced an invasion of Australia. Japanese war cabinet records are cited to this effect. I must say that I am unimpressed. Circumstances dictate strategic options, and the Coral Sea and Kokoda Trail victories ruled it out. To that extent, these battles stand alongside the contempqrary battles of Britain and Stalingrad, Burma and Moscow, as those which halted the strategic advance of the Axis powers. They were the markings of the end of the beginning and the beginning of the end. Thus it was with much emotion that I laid an official wreath at the Port Moresby Australian War Cemetery last November. The eventual end of the war did not produce an orgy of revenge, despite the brief and lightly dealt purges of 1945-47. Instead, Australian and American occupying forces set about creating an order based on liberal and representative government in East Asia. This was good strategy and good philosophy. Japan's militaristic regime had been aggressive, in large measure from domestic circumstances of isolated authoritarianism, but its domestic democratic opponents could not resist the logic that the Europeans had created empires by force and then excluded Japan from their spoils. After 1945 the Australian and American victors jointly pursued a post-colonial, open, free and democratic Asia-Pacific region. In hindsight, with full hindsight vision, the pursuit of this goal justly deserves the tribute that it receives in this motion. By the 1990s the region over which Japan had sought dominion justly claims to be the fastest growing in the world economy. Its rate of growth, of technological innovation and of political advance has been on the whole nothing short of miraculous. Much of this has, of course, been due to the energy of the was people who live in the region. But some credit must also be attributed to the foresight of the victorious American and Australian allies and their determination to create and defend an open and liberal regional order, to the determined defence of the sea lanes on which its trade has been based, and to their support for liberal political values and regimes. This strategic mission has not been without false moves. The handling of the nascent Chinese revolutionary regime must rank as a 20-year-Iong miscalculation. The too ready adoption of the military option in Vietnam still extracts a price today. Burma was ignored for far too long and the Philippines dictatorship was humoured too readily. The blemishes of regional conflicts, of outbreaks of repression and continuing poverty cannot be denied, and the record of a racist and often paranoid component to Australia's Asian diplomacy in the 1950s and 1960s is very hard to deny. But in the half-century sweep since the Battle of the Coral Sea, the project which began then of cooperation between our two great countries, that was then constructed in the early 1950s and pursued resolutely to this day, must rank as a geo-strategic success. In a culture and in an age that disdain triumphalist history, and not without justification, it give me great pleasure to support a motion of tribute to the basis of the Australian-United States relationship and its achievements during the last half century, and to express my support for its continuing development.",42
28,Mrs SULLIVAN,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"On 9 May 1990, I pointed out to this House that we were then just two years away from the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. I paid tribute at that time to courage of the Australians and British-but particularly the Americans-who so gallantly and ably defended Australia in the Battle of the Coral Sea. For all my life, I have been aware of this critical World War II battle and its significance to Australia. I was born in Brisbane on 8 March 1942, exactly two months earlier. Some. of my few memories from my earliest childhood are of American servicemen. One million of them passed through Brisbane during the war and my parents, like many Brisbanites, befriended a number of these young men and did their best to give them a 'home away from home' whenever they took respite in Brisbane from the war in the Pacific. My earliest consciousness that there was a world outside my suburb was overheard adult conversation about the Brisbane Line, that infamous line drawn from east to west through the body of the Australian continent starting at Brisbane, north of which Australia was considered undefendable. At least, that was the view of our political and military masters of the time, all of whom were at least 600 miles south of the line. Throughout my life I have therefore understood the particular emotions stirred in my parents' generation by the so-called threat from the north. I can understand the horror with which my parents, like so many other Australians in those darkest days, helplessly watched the apparently unstoppable advance of the Japanese armed forces as they conquered Malaya and Singapore, Indonesia, the Solomons and northern New Guinea, culminating in their victory in the Philippines in the battle for Corregidor on 6 May 1942. Mention of the Brisbane Line froze their hearts and minds as they waited in dread for what lay ahead for them and their children. In the light of this, it is surely possible, even 50 years hence, to understand the impact on average Australians in 1942 of the news of the first ever success in stopping the Japanese advance, namely, the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7 and 8 May. In the very few minutes available to me today, I want to pay tribute to all those who have worked to keep to the fore the sigthe nificance of the Battle of the Coral Sea over the intervening decades. It is all very well to remember an occasion when the fiftieth anniversary occurs. In my view, those who have sought the limelight this year-when everyone is looking-are not those to whom honour is due today: that honour goes to many nameless people who have faithfully observed the occasion and steadfastly paid tribute to its significance year by year since 8 May 1942. I truly doubt that there would have been a comparable celebration of this event had they not 'kept the faith' through the intervening decades, often in the face of indifference, sometimes outright hostility. The first public commemoration of the Battle of the Coral Sea was initiated in 1946 by the Victorian Division of the AustralianAmerican Association, an organisation formed in Sydney in 1936. The first Annual Coral Sea Ball was also held in 1946 in Sydney. These events were the genesis of what became known throughout Australia as Coral Sea Week, and they continue to this day. Ever since 1946 the Battle of the Coral Sea has been observed annually at public ceremonies in all our capital cities-Darwin, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane-as well as Wagga, Launceston, the Gold Coast and, in more recent years, Cairns and Townsville. Ever since 1950 the US Government has been officially represented by a personal presidential envoy, the first being Admiral Raford. Other envoys' names which W-- still familiar are Admiral Halsey in 1954, General Doolittle in 1956, Casper Weinberger in Â·1975, Nancy Kissinger in 1976 and Vice-President Bush in 1982. This year President Bush has sent dual envoys Secretary of Defense Cheney and Secretary of Education Alexander. Additionally, many senior US naval personnel have paid fonnal visits during Coral Sea Week over the years, notably two CINCPACs-the acronym for Commander-inChief of the Pacific Fleet: Admiral Lyons in 1986 and 1987, Admiral Jeremiah in 1988 and 1989. At one of the 1986 Coral Sea ceremonies, Admiral - Ace' Lyons unveiled a plaque on the memorial wall outside the Southport RSL, which had been donated by retired US servicemen who now live on the Gold Coast. It bears an inscription which I believe states exactly who and what we are honouring here today. The words are from a speech by Air Marshal Selwyn D. Evans, Chief of Air Staff, RAAF. They are: For the first time in our history we were under threat of invasion. We were saved from that threat by our good friend and ally, the United States of America, through the strength, courage and dedication of her fighting forces. We are grateful. We will remember.",43
29,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"I am happy to support this motion and I commend my colleagues the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) for initiating it. I am sure that it will have the support of all honourable members. I am pleased that I am being followed by the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in this debate. It is a significant debate because, on this day, at this time, the Battle of the Coral Sea was being fought. It is something that we ought not overlook in tenns of our historical understanding. My consciousness, and that of many honourable members in this House, was fonned in the post-1945 world. It was fonned by my family and my friends who told me, as a child, of their experiences in the war. It became very clear to me, and I am sure to those who went through the process, that the Battle of the Coral Sea was really the turning point in tenns of the marine based Japanese offensive against targets to the south, including Australia. It was also clear to me that, if it had not been for the role of the United States, Australia would have been in an extremely precarious position. They were very dark days. They were days in which Australia's resources were stretched and in which our capacity to conduct military engagements of this kind was completely beyond the resources we could commit. But for the support of the United States Australia would have been in a very bad position indeed. I believe it was from the experience of that battle that Australia began to realise that it was a regional player. If one looks at the experience since World War II, Australia had to begin to understand its role and to work out its relationship in the region, and also to understand that the United States was to be a key player in the region. I say many times to young people at schools that it was the experience in the Coral Sea that really became a major underpinning of Australia's postwar foreign policy. It was an underpinning based on the fact that we had survived in what were very precarious circumstances. There are many other elements to it which need to be acknowledged. The contributions of Australian forces in Kokoda have been talked about in recent times, and properly acknowledged, and Australia contributed to many other theatres. So Australian forces were involved with allied forces not simply in one event but in a series of events in winning what amounted to a series of battles and finally the war. I find it interesting in hindsight because much was made of what happened later in the war. The dropping of the bomb completely shaped thinking in my lifetime. We have only more recently begun to understand that we can live in a world in which we would hope that the threat of nuclear destruction has now passed. I do not believe it has passed completely. In fact, we need to be ever vigilant, particularly as the capacity for third powers to engage is something to be considered. But it is important that we understand that this battle was fundamental to the outcome of the war. It had many interesting characteristics. It was significant because it was one of those major naval battles in which aircraft carriers played a prominent role. It also, therefore, made Australians think about the role of aircraft carriers in relation to war and our commitment. It is interesting that Australia no longer has an aircraft carrier capacity. That is because we now realise that land based capacity is significant in terms of the engagements that we might anticipate. I simply say, in relation to my contribution to this debate, and in acknowledging the fine sentiments of the honourable member for Herbert, the honourable member for Casey and my other colleagues, that Australia does recognise, and this Parliament does recognise, that the Battle of the Coral Sea was very important for Australia. We certainly want to place on record our appreciation of what the US Congress has done and certainly what those very brave service personnel did at that time. In what was a very dark hour for Australia, it certainly saw a change in the war and, gladly, a satisfactory outcome for Australia. I thank the House for listening.",44
30,Mr SINCLAIR,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"I rise to endorse the motion, to commend the memory and the sacrifice of those who served in the Battle of the Coral Sea and to .express a few words about both that occasion and the future. In so doing, could I first seek the consent of the mover of the motion, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and the seconder, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), to make a slight modification to the second paragraph of the motion in that there are, in fact, three members of the United States Cabinet in Australia. The third, whose name is not mentioned in the motion, is Secretary of the Army, Michael Stone, with whom numbers of us were present at the EI Alamein ceremony at Puckapunyal the other day. I have raised this at the beginning of my remarks, but I would be grateful if the processes could be followed so that we can include that other name in the motion. I know I have the approval of the mover of the motion and the seconder. I seek leave of the House to have the motion amended by the inclusion of that third name. Leave granted.",45
31,Mr SINCLAIR,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"I thank the House, and I thank the mover and the seconder. Secretary Stone, I might briefly add, is quite a remarkable American Cabinet Minister. He served, in fact, in the Royal Navy. As I understand it, his father was an American serving in the United Kingdom and he completed his naval service at Williamtown which, of course, is a Royal Australian Air Force base in New South Wales. I want to reflect on the fact that the Battle of the Coral Sea was not only a turning point in the war and of such tremendous importance to Australia-the significance at the time and the atmosphere of 1942 are difficult for us to recall now, 50 years on-but also a turning point in naval warfare. The Battle of the Coral Sea was the first occasion when the great forces of aircraft carriers became dominant strategically. Of course, it was followed not long after by the Battle of Midway and from then there has been the exercise of power through aircraft carriers that has dominated the world to the present time. So, strategically, it was not only an important event for Australia but also significant in the changes it brought to the nature and character of warfare. However, it is on the future that I wanted to speak. The beginnings of that AustralianAmerican relationship go way back to the days of first settlement, but the military links and the strategic links and the links towards the pursuit of peace that led to the formation of ANZUS in the postwar years in fact began at the Battle of the Coral Sea. The lessons of that relationship are important. Sadly I have not time to canvass them all, but to my mind the ANZUS relationship is as important today as it has been at any time during the Cold War. Strategically, the world has changed. There is no doubt that the forces that saw the clash of the superpowers are now, thank goodness, at rest. There are disturbances that flow, whether it is the Saddam Husseins, whether it is the terrorism of the Gadaffis, whether it is the instability in countries like Cambodia, where our own forces are now serving to try to restore peace and ensure a democratic election, or whether it isÂ· in the changing circumstances which affect so many countries of the region. But the pax Americana, of which Australia is an important part, exists largely because of that ANZUS involvement and our relationship with the United States. To those who are concerned about that relationship, let me emphasise that our role as a small nation, able to persuade our bigger brother, is a critical part of the heritage of that Battle of the Coral Sea. We may be smaller, we may not be as significant in world terms, but we have an enormous influence on the United States. That is something that is reflected not only in the presence of Secretary Cheney, Secretary Alexander and Secretary Stone but in the words spoken by President Bush during his recent visit to Australia and by the feeling of all those who now are celebrating that brief but significant occurrence on 7 May and 8 May, 50 years ago.",45
32,Dr THEOPHANOUS,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"I also am happy to participate in this debate and to support this motion. I want to say that, as someone who spent two years living in the United States and teaching at a university in the United States, I came to know the American people well. Sometimes the image that we gain of the American people overseas is not necessarily a correct one. I believe that the American people are a very strong, dynamic, diverse, multicultural society that we have much in common with. While there are many things that we can learn from them, there are also some things that they can learn from us. It is significant, I think, that in the last 50 years the American people and the Australian people have had close links as a result, I think, of those that were forged during this period that we are celebrating with this motion. I know that until the last decade many Americans had often not heard of Australia, but there is no doubt that Australians of every walk of life are increasingly making an impact when they go to the United States, not only in entertainment and films and television and music but also in other fields. I was one of the first Australians actually to teach in postwar period at an American university but I know that there are many others who have actually taught there since that time. What is important is that this celebration be seen as a further strengthening of the links between the two peoples. Of course, there have been times when there have been differences between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States, and we should not pretend that that has not happened. Nevertheless, what is significant is that notwithstanding such differences the very strong links between the peoples have remained. I believe that there is still much more that can be done. I think that there are many Americans who would like to visit Australia to see our unique culture and to see the way in which we have handled many of the problems which they also encountered, and, in particular, mass immigration. The United States has been built on immigration and it is interesting that during the period when Australia more or less closed its immigration doors-I am referring to the period from the 1890s to the 1940s-the United States was by far the biggest immigrant-accepting country in the world and actually brought in millions and millions of people and built its version of a multicultural society. Since the war the United States has continued its immigration program but where we have differed is that we initiated our very large immigration program and have totally transformed the nature of Australian society. I guess that in some ways, since that period, we have become a melting pot, just like the United States. We have much to learn from the Americans and their experience and they have something to learn from our experience. I think that the bravery of the people who fought in the war and in the Battle of the Coral Sea has been remarked on by other speakers. Let me just say that I agree with the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that the battles in the Second World War really helped to establish us as a nation, helped us to forge very strong links with the the American people and also forge much of our postwar experience in terms of defence and foreign policy. I believe that what is important is, as I said, the continuing links between the two peoples and the ever improving relations between them.",46
33,Mr ATKINSON,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"l am very pleased to join this morning's debate on the motion moved by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) and seconded by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halversori). The fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea is well worth remembering as it is surely one of the most important occasions in Australia's military history. There is no doubt that the joint American and Australian fleet saved Australia from invasion and it was certainly a turning point in the Pacific war. Together, Australia and the United States resisted the military might and expansion of Japan and cemented for all time a military and friendship bond between our two great nations. The strength of the alliance between Australia and the United States was evident during President Bush's visit to Australia in early January of this year. The President's speech to the joint sitting of Federal Parliament on 2 January 1992 was testimony of the close ties between our two nations. For the record I remind honourable members of President Bush's reference to the Battle of the Coral Sea: Fifty years ago hi the Coral Sea, Australians and Americans paid a high price for freedom. But they proved to the world that the future belongs to the brave and the bold. For the half century since, we have deepened our friendship, our economic interdependence and our collaboration on mutual defence. Now, more clearly than ever, we can see a hopeful future for the far-flung kinsmen of Australia and America and for all who share those fundamental ideals that we hold dear. We are prepared to work as partners in the next century to break new ground for freedom, cooperation and economic progress. I am certain that the vast majority of Australians would concur with the sentiments of President Bush. I join the mover of the motion and other honourable members in welcoming to Australia those American veterans who are participating in the various remembrance ceremonies being conducted throughout Australia. To these veterans we say: welcome back to Australia and thank you for your courage and bravery, 50 years ago, in the Battle of the Coral Sea. I also welcome to our shores two representatives of the American Government, Secretary of Defense Cheney and Secretary of Education Alexander. To have two such distinguished gentlemen in Australia representing the American Government is evidence of the importance placed on this occasion by President Bush and his administration. Part 4 of the motion before the House reaffirms the continuing importance of security and cooperation between the United States and Australia. Australia's military and security relations with the United States were forged in the dark days of World War II. World War II brought about a reassessment of Australia's defence needs and capabilities. As a result, the strong alliance with the United States of America was formed. This alliance was formalised with the signing of the ANZUS Treaty in 1951. Since that time, Australian and American service men and women have fought side by side in three wars: in Korea, Vietnam and most recently in the Gulf. The security of the United States and of Australia is inextricably liriked, and the ANZUS Treaty is fundamental to that relationship. The final part of the motion before the House expresses strong support for the continued close cooperation between the United States and Australia on economic and security issues in Asia and the Pacific. To this end, Australians can take great comfort from the words of President George Bush in his address to the joint sitting of the Federal Parliament. He said: Clearly, with the dramatic changes in the world we must adapt to the new security realities as well. But let me simply pledge to you, our friends: no matter what changes cotne about in the defence expen:uitures in the United States, or in the nature of the threats to international peace, the US-Australian alliance is fundamental to the stability of the Asia Pacific region. Australia should take much comfort from that commitment by President Bush. I have great pleasure in supporting the motion before the House.",47
34,Mr SCHOLES,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"Corio) (12.28 p.m.)_l i have very great pleasure in joining in the debate on this motion. I think the importance of the occasion is demonstrated by the number of very important people who were our allies in this battle who have come to Australia from the United States. They include the Secretary of the Army, Mr Michael Stone, and the Secretary of the Navy, Mr H. Lawrence Garrett, who are both in Australia for these celebrations- These are very important people and a gathering such as this is very unusual. I lived through that period. I was very young, but I recall the drama of the time. I have heard those who were involved talking about it. My father was in New Guinea during the period of the Second World War. There is no doubt that every Australian, 3nd certainly every Australian leader, at the time believed that Australia was under threat. I have no doubt that, no matter what academics might find 50 years later, a real threat did exist for Australia. Whilst they may not have planned it, had the Japanese had an easy victory on the Kokoda Trail, or had they been able to get a decisive victory in the Battle of the Coral Sea, they would have been a threat to Australia itself. Those in Townsville and Darwin know well that war did take place on Australian soil. I think it is unfortunate that some, in trying to justify some political end of their own and not a political end party-wise, have suggested, even on Coral Sea Day itself, that we should have left our troops in the Middle East, fought the European war and ignored Australia. I want to say that every person who fought in the Coral Sea Battle, and everyone who fought in New Guinea, fought because they believed they were fighting for Australia and because they believed that their lives were placed on the line in the interests of their country. So I believe that it is quite improper for anyone to suggest that any Australian leader of that time could have taken any decision other than that which was taken.",48
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"Mr Truss)Order! It being 12.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with sessional order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. The honourable member for Corio will have leave to continue his remarks. Does the honourable member for Herbert wish to make an explanation? Mr Lindsay- Mr Deputy Speaker, I understand the honourable member for Corio wanted to continue his remarks on a certain aspect.",48
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,I understood that there was a wish to make an explanation in lieu of the proposal to proceed with an amendment. Mr Lindsay-I am prepared to accept the explanation and the seconder is prepared to accept the explanation in lieu of the amendment.,48
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BATTLE OF THE CORAL SEA,"As I understand it, there was a proposal to include additional names by way of amendment. Now it is the wish of the House to just refer to them by way of explanation. Mr Smith-That would be a very good idea, particularly in the case of the sixtyeighth Secretary of the Navy, H. Lawrence Garrett III, who was in Hobart and Launceston. I am sure that all of us would want to include him and his colleagues in the motion where we can-if not formally, certainly by way of explanation; NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Australia's Wartime History",48
38,Mr BRADFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I have the great privilege of being a patron of the Coral Sea Battle Commemorative Association along with ViceAdmiral Sir David Stevenson, retired, and Air Commodore Kingwell, retired. The Gold < Coast based Coral Sea Battle Commemorative Association arose from friendly discussions about the Coral Sea Battle between a small group of Allied ex-service men and women, including the late American Colonel Bennett D. Farnham of the US Army. There was until recently almost total ignorance of this histori cal event. Today's debate has been extremely helpful in raising public awareness of the importance of the Battle of the Coral Sea. I must pay great tribute this afternoon to Mrs Audrey Wicks, the honorary secretary of the Commemorative Association since 1987. Audrey has almost single-handedly produced the marvellous and comprehensive historic book entitled Coral Sea Log. It is a chronicle of events in and around and above the Coral Sea area and its surrounding land and sea masses during April and May 1942. It really is a magnificent tribute to all involved. I congratulate the Association and Mrs Wicks for their work. The year 1992 is an extremely significant one for us as we look back to the events of 50 years ago. It is a pity, I believe, that recollections and commemorations have been so distorted and offended by the recent attempts of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to rewrite our history for purely political reasons. The timing of his campaign to change the flag and to push republicanism is a disgrace. Even the places he has chosen to do this-Indonesia and Papua New Guineawere inappropriate. Nobody argues that there cannot be such debates. This is a democracy. Ironically, for this freedom of speech that so many the Prime Minister has offended actually fought. His worse remarks have been traitorous and he stands condemned. His brand of patriotism is foreign to many Australians and we reject it completely. Whenever Australians have served they have done so with distinction. I was proud to have served in South Vietnam as an Australian. Our soldiers did everything that Was asked of them there. We went there in the first place to support our allies, as we have done consistently and most recently in the Gulf war. The Prime Minister's recent attempts to rewrite Australian history, as I say, have been deplorable. He was recently described as the nation's self-appointed wandering lecturer in history. His remarks about the role of our closest ally, Great Britain, in the fall of Singapore in the early 1940s were not only wrong but also extremely offensive to everyone involved. Perhaps it is time for us to reflect today and to thank those 31,000 Australians who became prisoners of war during World War II. The greatest numbers were prisoners of the Japanese Imperial Army; there were 22,516 who had that fate. Of those, 7,964 died in captivity and many have died since as a result of their experiences, especially those who worked on the infamous Burma railway. It is impossible for ordinary people to comprehend how one human being can treat another in such a monstrous way-but it is still done today. For a number of prisoners of war of the Japanese who survived the abuse and deprivation of the Burma railway and Changi our and other places, there was worse to come. Some were victims of the sinking of the Japanese transport ships en route to Tokyo, ironically by American submarines, which, of course, did not know what a valuable cargo was on board. These events were recently recounted in the book Return from the River Kwai. Reading the book is a moving experience. The two Japanese ships Rakiyo Maru and Kachidoki Maru had thousands of Australian and British it is prisoners of war on board. Most perished when those ships were sunk. Those few rescued by American submarines spent up to six days in shark infested waters without food or water. Acting Prime Minister Forde, speaking in the House of Representatives at the time, spoke for an hour with a detailed account of the sinking of the Rakiyo Maru and the horrors and atrocities of the Burma-Thailand railway. Mr Forde paid tribute in that speech to the survivors. He said: They have shown themselves undaunted in the face of death. . The Sydney Morning Herald was one of many papers that next day headlined the story. Its headline was 'Japanese left prisoners to drown'. Two of the survivors of that particular tragedy, who were on that ship and spent those six days in the water, live in my electorate of MCPherson on the Gold Coast. I pay tribute today to Leo Cornelius and Ross Smith and I wish them well. The Prime Minister's comments at Kokoda contrasted in a most invidious fashion the role our soldiers played there with the role of those who had defended Australia in the Middle East. My father served in the 6th Division of the 2nd AIF there. It is incredible that the Prime Minister should have sought at Kokoda to diminish in some way the role, for example, of the 9th Division under General Morshead at Tobruk-they were the. so-called Rats of Tobruk. The siege at Tobruk was one of the most famous battle honours in the history of Australia's militaryÂ· forces. It has been described in some circles as the Gitllipoli of World War II. Here for the first time the Germans were shown to be resistible. The defence of Tobruk cost 823 Australian lives. Does the J>rime Minister suggest that their sacrifice there was somehow less than those brave soldiers who gave their lives at Kokoda? Churchill's message to General Morshead in May 1941 is immortal. He said: The whole Empire is watching your steadfast and spirited defence of this most important outpost Egypt with gratitude and admiration. In fact, the first two years of the war were an important preparation for the great struggle in the Pacific which was to follow. The three divisions of the AIF that had served there fought the Germans, the Italians and some of the French, and they learned much about modem warfare in the process. Valuable experience was gained. The eventual return of those battle hardened divisions was a significant element in the fight against and the defeat of the Japanese. I use strong words here this morning because the sentiments I am expressing are shared by many Australians and particularly those who have served their country in war. The hypocrisy of the Prime Minister's remarks in recent days, particularly when we contrast his criticism of Menzies with his embracing of Curtin, is unbelievable. In fact, I am prepared to concede that Curtin was a great wartime leader and a man for whom I have the utmost respect. But the Labor Party at the time was not unlike some elements of the Labor Party today. The Calwells and Wards, as we read from the history of that time, attempted at every turn to undermine the war effort. They were more concerned then about the class war in Australia than they were about the World War. We note from the history that Curtin was faced with a split in the Labor Party, as Billy Hughes had been during the First World War in 1916, on the issue of conscription. Earlier today we had a bipartisan debate on the Battle of the Coral Sea. It was a significant battle, and it is important that we remember those events as the war came close to Australia and Australia was threatened. But let us not diminish in any way the brave acts and the contribution that those soldiers made to the defence of Australia in the early dark years of the war. April 1941, for example, was a very dark time of the war, as the Germans appeared to be invincible. Yet the Rats of Tobruk stood up against the Germans and turned back Rommel just as, in the Coral Sea 50 yea- ago, the allied forces for the first time turned back the Japanese. The Prime Minister's comments at Kokoda of contrasted in a most invidious way, and are to be deplored. The debate earlier today in respect of the Battle of the Coral Sea was bipartisan, and it should have been. As a member of this place, I want to be extremely vigilant that the lessons of the past in relation to the defence of this country are not forgotten. Mr S. Plenty",48
39,Mr ONEIL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My grievance is about a man and his wife in my electorate, Mr and Mrs Syd Plenty, who, for the last 24 years, have suffered a most scandalously inhumane injustice at the hands of the legal system. To tell the whole story of this couple's traumatic experience inÂ· 10 minutes is totally impossible, so I will touch only on their principal problem. The background of these people is worthy  married he spent six months in the national service in preparation to defend this country with his life. Immediately after they were married in January 1959, he and his wife left their families in South Australia and went to Albany in Western Australia to pioneer a virgin block of land, with very meagre ces. Living in a caravan for the first seven years, with no electricity, as true pioneers would they worked tirelessly as a husband and wife team to clear their land, as well as raising three children. However, just when they were beginning to get on top of things and were branching out in a .further farming property, in June 1968 they were involved in a motor car accident in which no liability whatsoever was attached to them. However, they were both injured. Mr Plenty'S injuries were severe enough to force him off his newly developed farm as he was no longer able to do the work required of him  injured in his right knee and in his back. On the advice of his doctors he gave his surgeon unrestricted permission to operate on his right knee and remove the whole of his kneecap. He underwent surgery the day after the accident, but it was not until later that Mr Plenty learnt that the surgeon removed only a part of the kneecap. The surgeon assured  100 per cent recovery. However, this failed to  great deal of pain and distress.  soever from either his original surgeon or his specialist orthopaedic surgeon in Perth that any further surgery or treatment would ev!!r improve his disabilities, let alone cure them. Therefore, believing that any further surgery would be hnprudent, and also being forced at that stage by the compulsory government third party insurance company to decide whether to accept a meagre offer of settlement  to the third party claims tribunal of Western Australia, believing that he would be justly treated and compensated for his pain and suffering, his incapacities and his economic losses. However, contrary to the evidence, the trial  reasonable in not undergoing further surgery, as the judge believed that some further  period of time, even to the extent of stiffening the leg as a cure. As such, he said that Mr resour- Plenty had been unreasonable in not mitigating his damages. Consequently, the  pensation whatsoever for his pain, incapacity or economic losses.  expecting that the higher court, the Full Court of the Supreme Court o.f Western Australia, would be more just. The appeal court said that in its judgment the trial judge was wrong in believing that further surgery would cure  there was no evidence to support that this would be so, and that therefore the trial judge had assessed his damages on a completely wrong basis. However, the appeal court also decided that in order to get his damages assessed correctly  Implicit in what it said was that if he refused to have any further surgery before going to a retrial he could be devastatingly penalised for failing to mitigate his damages, to such an extent that he could lose all, including having all costs given against him. This was even though it had already accepted that there was no evidence of any real prospect of any cure, for any length of time, from any further surgery being carried out. The appeal court judges departed from the recognised standard of proof in cases where a claimant is accused of not mitigating his damages. They falsely applied every authority they used so that they insidiously shifted the  for him to have any chance of success of qualifying for any compensation, he would be compelled to become like a mercenary and forced to undergo some unwarranted, unrecommended, mad operation in order to prove that further surgery would fail and that he was not unreasonable. This insidious and appalling judgment  'can't win' situation. Amongst other things, it is totally contrary to the International Declaration of Human Rights and our own Human Rights Act through the compulsion it  before he has any chance at all of receiving justice. The consequence of this state of affairs is that the Plentys are left with a very perplexing and absolutely untenable situation. They have made every possible effort known to them, including trying to get solicitors to responsibly seek a remedy in the courts of this country. However, every solicitor they have approached has given them plenty of sympathy but has refused to take their instructions so that a remedy can be found to a situation which has cost them thousands of dollars over the years. Because of the failure of solicitors, the Plentys have been forced into the unwanted situation of having to represent themselves in various legal matters resulting from the car accident. They have discovered, firstly, that there is a fault with the High Court rules which prevents them from representing themselves, or from seeking leave to appeal to the High Court. The Plentys say that this is a result of the High Court judges' attitude to section 78 of the Judiciary Act. Order 69A rule 11 of the High Court rules restricts such an application to counsel. The High Court judges also have made it very clear to the Plentys, by inference, that even when there is a right for them to represent themselves, they will not allow this to occur. Secondly, the Plentys have discovered that there is a conflict of interest between solicitors and the courts, in that solicitors officers of the court and their first duty is to the protection of the court and not to their client. That means that where there is a fault with the court against the client, such as in the Plentys' case, then solicitors will generally not take up that fault with the court. Thirdly, the Plentys have discovered that the High Court has obstructed them from commencing any proceedirtgs themselves in the High Court. The end result is that the Plentys have been unable to get this matter resolved because, with or without solicitors, they are unable to take the matter to the High Court, which is the only Court that has jurisdiction to remedy the problem. It is a complete denial of justice through absolutely no fault of their own. Mr and Mrs Plenty have suffered the burden of this injustice now for some 24 years, in which time it has created untold problems with the whole of their affairs, including their taxation affairs-as is obvious from their taxation files. Over the years these problems have been brought to the attention of all members of parliament, including Treasurers, but without solution. Their taxation problems even went so far in 1984 that they were falsely imprisoned asÂ·a result of action taken by the Taxation Office. This has all taken an enormous toll upon the health and well-being of these people. I know these people personally and I have a great respect for the genuineness of their problem, for the efforts they have made to have their problems resolved, and for their forbearance. I am sure that none of us in this House would have the forbearance of these people. Therefore, it is an utter disgrace upon this Parliament that nothing constructive has ever been done to resolve these people's problems. The Plentys have been told by many legal people, including some in this Parliament, that they have no doubt what complete injustice but no-one has ever given him a solution. I therefore put it to the Attorney-General that it is high time that he and the Parliament did something constructive to find a solution to these people's untenable situation to allow are them to pick up the pieces of their lives and lead a normal life. To do this, I believe, and Mr and Mrs Plenty believe, that the Attorney General should be compelled to make a genuine effort to thoroughly inquire into their problems. Particularly he should make time to meet with them and hear their whole story and their views as to what can be done to help resolve the matter. The Plentys say that one thing that might help them is if legislation could be altered, or else made, in two areas. The first change is in the area of the High Court rules or the Judiciary Act, to allow personal representation to the High Court upon seeking leave to appeal. The second is that appropriate legislation be made to remove solicitors as officers of the Court. This would remove any conflict of interest, so that there would be absolutely no fetter placed upon solicitors to represent their clients as their first duty, instead of, as currently, acting as Judases. The State courts would eventually follow, as the State courts are generally-if not entirely-bound by precedents set by the High Court. This is a very sad case indeed, but I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), is at the table today. I personally request him to take this matter up with the Attorn-y-General and to see that justice be done for these people after 24 years of hurt and vilification that has been carried out against them. It is a sad case indeed, and I certainly hope that this Parliament can rectify these people's problems. ' Battle of the Coral Sea",50
40,Mr TAYLOR,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Groom) (12.51 p.m.)Earlier in this place we heard one of the most people. substantial contributions to bipartisan support on an issue that it has been my pleasure experience in four years in the Federal Parmand liament. I congratulate honourable members on both sides of this chamber for their dividual and collective comment and wisdom on one of the most significant battles World War II in the Pacific area. I offer congratulations as both the Federal member for Groom and one who served proudly three decades in the Senior Service of Defence Force before coming into this I congratulate the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), in particular, who was the architect of the earlier motion. I also congratulate Sir Eric Neal and his national committee for their organisation of the Sea celebrations and their coordination of activities right across the country. As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary one of Australia's most significant naval conflicts, the Battle of the Coral Sea, it is important to reflect on some of the historical background. Early in 1942, Allied political leaders agreed that the United States would accept responsibility for the Pacific theatre, including Australia and New Zealand, and that Britain would be responsible for Indian Ocean and Middle East theatres. The European and Atlantic areas would be a joint US and British responsibility. From Australia's point of view this basic grand strategy, to beat Hitler first, was both significant and emotive. This meant that, in spite of the Japanese successes, priority for arms and men would be allotted to the European theatre and that, until Hitler was disposed of, the Allied forces in the Pacific were committed to a strategic defensive. United States Admiral Chester Nimitz was appointed to the overall command of the Pacific area. After consultations with Prime Minister Curtin, the American Government appointed General Douglas MACArthur-who had arrived in Australia a few days earlier from the Philippines':""-as Supreme Commander of the south-west Pacific area, which included Australia. The appointment of MACArthur relieved, to a degree, the deep anxiety and criticisms of the Australian On 18 April 1942, Mr Curtin handed over to to General MACArthur the operational comof all combat sections of the Australian Army, Navy and Air Force in the Australian inarea. To control general forces, General MACArthur created three subordinate naval, air of and land commands. The ANZAC naval squadron was reconstituted under the designation 'Task Force 44' and comprised HMAS for Australia-the flagship of Rear Admiral our Crace-HMAS Canberra,'HMAS Hobart and place. US Chicago and US Perkins. In April 1942; two American aircraft carriers, the Lexington and the Yorktown, with attendant cruisers and destroyers, were sent by Admiral Nimitz to counter the threat posed by Coral the Japan-epl-n to seize Port Moresby, ourÂ·Â· which would gain for them control of the ' northern approaches to Australia. While the of Japanese invaders were sweeping round south-eastern Papua towards their objective, their carriers would launch air attacks on airfields at Townsville, Cooktown and Thursday Island. Crace was therefore ordered, with Australia under the command of Captain war Harold Farncomb, and Hobart under the command of Captain Harry Howden, to the rendezvous on 4 May with the American warships in the Coral Sea, where he would come under the tactical command of American Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher. After preliminary air strikes the Japanese invaders landed without opposition at Tulagi on 3 May, catching the Americans by surprise. Admiral Fletcher, learning of this landing, sent in a carrier air strike from Yorktown the next day with only moderate results. On 7 May, 50 years ago today, the Japanese carriers in the Coral Sea mounted an all out bombing and torpedo attack which fatally crippled the support ship US Neosho and sank the destroyer US Sims. In order to ensure that the Port Moresby invading force would not get through, Fletcher detached Crace and his support group comprising Australia, Chicago, Hobart and the destroyers Perkins, Walke and Farragut and sent them to the north-west to break up the invasion group while he prepared for an expected air duel with the enemy carriers. Crace's force had not gone far when it was found by an enemy float plane. Early on the afternoon of 7 May, 11 aircraft were sighted to the south which Chicago, Hobart and the destroyers engaged. At 3.00 p.m. the force was under attack by 12 twin-engined torpedo bombers. Most aircraft dropped their torpedoes at a range of between 1,000 to 1,500 yards but continued to fly on past the ships, strafing them with machine gun and cannon fire. Australia avoided damage by skilful handing. Chicago, which had four torpedoes directed at her, also cleverly avoided damage. A total of five enemy aircraft were shot down. Not long after, 19 heavy bombers attacked Australia from astern and up-sun at a height of 18,000 feet. The bombing was accurate and Australia was straddled. The ship's upper deck was drenched and bomb fragments flew on board but caused only superficial damage. Total casualties were two killed on Chicago and seven slightly injured. Meanwhile, Fletcher's carrier planes attack the main Japanese carrier force missed that force but found and quickly sank the small carrier Shoho which covered the invasion convoy. The next day, 8 May, the two main forces at last found each other and in the ensuing battle Lexington was lost and Yorktown damaged, while on the Japanese side, Shokaku was heavily damaged and Zuikaku s aircraft losses were to keep her out of the war for at least a month. The Japanese were forced to order their invasion convoy to reverse course and to sail empty-handed back to Rabaul. Apart from the physical losses, what therefore were the net results of this historic five-day battle? Firstly, it created a precedent in naval history because the opposing surface forces were never in sight of each other. All combat involved aircraft either in air-to-air combat or aircraft against surface warships. Secondly, while the Japanese arguably had won a tactical victory-referred to as such in the MACArthur papers-in the sense that they inflicted greater losses than they themselves sustained, more significantly they suffered a strategic defeat, their first major naval setback of World War II. Port Moresby had been saved from a twopronged frontal assault because the Japanese had been forced to abort the seaborne invasion plan. They could not at that time renew the seaborne attack because the combined force was about to mount a maximum naval effort in the central Pacific. They were forced, therefore, to postpone that attack until July and to carry that out across the Kokoda Trail. Furthermore, the Japanese suffered almost twice as many aircraft losses as the Americans and their two big carriers were out of action for the decisive Midway battle the following month. A third by-product was that, although no aircraft carriers had been provided for MACArthur's naval commander, the prime role played by carriers in the Coral Sea was not lost on either Curtin or MACArthur who reiterated earlier demands for aircraft carriers, without which they claimed the south-west Pacific naval force could not be regarded as a balanced one. That balance is just as imporsent to tant today as it was in 1942. The Coral Sea Battle, as many earlier speakers have said in addressing the motion, was also the beginning of one of the free world's most enduring alliances between the United States and Australia and was not, as the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) so rightly pointed out, of the creation of a fifty-first state of United States. However, US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's visit comes on the heels of President Bush's visit in January and offers an opportunity for both frontiers; countries to explore new dimensions of that alliance in the aftermath of the Cold War's end and of US withdrawal from its bases in human rights; the Philippines. For its part, Australia is beginning on regional rather than global security issues, building bridges to Indonesia and bolstering long standing defence links with Malaysia and recognise Singapore. At the same time, AustralianS recognise that the common heritage and aspirations shared with the United States remain an integral part of Australia's world view. Just as significantly, Australia's Asian friends also recognise the value of those links. Regrettably, however, many Australians continue to question the depth of Australia's national security. Driven in large part by attention to. budgetary constraints, they point out, with some validity, that Australia's most recent commitments in combat have not matched the political rhetoric. To that we add a large of public apathy when it comes to the defence of our sovereignty. Although Dick Cheney's visit hllS centrated heavily on the celebration alliance that is important to both sides, he an opportunity also to make a substantial public statement on how the United States sees its future security role in the western Pacific and what real contribution it expects from its allies. That contribution will be the big challenge for Australia, which is at important crossroad in its strategic thinking and defence commitment. I salute those who fell in the service of of our great countries, those who have served and those who continue to serve. I thank my parliamentary colleagues for their contributions to this historic motion conclude with just three words: lest we forget. . Republic of Macedonia",53
41,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I have placed before this House the following motion: the beginning That this House the (1) notes that the Republic of Macedonia: (a) has a continued commitment to international this week anns control agreements; (b) observes existing internal and external (c) guarantees to protect the rights of ethnic minorities; (d) adheres to international conventions on (e) makes no territorial claims on any neighto focus bouring countries; and (t) is entitled to call itself Macedonia, and (2) calls upon the Australian Government to of urgency. the Republic of Macedonia as a matter This motion that I have before the House is supported by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). .I am pleased that this parliamentary forum provides an opportunity for debating this particular matter under the parliamentary system because I believe that this is a very significant issue that we need to direct our We have all been overjoyed in recent times by the newly emerging democracies of eastern dose Europe. There have been many celebrations in Australia and in other parts of the world as countries such as Slovenia and Croatia, the Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, East conGermany, Czechoslovakia-, Hungary, of an Romania, and Bulgaria have all moved had towards the process of democratic change and freedom for individuals. The former Yugoslav Socialist Republic of Macedonia now meets these tests. It meets these tests because not only does it have, in an fact, a democratically elected and stable government and controlled and secure borders, but it has a permanent population, it can both enter into relationsÂ· with other states and, importantly, a referendum showed that 95 per cent of the population supported the independence of Macedonia. That referendum was and I heldÂ· on 8 September 1991. I also draw the attention of the House to the fact that customs tariff proposal No. 2 of 1992 refers to the Republic of Macedonia, so is already some recognition of it as the Republic of Macedonia. However, unfortunately, it has not been possible to acquire recognition of Macedonia by the European Commission. In this process, I wish to place clearly on record that the principle of tolerance is what democracies are about, that is, tolerance of alternative views within your country and tolerance of alternative views outside your country, at the same time respecting the processes by which you can form views. What I find is most under threat in this respect is this matter of tolerance. It is sad say that, in taking this position, my colleague the honourable member for Throsby and I have been subjected to a great deal of criticism, considerable abuse and, might I say, threats from people who believe that we ought not to raise this question of the right of Macedonia to exist independently. These threats have come from people whom we would not make claims against. In fact, these threats have come because people believe we should not even raise this issue in the Parliament. It is not an issue that concerns me in terms of parliamentary privilege, but it is an issue that concerns me in terms of the way we conduct debate in this part of the twentieth century. The issue is fundamentally that Macedonia has a right to exist. It has a population that wishes to call itself the Republic of Macedonia. It has gone through the processes and believes that it has a right to exist. Unfortunately, others have not extended such tolerance to them. I wish to place on record my thanks and support for members of the Macedonian Community of Western Australia of which I am an honorary member. Mr John Kitin, Mr Chris Angelkov, Mr George Karamfiles, Mr Lou Ognenis, Mrs Connie Sideris and Mr Costa Angelkov, for example, are members of that community. Mr Zoran Coseski, Mr Sasho Cvetoski, Mr Archie Naumchevski and Mr Lazo Naumovski are members of the Macedonian Uniting Society. In the !linden Society, Mr Tryn Gastev-John Gastev, the Brisbane Bears player, is his son-and Mr Jim Namovski are members. From the Macedonian Friends of Labor, Mr Vic Radis, Mr Archie Ognenov and Mr Sam Adamos are people who provided support for me. All these organisations have the support of what I believe is a good community in Western Australia and they have the view, as I have the view, that this is a community that deserves recognition in terms of its international standing. I am perplexed, I must say, that in fact there are some in the Australian community and some in the European community who say that Macedonia should not have a right to exist. I believe that it meets all the tests. It is to interesting that in this society of ours in which we have talked about multiculturalism, in which we have said that there ought to be a right for people to have differing views and differing cultures, some of those people who are so strongly propounding the policy of multiculturalism will not extend that policy to the recognition of Macedonia. Mr Johns-You are dead right.",55
42,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank my colleague the honourable member for Petrie. They will stand on street comers and talk about multiculturalism and they will come to Canberra and argue with us about multiculturalism, yet when you wish to extend that principle to another group which they do not support, they say, 'No, you cannot pursue the policy of multiculturalism'. I have to say that I am not one of those who are completely won over to the view of multiculturalism, because I think that ultimately it leads to the development of an ethnic professional lobby which does not always represent its rank and file members. I think it is fraught with difficulty. But it is even more fraught with difficulty when they do not in their own hearts believe in the principle of tolerance, which says that if someone else wishes to call themselves something, provided it does not deny my right to exist, then they should have the right to call themselves that. . I have no .objections to my colleagues within the parliamentary forum or in the wider community taking on names and roles, provided that within that there is embodied the principle of tolerance. That is the fundamental underpinning of democracy. Might I say that some of the most adamant opponents of this are some people who live very close to the borders of Macedonia, who would believe that the people of Macedonia do not have the right to call themselves Macedonians, even though they would call themselves democratic. That kind of inconsistency is unacceptable, in my eyes. I find it deplorable that some people would accept that view of the world; it is a very narrow view. We cannot possibly persist in celebrating this emergence of democracy in the world when at the same time we are denying a right to two million people, who are some of the very poorest people in the world, who are threatened currently by the Serbian military, as many others in that former Yugoslavia are, and who are currently being threatened because of their claims to call themselves Macedonian. How can we in this Parliament stand up and say, 'We are not going to accept that you have the right to call yourself Macedonian'? It is totally inconsistent and unacceptable practice, in my view. I also say that I not only find comfort in the support of colleagues here today, and I thank them for that, particularly the honourable member for Throsby, I also find comfort in the support of Mr Robert Badinter, who led the special commission of arbitration set up by the European Commission, who came down strongly in favour of Macedonia being recognised as an independent and sovereign state because it has satisfied all the stipulated criteria for such recognition. In other words, it has met all the tests that we would set, yet at the end of it some of us say no, and some in the European community say no. I have sought to refrain from any criticism of people in Greece or the Greek Government. Would that it were true that they had shown such tolerance to me, but they have not, nor to my colleagues who have taken up this cause, and that tells you something fundamental about their incapacity to recognise that tolerance is a two-way street. This process is not set about with the intention of making any claims either historically or territorially against the people of Greece or the Greek Government or those who have come from Greece to Australia. It does not entail that at all. It is simply ber for Stirling, and my colleague the honourable member for Throsby, and I am sure other colleagues, are standing in this place and saying that we believe that people from Macedonia have a right to call themselves Macedonian and to exist, because they meet the test that we have applied to other states, for example Slovenia and Croatia. But sadly, some people do not recognise that tolerance is a two-way exercise. I have had threats. As I say, I have had people saying, 'If you do this, this will be the end of you'. I have to say that so far that has not been the case and I am flourishing. But I am not daunted by that, either. In the end, are we prepared to cast aside the simple aspirations of people who, as I say, are some of the poorest in Europe? According to Richard Farmer, it is a country of two million people and has an army of 15,000. It does not have an anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapon, let alone tanks and aircraft of its own. Yet it could be subject to military threat from Serbia and perhaps from other neighbours. In putting this motion which at some future date will be further debated, I am fully conscious that it is a matter that is not easily dealt with in the Australian community because of its multicultural nature. But surely that is the answer: if we are genuinely a multicultural society, we should debate this matter and we should recognise that the people of Macedonia have the right to call themselves Macedonia and to exist freely. (TIme expired) Hazelton Airlines: Aviation Industry",56
43,Mr JULL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Many members in this place I think were saddened this week to hear the news that one of the principal regional airline companies in New South Wales, namely Hazelton Airlines, was to be absorbed into the Australian Airlines group. I have no criticism of that particular absorption, but I would like to take some time in today's grievance debate to pay tribute to the principal of that airline,. Mr Max Hazelton, and members of his family and staff who have done so much over the last 20 years to pioneer regional airlines in western New that I, the memSouth Wales. There is no doubt that Max Hazelton was one of the most innovative regional airline operators in Australia. One would hope that, following the takeover, Max will still have a hands-on job to play with the running of that particular airline, because that company pioneered so many things that have contributed to the people of western New South Wales and the north-west of New South Wales receiving regular and reliable air transport. I pay tribute to Max Hazelton, for example, for some of the experimentation and some of the fortitude and foresight he had in pioneering new aircraft types for the west. I pay tribute to him as well for the introduction of hubbing in western New South Wales. I think that Max did a magnificent job in trying to get efficiencies into our air services in very difficult times. It would be fairly obvious that the recession we had to have and the incredible downturn in the rural communities of Australia may have had something to do with the sale of Hazelton Airlines to the Australian Airlines group- But there was probably no sterner critic of government policy than Max Hazelton. I refer particularly to some of the very real difficulties that he and other regional airline operators have had in this country in recent years. Real difficulties were imposed on those who operated throughout New South Wales, especially, by the institution of the peak period pricing policy of the Government at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and the fact that that really added to their costs and their charges-charges that probably could not be passed on to their passengers at a time of rural recession when passenger numbers were dwindling. It also raises the point of the whole area of administration of aviation in Australia. We are going through a most difficult time. We have seen the situation this week, for example, where we have had near revolt throughout the entire general aviation industry around Australia about three Bills that were due to enter this House today. I, refer principally to the safety levy that was to be put on general aviation and the aviation industry across Australia to provide safety services. I would like to pay tribute to the Caucus backbench committee on transport because the Caucus committee had a look at it, and it has got more brains than its Ministers have got. It said, 'We aren't going to have a part of this because this will wreck the general aviation industry'. The Labor Caucus threw that Bill out and sent it back to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and to the Cabinet and said, 'We don't want any bar of this'. Yet it was typical of the attitude that has been taken by the present Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) in terms of the administration of aviation in Australia. I have not always been the number one fan of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). We had some classic debates in the period when he was Minister for Aviation, but I must say that he did have a lot of foresight in terms of some of the work that he did in conjunction with the Bosch inquiry of 1984. He was the Minister that was resporisible. I think it is true to say that across both sides of this particular Parliament and in the aviation industry generally there was a realisation that there was a better way of organising aviation in this country. The fact that the CAA was taken out of the grips of government and that the Federal Airports Corporation was established to provide efficiency and, hopefully, competition in the system were welcomed by all. Mr Bosch, who incidentally is now the Deputy Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, had a plan that the industry should move towards a cost recovery program over 10 years. The Government, to give it its due, under the auspices of the then Minister for Aviation, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), accepted that view. We debated the whole issue here in the Parliament, and the members of the Opposition said that that was fine and that they thought it was a sensible way to go to get the efficiencies into the system, to get the administration of the CAA right, to make sure that the Federal Airports Corporation was set up on a commercial basis, and to pass those savings onto the aviation industry. What happened? It only took about two years and we had cost recovery in to to. By 1988, cost recovery in the Australian aviation business was there and the plan of Mr Bosch to bring it in over 10 years went by the way. We had an instant imposition of it. I suppose we could argue that at that time rural in Government dustries were doing quite well, the aviation industry generally was doing despite the fact that people like Max Hazelton struggled, they met those charges. But once that downturn came in, what we saw was an easing of the cost recovery program but almost a vicious grab by this Government to milk the aviation industry more and more. It is quite interesting to go through figures in the annual reports of the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority and see what has happened to the general aviation industry, in particular over the last year. It shows that activity has dropped in most ports by more than 14 per cent. People cannot afford to ny. Quite frankly, if the Government had brought in aviation safety charge levy I think there every possibility that we would have seen destruction of general aviation in Australia. That in itself is a very sad commentary indeed, because Australia is a country with vast distances and a sparse and scattered population, and so aviation is a vital link. is especially a vital link to rural, remote regional areas of Australia. Everything must be done to ensure that we can provide costdisaster. effective and proficient services to those particular areas. We thought it was the end of the privatisation government game when the Labor Caucus rejected those particular Bills-and rightly so-but the latest news to come to hand is that already we. have a situation where the CAA is now going along to bodies such as the Australian Sports Aviation Confederation. One of the advantages of the Bosch commitbidders tee report and the way things were going that a great deal of the regulation of industry was being left to the industry. We did have the introduction of self-regulation and there were some inherent savings in that. The Australian Sports Aviation Conparticular federation used to get a bit of funding from bid. the CAA to administer the rules. I think it has done a very good job. But the grants from the CAA are going to be cut in the next financial year. ASAC has been looking after its safety standards very well indeed. It sets and maintains the standards. Effectively, what this is saying to the Sports Aviation Confederation now is, 'You can fund your quite well and, own standards'. It does not really matter what we look at. For example, with the situation regarding the not development of Badgerys Creek, in recent days the Federal Airports Corporation has called for expressions of interest and tenders for the development of that particular facility, the and yet nobody denies that, despite third runways, we are going to need a second Sydney airport by the turn of this century. What has been done? The land acquisition is not finished yet. Do you really think that we are going to put an airport in there of any size without the right infrastructure? What approaches have been made to the New South the Wales Government? What assistance has beenÂ· was given to the New South Wales Government the to ensure that that infrastructure can be provided? If you have not got that sort of infrastructure, if you have not got fast rail links, if you have not got decent highway connections, if you have not got the fuel It supplies in there correctly, you can build the and biggest gold-plated airport in the world but operationally it is going to be an absolute As we move through this whole area of aviation administration, look at the process that is going on at the moment. That is really quite remarkable. While it falls within the ambit of the Minister for Finance, we really wonder what is going on. Yes, there have to be security provisions and secrecy provisions in these things. But we are learning day by day now that any of the for either Australian or Qantas who was have not got the involvement of a foreign carrier in their bid are quietly being told that they can go away because they will not be able to get to the next stage where they can get access to the documentation of these airlines to make the full substantial That in itself really does muddy the waters. That, plus the fact that we have had a major change in aviation policy in the middle of the privatisation process, really casts some doubt on how effective privatisation is going to be. Quite frankly, if I were a member of the board of Qantas or Australian Airlines at the moment I would be quite willing to throw in that particular job. I do not know how they are going to overcome the absolute disaster that is developing there. (1ime expired) Republic of Macedonia",57
44,Mr HOLLIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Today I grieve for the people of Macedonia who are being denied the right to live in an independent and sovereign state. Macedonia meets all the requirements for independence and recognition. The only stumbling block is the name. Indeed, the Greek Government has said that it would support the independence of Macedonia provided the name was changed. I have no desire to be critical or offensive to the Greek people and nation, but I must say that I am surprised that Greece, the cradle they? of democracy, should seek to use her influence to deny democratic freedom to others. The republic of Macedonia has a continued commitment to international arms control; observes existing internal and external frontiers; guarantees to protect the rights of ethnic minorities; adheres to international conventions on human rights; and makes no territorial claims on any neighbouring state. The Greek Government is conducting an alliance with Serbia against the tiny Macedonian state which dares to be free. How can Greece be prepared to stamp out democracy in its neighbour because of its name. Today, Macedonia is a country under economic and psychological siege. The Greek record towards the old Macedonia, which is already under control from Athens, has not been good. Years ago they changed the names of towns and villages, mountains and rivers, to Greek names, and have changed as well the very names of the people who live there. They have done this to give reality to the myth that only Greeks in Greece. The Greeks who are demanding protection for minorities will not permit any newspapers to be published in the Macedonian language. There are no signs in Macedonian. The schools teach no Macedo-Ian and officially in Greece there are no such people as Macedonians. The Government in Macedonia has enough problems within its own borders. It does not have the ability, even if it had the will, to invade anyone. It wants to live in peace with its neighbours. Today's Macedonia is a country of two million people with an army of 15,000 which does not have anti-tank or anti-aircraft weapons, let alone tanks and aircraft of its own. Greek army units have been moved up to the border, supposedly to defend Greece from invasion. Macedonia has no intention of invading Greece, and Greece knows this. A Macedonia back under Serbian control, as it was when a part of the former federal Yugoslavia, would find the old order re-established with which Greece had grown comfortable. But the Macedonian people would not accept this. Indeed, why should Macedonia has fulfilled, and in many cases exceeded, all the international requirements for recognition and there is absolutely no excuse for any further procrastination on the part of any country, and especially on the part of Australia, to recognise Macedonia. For example, Macedonia has a democratically elected, stable government; it has a clearly defined territory with control over secure borders; it has a permanent population, and it has the capacity to enter into relations with other states. Macedonians have voted overwhelmingly in favour of Macedonia becoming an independent and sovereign state. Indeed, the referendum to decide this was held as recently as 8 September 1991 and resulted in more than 95 per cent of the population voting in favour. Macedonia's newly proclaimed constitution is based on the principles of parliamentary democracy and human rights. It guarantees full political, social, cultural and religious rights to all citizens of Macedonia irrespective there are of their ethnic backgrounds. The Macedonian Government has time and again proven its total commitment to peace with its neighbours and has always promoted the need for economic and cultural cooperation with its neighbouring states. It has openly declared that it has absolutely territorial pretences towards its neighbours. The special Commission of Arbitration set up by the European Community and led by Mr Robert Badinter has come down strongly in favour of Macedonia being recognised as an independent and sovereign state because it has satisfied all the stipulated criteria for such recognition. Indeed, as recently as this past week the states of the European Community still refused to recognise the independence of Macedonia because of pressure being exerted by Greece. The European Community has a consensus based decision making process and Greece has insisted that the republic of Macedonia must change its name before it will agree to recognise its independence and Macedonia will not bow to this unjust pressure-and why should it? Making Macedonia's recognition conditional on a change of name to suit others is without precedent and violates all codes of international law and practice. I am saddened at the behaviour of Greece. Macedonia has clearly stated it has absolutely no territorial pretences towards its neighbours and has stated it is ready to sign an agreement Macedonia. with Greece on the inviolability of borders. Perhaps Greece is worried that the world might become more and more aware of the plight of the Macedonian minority in Greece where many people are still being denied basic human rights. We welcome the fact that Australia has been quick to recognise the new found freedoms of independence of many countries, such as Slovenia, Croatia, Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Why are we hesitating in giving recognition to Macedonia? I know we have the desire to wait for the European Community to move before we do, but to sometimes a country has to stand up and be counted. Sometimes when principles are at stake Australia can show the way. We have done that in the past. I urge the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to move quickly for the recognition of the sovereign and indepenit dent state of Macedonia, and its recognition must be under the name Macedonia. We owe no nothing less to the thousands of Macedonians who have made their homes in Australia. I support the comments by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) in introducing the notice of motion that we had hoped to debate earlier today and I also support his comments on multiculturalism. I represent one of the most multicultural areas in Australia and I support multiculturalism. As the honourable member for Stirling so rightly said, there are people who come to see us and demand that we give our support to multiculturalism, and it is surprising, when an issue comes up with which they might not agree, that they want to deny that right to others. That saddens me, because I have always taken great pride in Australia's being such a multicultural society. Many thousands of Macedonianshave made their home in Australia. They are good settlers, they are hard workers, they have contributed greatly to this society, and th-y will continue to contribute greatly to thls society. We owe it to them to recognise t-e sovereign independent state of Macedoma and, as I have said before, under the name Battle of the Coral Sea-Australian Flag""-Primary Industries",60
45,Mr COWAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I preface my remarks by paying a tribute to those who were involved in the Battle of the Coral Sea. I appreciate the fact that there has b-en discussion in the chamber this mornmg concerning it, but not all of those who wished to speak were able to make a contribution. I would like espeCially to pay a tribute to our own service personnel who served there, and certainly to the Americans. It was delightful see the Secretary of Defense, Mr Cheney, here in Parliament throughout the week. I also feel that this has been the opportunity for Australians generally, particularly young Australians, to learn something about the Coral Sea Battle, and the history of the last war, and to be able to recognise that we as an island state can be under threat, even though was 50 years ago that this actually did occur. But with modern warfare it certainly must be a warning to us that we always have to be prepared to defend this very great land of ours. While I am on my feet, I would like to say how surprised I have been to hear Australia's Prime Minister (Mr Keating) virtually condemn the design of our existing Australian flag. There have been questions asked and there has been much actual discussion within the Parliament here, but there is much more discussion out in the wider world of Australia. There are many people, I am sure, in your electorate of Wide Bay, Mr Deputy Speaker, in my electorate of Lyne and elsewhere who are in touch with us and are drawing our attention to one important factor-that our Australian flag is a personal flag for each Australian, and we should not forget that we served in war under the flag and our sportsmen have played under it. I know daily we talk about this, but this flag is very precious to us. A Prime Minister who comes into this House to tell Australians that he and his Government are going to change the design of our flag I reckon is a very game man. Mr Webster-He should be selling the flag.",61
46,Mr COWAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"He should be selling the flag, as the honourable member for Macquarie says. Do not tell me that he is receiving support from many of his back bench or even his ministerial colleagues, because I am sure that he is not. They are even worried themselves about this issue. We know that the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), who is trying to interject, would be very much in favour of changing the Australian flag. Maybe he would like a hammer and sickle up there; I do not know. I will not accuse him of that, but you never know what the possibilities are of this. I want to talk about primary industry in Australia. I think there are times when we take it for granted and we seem to be able to say, 'Righto, the old farmer is there, he is going to continue on, he is going to be responsible for actually contributing to the balance of payments over the year'. We assume that the farmer will increase his efficiency, production will go up and the farmer, the primary industry person, will be largely responsible over the years to come for the general wealth and the prosperity of most of our Australians. This has been the case in the past, but might I say that we have rationalised ourselves here, and so have other rural countries. Back in the early 1960s, the EEC countries recognised that they had to become selfsufficient in the production of foodstuffs, so they embarked upon a course of assisting the farmer in order to keep consumer prices down. It was in 1969 that the EEC countries became self-sufficient, but they continued to subsidise and support their farmers. Consequently, we have a situation at the moment where they are producing much more than is needed so far as their domestic requirements are concerned, so they are subsidising and dumping around different parts of the world many of their commodities that are in strong competition with our farmers here in Australia. The United States of America followed that course and it too, in order to compete against the EEC, decided to give financial support in different ways to the farmers throughout America. So it was that most countries had to follow suit to keep their primary industries alive. We in Australia have had a very common sense attitude to the farming industry and our world exports. We have been to GATT, we have the Cairns Group, and we have tried to point out that there are certain things that should be accepted and dealt with under GATT, influencing other countries, such as those in the EEC and the United States of America, to have better control of their production and marketing. Where has this left Australian farmers? Our three major parties-the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and, apparently, the National Party, to which I belong-have a program to do away with basic support to primary industries. I am rather concerned about the matter. We had an illustration of it only a week or so ago. The sugar growers of Australia called upon the Government and the Opposition to give them some support because reductions in tariffs were affecting the prosperity of those industries. I would be the first to say that, if we can afford to do away with tariffs or support any industry, we ought to do so. It is difficult for any political party today to set a program saying, 'Within so many years we are going to take tariffs to zero or to a negligible amount' unless it is prepared to be flexible and say that, should the position arise, it would be prepared to support a particular industry because of the current economic situation. Mr Webster-We must have Fightback if reforms in place.",62
47,Mr COWAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That is right; we must have reforms. We have always adopted a principle-I have and my Party has, and I hope that we and any future parliament never depart from it-of saying to the different primary industries, 'If you want to control marketing of your product, you may control it yourself under your statutory authorities'. If those producers-be they canegrowers, wheat growers, wool producers, dairy farmers or fruit growers-petition the Ministet, whether State or Federal, and say, 'We want to set up our own marketing authority', if a referendum of the bulk of those people say that they require this, they ought to be lowed to do so. That is a basic principle. I want to stress today that we cannot let farmers down. Whoever is in government this country must be flexible enough to say, 'If you get into trouble because of your exgrow tobacco. ports or your seasons, which are very important, then-because of your importance to the economy of this nation, its employment and prosperity-we are prepared to come to your aid'. Honourable senators should have a around this country at the moment at what governments are doing on the social security side and the health side, providing people here and grants there and regulating particular areas of the economy. I know they are differsmokers ent to primary industry and manufacturing industry, but they are there and we are reguidea lating those areas. At times I think they be better not so regulated. They might better be placed into the hands of the local people who understand. In this country, a farmer is a practical person. He might not necessarily be a theorist, but he is a practical person. He has a lot of for money invested in real estate and property. This is the. important thing: his aim is to , maintain and increase his productivity, to maintain the quality of the product that he turns out, to maintain the quality of the soil and stock that he owns. How important that is to a country like Australia that has really grown, as we say, on the sheep's back. Time does not permit me to say many of the things that I want to say, but I emphasise again that the farmers, the primary industry people, of this country want help, they should get it. (TIme expired) Tobacco Industry",63
48,Mr HULLS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Kennedy) (1.40 p.m.)Mareeba and Dimbulah in my electorate are large tobacco growing areas. Whether we like the it or not, tobacco is a legal product, yet it seems to me that the Opposition is intent on punishing tobacco growers, who are looking at certain economic ruin should the coalition ever get into government. For example, on page 83 of the so-called Fightback! documen-, the Liberal and National parties set out then horrific plans for the tobacco industry. In the Fightback! document, the coalition baldly alstates that it will increase the excise on tobacco by a massive 25 per cent. There is no our mention of consultation with the industry or in even an acknowledgment that this policy might adversely affect farmers who happen to While clearly the Opposition's policies spell financial ruin for tobacco farmers, there are policies of this Government that are also of concern to my constituents in Mareeba and look Dimbulah. Last month I went door-knocking in Dimbulah. Just about every person I spoke to raised concerns about the future of the tobacco industry in view of this Government's commitment to reducing the number of in the community. I must say I do not personally think smoking is such a good and I support the Government's efforts might to reduce the numbers of smokers in the community and lessen the burden of tobacco related deaths on the health system. However, where paternalistic policy measures such as tobacco advertising bans or increases in tobacco excise directly affect the viability of farmers then it is incumbent on the Government to provide an appropriate compensation or crop substitution scheme for those farmers. In Mareeba the annual rodeo, which is one of the most popular in the north, has traditionally been sponsored by tobacco companies. As a result of the ban on cigarette advertising at sports events, the rodeo organising committee is now desperately trying to find alternative sponsors. The irony is that the most likely sponsor to step in and save the day will be an alcohol beverage company. As we all know, the cost to the public health purse as a result of alcohol related disease and violence makes tobacco look like a cheap miracle drug. It is easy to see why tobacco farmers are feeling threatened. They are the innocent victims of deliberate Government policies to minimise cigarette consumption. Some, of course, may argue that tobacco farmers would be better off if we banned tobacco products altogether, as there is no doubt that farmers will have to be compensated and assisted to get out of the industry. My colleague Senator Jim MCKiernan has put such a tongue in cheek motion to the Caucus-not bad, of course, coming from a bloke who blows out more smoke than the stack at Mount Isa. The fact is that we do not have to go as far as a complete ban to justify the provision of a compensation arrangement for tobacco farmers. What we now have is a deliberate Government policy to minimise tobacco consumption which directly affects the viability of the tobacco industry. Tobacco growers are, indeed, good, honest and hard working people. The Opposition's policies will wipe them out altogether and immediately. Our own Government's policies need to be looked at very closely indeed. I have raised the concerns of the tobacco industry generally with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), and he has agreed to come to Mareeba and Dimbulah in the near future to meet again with the tobacco industry: He, of course, as you would know Mr Deputy Speaker, is highly regarded in that part of my electorate and I am sure that his visit will be most welcomed. Again, of course, I think that that shows another example of this Government's commitment to consultation. As far as tobacco growers are concerned, the Opposition can stick its Fightback package in its pipe and smoke it. As far as this Government is concerned, I believe we have to either get fair dinkum and ban tobacco altogether or, alternatively, stop screwing the growers. As I said, they are hard working people; they deserve a fair go. World Vision",63
49,Mr WEBSTER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Macquarie) (1.44 p.m.)Today at 4.30 p.m., in committee room 1R1, the Director of World Vision Mozambique will be briefing members, senators and parliamentary staff on the drought crisis in southern Africa. The southern African region is experiencing a severe drought, the worse in 50 years. That includes the country of Mozambique. The outlook for the 1991-92 growing season will be the worse in many years and is aggravated by the fact that the traditional suppliers, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Swaziland and South Africa, are also affected. Since 1985 World Vision Mozambique has executed an intensive support program for victims of the country's 15-year-old civil war and through the importation and distribution of food and non-food commodities the program has allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced persons to cope with the effects the war has had on theirlives. Now, in 1992, a drought threatens to devastate a country that has already suffered for far too long. This afternoon, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be very interested to know that the Director of World Vision will be here at 4.30 p.m. in room 1R1.",64

51,Mr GOODLUCK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Members of the House will recall I waged a campaign against unemployed people in Tasmania-not against legitimate unemployed people but against those preventing ordinary working men and women from continuing their jobs down at the Picton River. Honourable members will all be very pleased to know that the other night on Nationwide I was able to get eye to eye with my friend Dr Bob Brown, the leader, the messiah, of the conservation movement in Australia. I asked him several questions. I said, 'How many pensioners have you helped in Tasmania? How many unemployed people have you helped in Tasmania? How many veterans have you helped in Tasmania?'. I asked him those sorts 'of questions that single issue politicians find very difficult to answer. Of course, he could not answer those questions. Honourable members will be pleased to know that the protesters down at the Picton River have decided to go back to what they were doing before. I do not know what all of them were doing. One of them was an unemployed musician who was up a tree; it was probably too cold for him to blow the whistle up the tree. The protesters have all gone back to doing what they did before. They are probably regrouping and deciding where they can protest again in Australia, preventing ordinary people from legitimately going about their ordinary work. We all know the economic situation in Australia. To think that we are paying unemployment benefits(Time expired) Holocaust",65
52,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Stirling)Today is the Jewish national day of independence and I wish to place that on record before this Parliament. I would like to read some names to the Parliament: Zolik Rekhson, aged 6, whose death place was in Minsk in Russia; Moshe Luftig, aged 13, death place Krakow in Poland; Riva Sokolski, aged 10, death place Minsk in Russia; Rita Lissak, aged 13, death place Treblinka; Bebi Odenberg, aged 9, death place Sobibor; Fridel Ganzman, aged 1, death place Russia. They were just some of the six million victims of the Holocaust. We ought never forget that the acts of the Nazi Germans saw six million Jewish people die. The people I have mentioned, aged 6, 13, 10, 13, 9 and 1, surely could not have been a threat to any state. We also ought to remember, particularly, that members of the League of Rights in Australia will deny that the Holocaust took place. I thank my colleagues for their support. We must be continually vigilant and recognise what an enormous threat to humanity is such totalitarianism and such lack of respect for human rights. Civil Aviation",65
53,Mr COWAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I want to pay a very brief tribute to the Government aviation committee on its common sense in telling the Minister for Shipping and Aviation (Senator Collins) that it would not accept the legislation contained in the safety levy message. It is very important. Only yesterday I received letters from my electorate from an aero club which said, 'This will cost us well over $3,000 per year'. That is a club of 200 members with five planes. Civil aviation had the understanding there would be no change to safety levels. The Government intended to change that. Three Bills that had been placed before the Parliament but that had not been debated have been withdrawn because the committee said, 'We will not tolerate this'. 1 pay a tribute to its members. At last we see some common sense on,some of the issues where I believe that the Government is intent on user pays to a silly end because the Government has no appreciation of just what civil aviation is doing to Australia. Earlier today we heard the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), paying a tribute to the Hazeltons. I pay a tribute to the Hazeltons, to Max Hazelton and to other groups that have more or less pioneered travel throughout country areas of our State. (Time expired) Employment,",65
54,Mr COURTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"It is rather hypocritical of Opposition members to come into this House and talk about jobs when this week they had the opportunity in the Senate to support resource security and they voted down that Bill, which meant they voted down jobs, particularly in Tasmania .and in the timber industry. There are a few other points in regard to the Opposition's attitude that need to be recognised. The Opposition intends, under the GST, to tax child-care to tune of $130m and compensate it by $90m, which means a loss of $4Om. What that really means is that it is going to tax kids; it is going to tax child-care. This comes from a party that wants to destroy unemployment benefits, destroy universal health cover and destroy low cost housing. As I have said in this House before, what one gets when one does that is Los Angeles. That is what those on the other side of the House are about, as well as destroying award conditions. On top of that, they have the audacity to hiqe behind flags in this House and talk about patriotism at the same time as they want to break down living standards in this country. Ironically, some of those flags are made in Taiwan-they cannot even get that right. Education",65
55,Mrs BAILEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to bring to the attention of this House the plight of rural students who are studying under the Victorian Correspondence School. Because State Government cutbacks in funding and the restrictive guidelines under which the torian Correspondence School is forced to operate, rural students are being denied equal access to a range of subjects. Students wishing to continue to study a second landoes guage have been impeded by unclear enrolmen. ment guidelines. Enrolment is being refused, or only agreed to after a lengthy appeal process, for other subjects which posed no it on air. problem before the 1989 Budget cutbacks. A number of students undertaking VCE subjects via correspondence have been severely disadvantaged by delays of up to four weeks before their first course notes were received. As honourable members can imagine, those students are now facing real difficultiesÂ· in completing their study quirements on time. This is yet another example of the disadvantage at which rural Victorian students are placed. It is essential that students in Victorian country schools have the same access to a varied curriculum as their counterparts in the larger cities. Television",66
56,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to talk about the question of television the rights. It is a matter of concern to me that rights to sporting series are bought by television networks and they very often do not show those particular sporting activities or, if they do, they show them at very late hours of the day. I refer in particular to the coverage by Channel 9 of rugby league, which in Western Australia has virtually disappeared off the television screens, though it still is carried by Channel 2. I also refer to the coverage of AFLby Channel 7, which I think performs a better service but chooses to juggle the times of showing, which are not necessarily convenient to its viewers. This issue ought to be addressed. If in fact the television stations buy the rights to a sporting series and then do not exercise those rights, they should forfeit them and they should go to another television station that can provide the service. I use the example of .the Wimbledon finals three years ago, in 1989. Channel 9 had both the Test cricket and the Wimbledon final and it enlisted the aid of of Channel 2 to cover the cricket. It is very important that Australian viewers are given Vicaccess to these sporting broadcasts. I conclude with a plea to Channel 10 to get rid of that disgraceful program called Studs, which is cheap and exploitative of women. It nothing to assist the roles of women and It is on at prime time, it is a disgraceful piece of cheap American television and it does Channel 10 no credit whatsoever to have Chief of the General Staff",66
57,Mr WEBSTER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise just in these 90 seconds to pay tribute to General Grey, the new Chief of the General Staff, for the wonderful day that a number of us experienced at the El Alamein firepower day at rePuckapunyal last Tuesday. My friend the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) was also a recipient of the wonderful hospitality and the excellent display that took place on that day.",66
58,Mr SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,All the big guns were out.,67
59,Mr WEBSTER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"That is so. We were greatly privileged to realise, through the demonstrations that were shown to us in this excellent training exercise, just how dangerous war can be and how we all must continue, as has been the theme of many talks today on the Coral Sea Battle, to make sure that we avoid at all costs future conflicts that are going to see us engaging in the use of such tremendously powerful weapons of war. So I just pay tribute to General Grey and all the staff at Puckapunyal, all his other officers and generals and the men in the field for the outstanding display, not to mention the magnificent efforts of the pilots of the FlUs and FA18s we saw that day. Fairfield City Tennis Association",67
60,Mrs CROSIO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to raise a concern that I have with the Fairfield City Council in that it is considering taking away the lease of the Fairfield Tennis Association. This association has been a voluntary amateur association running for some 63 years, which every 10 years has a renewable lease of the courts it now plays on. It has over that period trained many professional tennis players but, most particularly, at the moment, has something like 700 in the association. It is, as I said, an amateur club. trains juniors and seniors, and it even has an aged team that competes successfully throughout the districts. Its courts are renowned for the work that has been put in on a voluntary basis. Now, I think, the Council sees it as an asset from which it can gain extra revenue. I appeal to the Council and the elected representatives to have consideration for what an amateur group has done over 63 years within the Fairfield City, and most particularly to preserve its rights to control, as an amateur group, those particular facilities. I would like to see it expand in what it is trying to do and that in future, the lease is a longer term than what has been granted to it in the past. We need to encourage the amateur part of our sporting endeavours. Most particularly, we need to encourage those people who give up so much of their time in training the juniors within our communities. I would like to say to Fairfield City Council that it should reconsider the action it is contemplating in taking away the lease of this particular group and acknowledge the work that has been undertaken by this group and its predecessors over the last 63 years within our Fairfield City Council area. Child-care",67
61,Mr TUCKEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) recently got up to cry some crocodile tears on behalf of people seeking child-care arrangements, but he overlooked the fact that his own Minister said the other day in this place that the first responsibility was to create more child-care places. Of course, without them, people cannot even get the opportunityÂ· to spend the money on the child-care for which he bemoans. Recently, in the electorate of Swan-the responsibility of another Minister in this place, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley)-a firm called Sigma Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd put a proposition to the Minister whereby it would build 19 child-care places for its staff and the staff of adjoining premises, including It Telecom. It said it would spend substantial amounts of its own money and make the land available, but it sought $40,ObO assistanceapproximately $2,000 per child place---':but the Minister refused the application. The Minister, who has just entered the chamber, might like to add to it because it is in his electorate and he was approached on it and apparently could not do anything, either. The unions got their nose out of joint because they were not leading the push. One trade unionist ,,:,rote to the paper criticising the young lady who had made most of the effort within that business because she was a member of staff, and she was not from the work of force. If that is the way the Government is going to go on, I do not want to see its crocodile tears, because it is not doing the things it should do first. (TIme expired) Fightback",67
62,Mr COURTICE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Speaker, I am proud to defend child-care and low income working families against the mob on the other side who want to put a tax on food and clothes and give tax breaks to Ferrari drivers and those who eat caviar. The real difference between those on this side of the House and those opposite is that we actually care about Australians, not special privilege or the House of Lords in England. We will never bow our heads to those opposite or to the privileged overseas. That is what this is all about. If we strike a nerve, that is too for those opposite. To put a tax of $40m on child-care is an absolute disgrace. It is un-Australian, just like the Fightback package and we will expose that over the next 12 months. Tourism",68
63,Mr JULL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to pay tribute to the work that was done by Mr Tony Thirlwell, the General Manager of the Australian Tourist Commission, who announced, sadly, his resignation this week. Under very difficult circumstances, I think he has done an outstanding job for Australia. It must have been a most frustrating job after the succession of Ministers that he had to put up with and some of the difficult times this country has faced, such as during the pilots dispute. We will free up the ATC and we will give the next General Manager a fair go.",68

67,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can the Minister advise the House of the labour market situation in April? What consequences does this have for the employment prospects of Australians? Will the Government encourage the creation of dead-end jobs to overcome this situation?",68
68,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The unemployment rate, as announced today for April, is 10.4 per cent, down from 10.5 per cent the previous March. Most of that movement is a product bad of a change in the participation rate. From that point of view it is no cause for celebration. As I think has become a cliche in this place and elsewhere, in analysing the fact that we are now coming out of a recession, the last set of figures to move will be those that are related to the levels of unemployment. Interestingly enough, the leading indicators of employment that my Department put out yesterday showed some very positive growth indeed. Motor vehicle registrations were up almost 10 per cent in March; dwelling approvals were up 7 per cent in March; ANZ vacancies were up half a per cent in March, and half a per cent in April; CES vacancies notified were up 6 per cent in March; CES unfilled vacancies were up 2112 per cent for the March quarter; ABS vacancies were up 3 per cent for the March quarter; ABS overtime was up 6 per cent for the same period; and the DEET skilled vacancies surveys have been rising steadily since mid-1990-91. One of the figures that is of some interest in the material coming out today shows that there has been an improvement in teenage unemployment. Those between 15 and 19 years looking for full time work fell by 5,100 in April to 123,400. It is worth focusing on that for a minute because, whilst there has been over the last few months a substantial of concentration on the situation of teenagers in unemployment, certain things need to be said about it. The percentage of that age group unemployed is about 9.3 per cent, compared with 12.3 per cent in April 1983. Indeed, in total numbers, there were 34,000 fewer unemployed teenagers in April this year than there were in April 1983. This is because young people are where they ought to be-in training, in schools, in universities, and in TAFEs. Considerable effort has been spent on the part of this Government over the last nine years to put them exactly where they ought to be. There will be further effort, at least if this Government retains office, to ensure that even greater numbers are educated-which I must say is an extraordinary contrast in the huge number of contrasts now being opened up between this side of politics in Australia and the other side. I came across a most extraordinary quote today of the Opposition's spokesman on industrial relations, who had this to say about what ought to happen to young people. He said: I want us to go back to a situationthis is becoming a terrible theme, I might saythat used to exist when I left school, and that that if you wanted to get a job as a kid you And, we used to have a saying in Australia called the dead end job. That referred to somebody who got a job that didn't involve any kind of but you could get those in the 50s and 60s, you can't get them any more. And, I would like to see Australia go back to those days where young people had hope, hope, that is, of a dead-end jobinstead of facing the prospect they do nowand these figures are totally inaccurate, of course, as my statistics have indicatedof one in three of them who want a job not being able to get it. I think that is a most extraordinary confession about the attitude of our opponents to the work force, which is why we see absolutely nothing in Fightback- . Mr Lavarch interjecting",68

70,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"dealing with the issues of training. The real desire of the Liberal Party in this place is to forget training; forget about opportunities for creating a skilled work force. What it wants to do is get out there and run around creating dead-end jobs. Very rarely do you get such a confession; usually you get some sort of euphemism to describe it in some other way that makes you look halfway respectable. But there is at least some degree of honesty on the part of the Opposition to correctly define exactly what it means and describe them as dead end jobs. Quite clearly, the unemployment figures that we confront these days give us no joy at all. We can contrast them, of course, with the situation that existed in 1983. If they had had the participation rates then that we have now as a result of our encouraging more and more people into the work force, the level of unemployment under them for this month would have been 13.5 per cent back in 1983. We take no particular joy from that contrast because we want people to participate in the Australian work force, and we want them to participate in the Australian work force in relevant jobs. Because those relevant jobs are there, because the training is there and is, because, as I said, those leading indicators are could. now performing in the way in which I described we, at least on this side of the training, House, offer hope to this country of something a bit better than dead end jobs in the not too distant future.

I refer the Prime Minister to a report on the AAP wire yesterday in which the Marshall Islands Attorney-General, Mr Dennis MCPhillips, stated that a reference provided by Senator Richardson on Mr Symons had been faxed to the Republic from the office of the then Minister for Social Security, namely, Senator Richardson. Mr MCPhillips is also reported to have commented: It is my understanding this particular Minister one of the most powerful Ministers in the Australian Government. He wields great power.  statement in the House last week that Senator Richardson did not use his position to place a phone call to the President of the Marshall Islands and has not 'heavied' any government officials in the Marshall Islands in any shape or form?",69
73,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is nothing explicit or implicit in the question which suggests did. I am not sure what the Leader of the additional National Party is asking me. I said last that Senator Richardson represented himself as an individual, not as a Minister. The fact of the matter is the person he quotes a week or so ago saw no difficulty with Senator Richardson approaching him. I think it is only the notoriety since which has encouraged further statements from him. Indexed Bonds",70
74,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to an article in Tuesday's Australian Financial Review headlined 'Super Boosts Indexed Bonds'. Can the Treasurer package advise the House of the current state of the market for indexed bonds and indexed penbonds. sions in Australia?,70
75,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did see the article and, whilst I have not had an opportunity to all the facts, I understand that it is accurate, though it somewhat understates the current value of Commonwealth Government indexed bonds on issue. The issue of indexed bonds helps the private sector to provide indexed pensions, and the Government se.es advantages in persons retiring with indexed pensions rather than simply living off lump sums. The demand for index linked securities will grow as the Government's retirement income policy encourages more retirees to take up complying annuities. But at this stage the main organisations paying CPI index pensions in Australia continue to be governments rather than those private sector providers. . For the 1991-92 financial year, the Commonwealth has budgeted to pay a total of $2.2 is billion in indexed pensions to retired Commonwealth employees, public servants, retired Australia Post and Telecom employees, et cetera, and also retired members of the defence forces. These pensions are adjusted each July in line with the CPI movement over the 12 months to March of that year. The Government would have to legislate if it way, wanted to abrogate the CPI adjustment. Under those circumstances, it is very strange that the Opposition's Fightback he document contains no allowance for the cost to the Governrilent of adjusting week those pensions when the Opposition's proposed new tax pushes the CPI up. Does the Opposition intend to legislate to stop the CPI adjustment? Is it being deliberately quiet about that? In other words, is it not telling Commonwealth retirees that it does not intend to adjust their pensions for the inflationary consequences of the introduction of the new tax? Or is this just another piece of faulty arithmetic on the part of the Leader of the Opposition? I am sure that all those pensioners in the community would like an answer to this question. Another apparent hole in the Opposition's is that it omits any figure for the cost of the CPI adjustment to the indexed Treasury Is the Opposition intending to renege on the Commonwealth's contractual obligation to bond holders, or is it, as we check suspect, yet another example of the Opbroadly position's erroneous arithmetic? Another example exists as well. Whilst Treasury notes are not formally index linked securities, they are short dated and the stock is regularly rolled over through a process of competitive market tendering. That competitive process means the yield is set by the market and incorporates a market determined rate of compensation for the expected rate of inflation. If the market believed the Opposition that the consumption tax would have only a one-off effect on the CPI and that effect would be limited, as the Opposition suggests, to 4.7 per cent, the competitive tender process would automatically build that figure into the interest yields on the Commonwealth's outstanding treasury notes. This should have appeared as a one-off effect on the public debt interest outlays in the 1994-95 year of Fightback's costings. Its omission is another clear error in Fightback's costings. I have not mentioned the indexed pensions paid by State governments to their exemployees because I suppose the Leader of the Opposition has inÂ· mind that he would expect them to abrogate their own CPI adjustments of those pensions. If not, he should be expected to compensate the States for the cost of meeting the CPI jump in those State fundedÂ· pensions. I have not bothered to put a dollar figure on this last item, but the other three alone add up to over three-quarters of a billion dollars over the three years on which the Opposition claims to have fully calculated the cost of its package. This is another three-quarters of a million dollar hole. It is another three-quarters of a million dollar credibility gap that the Opposition Leader has to contend with. That is on top of the $1 1/2 billion credibility gap that I revealed on Tuesday, on top of the $3.9 billion credibility gap that was revealed by my predecessor last December. That adds up to $6 billion. So at last, the Leader of the Opposition has become the $6 billion man as a result of his own faulty arithmetic.

But day after day we see more examples of the erroneous arithmetic of the Leader of the Opposition. It is about time those opposite admitted that this has been a terrible mistake, full of the most terrible errors, and went back to the drawing board, started to come clean, started to produce Fightback Mark II, Mark III-however many times it takes to get the figures right.

93,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. Can the Minister infonn the House whether the Government supports the protection of basic conditions of employment through legally binding awards? Is there any threat to award protection with the move towards enterprise bargaining?,72
94,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure the honourable membet for Reid and this House that the Government does continue to support the provision of minimum conditions of employment through legally binding awards. Of course, the major benefit of that system is that it provides protection to all employees, regardless of their bargaining power or lack of it, against exploitation. If the award system were ended, or even made more difficult to access, there would clearly be greater scope for exploitation of sections of the work force, which would be forced to accept substantial reductions in conditions of employment. This has been clearly shown by examples that have already been given to the House in respect of New Zealand, which untilÂ· last year had a similar award-based system to our own. Then it deregulated the labour market, that is, it abolished awards as they ran out, and thenceforth provided that employment conditions would be set by contracts of employment. The way in which such a system can work has been demonstrated by a letter from a New Zealand employer to his employee, which was recently published in the Canberra TImes, and it concerned a chap called Steve Edwards, a New Zealand house painter.. Last year he earned an award wage of $436 a week net; this year there is no award and he is earning $347 for the same week's work. The article states: When the award Steve was working under expired, his employer wrote him a letter which amounted to a contract of employment. It read like this: 'Dear Steve, Re: Conditions. of Employment. This is to confirm that your terms of employment with Crozier Decorating Limited Hereafter called the Company, for painting work, are as follows: You are employed as a painters labourer on a fixed fiat hourly rate of $8 which will be taxed at the normal PAYE rate. The company will pay its statutory obligations for ACC allowance on your earnings. Included in the above rate is any travel time, holiday pay, statutory holiday pay, all industrial allowances you would have normally received under the award and any sick pay allowance.' Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Is the Minister able to authenticate this letter? Is he just making it up as he goes along, or did he get someone to write to the paper? I think that the Parliament is entitled to know whether or not it is true. I can write a letter like that to the paper and read it in here; I can write one about dogs.",72
95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat. If the honourable member takes a point of order that purports to be a point of order like that again, I will discipline him. The Minister will answer the question. Mr Thckey- Mr Speaker, I wish to raise a further point of order.",72
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Does the honourable member for O'Connor have a further point of order? Mr Thckey-Yes. Members of this House are entitled to question the veracity of a statement by a Minister.,72
97,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Minister is answering a question. The Minister is giving his indication that he is able to substantiate the matter.,72
98,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, this letter was referred to in the Canberra TImes a few days ago. Perhaps I should read that last bit again because someone interrupted: Included in the above rate is any travel time, holiday pay, statutory holiday paythat is, public holidaysall industrial allowances you would have normally received under the award and any sick pay allowance. In other words, if you are not at work for any reason including but not limited to sickness or bereavement, you will not be paid. You are only paid from the time you start work to when you fip.ish and are expected to work at least 44 hours a' week. The Company will allow 10 minutes morning and afternoon tea time to be taken within paid hours. Your term of employment is hour to hour for as long as the company has work for you. In other words, Steve has a $90 a week pay cut, and no paid sick leave, annual leave, public holidays or any other leave. He works a 44-hour week, has only hourly employment, and in effect can be dismissed at any time without notice. It is a matter of great concern that the Opposition is proposing a similar system for Australia to that which currently exists in New Zealand. Many lower income earners in Australia, but not just lower income earners, would clearly be at risk of being worse off, as the New Zealand example shows. There could be a dramatic deterioration in conditions, and the only alternative that employees would have if they did not like that situation would be to take the sack. The Opposition has said that there would still be the protection of a minimum wage but, as the honourable member for Bennelong-or the dead-end kid, as we probably should call him now-has admitted that that minimum wage could be below the award rate. Today, another Liberal spokesman has blown the whistle on what this policy really means. The Queensland Liberal Party Leader, Joan Sheldon, was interviewed on Radio 4QR in Brisbane this morning regarding the Women's Electoral Lobby survey of the goods and services tax effect. When the question, 'Don't you believe that the motivation there was to widen the debate?', was put to her, she had this to say: If you are going to widen the debate, and if you are going to put time into it, then put a balanced representation. Put the time into it, but be honest and say well we've done this whole survey, we've taken into consideration the abolition of payroll fuel exciseand listen to thisthe fact that the wages of the people who work in all these institutions are going to drop by 30 That is what the Queensland Liberal Leader believes are the implications of the Opposition's industrial relations policy. The Opposition's industrial relations policy would reduce wages for supermarket employees by 30 per cent. . Mr Downer-It is the tax.",72

They publish the GST, the Fightback proposals, and say that everyone will be compensated absolutely, everyone will be better off and no-one will be worse off. They do not take into account a whole host of proposals, and clearly have in mind, through the briefings they have from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Minister for industrial relations, that their policy will involve many people having substantially reduced levels of wages-up to 30 per cent. Mr Nugent-You are deliberately distorting the facts. Mr Bradford-You have got it wrong.",74
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Aston and the honourable member for MCPherson will cease interjecting;,74
112,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Another implication of the loss of award coverage which is relevant to current considerations of this Parliament is fact that there would be a loss of award superannuation. Eighty per cent of Australian employees are covered by awards; 72 per cent of employees have award superannuation entitlement. That gives them a minimum 3 per cent employer contribution. Under the Opposition's proposals, if you lose your award entitlement, you will lose your award superannuation. The employer could possibly continue it, but obviously in many cases would not. It is not just a matter of this Opposition being against the superannuation guarantee levy, which would enhance the minimum amount which currently exists for most employees; it would in fact put a policy in place which would mean that many employees would lose the minimum entitlement of superannuation that they currently have. Mr Nugent-You are a disgrace.",74
113,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is an incredible policy that the Opposition is pursuing. What is becoming obvious is that when this Opposition talks about the big bang policy, it really means, bang, you are going to get a 30 per cent wage cut. Mr Nugent-We have said very clearly that we would keep it. You are distorting it again.",74
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! If the honourable member for Aston interjects again, I will name him.",74
115,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Bang, your 38-hour week is gone. Bang, your paid leave is gone. Bang, your award superannuation is gone. In other words, bang, your living standards have gone, and any hope of a decent living has gone. Taxation: Self-Funded Retirees",74
116,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Treasurer: is it a fact that an age pensioner can have an income up to $10,200 a year without paying tax while a self-funded retiree starts paying tax at $5,400 a year? Is it also a fact that many self-funded retirees have suffered loss of income from falling interest rates and the denial of a range of concessions available to pensioners? Will the Government review this discriminatory tax treatment of self-funded retirees on the modest incomes and increase their income tax threshold to the same level as age pensioners?",74
117,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member's question goes to the point that many of those people living on investments have suffered a decline in their incomes as a result of a reduction in interest rates. That is the consequence of lower inflation in Australia and, as a consequence, lower interest rates. Therefore, those people who in the past were receiving windfall gains from higher interest rates which were experienced over the last couple of years are now coming back to a more normal position. I want to make it clear that it is our objective that interest rates should stay down low, and that will be possible because inflation will stay low. The point to make as far as people on fixed incomes are concerned is that, so long as inflation remains low, an automatic protection is built in for them. Mr Bradford-We all know that. We want to hear your answer.",74
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for MCPherson will cease interjecting.,75
119,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The worse scourge confronting people on fixed incomes is high levels of inflation, which not only eat away at their savings but also force them into a higher cost of living, year after year. So what we are doing in terms of lower levels of inflation carries with it a great benefit for people on fixed incomes. Of course we have sympathy for those people who have suffered a decline in income, just as we have great sympathy for those people who suffered a decline in income because they lost their job. As interest rates went up, people with investments had their incomes increased as a consequence; other people lost their jobs and saw their incomes diminish as a result. Just as the unemployment benefit, at least under this Government, is there as a safety net for people who lose their jobs-unlike the Opposition's policy which would throw these people on to the scrap heap after nine months of unemployment-our unemployment benefit stands there as a safety net for those people who are out of work, who are making an effort to find a job or who are participating some training program to improve their chances of getting a job-similarly, the age pension sits there as a safety net for people retirement. The honourable ,member for North Sydney draws attention to the interrelationship between the pension and the income tax system because both impact on retirement incomes policy. I refer the honourable member to a very detailed statement on retirement incomes policy by the Deputy Prime Minister a couple of years ago when he was the Minister for Social Security which did address many of the questions about the interrelationship between the pension system and the income tax system. The fringe benefits issue is something which the Government has looked at from time to time because, of course, we want to see a fair system. But, whenever we have looked at the fringe benefits area, we have found that many of the fringe benefits are provided by State governments. Of course, some are provided by us in the form of health benefits and so on, and those have been reviewed from time to time; but many of the fringe benefits which are available on the basis of pension entitlements are those provided by State governments, and I suggest that the honourable member direct his attention in that area. If there are some matters of detail which were included in the honourable member's question and which I might have managed to overlook in this answer, I will be happy to respond to him in greater detail. Tariffs: Manufacturers in Queanbeyan",75
120,Mr SNOW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the growing number of manufacturers in Queanbeyan. Will the Prime Minister advise whether he is aware of proposals to eliminate tariffs entirely? Can industry rely on movements in the exchange rate to provide protection from foreign competition?,75
121,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Australia needs to be more internationally competitive in its industry. As that has happened over the past decade, we have seen industries grow and proliferate in places, including Queanbeyan, where formerly industry was very light indeed. The development of such competitive in industries needs to be achieved while ensuring the long term viability of industry in general. That is precisely what the Government's in policies are producing: a program of tariff reductions against a background of workplace reform and micro-economic reform in such areas as transport and electricity, with these tariff reductions set out well in advance to provide certainty for investment decisions so that the businesses understand what climate they will be in, that the protection levels are coming down, that the economy is becoming more productive and efficient, that inflation is falling, that interest rates are falling, that a competitive exchange rate mechanism is in place and that we are seeing micro-economic reform. . The end point of the Government's tariff reductions is between 5 per cent and 25 per cent. Important parts of industry would simply not survive without this continued modest level of support. The strategy is clearly working in areas such as the motor vehicle industry which is investing in state of the art technology. My colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy last week announced a plan for the dairy industry which was developed in close consultation with that industry. We will see an increasingly efficient, competitive industry. Similarly, following the Industry Commission report on sugar, the Minister will be consulting with the industry on how best to achieve a dynamic and profitable sugar industry. In this regard I was pleased to see that the Chairman of the Queensland Canegrowers Council, Mr Bonanno, has welcomed the opportunity to participate in this process. This is all in stark contrast to the zero proposals of the Opposition. Yesterday on the John Laws program we had the Leader of the Opposition again saying: The aim is to eliminate tariffs. But of course, exchange rate movement can still provide protection. I notice that report was picked up in the Australian Financial Review in an article headed 'Hewson back to zero tariffs'. It talked about that and states: The Deputy Leader of the National Party, Mr Lloyd, has told The Australian Financial Review Dr Hewson had assured him that Opposition policy meant 5 per cent sugar tariffs by the year 2000. ""The National Party resolved to emphasise that Fight-back! provides for negligible-not zero only-tariff policy,"" last week's party room statement said. Yet the Leader of the Opposition is out there talking about eliminating tariffs on industry. The fact is that we have seen this proposal for zero tariffs and smokescreen references, but of course the exchange rate movement can still provide protection. In other words, if the exchange rate goes down, the effective level of protection rises. So the Leader of the Opposition is arguing and slipsliding on the basis, 'Look, we can have a zero level of protection because if the exchange rate goes down, that may in fact lead to an increase in effective protection above even the 5 percentage point nominal level'. Well, what if the exchange rate goes up? What happens then? What do you do to your zero tariffs then-add on new tariff levels? Do you go and add on tariffs? Do you put tariffs up? The fact is, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is wandering around with a zero tariff policy and he has these smokescreen words about the exchange rate, as though the exchange rate goes in only one direction-that is down. Again on the Sunday program on 5 April, he said to Laurie Oakes: We're absolutely locked in, Laurie, with a commitment to go to what we said was negligible protection-that is zero plus or minus, I suppose, up to 5 per cent because the exchange rate does move around. Every sentence carries this exchange rate reference. The fact is he is pursuing a zero tariff tariff policy, while the National Party is running around the countryside saying, 'No, they will be only 5 per cent on sugar' .. We caught out the honourable member for Benthe nelong in the Herbert River Express. He is a special, John. He gets out there when he thinks there are a few local reporters and says all the local things, and then he behaves himself when he gets back within cooee of the capital city media. He said, 'By ""negligible"" you can really mean anything from zero to 5 or 10 per cent'; that is the tune he is singing. Then in the National Party of Australia media release we see, 'The party resolved to emphasise that Fightback provides for negligible, not zero-only, tariffs'. Well, you had better tell that to your leader who said yesterday that he aimed to eliminate tariffs. Maybe we are a little simple and 'eliminate' does not mean 'zero'; but it does mean zero. References to the movement in the exchange rate lifting or lowering levels of effective protection are valid only if one assumes also that the exchange rate can rise and lower the level of effective protection. If you have got a zero tariff rate, what are you then supposed to do? In your terms of reference, you add on to tariffs, or increase tariffs. This is the sleight of hand that the public is being given. Then we had the Toyota Motor Co. making its position clear in yesterday's press: 'Car boss hits tariff plan'. It said: Toyota's Australia boss would like to stop construction of the company's $420m Altona plant because of the Opposition's zero tariff policy, auto industry executives said yesterday. I notice Mr Johnson was on the Laws program today talking about the deleterious effect of a zero tariff pn the motor vehicle industry. The Leader of the Opposition has been called Captain Zero and the fact is that going for zero tariffs in the way in which he is, while having the National Party mislead its constituency around the country with statements that h-ve no truth in them whatsoever, is the sort of duplicity which has brought public policy inÂ· this country into disrepute. Opposition Members-Ha! Ha!",75

142,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The fact that he has a meeting with the relative about the relative's circumstances means what? Nothing! Superannuation Guarantee Levy,78
143,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Prime Minister. Is he aware of comments which suggest that relying on tax incentives is not an effective way of encouraging saving for retirement? Are these comments consistent with the approach contained in the Government's superannuation guarantee levy?,78
144,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are. That is why the Government introduced it. I noticed that, in its submission to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, the Treasury indicated on page 6 in two tables that the additional superannuation contributions due to the levy would be $11.1 billion per annum by 200001. That is, the superannuation guarantee levy will add to national savings to the tune of the current account deficit of Australia every year by the year 2000. Then in the second table it lists the increase in annual post-tax private retirement benefits due to the levy on a cash flow basis, so that by 2030 there will be a further $50 billion per annum going into superannuation. It goes on to say on page 8 of the same docum-nt in terms of tables that an individual on half of average weekly earnings, as a result of the superannuation guarantee levy, would have a 31 per cent increase in retirement benefit. That is, an ordinary working person on half of average weekly earnings, AWE, would have a 31 per cent increase in retirement benefit as a result of the Government's superannuation guarantee levy. In just eight years from now, the equivalent of the current account deficit of Australia will be accruing in superannuation funds because of the levy-$l1 billion a year, and $50 billion a year in 30 years time when the contributions and the earnings start to multiply. Out of those important statistics, we have got the Opposition trying to fabricate a case of how the superannuation guarantee levy is not in the national interest and at the same time trying to suggest that the introduction of such a levy will in fact lead to increased unemployment, which, of course, was put down by the Secretary to the Treasury yesterday in his testimony. I quote from the Hansard of the Committee hearing where the Secretary is talking about the material which made quite a splash in the press. He said: That splash is, in the main, based on what I consider to be wilful misconstructions of the material provided in answer to Senator Alston's questions. That is the Secretary to the Treasury-'wilful misconstructions'. He continued: The material provided was not really Treasury analysis of the likely impact of the SOL on unemployment. The material provided was simply a simple exercise of modelling using assumptions that were provided in the question placed by Senator Alston. He went on to say: It has long been known that, with economic modelling or indeed, any sort of modelling, with anything that uses computers to generate lots of numbers, garbage in produces garbage out.. On this occasion, the assumptions, as I say, were specified in the question . . . In other words, he was asked a question based on garbage assumptions by the Liberal Party; he put garbage assumptions into the model and they produced garbage results which you then try to represent as being the Treasury'sdishonestly, as always, try to misrepresent as being the Treasury's. In the one great change to retirement incomes in this country, which will see an equivalent of the current account deficit added every year to national savings from the year 2000, you try to blackguard it and drag it down on the basis of a fictitious claim made from assumptions published by you at your request. Mr Reith-Even the Treasury would not say that.",78
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,78
146,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it always suits you to blackguard the Treasury when the numbers do not suit you and, when you think they do, you hold them up as paragons of economic '\'irtueMr Reith-You just misrepresented it.",78
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition!,79
148,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Only Mr Cole has stood you up for your dishonesty. Mr Speaker, today the Financial Review under the headmg 'AMP supports Government's super policies' , says: . . . the AMP Society declared its support for compulsory superannuation. It says that Mr Salmon said: Incentives have not in the past succeeded in generating sufficient savings to support adequate levels of income in retirement for most people Dead true. He said: Until now, social security age pensions. in Australia have been paid for out of taxatIon revenue on what is called the pay-as-you-go system ... He said: But, for the demographic' reasons, the pay--sÂ­ you-go system will become much more expensIve in the 21st century-so much so that the retIrement benefit cost burden on the taxpayers of those days will be almost double what it is now unless changes are made. Common sense and practicality require that those who are to retire then should begin to save for retirement now . . . He went on to say: ... the Superannuation Guarantee Levy, c-rrently before Parliament, would enable a worth-while base to be built up by the time the issue became too difficult to manage. That is from the largest retirement income management fund in Australia, the AMP Society. Yet we have the wilful, mindless, shameless opposition from the coalition parties in the Senate to the superannuation guarantee levy, all on the basis that working people will receive a benefit from - he tax concession to improve their retirement mcome standards. As the Treasury data indicates, a person on half average weekly earnings-and surely you have not got it in for someone on half average weekly earnings-picks up a 31 per cent improvement in retirement income. Mr Reith-You are not relying on that table! They admit that that table",79
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,79
150,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As well as that, there is an $11 billion a year addition just eight years hence; that is the equivalent of the call by Australia on overseas savings via the current account, and the additions to our international indebtedness are met by savings under the superannuation guarantee levy eight years away. And they want to try and knock it, simply for reasons of envy. They are run by envy. Do not give working people an even break; do not give the ordinary bods an even break-rip it off them and give it to the wealthy again. The other thing, in terms of those Senate Estimates committees: again a . . . , Treasury answer which was relevant to costs said, when talking about productivity: Annual growth of this o-der of one and a half per cent would be equivalent to a total increase in productivity of about 14 - er cent in the peri?<i ov-r which the SGL is to be Introduced. On thIS baSIS the SGL cost would account for less than one-third of productivity increases over the period of its introduction. One-third of productivity! You say it is not affordable in national terms. You are left without a leg to stand on. In terms of retirement benefits, in terms of national savings, in terms of equity and justice, and in terms of Mr Salmon's remarks about common sense and practicability, you are left without a leg to stand on. Yet you are still trying to hide behind the ideological tripe of the Fightback! document, which would damn us again to Budget only funded retirement income for a retired aged population double the present population in 20 years from now. Yet you are not prepared even to support the hard work which has been done by the Government over a decade to sensibly move this into place. There has been no more wilful demonstration of simply wrecking something useful to the national image, to the national interest than this kind of approach by the j Opposition parties in the Senate on this particular levy. It is well and good that the Treasury has stood you up for misrepresenting it and using it, and shamefully abusing it. Minister for Transport and Communications",79

Can the Minister inform the House of what action the Government is taking to lift the level of awareness of the importance of science and technology to Australia's future development? Mr Ruddock-Do you see relatives with their lawyers in your office?,80
164,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Dundas interjects again, I will name him.",80
165,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and I acknowledge his continuing interest in matters scientific, particularly the institutions of AIMS, James their Cook University and the Davies Laboratory, all of which, coincidentally, are located in the electorate of Herbert. Yes, the Government is fully aware of the need for attitudinal change towards science in Australia. Last year, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce commissioned a survey of attitudes of Australians to science and technology. This survey found that many young people felt that there was no association between science and things of value in society, except perhaps for medical breakthroughs. Science was seen as a hard subject about discoveries made elsewhere at another time. The stereotype of the scientist as an old, eccentric man in a white coat persisted, and scientists were described by one respondent as nerds and losers. We need to develop in the Australian community a better understanding of how pervasive science is to all aspects of our lives. I am pleased to say that this is a challenge to which the Government has responded and continues to respond. For example, the Government has highlighted science and technology awareness as one of the four key themes to be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper. Further, the Government's commitment was underlined last week at the presentation of the Australia Prize. I was delighted that the Prime Minister was able to attend that function and to present the awards. In addition, the Prime Minister has underlined his commitment to the awareness of the fundamental importance of science and technology by requiring that the date of the next meeting of the Science Council be moved in order that he can attend that meeting. The importance of the Australia Prize is that it places Australian science in an international context. Globalisation of technology is not just a concept, but an important part of Australia's new and outward looking culture. Of course, science and technology awareness is not just for students and business leaders. Many of the Opposition members in this House would do well to show some interest in this area. It is clear that, at least among the shadow Cabinet, science has no profile. We have been promised an Opposition science policy for many months.",80
166,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They don't care about it.,81
167,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is right; they do not care about it. All we have seen from the Opposition so far is a multimillion dollar looting of the nation's science base in Fightback! and the attachment of a few research afterthoughts to the rump of its education policy. I must say there is little better in the offing. Honourable members would have seen Peter Hartcher's article in Monday's Sydney Morning Herald which listed eight policy areas that were being looked at by the Oppositionan exercise described by senior members of the Opposition as 'turning up the policy knob'. Unfortunately, science is a notable omission from the Opposition's policy dialit does not appear among the eight. By contrast, the Government recognises the importance to Australia of a strong and dynamic science and technology system; It will continue to weave elements of science into the fabric of future economic initiatives. The science community overwhelmingly understands and respects the Government's record in this area. Until the Opposition catches up with the Government and learns to take science seriously, it cannot hope to enjoy the same level of respect.",81

171,Mr TUCKEY,ALLOCATION OF CALLS FROM THE,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. I refer you to your decision during Question Time today to give the call to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) ahead of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Furthermore, I draw your attention to a previous answer you gave me when you indicated that for the purpose of Question Time you propos-d to treat the honourable member for North Sydney as a member of the Opposition. Page 487 of House of Representatives Practice, under the heading, 'Allocation of the call', states: The Speaker first calls an opposition Member, and the call is then alternated from right to the Chair. On the opposition side priority is given to the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It then goes on to talk about two parties. Mr Speaker, in light of this information, is it your intention to continue or to change this convention of parliamentary practice?",82
172,Mr SPEAKER,ALLOCATION OF CALLS FROM THE,"As I have mentioned to honourable members on at least two occasions in the past, for the purpose of the way in which the Parliament operates and has operated, the House is divided into government and non-government members. Independents who are not part of the governing group sit with the opposition. Just after the last election, I notified the House, and I think I also outlined it to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), who asked me about it, that I would allocate the call by giving the Independents-at that time it was only the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack)-an exact proportion of calls that was entitled to them as people who were entitled to ask questions. One arrives at that using a figure of 120 because approximately 120 members of this House are able to ask questions. Ministers cannot ask questions, I cannot ask questions and the parliamentary secretaries cannot ask questions. Mr Tim Fischer-They do.",82
173,Mr SPEAKER,ALLOCATION OF CALLS FROM THE,"I really like the way the Leader of the National Party tries to help me out, but I would prefer that he was a bit factual when he helped me out. I know how I allocate the call. He might have another view in his head, but I know how I do it. I CHAIR will give the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Wills the call about 120 times after the first question they ask. So the honourable member for Wills has not even got into the slot yet. That is how I allocate the call. I will normally give preference to the Leader of the Opposition. I will normally give some lesser preference, but preference, to the Leader of .the National Party. In fact, one generally tries to give the three leadership people on the non-Government side and the three leadership people on the Government side a little more flexibility than others. I see the Leader of the National Party nodding his left of head, so he agrees with me on that matter. On days when it appears that all the questions are going to be asked by the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the National Party, and it is the tum of the honourable member for North Sydney or the honourable member for Wills, I will find a way to slot them in. I will not give them the first question, as I have always not, but I will give them a question on that day. Today we had six questions from the nonGovernment side. Four of them were from the Leader of the Opposition, one was from the Leader of the National Party and the other was from the honourable member for North Sydney. I do not think I can be more fair than that to the 'Leader of the Opposition, and I do not think that he would expect me to be more fair than that. NA Visit to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea",82
174,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"by leave-I take this opportunity to provide the House with information and observations arising from my visit to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea between 21 and 26 April. I visited these two countries to emphasise the Government's determination to make Australia's place in the region more certain. Indonesia and Papua New Guinea are close and important neighbours. Both have rapidly growing economies and hold great promise as destinations for Australian exports and investment. Both are vital to our regional security. To a very considerable extent it what we do now in these and other countries of the region that the future of Australia depends. In going to Indonesia it was my intention to demonstrate to the Indonesian Government and the Australian people that Indonesia is in the first rank of our priorities. It is in many ways the best test of our ability to do the things we must do in the wider region. Indonesia naturally commands our attention. It is the fourth most populous country in the world. It is a leading member of the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, and a key player in regional affairs. As our close northern neighbour, Indonesia has an important bearing on our security environment. More than is commonly appreciated in Australia, we have benefited very directly from the achievements of President Suharto's New Order Government over the last 25 years. Between 1966 and 1991, Indonesia's real GOP rose 450 per cent. Over the last few years Indonesia's economic growth has averaged around 7 per cent. It is expected to be around 5 or 6 per cent until the end of the decade. Through a sound policy of encouraging foreign investment, bureaucratic reform, financial deregulation and support for manufacturing and lifting of trade barriers, Indonesia has emerged as a dynamic and competitive economic force. Political stability and economic advancement in Indonesia have not only led to dramatic improvements in the standard of living of the Indonesian people; they have also contributed to stability and prosperity in the wider South East Asian region. Australia gains from all of this commercially. In 1991, our two-way merchandise trade with Indonesia was worth $2.4 billion. Exports to Indonesia were worth $1.4 billion, making it our tenth largest overseas market. But just as importantly, our national security benefits from aÂ· benign environment in the region to our north where not so many years ago there was great uncertainty and volatility. In describing the stake Australia has inis on volved in cooperative relations with Indonesia, I readily acknowledge that our relationship with that country has sometimes been strained. Since 1975, East Timor has been a recurring and sometimes divisive issue. My firm conviction is that the only realistic way for us to approach our relationship with Indonesia is to start from the assumption that, as neighbours, each side wants to deal with the other seriously and constructively. We can build a worthwhile relationship if we work on the firm ground of shared interests and develop institutional links which consolidate our progress. We must recognise continuing differences in our cultures and outlooks without allowing ourselves to be obsessed by them. This was the basic approach I followed in Indonesia, both in discussions with President Suharto and his Ministers, and in public statements. The centrepiece of my program in Jakarta was a very cordial two-hour discussion with President Suharto. He explained at length the aspirations of the Indonesian people in regard to their independence, their progress in nation-building, and his own concern to nurture stable political institutions. In turn, I described the Government's commitment to lead Australia into wholehearted engagement with Asia. This led us to agree to look for ways to strengthen the institutional framework of the bilateral relationship, to reflect better its growing maturity and diversity, and to guarantee its overall resilience in times of difficulty in specific areas. The President agreed to my proposal to establish a ministerial forum which will meet at least once every two years to review the bilateral relationship and set an agenda for cooperation, especially in economic areas. The forum will be co-chaired by the two Foreign Ministers and involve at least two economic Ministers from each side. The President and I witnessed the signing of three bilateral agreements which add further shape to the formal framework of the relationship. They cover double taxation, fisheries cooperation and extradition. The Indonesian Government agreed to conclude further bilateral agreements, covering investment protection and promotion, copyright, the delimitation of outstanding maritime boundaries, and mutual assistance on criminal matters. My discussions with President Suharto were complemented by very useful separate meetings with Foreign Minister Alatas, six economic Ministers-whom I met jointlyand Defence Minister Murdani. I was impressed by the calibre of the Ministers in the Indonesian Cabinet, and by their confident determination to continue the process of economic development and nation-building. I made a point of thanking Foreign Minister Alatas for the friendly and creative relations that he and Senator Evans have cemented for our joint benefit. With Defence Minister Murdani, I repeated what I had said to President Suharto about Australia's satisfaction with our bilateral defence relations with Indonesia, and our interest in expanding contacts such as highlevel consultations, joint exercises, and training exchanges. General Murdani supported the current approach of. proceeding step by step and expressed confidence that our defence relations would continue to grow. During my visit I was also glad to have the opportunity to lend the Government's support to the activities of Australian business in Indonesia. I opened offices for AOTC in Jakarta; also for the Western Australian Government, an office in Surabaya; and addressed an Indonesian and Australian business audience organised by the East Java Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There has been some comment in the Australian media to the effect that, in my discussions with the Indonesian Government, I did not give sufficient weight to Australian concerns about East Timor and human rights issues. Let me repeat what I said about this publicly in Jakarta. While recognising the importance of the media in both countries, I believe it is not up to them but up to the two governments to set the agenda for the bilateral relationship. The Indonesian Government responded positively to our putting first priority on the establishAustralia ment of a basis for a long term cooperative relationship. Having established a constructive basis for dialogue, I took appropriate opportunities to raise with President Suharto, Foreign Minister Alatas and Defence Minister Murdani, our concern about the killings in DiH last November and human rights in East Timor. I registered firmly our view that the unhappy situation in East Timor detracts from Indonesia's otherwise impressive achievements, and said it is likely to continue to attract close public attention in Australia. I repeated the Australian Government's view that the Indonesian Government's response to the DiH killings had been a credible one. I underlined our continuing concern for the welfare of the East Timor people and emphasised three points: Â· the need for a more benign, and therefore constructive, approach by the armed forces. Â· the need for long term reconciliation, taking account of the economic aspirations of the people of East Timor, and Â· our concern about using the criminal code to deal with non-violent political protest. I explained that our aim as concerned outsiders was not to challenge Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor, but to assist where we could in measures for the welfare of the people, and to support a process of reconciliation between them and the Indonesian authorities. As a practical example of how Australia can help, a memorandum was signed during my visit providing for an $l1.5m aid project to improve water supply and sanitation in parts of East Timor. In advance of my visit to Indonesia, I had written to President Suharto about the possibility of establishing a process of periodic Asia-Pacific heads of government meetings, preferably based on the APEC mechanism. I was encouraged by Pre-ident Suharto's response. He endorsed the proposal and underlined the need for proceeding carefully, a view with which I entirely agree. Since returning from Indonesia, I have received a letter from President Bush welcoming the proposal for periodic APEC heads of government meetings. He encouraged to promote the proposal in a way that takes account of separate moves to develop the institutionalisation of APEC. The suggestion of periodic APEC heads of government meetings is not an initiative being, pursued against a specific deadline. But it is intrinsically a worthwhile idea and is now finding its way onto the regional agenda. A recurring issue in Australia's relation.s with South East Asia is whether our free media is an obstacle in the path of constructive relations. In fact, this issue end of an address to a large audience in Jakarta. I made a point of saying that I believed the Australian media-and a free press in general-need not be feared in Indonesia. Indeed, rather than wish us to constrain our media from disseminating what they might regard as unfairly critical views, they should themselves take advantage of the opportunity always available in our media to respond to the criticism. It may be of particular interest to honourable members that the heightened interest in Australian identity and nationhood has struck a positive chord in Indonesia. It is not really surprising that a country like Indonesia, which had to fight so hard for its independence, should be interested in the emergence here of a more clear-cut view of Australian nationhood. Let me emphasise that our purpose is not to ingratiate ourselves with Indonesia or any other nation, as some honourable members seem inclined to imply. Australia's nationhood, its re-generated sense of identity and purpose, will be determined by Australians, on Australian terms and as suits us best as a people. At the same time, there is no harm in observing that indications of a leSs equivocal sense of hood actually help our foreign policy. My visit to Indonesia achieved all its objectives. It accelerated the building of a network of connections and institutional links: diplomatic, cultural and, above all, commerciallinks, which have given greater substance to the bilateral relationship. I am satisfied I struck the right balance in underlining our commitment to a positive relationship with Indonesia, while firmly registering our views in areas of difference. There is now a basis for the expansion of relations with our largest close neighbour, a key country in a region vital to our security and prosperity. It was with great pleasure that I visited another close neighbour and important partner in the region, Papua New Guinea. That the visit was occasioned by the commemoration of the heroism and sacrifice of Australian, Papuan, New Guinean and Allied servicemen in the most crucial battles of our history, arose at the made it a privilege. It is a tragedy of our history that there are a great many places in the world where Australians died in battle and lie buried. The stories of their gallantry are legion, and the monuments and rituals we have constructed to their memory ensure that we will not forget. It is not surprising that the First World War, in which 60,000 young Australians were killed, and the first great battle in which Australians took part, Gallipoli, should have come to dominate our national legend in this century. Yet it is ironic that our knowledge and appreciation of the battles which were truly in defence of this country and the civilisation we had built here are less well known. It is my earnest hope that the fiftieth anniversary commemoration of the terrible, yet ultimately triumphant, battles of the Kokoda Track, Milne Bay and other places in Papua New Guinea will re-awaken our regard for them, and in time fix them at the centre of our tradition. It is certainly to be hoped that the story of the campaign in Papua New Guinea, and the story of the battle for Australia in 1942, will become known to all Australian nation- Australians. It was one of my great privileges to pay, on behalf of Australia, due homage to the Papuan and New Guinean war carriers whose assistance to our troops was arguably the greatest humane gesture in our history. Arising from my discussions with Prime Minister Namaliu and my visit to Kokoda, I was happy to announce various steps the Australian Government will take to show our appreciation of past sacrifices for Australia and Papua New Guinea. I offered Australian assistance to establish in the Waigani district of Port Moresby a memorial to commemorate the deeds of the PNG war carriers. As I said in the House last week, I warmly welcome Prime Minister Namaliu's announcement that the Kokoda Trail and Kokoda village will be declared a national heritage area to preserve their historical significance. While in Papua New Guinea, I announced that the Australian Government would be happy to help establish rest facilities for people walking along the Kokoda Trail, improve local welfare facilities at Kokoda, and,improve the local war museum. The cooperation between Australians and Papua New Guineans in defence of their countries left a profound friendship as its legacy. That it endures was plain in the reception we received everywhere we went, and in discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr Namaliu, and other officials. Papua New Guinea's democracy remains vigorous. Through a difficult period of structural adjustment, the economy has become more competitive and resilient. Notwithstanding the effects of the Bougainville problem and falls in commodity prices in 1991, real GDP grew by 9 per cent. Driven by developments in the mining sector, that growth rate presages a resources boom which, if it is managed judiciously, promises to lay a sound basis for the country's economic future. PNG has also become more outward looking. Like Australia, it is working to make the most of the opportunities generated by growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Without abandoning its ties with the South Pacific, it has developed new links with ASEAN. It has consolidated a close relationship with our mutual neighbour, Indonesia. Australia's economic relationship with PNG continues to expand. Two-way trade last year reached a record $l. 7 billion, an increase of 48 per cent over the previous year. Opportunities for our exports should rise as demand is generated by the anticipated resources boom. The principal problem for PNG remains the one which its Prime Minister defined so precisely - without security, economic development cannot proceed, and without development, security cannot be guaranteed. During my visit I reaffirmed Australia's commitment to security and defence cooperation with Papua New Guinea, as set out in the Agreed Statement on Security Cooperation of September 1991. But more work needs to be done to ensure that this cooperation is fully effective. In particular, I stressed the need for Papua New Guinea to develop its own integrated and comprehensive plan of action on security force reform and resource allocation. During my talks in Port Moresby I stressed the need for a peaceful solution, through dialogue and reconciliation, to the continuing problems of Bougainville. I made it clear that Australia was willing to help with the reconstruction that will be needed on Bougainville. At the same time. I stressed the need for the PNG Government to keep up regular supplies of humanitarian goods and channels of communication with Bougainvilleans, and, equally, our desire to facilitate such aid. We can be confident, I believe, that the people of Papua New Guinea have the will and the capacity to meet the challenges which face them. Australia stands ready to give what help it can on the path to greater stability and prosperity. As partners in a changing world, a self-reliant PNG, and thus a PNG better placed to realise its aspirations and potential, will be in both our interests. The world is undergoing profound changes-and nowhere is this more the case than in our own neighbourhood, During the past decade the economies of north-east and South East Asia have been expanding at approximately twice the world average. They will continue to grow. Through our strategic location and expanding links with the region, Australia stands to benefit greatly. It will not happen without an effort. It will require imagination, initiative and persistence. It will require belief in ourselves. It will require these things from governments, Federal and State. It will require them from business. It will require them, I believe, at a truly national level. By this, I mean that to seize the opportunities and assure our long term security, without prejudice to our predominantly British and European origins and our continuing affections for those places, we must determine as a people to think of Australia as a place whose history is its own, whose traditions and values are its own, whose future is most definitely its own. In going to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea I sought to strengthen our regional linkages, to open dialogues, and to help to lay the foundations for relationships which will enable us to contribute to and share in the fruits of regional growth. I sought to demonstrate the importance ,Australia attaches to its growing integration with the Asia-Pacific region, and the importance we attach-and must attach-to increasing the breadth and depth of our understanding of those countries. I do not think we should be surprised if we find that in coming to know our neighbours as never before, we come to know ourselves as never before. I present the following paper: Prime MinisterVisit to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea-Ministerial Statement, 7 May 1992. Motion (by Mrs Kelly) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of standing and sessional orders suspended as would prevent Dr Hewson (Leader of the Opposition) speaking for a period not exceeding 20 minutes.",82
175,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The Opposition welcomes the opportunity to debate a statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) detailing his recent visit to Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, as he saw it. After all, we called on him to make it at the end of his trip because we felt very strongly that the Prime Minister sold this nation short on that overseas trip. The Prime Minister failed to demonstrate any genuine understanding of what is required to develop our links with the Asia-Pacific region. He certainly failed in any way to provide any substance to the development of the relationship between Australia and Indonesia and he showed a characteristic unbelievably embarrassing to most Australians: a tendency to tug his forelock to the Indonesians, rather than to state in a hardheaded sense what is in Australia's best interests. Most notably, he denigrated the Australian flag on foreign soil and foreshadowed that he would change our flag. He announced that while he was overseas, rather than having the guts to do so in this country. For these and many reasons we are very pleased to have this opportunity to debate this statement today. In doing so, I want to make it perfectly clear at the outset that we firmly believe the future of Australia is principally in the Asia Pacific region. On the other side, we have a Johnny-come-lately to this issue. This is the guy who used to overfly Asia. Asia was a place that the Prime Minister overflew en route to London and, particularly, Paris to get his French clocks. He has only latterly discovered that Asia is a very important area for Australia and, indeed, where our future lies. The development of the Fightback package, our whole policy thrust and our view of Australia in the year 2000 are all carefully constructed on an objective assessment of the potential that is in the Asia-Pacific region for a country like Australia. The Fightback package recognises that we will not capitalise be on that opportunity simply because we happen to be located nearby. We will have to make a lot of changes. We will have to develop a lot of policies and, most importantly, now that the foreign policy considerations of the world areÂ· driven by economic considerations, we will have to get our economic house in order, if we are ever to play an effective part in the Asia-Pacific region and if we are ever to restore our standing in that region. It is also why, in the two years I have been Leader of the Opposition, I have focused on the Asia-Pacific region in my overseas trips. Not only did I visit Indonesia and speak to President Suharto and other Ministers to whom this Prime Minister spoke, as well as others in Papua New Guinea; I have also been right through Asia. I have taken a trade delegation to Taiwan and developed a whole host of other links with the Asia-Pacific region, which demonstrates that I have a much clearer understanding of the direction in which this country can go and the potential that is there for us at this time. There are about six major reasons why I believe that the Prime Minister's trip to Indonesia was a conspicuous failure. The first is that he tried to sell it as some sort of dramatic break with our past, some type of new, heroic statesmanship. Just in order to debunk that myth, I thought it was important to go back over the past 30 years to see some of the things that previous Prime Ministers have said in relation to their visits to Indonesia and to see the extent toÂ· which the Prime Minister has developed that relationship in any significant sense relative to the statements of the past. Not surprisingly, we found that all of these previous leaders, quite appropriately, recognised the scope of President Suharto's contribution to his country and to the region, as our Prime Minister did, and.all of them acknowledged historical and cultural differences between Australia and Indonesia, and went on to emphasise common future goals, particularly in terms of economic and security issues. Just to highlight some of those similarities, I think it is useful to go back and look at some of the speeches previous Prime Ministers made and compare those speeches with the words we heard from the Prime Minister today about what he saw as the nature of the link between Australia and Indonesia. I am sure the words of his speech are still ringing in the ears of honourable members, or at least the carry-over from his speech. I will not repeat his words. The similarity is staggering. Let me first quote former Prime Minister Hawke, his predecessor. He said: I know that we both deeply share the desire for an effective, constructive and enduring relationship between Indonesia and Australia. These two close neighbours, so different in so many ways, but which share so many common interests of the highest and most enduring importance, and I firmly believe that for us, as our nations' leaders, to neglectÂ· any opportunity to remove misunderstandings and to strengthen the foundation of agreement would be a dereliction of out' duty to both our peoples and a denial of their common destiny in region which binds us together indissolubly as neighbours. Those are very similar words to what our present Prime Minister used. So we can go back to Malcolm Fraser. He said: Let me say to you at the outset that it is a fundamental foreign policy objective of the Australian government to consolidate, strengthen and develop over the years ahead a close, cordial and cooperative relationship between Australia and Indonesia. I personally place the highest importance on a stable and soundly based friendship between our two countries. We can go back to Gough Whitlam. He said: Relations between Australia and Indonesia have always been cordial and strong. See those words-they keep coming back. He continued: It is my government's intention that they will become stronger still. I believe that Australia and Indonesia-and lei it be said Papua New Guinea as well-are necessarily involved in one another's destinies. This has already been so. No countries in the region have. a firmer foundation of trust and cooperation on which to build. We can even go back to John Gorton. He said: So I believe, your excellency, that the two countries must go forward together. I believe also that each of the two countries together recognise that. I believe that not only our two countries but the other neighbouring countries in the region must also go forward with us. Very similar words, very similar sentiments, but there has been no net advancement on this particular occasion over any of those previous visits. So much for this being a major new dramatic approach to Indonesia. It might have made good copy back here in Australia for those who were travelling with the Prime Minister, but it had no substance whatsoever when we look at the detail of what was achieved on that particular occasion. The second criticism I would make of the Indonesian visit is that the Prime Minister failed to face up to the reality that foreign policy and domestic policy are linked more critically than they have ever been before. In fact, we will not get any respect in a country such as Indonesia if we go there trying to tell it what we think it wants to hear rather than state what we know to be in Australia's best the interests. This Prime Minister certainly does not understand the nature of our economic performance and how our standing in the eyes of the countries in the region has slid so dramatically as our economic performance has fallen off the pace in recent years. The Prime Minister went along there making self-serving remarks and trying to make the sorts of statements at dinners that he thinks the Indonesians want to hear. At the same time, President Suharto stood up and left the Prime Minister in absolutely no doubt that he had a very clear-cut view of where Indonesia was going and what he expected of a country such as Australia. Most importantly, he was looking for some words from the Prime Minister to demonstrate that he was serious about getting our economic house in order. The Indonesians have a very real interest in seeing us rebuild our economy so that they can benefit from that faster growth in terms of the development of economic trade and investment links. What did the Prime Minister do? Apart from the self-serving remarks, and the remarks that he thought the Indonesians wanted to hear, he promised to change the flag and jettison our British heritage. That must have given the Indonesians a great warm inner glow when it came to getting some satisfaction that he had a clear sense of direction for this country. He failed miserably to show any understanding of the importance of rebuilding our economy as the fundamental basis for any development of that relationship into the future. The next reason why I think the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia was a conspicuous failure is that he made the mistake that he could buy new friends in Asia by disowning old ones, by apologising for Australia's past and by committing his Government to changing our flag-the point I made in the introduction. What the Prime Minister must accept, as a majority of his Party clearly does, is that the flag as an issue is a very divisive one in our country. It is totally unnecessary to focus on that issue at this time. It is nothing more than an unnecessary distraction from what is needed to make Australia a dynamic participant in regional economic growth. One must ask the basic question: how many times would the Prime Minister have been asked, while he was in Indonesia, PNG or anywhere else in the region, whether he was embarrassed about the fact that the British flag comes up in the top left-hand corner of our flag? Can honourable members imagine him sitting down and starting those sorts ofMr Beazley interjecting",87
176,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"An interesting question would be whether he asked President Suharto whether he had a basic feeling of personal insecurity about Indonesia's flag because it is the same as the flag of Monaco with its red and white bar. I wonder whether President Suharto was in a conspicuous state of advanced nervousness and insecurity because his flag is similar to the flag of another country? Of course he was not. President Suharto has a clear sense of where his country is going. He has been there a long time. He has been taking Indonesia in a particular direction and he has been doing a very good job of it. He would be amazed to find a Prime Minister making the sorts of statements that our Prime Minister made during some of his speeches. Let me quote some examples of some of the things he told the Indonesians about Australia: When you have been for so long a branch office of empire there is a tendency to go on expecting special treatment long after the head office stopped opening the mail. He also told them: The residues of colonialism have tended to persist in Australia. He also told them: There is a conservative element in Australian society; not so strong as it was but influential just the same which through its attachment to the past and its anxiety about the Asia-Pacific future tends to resist the full expression of Australian nationhood. Finally, he told them: Australia has clung for too long to such vestiges of the old imperial power and culture as will, we think, earn 1.1& respect in the world. These are obsessions of the Prime Minister. They are obsessions in his mind. They arise from his knowledge of history, distorted and limited as it is, coming from Jack Lang. That is where these obsessions and insecurities come from. The Indonesians must have been fascinated that on a state visit our Prime Minister was unable to show a degree of statesmanship that could take an objective view of our history, draw on the strengths of our h-ritage and show how that would place us well for our movement to a future in the Asia-Pacific region. It is interesting to note some of the comments that Professor Geoffrey Blainey has made about this. He is a real historian, not the sometime professor of history that we have on the other side who calls himself Prime Minister, but a real historian.",89
177,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Ah, yes, hmmm.",90
178,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The honourable member is groaning. Maybe something he has eaten did not agree with him? There is no doubt he is wasting away. I will just quote what Geoffrey Blainey says about our Prime Minister: He has done deep hann by altering the facts of history to suit his current political campaign. Presumably he is setting up a smokescreen and so diverting voters' eyes from the economic mess. His smokescreen version of history is a sad joke. It is incredible that he loudly denounces Sir Robert Menzies for ignoring Asia and its economic opportunities, because it was Menzies who presided over the remarkable swing in Australian trade from Britain as our main customer to Asia as our main customer. Menzies and his Government set in motion the very thing Mr Keating wants to do. He did it quickly and competently without boasting he did it 30 years ago. We only have to think about the 1950s and 1960s to initiatives like SEATO, the Colombo Plan, the Australia-Japan trade agreements and so on to know what nonsense our part time transient or visiting professor of history is saying. Professor Blainey goes on to say: That Mr Keating should blunder into this topic hardly makes him fit to be the nation's wandering lecturer in history, a self-appointed role. I say no more-it is a major disgrace and a major national embarrassment that the Prime Minister should go over there and bucket our heritage and bucket our flag, as if it was going to show some sense of nationhood to the people of Indonesia. They must have gone away in a cold sweat wondering what on earth they had below them in the southern seas. The fifth failure of our Prime Minister on his Indonesian visit was when he said there was no link between aid and human rights. We are not saying that this is a one-to-one link, but we do say that in Australia's situation, in which it gives a reasonable amount of aid to the rest of the world, the allocation of that aid is a decision that we make on the basis of a whole host of considerations, and surely one of those factors has to be human rights. We have to reserve the right to vary our aid as we see fit in response to developments in relation to human rights. Senator Evans certainly agreed with that, because some time ago he said: Human rights considerations ought to be taken into account when fonnulating aid programs. But not this Prime Minister! He does not think that there should be any link. That is an awkward message to get across, particularly in the circumstances in which we find ourselves with Indonesia. The Opposition currently supports the level of aid and does not in any sense argue that we should change the level of aid, but we reserve our right to monitor developments in human rights. Against that background, I must say how pleased we have been that the Indonesian Government's assessment of the Dili massacre has been a very credible one. Indonesia's response has and been a very credible one, and I think, to be fair, it is probably better than many people would have expected. In that sense I think it is very important that we continue to give Indonesia encouragement to meet those international standards of human rights and to satisfy the rest of the world that it is cognisant of the importance of that issue in terms of dealing with incidents such as those that occurred recently in the case of the Dili massacre. There are five major reasons already why the Prime Minister's visit to Indonesia was a monumental failure. A final reason is this proposal of his to have a regional heads of government meeting. It is a good proposal and we would support it, but we would not give it a lot of priority. Nor did President Suharto. Despite the Prime Minister's claim in his speech today, I would say that, at best, President Suharto gave it lukewann endorsement; he did not see it as a priority. The Prime Minister also quoted a letter from President Bush in support of the idea. I would like to see that letter. I bet President Bush also did not think it was a priority. There is so much that can be done within the existing framework of APEC as an institutional structure. We could give it for example, and pursue a. genuine objective of trade liberalisation in the Asia-Pacific region. In that sense we could use the existing structures. I am not playing down the fact that at some time down the track we might have a heads of government meeting on a regional basis, but there is so much more that needs to be done, particularly given the magnitude of the economic circumstances of the time in our region. That can be done within the existing institutional framework of APEC. Finally, the Prime Minister commented on his visit to Papua New Guinea. I, too, was pleased to be there at the same time as the Prime Minister and to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the New Guinea campaigns of the Second World War and, importantly, to reaffinn our commitment to the importance of the Australia-Papua New Guinea relationship. I spent a day with Prime Minister Namaliu visiting his local political constituency and, as part of that, I Bita Paka War Cemetery near Rabaul, where so many Australians died. I also visited parts of the Kokoda track. I walked just a few hundred yards of that track, almost continuously in a vertical direction, and I am that at one time even the television cameras picked up the fact that I disappeared off the screen. People can read all the books they like and they can see all the movies they like, but when they stand there and see how rough that terrain is, when they realise that an enemy could be five or 10 feet away yet they cannot even see him or have any idea that he is there, and when they see the afternoon rains wash down those areas and sweep away any work that they thought they may have achieved in the morning, they understand the magnitude of the sacrifice that those men made on our behalf. . It was a particularly important time for me because both my father and my uncle had links with that Papua New Guinea campaign, my father in the Navy on convoy runs between Australia and Milne Bay and Lae, and my uncle on the ground in many of those battles. I have heard those stories since I was a kid, but there is nothing like seeing the situations in which those battles were fought. We should never forget the magnitude of the teeth, sacrifice that was made on our behalf 50 years ago, nor the significance of those battles. But in saying that I do not in any way accept the notion that there can be a hierarchy of sacrifice. In many battle theatres all around the world right through this century, Australians have given their lives in pursuit of what they believed in and in pursuit of this nation. I do not in any way pick anyone of those instances as more or less important, and I certainly do not pick anyone of those instances as a more or less important sacrifice from the point of view of developing Australian nationhood. I also had the opportunity, as Leader of the Opposition, to go to Gallipoli on the seventyfifth anniversary of that campaign. I can tell honourable members that the sacrifices that have been made for Australia and for us-and the opportunities and the responsibilities we have today as a result of that-are very visited the important and very real to me. What perhaps offended me more than anything else was that, in the midst of the commemoration of events in Papua New told Guinea 50 years ago, the Prime Minister went up to a small child who had gone to the trouble of making his own version of the Australian flag, looked down and said, 'I will give you a new one of those soon'. That showed the most amazing sense of hypocrisy and was most insulting to the Australians who fought under that flag and who died under that flag. And the Prime Minister claims he has a sense of direction for this country? He does not even know where to begin!",90
179,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"It is my pleasure to respond to the farrago of nonsense from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on this, and I can do no better in that regard than start out with a very reasonable piece of analysis of what the Leader of the Opposition stands for when it comes to issues of foreign affairs. It says: Certainly Hewson seems driven in foreign policy by little more than a desire to criticise whatever decisions the Government takes. At one stage he says the Government places too high a priority on human rights, and at other times he seems to take a tougher line on human rights himself. It is hard to find a connecting thread. Indeed it is. The Opposition Leader is no foreign policy manque, no matter how he might decide to display himself in this House. His performance in erecting straw men in this particular debate is.a further example of that. Let me just take one piece of nonsense that he came up with. He missed the whole point-the whole point-of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was saying about the sacrifice of our soldiers on the Kokoda Trail. Like most Australians, relatives of mineactually, as it turns out, a relative I never could have known as I was born after the war-participated in that campaign. One of my uncles was taken prisoner and subsequently killed in the aftermath of a submarine attack on the transport vessel on which he was being taken back to Japan. The Leader of the Opposition is not unusual in having had that experience. He ain't Robinson Crusoe in this place or anywhere else. What the Prime Minister specifically referred to about this-and I must say, as a person who once earned a living as a political historian, I am enormously gratified that at last history is being brought front and centre into the way in which we define ourselves as a nation-in that speech that he made on the Kokoda Trail was the sacrifice of Australians in all theatres. He did not differentiate between those who died on the Kokoda Trail, those who died as a result of actions in Papua New Guinea or the Papua New Guinean campaign, and the death of an Australian soldier in Gallipoli, the Middle East or anywhere else. He said that Australians have to get to grips with their strategic geography and understand what was important for us, not just in terms of defending general values of democracy, which of course we were committed to in dealing with the Nazi threat-those who fought against the Germans in the Middle East-but also in dealing with the issues of what was strategically significant to us. In fact, in the 1940s people like Curtin had a hell of a battle to get a focus in our region, to get a focus for equipment, to get a focus for personnel. I cannot absolutely verify this, but I do think it to be true, having got it from somebody who has made a speciality of this campaign: it was not until the middle of 1943 that General MACArthur had more American troops under his command than Australian troops. Australians fought very hard diplomatically in that period to get themselves in a position whereby we could survive. In one sense it was a perfectly reasonable judgment by Churchill and by leaders in the United States-because it was not particularly a British view-if they were simply looking at the tactics of the situation, that whether Australia went or survived was not that important. There were many in the United States Navy who advocated that they should go into Japan head-on and not bother about island-hopping. In those circumstances, Australia was irrelevant. The judgment could be arrived at by a man terribly embattled and embroiled with his major threat in Europe-the Nazi threat-that that was where his efforts should be concentrated. I do not denigrate Churchill for having arrived at those conclusions and I do not denigrate the Americans who supported him for having arrived at those conclusions; in their eyes it was perfectly reasonable. When we look at the history of the twenties and thirties, for which Churchill was not responsible, in which the British Navy was rendered impotent in the Far East, totally impotent, and certainly impotent in circumstances where it had to confront a war on a mUltiplicity of fronts, we see that it is reasonable that he decided, having confronted those facts with the material that he had to hand, to deal with the situation that was there in Europe. It is fine for other people to make judgments. But there were seven million of us living here, and those who were occupied elsewhere in the region in the course of that conflict received very short shrift indeed. The Government of the day, those soldiers along the Kokoda Trail and those seamen out in the Battle of the Coral Sea had to make a standdenuded of a considerable amount of help from the people of their own country who were away fighting in the Middle Eastalmost on their own for a very long period. It was a strategic decision, not one about the equality of sacrifice between a soldier in the 9th Division who died in the Middle East at the battle of EI Alamein, and a soldier who died on the Kokoda Trail. That is not the point. The point is that there is a strategic lesson to be learned from that-and it is darned difficult to get into the heads of Australians that they ought to learn it. I might say that Geoffrey Blainey-as he was quoted by the Opposition; he is one of the Opposition's dancing professors on so many things-is not one of those who have made that point very lucidly in their own history writing. So I am not one to take his point. So the Opposition Leader, as has been the case with, Liberals so often in the past, debauched that feature of the debate \Vith his sleight of hand. He then went on to say in his arguments that as far as the initiative towards Indonesia was concerned-moving away from Papua New Guinea-this was no break with the past. It is true that there have been visits by Australian statesmen to Indonesia in years past; there is nothing particularly exceptional about that. What was exceptional was not what the Prime Minister had to say about himself or what the Australian media had to say about the Prime Minister-that had been said by Prime Ministers about themselves and by members of the media about Australian Prime Ministers in the past-but what the Indonesians said about the Prime Minister and about us and what they believed the visit constituted. Anybody who has been Defence this country for any length of time knows that when it comes to comments on foreign policy problems"" the Indonesian press is particularly robust. When it cornes to comments on Australia, the Indonesian press is, if anything, even more robust. The papers I am going to quote from have had things to say about me from time to time that I have not relished, but they have very different things to say about this Prime Minister. Kompas, for example, probably the most authoritative of the Indonesian papers, had this to say about the Prime Minister's visit: It is a common saying that this is an era of great changes, although not everyone, not even prominent figures, grasps its meaning and the implication of those changes. The State guest from Australia, PM Paul Keating, is one of those who grasp, understand and accept the implications of changes. His views and evaluation of developments in Indonesia, his neighbour, differ from what we have heard from Australian leaders. He does not see only the shortcomings and weaknesses of the neighbouring country but rather sees strategic advantages of Indonesia's developments over the last 25 years ... ""Such an opinion, as stated by the Australian leader, can be used as a productive framework of reference in terms of the relationship between the two countries, particularly between neighbouring countries of differing levels of economic progress and differing cultural background. The armed forces official newspaper, which, as I have said before, has had very robust things to say about many Australians-myself included-from time to time, carried an article entitled, 'New freshness in IndonesiaAustralia relations'. It observed: PM Keating's three day visit to Indonesia has evoked hope for the development of mutually advantageous cooperation between Indonesia and Australia in the future, the foundation of which was laid during the visit. . His positive attitude to Indonesia suggested that PM Keating preceded his visit to Indonesia with a profound study about Indonesia, aware of the differences between the two nations and states, not to be exaggerated-and only to lead to trouble but to seek a point of convergence instead, thereby enabling cooperation in various areas, particularly economic and political areas. I could go on. I will go outside Indonesia and quote from the Singapore Straits TImes Minister of editorial, which said: ""Australians looking ahead will face the usual parochial remnants of the country's past holding onto visions that have long passed their use, liberals whose extreme human rights programs would overshadow all else in the Asian realityIt then goes on to say a few things about the liberals. But it is a positive response to the image portrayed by the Prime Minister on his visit to Indonesia. It was a very important visit in terms of the security and economic interests of this country. Since we came to office there has been a dramatic improvement in our trade relations in the area. The Opposition Leader sought to say something about the fact that we failed to link foreign policy and domestic policy and about the nature of our economic performance. Well he might, because his performance overseas involves constantly denigrating Australia's economic performance when, in the Asian area, there are very different feelings about that and about the desirability of an et!onomic relationship with Australia. The Opposition Leader was interviewed by Laurie Oakes about this matter. When asked, 'What should you have said to the Indonesians?', he got up on his scrapers and replied, 'Basically, I would have presented them with a copy of Fightback! and told them what we intend to do about the Australian economy-particularly how we intend to crush people on the waterfront'. If he had any understanding of the history of relations between Australia and Indonesia, he would know that in the Indonesian legend about Australia the attitude to Australian wharfies is very different from that which goes through the Liberal Party. One thing all Indonesians of the generation that remembers independence know is that the Australian waterside workers struck against the provisioning, via Australia, of Dutch forces which were operating against the Indonesians in Indonesia. They do not share the view that the troops ought to be put on the Australian waterfront and the wharfies ought to be thrown out. The Leader of the Opposition put forward an absolutely ridiculous proposition as to what he wanted to talk about in Indonesia. As for the idea of buying new friends by disowning old ones, that is a load of nonsense. The Prime Minister made it absolutely clear. I must say that he did not make. any speeches about the flag when he was in Indonesia; he reiterated views about the flag in Indonesia in answer to questions from Indonesians. Mr Tim Fischer-And doesn'the regret it?",91
180,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"I do not think he does. These people who, according to the Leader of the Opposition, are supposedly not interested in the subject asked him questions about the Australian flag, and they heard his answers quite cheerfully. In answer to questions, the Prime Minister made the point that we value things from our British tradition. He said that we value the fact that it has made us a freethinking, free-speaking country. We value the institutions that the British have - eft us, but we have to represent ourselves in our own way and on our own terms in the region with which we deal. The only ridiculous performance in relation to the flag which took place in the entirety of these two visits was that by the Leader of the Opposition. He keeps wandering around this place telling everybo- that he does not want to make the flag political. Yet we see these Taiwanese versions of the flag in here-most of them incorrect. Honoorable members opposite have jumped the gun in the flag competition, because at least half of those flags are not Australian flags-unless they have managed to get the changes made-and virtually none of them are made in Australia. Perhaps that is what the Leader of the Opposition picked up on his visit to Taiwan. As far as the flag was concerned, the Leader of the Opposition put on an absurd performance. He went to Rabbie Namaliu and, as his gift to Rabbie Namaliu on the occasion of his visit to Papua New Guinea, presented him with an Australian flag. Of course, Rabbie Namaliu has seen this flag for most of his life. This flag was the flag that presided over Papua New Guinea as a colony for most of Rabbie Namaliu's life. So, yes, he had seen it before. But is it not an extraordinary thing? I could not imagine a single British statesman walking into any of the ex-British colonies and saying, 'What I want most to give you folk is a copy of the British flag. How do you like it?'. It would not enter the skull of a Britisher that he should so demean himself or his country by such a ridiculous personal performance aimed not at Rabbie Namaliu, but 100 per cent at the people back home. The Leader of the Opposition left a mystified Rabbie Namaliu sitting there clutching the Australian flag and saying, 'Oh, thanks a lot. This is really what I wanted'. I think that performance has been the only demeaning international penormance by any Australian politician in recent times as far as our national symbols are concerned. This has been a very successful visit. As far as Indonesia is concerned, the Prime Minister has acknowledged critical elements of the Indonesian relationship to our securityelements which we fail to acknowledge frequently enough about the vital significance of the new administration in Indonesia to the fact that we have reasonable levels of defence expenditure in this country. The Prime Minister has made those acknowledgments and he deserves praise for having done so. He deserves praise, too, for his conduct in Papua New Guinea, where he set the right interpretation on the significance of that country to us, both on a continuing basis now and in a time of war. He came to the right understanding of that, interpreting the sacrifice of the soldiers there in the way in which it ought to have been interpreted, but without demeaning those sacrifices elsewhere.",94
181,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"Farrer-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (3.56 p.m.)'--It was a British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, who said: When you're abroad you're a statesman. When you're at home you're just a politician. The truth of the matter is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went forward on his first overseas visit as Prime Minister as a politician. Whilst overseas, he performed as a politician; when he returned he was still a politician; and now he is just a politician. And he was a very divisive politician in all of his activities during that visit overseas. I will pick up on the comments of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in respect of three matters he raised. Firstly, he attacked the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and quoted an article which said that it was difficult to find a common thread in the activities of the Leader of the Opposition with regard to foreign affairs. I say very loudly and clearly that the Leader of the Opposition has established several common threads with regard to foreign affairs, not the least of which is the commitment to Asia which springs from his whole education, his attitude and his work experience before entering Federal Parliament-experience that he has carried with him to the key position of Leader of the Opposition. He has put a hard edge on building up the relations between Australia and Asia. He has added a dimension to, and put a priority on, building up those relations between Australia and Asia which have been long overdue. He has done more than the Government, for example, in respect of building up the relations between Australia and Taiwan. The Government has repeatedly dragged its feet and delayed such breakthroughs as the commencement of direct flights between Australia and Taiwan. This Government took a long time to sort out the bureaucracy and the other requirements necessary in order to drive that decision forward and commence those direct flights. It was, interestingly enough, during the visit by the Leader of the Opposition to Taiwan that suddenly the Government began to apply some priority of effort to that decision, which led, in turn, to the breakthrough and the commencement of flights between Australia and Taiwan. There are plenty of common threads in the foreign affairs activities of the Leader of the Opposition. One of the most important of these has been his activities in Asia, north-east Asia, south Asia and the ASEAN countries. Having accompanied the Leader of the Opposition to China and to some very important Il}eetings in Beijing, I can say that he is a consummate performer in respect of the skills of diplomacy and getting Australia's message across, even in the most difficult circumstances. For example, in a critical meeting with Li Peng-which was not an easy meeting-'-the Leader of the Opposition showed great purpose, determination and dediCation in Australia's national interests. He conducted himself in a very correct and proper way. The Leader of the House also reflected on the comments in respect of the Kokoda Trail. I want to say to the Prime Minister that I welcome that part of his statement where he affirmed that the Government is going to increase the provision of funds to provide an upgrading of rest facilities along the Kokoda Trail and increase the funds for the local war museum and related village developments and facilities. I think all members on both sides of the House regard the Kokoda Trail as very much part of the heritage of the region and of Papua New Guinea in the first place, and very much part of the Australian military heritage. I also welcome the announcement by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea that it is going to receive a heritage listing. In rebutting the Minister on this particular point, I can do no better than quote the article in which our Prime Minister said: That is why it might be said that for Australians battles in Papua New Guinea were the most important ever fought. That is a judgmental matter which, of course, then led the honourable member for Kalgoorlie e Mr Campbell), not a member of the Opposition, to make the point that the Prime Minister was one who was putting an added premium on the activity in Papua New Guinea. It is true that the Prime Minister did go on to mention all the conflicts in which Australians were involved, and I readily concede that. But I pick up on what the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, because he made a valid point when he said that if the African campaign, for argument's sake, had been lost then indeed all associated with World War II would have been lost. Of course there was linkage across all the battles in which Australians were associated. It is opening up a very awkward area to suggest that there are degrees of importance and difficulty associated with the commitment of troops and the activity of Australian troops overseas. It is a point that I think the Prime Minister might now regret that he raised in the context of this debate. Finally, in terms of the Minister's comments, he decided to describe Professor Blainey as 'the Opposition's dancing professor'. The professor is a man of letters well recognised. He does not even need me to attest to his capability, his statesmanship or his accuracy as a professor of history and related matters. I want to say right here and now that the professor on many occasions has pointed the way ahead for Australia on many key issues, and he has a right to speak up. His utterances should be well regarded and very carefully considered because they make a great deal of sense. Mr Nehl-A man of vision.",95
182,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"He is indeed a man of vision, and one whom I readily acknowledge. I return to why we had the statement from the Prime Minister in the first place. This is a very interesting question. Honourable members might remember that last week the Prime Minister, in a casual and cavalier way, decided to take a dorothy dixer from the Government to try to get away with the a cheap prime ministerial statement on his overseas trip by responding simply to a question without notice. We were quick to highlight that that was an inadequate approach, one which breached convention and one which, of course, is likely to give offence indeed to some of our Asian friends. I understand that the actions that we took, and perhaps some feedback from elsewhere, have now resulted finally, on this last day of sitting of this current fortnight period, in the Prime Minister creeping back into this House and giving the statement that he should have given in the proper way last week shortly after his return. I say of his statement in respect of his first trip overseas as Prime Minister what Harold Macmillan said: When you're abroad you're a statesman. When you're at home you're just a politician. The tragedy is that the Prime Minister acted as a Prime Minister overseas and in a very divisive way. It has to be said that his position is one of a wrecker, a destroyer, and one which is all about dividing this nation at a time when we need maximum empathy and maximum cohesion to deal with the problems which face Australia. The Prime Minister has not laid a glove on the Fightback package in real terms, and he has also gone on to indicate that his knowledge of foreign affairs, particularly Asia, could be written on postage stamp, with room left over. I must say that the Prime Minister comes into this House and dishes out the rhetoric time and time again, but when we get down to examining his record we find that it is an inadequate record so far as Asia is concerned. The acid test was in the nine years that Prime Minister was a frontbencher. Did he to one ASEAN country? The answer is no. He made not one working visit to one ASEAN is country. That is an utter disgrace for a senior frontbencher. Did he go to Europe, to London, to Russia, to France in particular? Of course, he went many times; in fact some eight to 11 times he was to be found in the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe and the United States. Mr Downer-Fourteen times.",96
183,Mr TIM FISCHER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"A total of 14 times, in fact, as the honourable member for Mayo points out. Compare that with zero trips to ASEAN countries to our immediate northspecial west. Compare that with any attempt to go to south Asia, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh or Burma, as I have been. Compare course, with his one visit to China. Why did he go to China? I will tell the House why he went to China. It just happened to be that Beijing was the venue for the World Bank conference in that particular year. Otherwise he would not even have gone to China. The one thing we learn in making annual working visits to Asia is that the Asians are quick to recognise a Johnny-comelately and someone who is less than sincere in his attitude and approach to developing relations with Asia. The one thing Asians like least of all are short term, opportunistic visitors, especially when they have had the opportunity, the resources and the capability have been more regular visitors to Asia in their most recent past and in the various positions they have held in the past. Prime Minister has been caught out in terms of his sudden adoption of the Asian way, Asian direction. Of course, the Asian direction is legitimate direction for Australia. The and National parties have made very clear, ahead of time, our commitment to building up a those working relations between Asia and Australia. Of course we will continue to do that. As Leader of the National Party I have gone out of my way each year, particularly in the month of January, to make working visits to a range of Asian countries; in fact, to some 18 different Asian countries. I have been to the all of them except Sri Lanka and Pakistan. go That is not for the want of trying, but of course the time available to make those visits always difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, I will try to rectify that as soon as I can. I make the point that at least I have been to every ASEAN country-on working visits, all six of them. I have been to Papua New Guinea and New Zealand and to all the near neighbours to our north in Asia and north-east Asia because I recognise that that is where Australia's economic future rests. I recognise that that is where there is so much rich potential for trading opportunities for our the primary industries. I recognise that that relationship between Australia and Asia is going to build up only if we put fair dinkum effort into it from both sides of this that, of House of Parliament. The Prime Minister has come into the Asian debate with his long overdue report as a Johnny-come-lately, as the Leader of the Opposition points out. He has come in trying to give a sense of direction. He did correctly choose two countries to go to first in terms of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, but then he made a botch of that visit, a visit which should have been statesmanlike and which was not a great deal better than a politician out there scoring points on such issues as the national flag. It was an absolute disgrace. But the Australian Prime Minister, whether to it be by question, premeditated comment or speech, decided to dump on our national flag in Jakarta in ANZAC week. Nothing could have The given more offence to a great number of Australians, as demonstrated by the many the comments which my colleagues received on ANZAC Day from one end of Australia to the a other-many of them from members of the Liberal Labor Party. They came forward and expressed their anger on television, in the media generally and to all of us no doubt on both sides of the House. That is why we are starting to see a number of Caucus members express their condemnation of the Prime Minister's activities in respect of the national flag. Notably, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has said in very clear terms that he is very unhappy with the Prime Minister's attack on the national flag, and members of the Caucus have appealed to the Prime Minister to calm down and to move on from the flag debate as a matter of priority. I say to the House that the Prime Minister, when given the opportunity, failed to respond and failed to show the true statesmanship that he should have responded with. Indeed, as to the particular question in Jakarta, of course, he should have ignored that question and moved on. There has to be. an absolute acceptance on a bipartisan basis that Australia is in for the long haul with Asia. We have to put depth into our relationship between Australia and Asia. On the one hand, for example, between Australia and Indonesia, that is manifested by things such as the Timor Gap treaty which is going to allow for detailed exploration of some very interesting kelp structures between Australia and Indonesia. On the other hand, it goes beyond the commercial to the political, the diplomatic and the military cooperation which should exist between Australia and Asia. We have a vested interest in providing foreign aid to Asia, and measured foreign aid at that; we have a vested interest in helping to raise the standard of living of Asians. That is often lost on elements, even of my own constituency, who would argue that in this time of horrific recession we should eliminate all foreign aid. I reject that argument, because it is as a consequence of the efforts that Australia has made in Asia, in part the foreign aid under the previous coalition government and this Government, that we have seen the . standard of living of places such as South Korea rise to such a level that they are now buying Australian wheat, whereas they never before bought Australian wheat. That, of course, is the sort of approach that we need to encourage. I take this opportunity to say to the House that the Prime Minister has failed the real test of his office and his duties as Prime Minister on his first visit to Asia. We all accept the need to build up those relations with Asia, but in his divisive approach as a grubby politician he gave less than an adequate performance on his first official visit overseas as Prime Minister of this country.

185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ORDER OF BUSINESS," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Bennelong proposing that a definiteMr Fife-I have a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I gave you, privately, notice that the Leader of the Opposition would be seeking the call prior to the MPI. We had this problem the other day and I was reprimanded for not having provided advice to the Deputy Speaker. I would submit, sir, that you might reconsider the question and give the Leader of the Opposition the call.",99
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ORDER OF BUSINESS,"As the honourable member for Hume would be aware, I looked towards the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition",99
187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ORDER OF BUSINESS,"Well, it is true. I looked towards the Leader of the Opposition; I paused for some 30 seconds or so; he did not jump. I then decided that as he did not jump, as he did not stand, I would proceed to the next business. So I intend to do that. Mr Fife-On a point of order",99
188,Mr BEAZLEY,ORDER OF BUSINESS,"We will help the Opposition by requesting that the business of the day be called on. Mr Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, again on a point of order, I am sure that you and all other Deputy Speakers, along with the Speaker, are interested in the smooth running of this House. This will be the third occasion when you or another person in the chair has gazumped the intentions of the Opposition, which under the Standing Orders we have the right to act upon. I ask you again, in the interests of the smooth running of this House, to reconsider your decision and to call the Leader of the Opposition.",99
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ORDER OF BUSINESS,"I am prepared to reconsider and call the Leader of the Opposition; but I must make the point that I did look to the Leader of the Opposition, I paused and I looked there for some time. As the Leader of the Opposition did not stand, I then called on the next business. I do now call the Leader of the Opposition. NA NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",100
190,Dr HEWSON,COMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith-That the Prime Minister be required to give a full explanation to this House of Senator Richardson's involvement in the affairs of Mr Greg Symons in relation to the Marshall Islands and to explain why he has not stood down Senator Richardson from the Cabinet for misleading the Senate. Today in the Senate we had a clear demonstration of the fact that the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Richardson, misled the Senate over the nature of his activities in relation to the Marshall Islands and his relative Mr Greg Symons, who is on something like 11 charges of forgery in the Marshall Islands. To be clear at the outset, as I want to establish the urgency of this debate, I want to put on the record the two particular instances which clearly demonstrate the extent to which Senator Richardson has misled the House. I go back to 29 April 1992, when Senator Richardson was asked a question by Senator Kemp on the basis of some newspaper reports about the activities of Mr Symons and his business affairs in the Marshall Islands. He asked Senator Richardson to provide details of his knowledge of Mr Symons's business affairs. Senator Richardson said: My recollection is, yes, I provided a number of details that had been provided to me by Mr Symons. That is, in relation to a reference that he gave Mr Symons. He went on to say: I repeat the statement that is, a statement that he had made previously to the pressthat I have no knowledge of his business affairs. Senator Hill then interjected, saying: But you put in a letter of introduction. Senator Richardson said: No, that was said in the context of whatever business it is in which he is involved, over which he has been charged. I made the point that I had no knowledge of that business and I repeat it now. Orders So there is a clear-cut statement on 29 April that Senator Richardson had no knowledge of the business affairs of Mr Greg Symons in relation to his activities in the Marshall Islands, for which he was charged, even though he had written a reference for Mr Symons in June 1991 in relation to his intention to develop business interests in the Marshall Islands. Then today, again under the questioning of Senator Hill, Senator Richardson gave a completely different answer. He was asked: Is it a fact that on or about 12 November 1991 you  President and Manager of the International Department of the National Bank of the Marshall Islands, and a lawyer? If so, what was the purpose of the meeting? What was discussed? Were Mr Symons's business interests discussed at this meeting? Senator Richardson went said: No. I think Mr Symons and Mr Finch did come; I do not think Mr Cheh made it. He had not arrived at the time that they came to my office, so I did not meet him. Then he went on with the crucial point: ... I have spoken to Mr Symons and Mr Finch, so I did know that they had a scheme going which was a business migration scheme. So here today in the Senate we have a clear contradiction of the earlier answer given in the Senate on 29 April. On the first occasion, Senator Richardson said he did not know; on the second occasion Senator Richardson said that he did know, but it was about a business migration scheme. But subsequent questioning . today in the Senate has revealed an attempt by Senator Richardson to stonewall on that point and he did not provide any additional information. I think in response to one other question he said he was not sure of the details of the plan. This is an incident that has been the subject of continuous cross-questioning by us in the Senate and in this House about Senator Richardson's activities as a Minister and whether he used his position as a Minister in relation to the Marshall Islands. That was in the earlier set of questions. He telephoned the President of the Marshall Islands, which he claimed, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) accepted, was done in a private capacity. Now, of course, today we see a direct contradiction of his position of 29 April. Originally he said that he did not know anything about the business interests and today, of course, he suddenly remembered that he did know that it was a business migration scheme. Finally, in a question, he was asked what he had been asked about and he said that it was whether he knew anybody in the State Department of the United States. That obviously had a particular role to play in this scheme. As I understand the scheme-and it is only what I have pieced together-it involves the sale of passports to Chinese nationals, mostly Hong Kong nationals, in the Marshall Islands, which in effect, it is hoped, gives them access to the United States by a back door. That is a very lucrative business which, in some press reports today, has been described by the Chief Justice of the Marshall Islands as an activity that involves, in his words, 'a tremendous amount of money'. Senator Richardson's particular involvement goes back initially to the phone call he made. He argued that he did not use his position in relation to that phone call. Honourable members can just imagine this phone call taking place. There is a bit of inconsistency here. On some occasions, he sort of admits that he did say it was Senator Richardson speaking and, apparently-as was said in today's press-it was known at the time that he was the Minister for Social Security, but he says that he did not use his position in relation to the Marshall Islands. Honourable members can just imagine the phone call coming in: 'This is Senator Richardson-S-E-N-A-T-O-RMinister for Social Security in Australia'. And this is to a country of about 45,000 people. ",100
191,Dr HEWSON,COMMUNICATIONS,"The notorious numbers cruncher-to use that expression-of the Australian Government rings up, though he was not doing it in anything but a private capacity; he was not using his position.. As we saw in today's press, there was clearly an understanding on the part of those in the Marshall Islands that Senator Richardson had used his position. In the debate about bail which took place earlier this month, it was interesting that the Attorney-General, Mr Denis MCPhillips, described Senator Richardson as 'a Minister of great power'. He concluded that without knowing anything beyond the fact that Senator Richardson was just a citizen of Australia calling on behalf of his relative. I think that it would be most interesting to go through some of these statements. The debate was about how much bail there should be for Senator Richardson-I am sorry, I am a bit ahead of myself; how much bail should be set for Mr Symons in the Marshall Islands. The Attorney-General has taken the view that about $US 1114m would cover any damage that would be done if Mr Symons did not come back. In his arguments before the court in setting that bail, Mr MCPhillips told Chief Justice Neil Rutledge: We do fear that, due to the influential friends in Australia that Mr Symons has, he may not return. 'Influential friends in Australia'. He continued: We may not be able to gather his return. As you see, I've just handed you a fax which. is the introduction of Gregory Symons from the Minister of Social Security in Canberra. We thought that there was a letter, but there was also a fax. We do not know where the fax came from, but it is from the Minister for Social Security in Canberra. Mr MCPhillips went on: This was an introductory document to the Republic. It is my understanding this particular Minister is one of the most powerful ministers in the Australian Government. He wields great power ... not just another Minister, not just an opposition party member, but part of the government. Knowing this, even more doubt has to be cast on the ability of the republic to retrieve Mr Symons should he not live up to the waiver of extradition or should we have to attempt to extradite with Australia, although we have no expedition treaty. So the Attorney-General was taking the view that Senator Richardson had used his position. Senator Richardson said that he knew nothing about the business activities of Mr Symons, but it is interesting to look at the reference Senator Richardson gave Mr Symons. He seemed to have had a reasonable idea of some of those business activities when he gave this reference to Mr Symons earlier on. It states: Mr Symons has extensive experience in trade and development and export of technology. and education services in the Asia-Pacific Region. In 1989/90, Mr Symons successfully negotiated the sale to the Peoples Republic of China of a steel mill facility and related technology from BHP Steel in Australia and coordinated the dismantling and shipping process. During the past two years Mr Symons has worked closely with a number of Australian universities, including the University of Sout'lem Queensland on development overseas of a University Studies Centre course known as Unipac International to train Asian students and accredit them for onwards entry into higher education in Australia, New Zealand, USA and Europe. From what we have seen, there is no doubt that Senator Richardson used his position and no doubt that he misled the Senate this afternoon. (Time expired)",101
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS,Mr Ronald Edwards}-Is the motion seconded?,102
193,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNICATIONS,I second the motion. There is a very short but nonetheless very important point of parliamentary principle involved in this issue. This Parliament should not rise tonight until the terms of the suspension of Standing Orders moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) have been responded to by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). There is no more serious parliamentary offence than a Minister lying to the Parliament. That is what has happened on this occasion.,102
194,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS,"I say to the honourable member for Bennelong that I , extended considerable latitude to the Leader of the Opposition",102
195,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNICATIONS,"Well, 'misleading the Parliament' .",102
196,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS,No,102
197,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNICATIONS,"All right, I withdraw it. Do not waste my time- 'misleading the Parliament' .",102
198,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS,You are preempting me. I extended considerable latitude to the Leader of the Opposition in terms of procedural motion. I let him move to the substantive motion rather than the procedural motion. I am sure that the honourable member for Bennelong will stay within the requirements of the procedural motion.,102
199,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNICATIONS,"I am making the point large that, in order to get the Prime Minister in here to discharge his parliamentary responsibility, Standing Orders have to be suspended. That is what I am speaking to. What is involved here is a situation where one of the selfprofessed power brokers of the Labor Party and the Government has deliberately misled the Parliament. Senator Richardson told the Parliament on 29 April that he had no knowledge of the business dealings of Mr Symons. We were led to believe that his was a fraternal call and was nothing more than the helping out of a relative of his wife. Who other than the mean minded on this side of the House would call that side of the activity into question? We now find, under questioning from us-not from his admission-that on 12 November Seriator Richardson had a meeting with Mr Symons, and he had a meeting with Mr Symons's lawyer. If it were such a casual, family, fraternal call, what was Mr Symons's lawyer doing there?  supposed to have been at the meeting. Mr Patrick Chen is the Vice-President of the National Bank of the Marshall Islands. He is also the head of the International Division of the Marshall Islands. I ask another rhetorical question: what on earth was the Minister for Social Security doing meeting a relative and the relative's lawyer, and being prepared to meet the Vice-President of the National Bank of the Marshall Islands? Senator Richardson then tells the Parliament that he knows nothing about the business affairs of his relative. Then, under questioning from the Opposition, and not as an act of ministerial contrition and coming clean we heard his story. If he had come into the Parliament and said, 'Look, I have really stuffed this one up; I did not give a full account of it and here is the full story', perhaps we on this side of the Parliament may have a different attitude. But he played fast and loose with the truth and he has been caught out. There is no man who plays the politics of toughness and hardness in a more brazen fashion than Senator Richardson. He is a legendary member of the 'mates', and they operate on the basis of never apologising and never resigning. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Prime Minister should be trying to tough this one out. But, at the end of the day, he has to realise that he stands in a long line of Prime Ministers in this country, from both sides, who, when the crunch finally comes, have normally done the right thing. Gough Whitlam, with all of his weaknesses, had the guts to sack Rex Connor because he inadvertently misled the Parliament. He had the guts to sack Jim Cairns because he, inadvertently or otherwise, misled the Parliament and his Prime Minister. We on this side of the House want to know whether Paul Keating has the guts to sack Senator Richardson because he misled the Senate. That is the short and simple point. The Australian people will judge this Prime Minister on the standard of probity that he is prepared to defend. The supreme test of the courage and probity of the Prime Minister is whether he i-ists on Ministers observing the basic requirement of a Minister, that is, that they tell the Parliament the truth. Senator Richardson has failed to do this. The Prime Minister ought to be in here explaining Senator Richardson's lapse. Better still, he ought to be hopping in the car, going out to Yarralumla and withdrawing Senator Richardson's commission. It is with great pleasure that I second the motion.",102
200,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER Opposition members-Where is the Prime Minister?,103
201,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS,"Opposition members may want the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) correctly said, the Prime Minister has gone to a very important match on the looth anniversary",103
202,Unknown,COMMUNICATIONS,"Opposition members interjecting Mr Fife- Mr Â·Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order.",103
203,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS,Order! I cannot hear the honourable member for Hume because his colleagues in the Opposition are creating such a noise. I am sure they will assist the Chair. Mr Fife-The motion for the suspension of Standing Orders calls for the Prime Minister to give a full explanation. Will you inquire of the Leader of the House whether the Prime Minister is going to come in and give. that explanation?,103
204,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS,I understand from the Leader of the House that he is explaining the circumstances. That answers your question. Mr Fife-The question is: is the Prime Minister going to respond now or is the Leader of the House going to respond?,103
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS,The Leader of the House has the call.,103
206,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS,"I would have thought it was patently obvious .that I was responding, since I was on my feet, and even more obvious that the Prime Minister was not going to respond because I told the House that the Prime Minister had gone to a very important function in Melbourne, as Prime Ministers do. Opposition members-He has gone to the footy.",103
207,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS,"He has not gone to the footy. Mr Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. In the spirit of trying to help the Government, the Opposition would agree to an adjournment of this debate until a later hour when the Prime Minister returns.",103
208,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS,"It is very nice of the Opposition to put that offer, but I think we will be able to deal with the matter adequately within the framework of the normal Standing Orders, because I have a feeling that this House probably will not want to suspend Standing Orders in order to have this discussion. So the kindly offer made by the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) will not need to be taken up. If Opposition members think they will get 75 votes 011 this, I think they have another think coming. Having made that point, I want to go into an exercise related to allegations being raised by the Opposition as the reasons why Standing Orders ought to be suspended. We have had a lot of experience in recent days of selective quoting by the Opposition; for example, the selective quoting of Treasury documents, which was dealt with by the Secretary to the Treasury so adequately today when he talked about its models as garbage in and garbage out. In this case, it is selective quotes from Senator Richardson's explanation in the Senate. The points on this are very simple. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) bases his claim on Senator Richardson saying that he had no knowledge of the business interests of Mr Symons after Mr Symons had visited him or whilst Mr Symons was in the situation in which he was in the Marshall Islands, and subsequently that he knew Mr Symons was involved with business migration. If we look at what Senator Richardson says, the explanation becomes pretty obvious. This is the quote the Liberal Party spokesmen have used today: My recollection is yes, I provided a number of details that had been provided to me by Mr Symons. I repeat the statement that I have no knowledge of his business affairs. Then Senator Richardson was heckled by Senator Hill: But you put in a letter of introduction. Senator Richardson responded: No, that was said that is, 'I had no knowledge of his business affairs'in the context of whatever business lit is in which he is involved over which he has bren charged. I made the point that I had no kno-.yledge of that business, and I repeat it now. I That is a very different proposition from saying that he had no knowledge of Mr Symons's business. What he said in completing that answer before he was heckled was that he had no knowledge of the business in the sense of that business for which he is charged. That is a very different situation. To know that somebody in this country runs a business migration business does not necessarily mean that one knows that he is conducting activities which lead to a charge in the Marshall Islands and that he is running a business migration program in the United States, allegedly selling passports, or whatever, for people to go through the Marshall Islands into the United States. Knowing that somebody, generically, is involved in the notion of business migration does not mean that one necessarily knows the details of that business. What Senator Richardson made absolutely clear from that, and again in his explanation to the Senate today, was that he had no knowledge of the business that was being conducted by Symons I which left Symons in a position in which h was subject to charges of fraud. The notion that the Oppos tion would disrupt the Parliament's procee ings to discuss that triviality when there is bsolutely no misleading of the House involved is simply an indication of the extent to which the Opposition clutches at straws and the absurdity of the propositions Opposition members frequently engage in when they misquote, half quote and start to make a statement about hanging offences. The Opposition Leader quoted the remarks of the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands. I notice with interest that there are two sets of views from the Attorney-General on this-one that he chooses to back in court when he is making the maximum for his case on refusal of bail, the maximum for his case to bring Symons to trial, and what he had to say about the position at the time he was questioned, about the phone call from Senator Richardson. Mr Downer-So he is misleading the court.",104
209,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS,"No; he is operating like a sensible lawyer. That is all. When he was quizzed, 'Did Senator Richardson's views carry any weight with you?', he answered, 'No'. He was asked, 'Was it a situation in which you felt you were being pressured?'. He answered, 'No'. It was not a situation which he found terribly difficult to live with. That is of a piece with what Senator Richardson happened to tell the Senate at the time: it was a telephone call without pressure; he was simply making a case that the fellow ought to be allowed to return home in order to defend himself and then get himself back to the Marshall Islands. He was on record as saying that he did not find that particularly offensive or was allegedquotesly pressured in that direction. As far as he was concerned, it had no influence on him whatsoever. Subsequently, he said, 'You ought not to deal with this fellow in any way other than keeping him here, because this senator in Australia has, as far as he is concerned, an enormous amount of influence'. That sounds like new knowledge on the part of the Attorney-General of the Marshall Islands, gained between when he heard about phone calls in regard to Mr Symons's business and when he subsequently had Mr Symons in court. The fact that he had a bit of new knowledge in that period of time is not germane to his original response and nothing which this House needs to trouble itself with. Quite patently, as far as Senator Richardson was concerned, he cleared himself sensibly on whether or not he ought to ring and what he ought to be able to put to the officials spoke to in the Marshall Islands. He rang the Foreign Minister. He went through an exercise with the Foreign Minister of determining what was an appropriate approach for somebody in his position. All members of parliament, and all Ministers-who are also members of parliament-are frequently in the position, as I frequently am, of taking action on behalf of constituents that may have legal implications and putting a case to people who may be in a position of authority to deal with it. We operate on the assumption that we are not putting pressure on them but are making an argument. Every single person here who is worth his salt as a member of parliament has been engaged in precisely that sort of activity. When we look at the way in which Senator Richardson appropriately cleared himself, because he was aware there might be some result like this, by dealing with the Foreign Minister first, we see that as far as that was concerned he operated perfectly appropriately. He has been engaged in no misleading of this Parliament.",105
210,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNICATIONS,So he misled the Parliament.,105
211,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS,"No, he has not. There has been no misleading of parliament. The Opposition has received from me the relevant",105
212,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNICATIONS,He has been charged.,105
213,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS,"Knowing somebody is involved in the business migration program, you klutz, does not mean that one knows the detail of all the blinking offences that he has been engaged in-or allegedly engaged in-in the Marshall Islands. That is a point he makes clear in his answer to the question, when he says: ... business it is in which he is involved, over which he has been charged.",105
214,Mr HOWARD,COMMUNICATIONS,He says today he has.,105
215,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMUNICATIONS,"Not over which he has been charged. He has not been charged over business migration business in Australia. He made it perfectly clear in that statement that the material related to what he had to say in that he the Marshall Islands. (TIme expired) Question put: That the motion (Dr Hewson's) be agreed to.

219,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"I present the report from the Committee of Privileges in connection with a matter referred to the Committee by the House on 26 February 1992, together with the minutes of proceedings. . Ordered that the report be printed.",106
220,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEE REPORTS,"by leave-This report concerns the honourable member for Aston (Mr Kelly, R. J. Nugent). The background is that on 4 October 1991 the honourable member wrote to the then Minister for Social Security on behalf of a constituent, a Mr Radisich, and, amongst other things, the honourable member's letter referred critically to a named public servant. On 18 February the honourable member received by fax a letter dated 13 February from a firm of solicitors, Dwyer and Co., which advised that it was acting for the public servant in question. The solicitors' letter concluded with the statement: Accordingly, our client requires a written apology from you together with a clarification to be both the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training within seven days, failing which we are instructed to commence proceedings for libel. The Committee received written submissions from the honourable member for Aston and from the solicitors involved. On receipt of a detailed submission from the honourable member for Aston, the Committee sent this to Dwyer and Co., inviting any further submission the firm wished to make. The Committee subsequently received an additional written submission from Dwyer and Co .. The honourable member for Aston advised the Committee in his submission that he felt, at the time he received the letter from Dwyer and Co., that he was being pressured both by way of the short time scale to respond, and the implication of threatened legal action with its resultant publicity, to withdraw his representations on behalf of his constituent. The honourable member asserted that he had a right and a duty to correspond with Ministers on matters affecting his constituents. In its submissions, Dwyer and Co. explained its actions, outlining the background to its involvement on behalf of its client and commenting on the honourable member for Aston's letter, which gave rise to its involvement. The Committee gave careful consideration to all the material before it and received a detailed memorandum on the matter. The Committee takes the view that mem-Â· bers should, in their correspondence with Ministers, distinguish clearly between ocjourned. casions when they are putting forward their own view and those occasions when they are relaying the views of a constituent. The Committee recognises that in such cases there are competing proper interests. Members the constituents they represent have an interest in the capacity of members to be able to make representations to Ministers without the threat of actions for defamation. On the other hand, the Committee accepts the proposition that citizens have a basic right to protect their reputations and, if necessary, to have recourse to the courts of law. As a general rule, the Committee believes that the sent to threat to commence proceedings against a member in respect of a letter written - o a Minister on behalf of a constituent could be held to constitute improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. In the present case, although the person or persons responsible for the letter from Dwyer and Co. to the honourable member for Aston may have acted without a full knowledge of the legal and related issues involved and although the person or persons may not have intended to intimidate or influence the honourable member for Aston in an improper way, the terms of the letter and the circumstances of its receipt, in the opinion of the Committee, had a tendency to impair the honourable member for Aston's independence in the performance of his duties. I should add that the Committee is of the view that, in writing letters to Ministers on behalf of constituents, members should not be immune from the laws of defamation. Such an extension of absolute privilege would not be warrante-. Nevertheless, the Committee believes that the House's ability to act in respect of a particular threat of obstruction, or obstruction, is important if members are to perform the work expected of them.

VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Humphreys, and read a first time. Second Reading",108
224,Mr HUMPHREYS,COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes amendments to veterans affairs and associated legislation. It gives effect to a number of important changes to benefits for veterans and their dependants. The Bill also contains a number of minor policy measures as well as some necessary drafting and technical changes. Among the most important measures concement tained in this Bill are: the extension of benefits to members Australian defence forces serving in bodia; the replacement of the existing voucher system for telephone rental concessions with an annual telephone allowance; and changes to the assessment rules for unlisted property trust investments. This last amendment arises from similar changes to social security legislation. The extension of benefits in respect of Bill (No. service in Cambodia follows thr. Government's decision of 9 October 1991 to deploy Australian Defence Force personnel for service in Cambodia as part of the United Nations peacekeeping efforts. The Bill will designate Cambodia as an operational area from 20 October 1991. This is the date, confirmed by the Department of Defence, on Affairs which Australian Defence Force personnel were deployed for service in the area. It will remain an 'operational area' until the United Nations cease fire takes effect, and related demobilisation and cantonment measures are in place. After that time, service in Cambodia will be designated as 'peacekeeping service'. Both periods of service provide entitlement to compensation in respect of incapacity or death based on the more generous standard of proof. The Bill will also extend eligibility for service pension for the period Cambodia is designated an 'operational area'. A further amendment to the legislation will be necessary to close off the period of operational service in Cambodia. Administrative arrangements will also need to be made to provide eligibility for benefits in respect of peacekeeping service in the area. These changes will take place after the United Nations ceasefire. In case there are any concerns, in the light of reports that the Department of Defence may call on some Army reservists to' serve in , Cambodia, I specifically make the point that this Bill ensures they will be entitled to the same benefits as those available to full time members of the regular defence forces. In line with the Government's announin the 1991 Budget, this Bill will provide for the existing telephone rental of the voucher system to be replaced with a Camtelephone allowance. This change will be effective from 1 July 1992. The Bill will also provide for the payment of a special telephone allowance for World War I veterans and mariners. This allowance will equal the annual telephone rental charge for a single telephone service, paid in four instalments. Changes to the rules for assessing income in respect of certain investments in unlisted property trusts are also proposed in this Bill. The proposed amendments give effect to the Government's decision of 25 November 1991. A more generous income assessment will apply as a part of the restructuring of the unlisted property trust investment industry. These amendments also reflect similar changes made to the Social Security Act earlier in these sittings. Other amendments proposed by this Bill reflect either minor changes and improvements in benefits available to veterans and their dependants; or streamlining of administrative provisions to provide for a more efficient and effective delivery of benefits for veterans. The Bill proposes a number of amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Defence Service Homes Act which fit within this category. In relation to defence service homes, the Bill will provide that certain persons, who revoked their entitlement to benefits under the Defence Service Homes Act in favour of benefits under the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act, will be able to withdraw their revocation and regain entitlement under the Defence Service Homes Act. Other proposed changes to the Defence Service Homes Act are: provision for all financial transactions in relation to the defence service homes insurance activities under the Act, or in respect of insurance as an agent for an insurer, to be conducted under the Defence Service Homes Insurance Trust account; provision to enable the Commonwealth and Westpac to agree to waive the first mortgage requirement on advances, in certain circumstances. This will enable persons to take advantage of State housing assistance; provision for certain persons who were discharged on medical grounds, or who die, prior to completing the minimum six-year period of service. This change will ensure that such persons, or their dependants, can establish their full entitlements under the Act; and clarification of the 'portability' provisions. This change follows my announcement on 22 August last year that two or more persons, both of whom are eligible for assistance under the Defence Service Homes Act, may 'pool' their entitlements on the same property. One other significant change is the proposed amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements and Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Acts to allow for the automatic grant of war widows or widowers pensions and payment of funeral benefits in certain circumstances. This change will streamline current administrative arrangements and result in improved service delivery. Changes of an administrative nature are also proposed in respect of the dismissal of applications to the Veterans Review Board. The changes are designed to clarify current provisions for dismissal of an application for review where the matter has not been finalised within two years. The remaining measures in the Bill relate to changes which flow from amendments to the Social Security Act. This will ensure consistency in the application and administration of the income and assets tests. Finally, the Bill contains a range of minor technical and drafting amendments. All the measures contained in this Bill will have minimal financial impact with the exception of the provisions relating to the telephone allowance. The estimated program costs for telephone allowances are $12.060m in 199293, $11.307m in 1993-94 and $11.401m in 1994-95. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Tim Fischer) adjourned. SOCIAL SECURITY (FAMILY PAYMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Simmons, and read a first time. Second Reading",108
225,Mr SIMMONS,COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP,"Calare-Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government) (5.06 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Social Security (Family Payment) Amendment Bill 1992 gives effect to the families Government's commitment to integrate payments for children. The integration of family allowance supplement and additional pension and benefit will result in a program of nearly $2 billion which will assist about 800,000 families or nearly 11h million higher children. As well, family allowance and family allowance supplement will be amalcourage gamated into a single payment with entitpensioners lement calculated under a two-step income their and assets test. Under current arrangements, family alwage lowance is payable to a one-child family with a combined income of $64,167 per annum and full rate family allowance supplement is payable where combined income is $20,700 take work. or less. Both are subject to an assets test based on net market value; $359,250 for family allowance supplement and $600,000 for family allowance with special provisions available for families with high net assets in hardship. The total number of families sisted under the whole family payment program will be in the vicinity of 1.9 million, or nearly four million children. The new payment will be payable at levels: a basic rate equivalent to the current family allowance and a higher rate, called 'additional family payment' in the Bill, equivalent to the current rates of family allowance supplement and additional pension and benefit, as well as rent assistance and guardian allowance if payable. The new payment and arrangements will commence from 1 January next year. At present, pay days for family payments and payments for children in the pensions benefits systems fall on different days in a fortnight. To ensure that the transition to the new family payment paydays does not result in loss, everyone who might otherwise miss out on payment for some days in the crossover period, or as a result of the crossover, will receive a one-off payment. The new family payment is a major reform which derives from the social security review. It will reduce poverty traps, improve work incentives for low income families, increase the take-up rate of the family payment for low income families with children and help to budget better. I will deal with each family of those improvements in turn. Poverty traps occur where recipients of income support perceive that they have little financial incentive for increasing income from earnings. In a period when unemployment is than we would all like, it is critically important to do everything we can to enwork force participation. Currently, and beneficiaries may compare financial situation while receiving social security with employment at a relatively low or salary and, because they are unaware of their likely qualification for family allowance supplement to top up their earnings, think that they will be no better off if they The measures in this Bill will make the choices between government assistance and work much clearer and will signal to pensioners and beneficiaries that assistance for their families will, in all likelihood, continue asif they take a job with a low to moderate wage. When a person leaves income support he or she, if income support was received for 12 months or more, will automatically be sent two a family payment claim form and will be given six weeks within which to claim the payment. Shorter term recipients will also be told how to get extra payments. This will give people every opportunity to test themselves for eligibility for the additional family payment. If they lodge their claim within the six weeks, full arrears of additional family payment will be made back to the time they ceased their pension, benefit or allowance. One major effect of these reforms is that the and new family payment will direct a greater proportion of the family's social security support to the person responsible for the dayto-day care of children, usually the mother. For example, in a family with two children under 13 where the father receives Job Search allowance, under the new family payment arrangements the mother will receive $163 a fortnight instead of the $41.40 she currently receives. Family allowance supplement payments are now directed to the mother in most cases, as are the payments of additional pension for children of pensioner couples. The changes in this Bill will apply the same principle to child related payments for families receiving Job Search allowance or other income support payments. Directing payments for children to the primary care giver is consistent with the Government's social justice strategy and the national agenda for women. The family payment will be paid on what are currently family allowance paydays. These fortnightly paydays fall on the alternate Thursday to pension paydays. Spreading pensioners' payments more evenly through a fortnight will assist family budgeting. To give another example, a sole parent pensioner with two children under 13 currently receives $46l.60 each fortnight on the Thursday pension payday and $41.40 in family allowance in the following week, giving total assistance of $503 per fortnight. Under the new payment structure, after 1 January 1993 a sole parent in the same situation will receive $31l.30 in the pension week and $19l.70 in the following family payment week, again with a total of $503 per fortnight. Rent assistance will also be included in the family payment for those families with children eligible for additional family payment who pay private rent. I must stress that total financial support provided to the family from social security will not be reduced under the changes to payment arrangements. At present sole parents who receive family allowance supplement do not receive guardian allowance, whereas sole parent pensioners do. Under the new family payment this anomaly will be addressed and all sole parents who qualify for additional family payment will receive the guardian allowance. At the moment, guardian allowance is $746.20 a year or $28.70 a fortnight. Paying guardian allowance to eligible working sole parents will deal with a potential poverty trap for this group. Maintenance income is currently taken into account in determining the rate of pension or benefit. Under the new arrangem-nts, maintenance payments will only be taken into account in determining the rate of the additional family payment. If the level of maintenance is such that no additional family payment is payable, the excess maintenance will not then be counted to reduce pension or benefit entitlements, nor the basic family payment. Family allowance supplement recipients are currently not subject to the maintenance income test. However, from 1 January 1993 all persons qualified for additional family payment will have maintenance taken into account. Although this means that some recipients will receive a lower rate of additional family payment, it will result in a more consistent treatment of people in receipt of maintenance. As I mentioned earlier, guardian allowance will be paid to all sole parent additional family payment recipients, and the additional $746.20 a year will largely offset the impact of the maintenance income test for a very substantial group. As part of the package included in this Bill it has been decided to continue the family payment until a student leaves secondary school or until the end of the year in which he or she turns 18, whichever is the earlier. This measure encourages families to allow their children to complete education and overcomes an existing anomaly whereby some families receive family allowance for children aged under 18 throughout year 12 while others with children who turn 18 at some time during the year cease eligibility at that time. As at present, students aged 16 years or more will not attract the payment if they are eligible for Austudy. To improve take-up of the new family payment, tax file number data matching will be used to detect clients who may be eligible for, but are not receiving, additional family payments. FAS is currently assisting over 200,000 families, and it is estimated that substantial number of additional be identified as having an entitlement to an additional family payment. I remind adjourned. honourable members that such payments are free of income tax. The increase in the PAS threshold from April 1992, together with the introduction of the new, single, two-step program, is estimated to lead to an additional 90,000 families receiving additional family payments. The changes being introduced in this Bill require major changes to the ADP systems used by the Department of Social Security. Such major reforms are feasible only because the social security computer system is advanced as any in the world. The changes will also require extensive training of staff and publicity and information material for Australian families. I mentioned the assets test earlier. Honourable members will recall that, from beginning of 1992, this Government introduced a hardship test as part of each assets test applicable to family allowance and family allowance supplement. In the substantially prevailing economic circumstances, especially the rural downturn, there are concerns about the welfare of children in families with assets above the family allowance supplement assets test threshold, but where those assets are returning very low incomes. Honourable members will be pleased that the new family payment system preserves the hardship tests for both the basic and additional family payments to protect the families concerned. The Bill I am presenting to is not the end of improvements to this Government's policies to provide assistance for families. It is the end of a rationalisation process that has tak-n a great deal of work formulate and to put into practice. Our mitment to Australian families is undiminindicate ished and this Bill is another clear signal the families of Australia that their interests will be both protected and, where possible, enhanced by this Government. Above all, Bill brings about a level of consistency in administration of family payments hitherto absent from the system. I commend a to the House, and I present the explanatory families will memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) NA",110
226,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Before calling the Clerk on the next item, I might respond to a matter raised with me by the honourable member for Mitchell. On 28 April the honourable member raised, as a possible contempt of the House, a matter in connection with articles in Sydney newspapers concerning a then forthcoming report from the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The honourable as member stated that, in accordance with procedures that I had proposed to the House in September 1990 concerning the disclosure of confidential committee material, the issue would be considered by the committee in question. I have been advised that the Standing the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has concluded that there was no breach of standing orderÂ· 340 and that the publication of the articles had not interfered with its work, with the committee system or with the functions of the House. As the procedures of the House are still in the formative stage in these matters, it is timely that I outline again and explain the procedures that I believe should be followed in such cases. I propose that at the first opportunity after such an issue comes to light it should be raised in the House. While the present standing orders concerning the raising of matters of privilege remain in force, this is the House today the proper course. There would be no need for the member raising the matter to go into detail; it would be sufficient to identify the committee and the to nature of the concern. At this stage, in the comnormal course of events, the Speaker would that the matter should be considered to by the committee in question. The committee would need to consider whether there had been substantial interference with its work, this with the committee system or with the the functions of the House. The committee should also take wha&ever steps it can to ascertain the the Bill source of any disclosure. Should a committee conclude that substantial interference has occurred, a special report which could be in the fonn of a statement should be presented to the House by the committee chainnan or by his or her nominee. This should explain why the committee has concluded that substantial interference has occurred. It should also outline the steps the committee itself has taken to ascertain the source of disclosure. It would not be for the committee to decide whether in fact a contempt had been committed. I expect that in ordinary circumstances such a finding would be taken by me to establish that a prima facie case had been made out. Precedence could be given to a motion after members generally had an opportunity to consider the committee's advice. Should a committee conclude that substantial interference has not occurred, I believe it would still be appropriate for the House to be infonned briefly of this fact by means of an oral report, the matter having been brought to members' attention in the first place. Unless the House decides otherwise, I propose to follow these procedures. I emphasise that it remains open to any member to raise such a complaint of breach of privilege. Indeed, technically, a complaint of this kind can be raised by a member who is not a member of a committee or the committee involved. The proposals I have outlined seek to give the House the benefit of some information from the committee in question, not on considerations of privilege as such, but on the circumstances concerning the matter alleged and their impact on the work of the committee, the committee system and the functions of the House, rather than having me and possibly the House deal with the matter without this important input. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL First Reading Bill presented by Mr Simmons, and read a first time. . Second Reading",112
227,Mr SIMMONS,PRIVILEGE,"Calare-Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government) (5.21 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill relates to the provision of untied financial assistance to local government. Its objective is to put in place arrangements for the provision of identified local road funding to local government for the three years 199293 to 1994-95. In respect of local roads funds, the Special Premiers Conference of October 1990 decided that funds for local roads would be untied and paid to local government or to State Governments where they are responsible for local roads, via general purpose grants. The Government decided to introduce interim arrangements for 1991-92 to provide a period of stability while the detailed arrangements were finalised for subsequent years. The interim arrangements were reflected in the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Act 1991. Since the interim arrangements were agreed to in 1991, there have been extensive consultations with local government and with the States. These consultations were marked by a positive attitude and a genuine desire on the part of all parties to develop arrangements acceptable to all concerned. I want to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the cooperation afforded by the Australian Local Government Association and the various State associations which comprise its membership. Their contribution is evidence of the value of Commonwealth and State governments fully involving them in the development of Commonwealth and State policies that will affect directly or indirectly local government and its operations. The arrangements that are now incorporated in this Bill reflect the advice and suggestions that were obtained through the consultation 1992 process. Under the arrangements proposed in the Bill: the funding involved will continue to be separately identified rather than absorbed into general purpose assistance; each State's share of the funding level of some $300m will be maintained at the present proportion. The arrangements will operate for a 3 year period 1992-93 to 1994-95; the funds will be distributed in each State on the basis of principles reflecting road needs; the legislation will no longer provide specific allocations for special roads but the funding of such works may be provided for in the principles that will govern the distribution of grants in each State. As for 1991-92 the funding will be untied which will mean simply that the manner in which it is spent will be entirely at the discretion of the local governing body. The commitment, previously given by the Government, to maintain this funding in real terms will be honoured. The distribution of funds between local governing bodies in each State; as I have noted above, will be in accordance with principles reflecting road needs. These principles will be worked out between the Commonwealth and each State and local government associations in that State. The Commonwealth will be insisting thatprinciples that are developed are consistent with the Commonwealth Government's response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. An important feature of the new arrangements is to provide funding for councils in the Northern Territory so that all local ning bodies in that Territory which are receiving general purpose assistance from local government will also receive identified road funding. This change will extend identified local road funding to an additional 52 local governing bodies in the Northern Territory, the great majority of which represent Aboriginal communities. This change will be achieved by providing for a mechanism to transfer some local roads funds, currently paid to the Territory Government, to Norlhern Territory local governments via the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986. The level of the funds to be transferred will be decided following consultations between the Minister responsible for local government in the Territory and me. Up to some $12m could be involved in the transfer. This change will not disadvantage mainstream councils in the Northern Territory, but will bring arrangements in the Territory into line with those in the rest of Australia. There will also be some adjustment to works funding levels in Tasmania, dependent on negotiations between the Tasmanian Government and the Municipal Association of Tasmania. These negotiations concern the responsibilities of the respective spheres of government concerning certain road works. Funding levels will reflect adjustments to responsibilities. Some $4.Sm could be involved. In both the Northern Territory and Tasmania, the adjustments decided will be notified in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette according to the requirements of this Bill. The net financial impact of the changes proposed in the Bill is nil. Increases in funding to the Northern Territory and Tasmanian local government will be offset by an equivalent reduction in general purpose assistance provided to those State governments. Because of the timing of the Government's decision I do not expect that the State local government grants commissions will be recommending any significant changes to the distribution of grants in their respective States for 1992-93. Certainly the Commonwealth will not be insisting on any such changes. This situation should now assist councils in govertheir planning for the coming year. The changes that are proposed will provide a firm basis for the provision of these grants for the next three years. They will improve the equity of the arrangements. Consistent with our policies for local government they will, in addition, strengthen the role of that sphere of government that is so important to all Australians. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned.

228,Mr BALDWIN,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The Act provides Commonwealth grants of financial assistance to the States, the Northern Territory and higher education institutions for the. provision of higher education. This Bill provides increased funding for higher education institutions of $46.7m in 1992, $29.7m in 1993 and $9.5m in 1994. In accordance with the Government's cost supplementation arrangements, the Bill provides for additional funds over the 199294 triennium to take account of movements in the Department of Employment, Education and Training's higher education salary and non-salary indexes. The Bill also gives effect to Government decisions on higher education announced in the former Prime Minister's November 1991 statement on the economy and employment and in the February 1992 economic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Bill provides an extra $38.4m in 1992, $21.5m in 1993 and $15.7m in 1994 for additional student places and for higher education capital works. The Bill also provides for a technical adjustment of funds payable to institutions between operating grants andÂ· amounts payable via the Higher Education Trust Fund in respect of HECS student liabilities. The variations reflect an ongoing adjustment to the level of funds available through the Trust Fund as estimates are adjusted to take account of actual student numbers. These adjustments do not affect the total level of funding available to the higher education system. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House.

229,Mr BEDDALL,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Unless the Parliament provides otherwise, section 66 of the Constitution prescribes a maximum annual sum for the payment of salaries to Ministers. Amendments to the Ministers of State Act which sets this sum are . thus required from time to time to cover changes to ministerial salaries. The sum appropriated is to meet the expected cost of salaries imd no more. While the Act covers the total cost of salaries it does not set the amount of individual salaries to Ministers. The enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 has had, amongst other things, the effect of linking the basic salary levels for parliamentarians to the top of the Senior Executive Service band one in the Public Service. There is also a similarly proportioned increase in the salaries of Ministers of State. Following the enactment of the Remuneration and Allowances Act the Government set in train arrangements to ensure that the relativities established between the salaries of parliamentarians at that time are maintained. That is, Ministers' salaries are increased at the same rate and at the same time that salaries of senators and members of the Parliament increase. Ministers receive the same percentage increase in additional salaries as members of the Parliament and are phased in the same way. The amount proposed to be appropriated accords with and includes the national wage case increase of 2.5 per cent effective from 15 August 1991.

Second Reading",115
230,Mr BEDDALL,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"I move: Thatthe Bill be now read a second time. The Customs Legislation (Tariff Concessions and Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1992 is an omnibus measure proposing a series of amendments to the Customs Act 1901, the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988, and the Customs Tariff (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1987 to: 1) repeal part XVA of the Customs Act 1901 and substitute a new part XVA of the Customs Act 1901 to give legislative effect to the Government's response to the Industry Commission's report on the tariff concessions system (Report No.9 of 8 March 1991), announced by the Government on 24 September 1991; and 2) amend part XVB of the Customs Act 1901 and the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 to give legislative effect to the Government's review of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing system, announced by the Government on 5 December 1991. I will now briefly outline the proposed changes: Tariff Concessions The present commercial tariff concession system allows duty-free entry of imports where there are no goods serving similar functions made by Australian industry in the normal course of business. The objective of the system is to ensure that industry is not I taxed by the tariff where it is serving no protective function. By lowering input costs, the concession system is an important element in the Government's program to improve the international competitiveness of Australian industry. Once a commercial tariff concession order is in place, any importer can use it to import goods described in that order dutyfree. The present commercial tariff concession system was introduced in 1983, following an lAC report in 1982. The March 1991 Industry Commission inquiry and report to which this Bill is addressed has been prompted by a growing dissatisfaction with the operation of the current system, particularly with the time taken to obtain a concession order, and the lack of transparency in the decision making process leading to the grant or refusal of such an order. The amendments proposed in this Bill reflect the Government's decision to accept most of the Industry Commission's recommendations for changes to the commercial tariff concession system. They will make concessional entry more readily available without affecting the assistance given to industry and improve the openness, clarity and consistency of the tariff concession system. In particular, clause 10 of the Bill introduces a new tariff concession system by repealing the old part XVA of the Customs Act and substituting a new part XVA. The four principal elements of the new system are as follows: The first introduces new definitions for the current core criteria for the granting of a tariff concession order to replace the old 'goods serving similar functions' test, which. incorporated the economic concept of 'cross-elasticity of demand', which has proven difficult to interpret and administer, The second introduces strict time limits both on the processing of applications or revocations by the bureaucracy, and on the submission of information by affected parties. This will streamline the consideration of applications for tariff concession orders or revocations of such orders, and help make the process more transparent, The third introduces limited and definitive grounds for the .revocation of tarif- - oncesÂ­ sion orders to Improve accountablhty and address co-cerns amongst users of tariff concessions about possible arbitrary revocations, The fourth introduces a right to merits review of all decisions made in the new part XVA, first through an intern-l. revi-w mechanism, and then via the Admlntstrahve Appeals Tribunal. With respect to this final principal reform, it is noted that the current concession system allows persons aggrieved by a decision under part XVA to obtain jud.ic-al r-view o! .that decision under the Admmlstrattve DecIsIons (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This is both costly and time consuming and, importantly, limited to errors of law. The proposed new two ti-red process - f internal review and AAT revIew IS aments review process which will allow Jor revi-w of a decisi<;m on; the facts togeth-r With a substitution of decisions in appropnate cases. Other more technical amendments relevant to the new tariff concession system contained in the Bill are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum. Anti-Dumping The proposed anti-dumping amendments in this Bill follow the Government's review of Australia's anti-dumping policy and administrative arrangements in late 1991. Dumping and subsidisation are not supported internationally if they cause, or threaten to cause material injury to an industry produ-ing like goods in the importin.g country. The internationally agreed rem-- IS the imposition of a dumping or countervallmg duty sufficient to remove the injury to the local industry. The Government has consistently maintained that effective anti-dumping and countervailing measures are necessary to protect Australian industry from injury caused by these unfair trading practices. However, in taking anti-dumping and countervailing actions there is need to strike a balance, a balance between providing local producers with effective relief and ensuring that relief does not unjustifiably impede trade or increase costs to Australian consumers. Antidumping decisions therefore require judgments to be made inyolving - ble-d of economic and commerCial consideratIOns. Over the last two years the Government has particularly focused on the time taken to process applications for anti-dumping and countervailing action. The Government looked exhaustively at the options for reducing the time between a request for anti-dumping relief and the time when such relief can first be made available. In the 1991 March industry statement the Government proposed and the Parliament subsequently passed legislation which greatly reduced the processing time for applications. Clause 13 of this Bill will further shorten the total time allowed to reach a preliminary finding to a maximum of 125 days or, for complex cases, a maximum of 145 days. This compares more than favourably to the times taken by other countries in the processing of requests for anti-dumping relief. Australia now has one of the .fastest anti-dumping systems. The USA, for instance, takes between 160 and 210 days; Canada between 141 and 186 days; and the European <?ommunity around 270 days. I seek leave to mcorporate in Hansard a comparative table of these time limits, for the information of honourable members. Leave granted.

231,Mr BEDDALL,MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT,"To keep processing time for anti-dumping relief to a minimum, the Government also considers it appropriate that the applicant for that relief provide sufficient information to enable a prima facie case to be established. The technical requirements of applications have therefore been tightened by clauses 12 and 13 of the Bill. However, I draw it to honourable members' attention that the Business Liaison Unit or Shopfront of Customs has been expanded to continue its important role in assisting Australian industry to complete the form for anti-dumping applications. . The Government has also recognised industry's dissatisfaction about the relatively short period, that is, three years, that anti-dumping and countervailing measures are in place. In recognition of this, and also to remain consistent with amendments proposed to the GATT in the Uruguay Round, clause 17 Of the Bill provides for anti-dumping and countervailing measures to be extended to five years. In addition to this extension, clause 7 then provides for a review to be undertaken by the Anti-Dumping Authority as to whether measures should continue after the five-year expiry date for measures or undertakings, following a request for such a review by an interested party. The Authority will call for submissions no later than eight months before this expiry date so as to allow sufficient time for a comprehensive inquiry to be made by the Authority-and a decision to be made by the Minister-before the end of the five-year period. Measures will be retained where the Minister is satisfied that they are requiredbut they may not necessarily be of the same type or magnitude. For example, if earlier measures were in the form of an undertaking, they might, depending on the circumstances, be replaced by anti-dumping duties. Similarly, earlier measures based on prices in the country of export may need to be revised to reflect prices which are more current. This reform is considered by the Government to be preferable to requiring an Australian industry to re-apply for anti-dumping or countervailing relief, with the possibility of a gap occurring in the important relief which might be available. , Finally, with regard to the substantive anti-dumping amendments contained in this Bill, the Government is proposing in clause 8 the extension of the life of the Anti-Dumping Authority for a further eight years to August 2001. During the course of its review, the Government considered claims of duplication of work by the Customs Service and the ADA, but it is satisfied that the current division of responsibilities between these two bodies should be retained, to ensure the comprehensive and impartial review of anti-dumping measures that is currently provided by the Authority. In proposing the substantive anti-dumping amendments which I have briefly detailed, together with the several technical amendments to the anti-dumping system which are explained in detail in clauses 11 to 16 of the explanatory memorandum, the Government does recognise the important part which imports play in our economy and reiterates that it will not see.the anti-dumping system used as de facto industry protection. However, the Government believes Australian industry will welcome the changes which this Bill proposes to make to the anti-dumping system. The message is clear. The Government will not allow material injury to local industry from dumped or subsidised goods. The Government has backed up that commitment with an anti-dumping system that is one of the fastest in the world, which recognises the need for applications to substantiate a case, and which provides appropriate assistance to all parties and is fair in its judgments. Financial Impact Statement The financial impact of the measures contained in this Bill relating to anti-dumping and tariff concessions involve new staffing costs to process the various applications for measures within the stricter time constraints, to expand the Business Liaison Unit within the Australian Customs Service to assist with dumping applications, and to meet the new merits review reform in the tariff concessions area. In addition, new notice requirements in provisions of the Bill relating to the tariff concessions reforms will involve increased printing costs. The estimated total increased costs are as follows: anti-dumping, $848,000 for financial year 1992-93; tariff concessions, $300,000 for financial year 1992-93. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned.

233,Mr JOHNS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (5.49 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Bill makes amendments to a number of Acts within the health, housing and community services portfolio. Part 2 of this Bill makes a number of amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986. The amendments to part II of this Act are part of a new strategy to assist Commonwealth funded organisations improve the of service they provide for people with a disability. The primary focus of the amendments is on providing people with the services which best meet their needs and aspirations, and to ensure that the quality of services is subject to safeguards. The Disability Services Ad came into operation in 1987. It provided all the then funded services, called prescribed services, with five years to meet the higher standards of service embodied in the objects, which are contained in section 3 of the Act, and prinand objectives made under section 5 of apthe Act and gazetted on 9 June 1987. This five-year period ends on 30 June 1992. Although significant achievements have been made, it has become clear that for many services this five-year period was not long enough to deal with the complexity of the changes required. Therefore, the Bill provides for ongoing funding to prescribed services so that they can complete the necessary changes enabling them to further the objects of the Act, and the gazetted principles and objectives. To be assured of ongoing funding, services will have to meet prescribed minimum standards. The minImum standards were introduced administratively in February 1991 and all services are expected to meet these standards by 30 June 1992. Ultimately, all funded organisations will be required to become eligible for funding under section 10 of the Act, by providing a service at a standard consistent with the objectives of the Act, and the gazetted principles and objectives. However, to give recognition and assistance to those organisations who are continually and substantially improving their services, but who have not reached the standard for eligibility for funding under section 10, the Bill establishes an intermediate level of service standard and attainment. To reflect their progress and transition on the path to higher service standards, these services will be called transitional services. The Bill provides for the Minister to determine clear and objective standards which services will be expected to meet. Where a service fails to meet the applicable standards the Minister will be able to take action under the terms and conditions contained in the funding agreement; however, this action will be subject to a review by a disability standards review panel. The amendments provide that the performance of funded services against the applicable standards Is assessed at least once every five years. The Department is currently consulting with a wide cross-section of the community about setting appropriate standards, the processes monitoring service performance and the operation of the review panels. The Bill also contains provisions relating to the transfer of services under the Commonwealth-State disability agreement signed by all heads of government on 30 July 1991. The agreement marks a turning point in the provision of more efficient, and better, services for people with a disability in Australia, by rationalising the responsibilities of each level of government, and by ensuring coordinated service delivery. The Bill contains provisions to allow State and Territory government employment services which are transferring to the Commonwealth, but which are not yet furthering the objects of the Act, or the gazetted principles and objectives, to funded as prescribed services under section 13. The Bill removes the restriction on funding of for-profit organisations. This will allow the Minister to fund, on a case-by-case basis, services which are provided by other than non-profit organisations; for example, some attendant care services for which there is currently no option but to fund outside the Act. The Bill also provides for some other minor and technical amendments to part II of the Act. The amendments to the objects of the Disability Services Act clarify that the disability services program and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service are assistance programs that operate within budget constraints. With respect to the amendments to part III of the Disability Services Act, the amendments clarify that the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, CRS, does not have liability for payments under the higher education contribution scheme, HECS, for pensioners and beneficiaries whose rehabilitation programs involve tertiary training. As is the case for other Australian students, it is appropriate that students with disabilities should meet these costs when their income exceeds the HECS liability threshold. Other minor amendments to part III of the Act would achieve an increase in the for operational flexibility of the CRS by: providing legislative support for the reasonable termination of CRS programs; deleting and/or replacing outdated references to goods, services and social security allowances; clarifying eligibility for free services; and allowing administrative arrangements to be put in place with other Commonwealth entities. Part 3 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983. The First Home Owners Act was amended in 1990, as part of the Government's data-matching program, to insert a provision requiring current and new beneficiaries under the Act to provide their tax file number, TFN, data within 60 days of its request. Failure to be comply results in termination of all future monthly payments of assistance-an unintended and unduly harsh penalty. Recipients of assistance under other Government programs covered by the Datamatching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 who respond late can resume their entitlement simply upon reapplication after furnishing the requisite TFN data, with the penalty only of those benefit payments lost in the interim. However, the option of a fresh application is not available to first home beneficiaries. The new subsection 17C to be inserted in the First Home Owners Act will allow monthly payments of first home owners assistance to be resumed once the applicant supplies the required TFN data, with the penalty only of those payments lost by failure to provide it within the specified period. The amendments in part 4 of this Bill relate to the provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973 concerning pathology services and the initiation of excessive diagnostic imaging services. The amendments affecting dillgnostic imaging services are designed to give the Minister the authority to refer an ordering practitioner, including a medical or a dental practitioner, a chiropractor, a physiotherapist or a podiatrist, to a medical services committee of inquiry, if the Minister has reasonable grounds to believe that such a practitioner initiated excessive diagnostic imaging services. Under the existing provisions of the Health Insurance Act a medical services committee of inquiry can deal with practitioners who render excessive professional services, but it does not enable excessive dering to be considered. The current legislation enables the Minister to refer medical practitioners who initiate excessive pathology services to committees of inquiry under section 23DM of the Health Insurance Act. The amending legislation before the House provides for similar provisions to apply to the initiation of excessi ve diagnostic imaging services. As a result of previous amendments to the Health Insurance Act, from May 1991 and March 1992 chiropractors, physiotherapists and podiatrists have been able to refer p-tients for certain diagnostic imaging servIces. The amending legislation proposes, therefore, that the definition of 'practitioner', in relation to diagnostic imaging services, be amended to include chiropractors, physiotherapists and podiatrists, so that these practitioners may also be subject to examination, on referral by the Minister, by a committee of inquiry for the initiation of excessive diagnostic imaging services. This legislation also provides that certain procedures are to be followed before the Minister may refer a practitioner to a medical services committee of inquiry. Such procedures parallel similar provisions already existing in the Health Insurance Act in relation to pathology services. Similarly, committees of inquiry will follow the same procedures for the hearing and reporting of cases in relation to the initiation of excessive diagnostic imaging services as they do for other cases brought before such committees. Part 5 of the Bill contains amendments to the Hearing Services Act 1991. In response to a report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) undertook to amend the Hearing Services Act during this sittings by omitting paragraph has 66(5)(c). The amendment will have the effect of limiting the protection of section 66 to the name 'National Acoustic Laboratories', the acronym 'NAL' and the NAL logo. In addition, subsection 56(-) is to be omitted from the Hearing Services Act, as it is no longer a or- requirement that the Treasurer tables in the Parliament Commonwealth guarantees of borrowings by the Authority. Part 6 of the Bill extends the safety net arrangements under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, contained in part VII of the National Health Act 1953, to include medication supplied through outpatient departments of State public hospitals and repatriation hospitals. The expenditure by patients on such medication will be able to be recorded by the hospital authority and count towards the threshold for the issue of concession and entitlement cards. The holders of these cards obtain their pharmaceutical benefits for $2.60 or free of charge, respectively. The hospital authorities will be able issue the cards to patients. By agreement with theÂ· various State governments,. these arrangements are to be retrospective to 1 January 1992. Procedures were put into place fot the recording of supplies of outpatient medication from 1 January 1992, and upon passage of this Bill the concession and entitlement cards will be issued to persons who have qualified for them and refunds made where appropriate. The passage of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act (No.2) 1991 created the position of Senior Deputy President of the Australi-an Industrial Relations Commission. A consequential amendment, in part 6 of this Bill, provides that the Chairperson of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal must be either a Senior Deputy President or Deputy President of the Commission. Part 6 of the Bill also provides that in cases of amalgamation of pharmacies, only the pharmacist or pharmacists whose pharmacy or pharmacies will close under the amalgamation agreement may apply for, and thus receive, the grant of financial assistance. Part 7 of this Bill contains several aimed at improvingÂ· the administration of nursing homes under the aged and community care program. The Government has achieved a considerable amount of reform in nursing homes over the last six years, and the measures proposed here build on this achievement. The measures improve both the rigour of the management of nursing homes and the outcomes for the frail, aged residents of nursing homes. The first measure relates to pre-admission leave. One immediate benefit to nursing home residents of this Bill will be the introduction of pre-admission leave. Nursing home residents already are able to leave the nursing home for up to 28 days a year without any reduction of nursing home benefits paid to the nursing home. In the case of residents having to go to hospital, there is no limit to the number of days leave during which benefits will still be paid. This entitlement to 28 days non-hospital leave is now being extended to allow for up to two days of leave to be taken to before the resident actually enters the nursing home. Both the nursing home industry and the public have expressed concern about the existing arrangements, where an elderly person often receives short notice of a permanent vacancy in a nursing home. The person is often expected to take up the place the same day, or risk losing the place. Under the existing legislation, no Commonwealth benefit is payable until a person occupies a place in a nursing home. The understandable desire of nursing home proprietors to maximise their occupancy can lead to considerable pressure being placed on the aged person to enter a nursing home as soon as possible. . The amendments to the Act will allow new nursing home residents to use up to two days of their existing 28-day entitlement for nonhospital leave, immediately prior to their entering the home. This two-day period will enable them to organise their affairs, and prepare for the change of living arrangements, without fear of losing their place in the nursing home. It will also assist people in country areas who may have to travel some measures distance to the nursing home. The introduction of pre-admission leave is not meant to be an automatic condition proprietors require of all residents, but will be an option available to those who need it. A limit of two days will ensure new residents retain a generous social leave entitlement for the remainder of the financial year to assist them to adjust to long term care. The second measure relates to the disclosure of information to prospective purchasers of nursing homes. The nursing home funding system is, in part, a cost reimbursement system. Commonwealth benefits are advanced to proprietors each month .and, following the end of each financial year, that advanced benefit is acquitted against the proprietor's actual expenditure on nursing and personal care. Where a proprietor has spent less on nursing and personal care than has been advanced, the balance is recovered. This is frequently the case. What this means is that it is possible for a proprietor to underspend benefit and sell his or her nursing home before the overpayment can be identified, let alone recovered. Once the home is sold, the Department is able to quantify the overpayment. However, the current legislation makes the new proprietor liable for recovery of the previous proprietor's overadvance. . This process is well.established and known in the industry, and is usually accounted for in contracts for sale of nursing homes. However, the secrecy provisions of the National Health Act 1953 prevent the disclosure by the Department of information relating to a nursing home to a prospective purchaser. While prospective purchasers may appreciate the possibility of a recovery subsequent to sale, without specific information as to current and impending recoveries, they may be unable to adequately make provision in the contract of sale. They may, as a consequence, be significantly disadvantaged by underestimating the amount of the recovery. This may place some strain on the home's financing, making it harder for the new proprietor to provide quality care to the residents. The Bill contains amendments to assist in protecting the incoming proprietor and ensuring continued quality care for residents by allowing the Department to provide the prospective purchaser with the information he or she needs to make an informed decision about a sale. The rights of existing proprietors are also considered, as the Department will be required to wait seven days before disclosing information, during which time the proprietor may make a submission on the matter for consideration. In situations where there is an urgent need to act to protect the interests of a prospective purchaser, however, the Department will be able to act immediately. The elimination of this risk in the purchase of a nursing home will promote confidence in the transaction, stability in financing and continued quality of care for residents. The third measure in this part of the Bill relates to the keeping of certain records by former proprietors of nursing homes. A further consequence of proprietors being able to sell their homes before an overpayment can be quantified is that, if the Department is unable to gain access to the proprietor's accounting records, it will be very difficult to quantify the overpayment accurately. While nursing home proprietors are subject to a number of statutory responsibilities in relation to the keeping of records, those responsibilities presently cease once the proprietor has sold his or her home. The amendment in relation to this matter will help to protect taxpayers' money by introducing a requirement for former proprietors to continue to maintain their records for 12 months after they have sold their business. The amendment also enables the Department to approve a specific location for the keeping of the records, and provides appropriate penalties for former proprietors who fail to maintain their records accordingly. The fourth measure introduces amendments in relation to receivers, liquidators, et cetera, who are appointed to run a nursing home. The Bill amends the secrecy provision contained in the National Health Act 1953 to clarify the Department's ability to divulge key information to persons appointed to manage a proprietor's approved nursing home. Historically, there have been practical problems about how the secrecy provision should be administered where, for example, a receiver or a liquidator is appointed to conduct a proprietor's nursing home business. This has limited the Department's ability to deal effectively and cooperatively with such appointees, thus making it difficult for the Department to act in the interests of the nursing home residents. The final measure in part 7 of the Bill relates to transfers of nursing home bed approvals under section 39B of the Act. The Bill contains a measure to protect residents, where approved beds are to be transferred from one home to another. Approval in principle for such a transfer will be subject to a condition that the proprietor of the home yielding the beds continues to comply with nursing home conditions of approval. This is to further protect the welfare and safety of the residents in that home which will close or be reduced in size. The amendments will also provide for the formulation of principles to be referred to in making decisions to grant refuse approvals in principle for transfers. These principles will address such matters fraud or the provision of false or information, failure to meet gazetted nursing home standards, and problems with any statutory requirements. The effect will be that, where a person does not have a satisfactory record in the provision of aged care, that person will not be able to expand his or interests in the industry by buying and purposes transferring nursing home beds. This further example of the Government's commitment to ensuring quality care for the frail aged. Part 8 of the Bill introduces amendments theÂ· Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. These that amendments clarify the definition of are 'therapeutic devices' for the purposes of Act and implement, in the time suggested, further recommendations made by Peter Baume for improving Australia's regulatory regime for therapeutic goods. These recommendations are contained in Professor Baume's Report on the Future Drug Evaluation in Australia, tabled in parliament in July 1991, and adopted for implementation as a package by the Government. The amendment to the definition of 'therapeutic device' in the Act will the regulation of therapeutic goods used to replace or modify the human anatomy for cosmetic purposes, such as breast implants. The amendment will also serve to permit greater scrutiny by the therapeutic goods administration of therapeutic goods used influence conception, including goods used in the IVF program. These changes also serve bring the definition of 'therapeutic devices' closer to that being used by the countries of servants. the European Community, from which a significant proportion of therapeutic are imported into Australia. The new definition will accommodate emerging techEvaluation nologies being developed in the fields of immunology, genetic engineering and commaking puter software. The remaining amendments largely give effect to the recommendations contained in Professor Baume's report. During the last or sittings, amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act were introduced to enable deadas lines to be set for completing evaluations of misleading certain therapeutic drugs. The Bill inserts a provision, Â·as recomother mended by Professor Baume, to enable applicants to treat - failure by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to meet the stipulated deadline as a decision to refuse marketing her approval for the applicant's drug, for the of precipitating a direct appeal to the is a . Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Bill also contains new reporting requirements designed to ensure that, for the protection of consumers and the public, any to adverse safety data relating to certain drugs have been approved for marketing, or that the subject of an application for such an that approval, will be reported by the relevant sponsors or applicants where they become Professor aware of such information. In order to attract suitable candidates to assume the challenging responsibility for of initiating recommended changes and improvements to the regulatory regime for therapeutic goods in Australia, Professor Baume recommended in chapter 12 of his report that the positions both of national manager and director of drug evaluation in the Therapeutic Goods Administration beÂ· strengthen filled on a contract basis. To enable such officers to exercise relevant powers under the Therapeutic Goods Act and Regulations, the Bill introduces amendments that will allow regulations to be made to to permit the Secretary and the Minister to delegate their powers and functions to officers to who have not been appointed to the Therapeutic Goods Administration as public Finally, the Bill facilitates Professor devices Baume's recommendation that the deliberations of the Australian Drug Committee and its subcommittees be more widely disseminated. It permits the of regulations authorising the release of therapeutic goods information to the public. I now tum to the amendments to the Health Insurance Act relating to the repeal of the Medicare co-payment arrangements, contained primarily in schedule 2 of the Act. These amendments will operate retrospectively from 1 March 1992. Provision has been made, however, for the preservation of the effect of the benefit reduction, co-payment and 'additional fee' for those prescribed services rendered during the period 1 December 1991 to 29 February 1992. Provision has also been made for the preservation of transitional arrangements for the Medicare safety net as it is affected by the change for individuals from a financial to a calendar year. The Health Insurance Act is amended so as to remove the enabling provisions for the Health Insurance Regulations to prescribe services which would have a reduced level of Medicare benefits, and where these services are bulkbilled and provided to noncardholders, a co-payment and an additional fee. The Health Insurance Regulations have already been amended so that no services have been prescribed under these provisions since 1 March 1992. Specifically, the Bill withdraws the provisions which enabled a reduction to the benefit for out-of-hospital general practitioner attendance items by $3.50 and eliminates the further reduction that was to apply to Medicare benefits for prescribed services in the following year. It also withdraws the provisions which permit medical practitioners to charge up to a $2.50 co-payment for those prescribed services which are bulkbilled and provided to non-cardholders, and the payment of the $1 additional fee to the doctor in respect of services. From 1 January 1992, registered families have been counting their out-of-pocket medical expenses or 'gap' payments towards a safety net threshold of $246 per annum. A 'gap' payment is the difference between the lower of the schedule fee, or whatever the doctor charges, and the Medicare benefit. The extension of the Medicare safety net arrangements to families remains unchanged by these amendments to the Health Insurance Act. However, the Bill removes the provisions relating to the safety net concession card and the need for a declaration form. These are not necessary as there is no longer a co-payment for bulkbilled services and, therefore, families and individuals do not have to provide evidence to their general practitioner that they have reached the threshold in order to be exempt from the copayment. The safety net status of an individual or a family need only be known by that person or family and the Health Insurance Commission. The withdrawal of these provisions does not affect the overall intent of the 1991 Budget announcement relative to genera'! practice. This Government is committed to working with the medical profession to achieve structural changes in general practice, which are aimed at achieving better quality care at better value for money. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services will be making more specific announcements on these measures in the coming months. I commend this Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCGauran) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Snowdon, and read a first time. Second Reading",120
234,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for these Transport and Communications) (6.16 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending 10 Acts administered within the transport and communications portfolio. While none of the proposed amendments involves significant policy changes, they are important for the general administration of the transport and communications. portfolio. Details of the amendments are as follows. Air Navigation Act 1920 The Bill amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 to enable ratification of two new protocols to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. These protocols increase the membership size of both the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and its navigation commission. Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 The Bill amends the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 to extend the Authority's functions to allow it to provide services to the Commonwealth, a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. Those services are to be services of a maritime nature and are to be provided on a commercial basis. This means that the Autho-ity will be able to recover the costs of providing any such services. The new provision will complement the existing function of the Authority which allows it to provide services to the maritime industry. Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 The Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 is amended to extend the Act to the Indian Ocean territories-Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands-as a consequence of the Government's decision to eliminate differences between the law of the Indian Ocean territories and that of mainland Australia. The Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 has also been amended to provide costs. that Australia Post is to supply its standard letter service, a community service obligation under section 27 of the Act; to the islands the single uniform rate of postage for carriage which applies within Australia. Civil Aviation Act 1988 Amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 will provide that the Authority is not entitled to reimbursement by the Commonwealth FAC where it suffers financial detriment as a result 'of complying with a ministerial direction concerning the performance of its environAustralian mental functions. Rather, as foreshadowed the Government in response to the report the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aircraft Noise, it is intended that these costs be' borne by the aviation industry. Under section 69 of the Civil Aviation Act the Authority is empowered to recover unpaid charges by imposing liens over aircraft. The Bill amends section 75 to make it clear that the Authority's statutory liens are to have priority over any other financial security interests, including pre-existing mortgagees. The amendments insert new transitional tax provisions into the principal Act which deal with the valuation of trading stock, accelerated depreciation of assets and capital gains tax. These provisions are consequential upon the Authority becoming liable to pay income tax from 1 July 1991 and are similar to transitional tax provisions applied to Telecom and Australia Post. These amendments have been drafted in accordance with policy advice from the Treasury and will ensure that the Civil Aviation Authority is accorded the same treatment as other government business enterprises that are now required to pay income tax. Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 The Bill amends the Federal Airports ,Corporation Act 1986 to specify that the Corporation is not entitled to Commonwealth reimbursement for financial detriment that it all suffers as a result of complying with a ministerial direction concerning the performance of its environmental functions. It is intended that the aviation industry bear these The amendments also clarify the FAC's financial transactions powers. As a result of at a decision by the House of Lords in 1990 there is a risk that an Australian court could find that the FAC does not have the power to enter into fim-ncial management risk transactions, such as interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements and options and futures contracts. The ,amendments expressly, provide that the can enter into such transactions and are similar to provisions that were inserted into the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the National Railways Commission Act by 1983 by the Transport and Communications by Legislation Amendment Act 1991. New transitional tax provisions dealing with accelerated depreciation of assets, capital gains tax and superannuation will also be inserted into the principal Act. These provisions are consequential upon the FAC becoming liable to pay income tax from 1 July 1991 and are similar to transitional tax provisions applied to Telecom and Australia Post. These amendments have been drafted in accordance with policy advice from the Treasury and will ensure that the FAC is accorded the same treatment as other government business enterprises that are now required to pay income tax. Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981 and Protection of the Sea (Protection of Pollution of Ships) Act The Bill contains a number of amendments to Australia's protection of legislation. This legislation implements several international conventions which deal specifically with the prevention of pollution from ships. The amendments in the Bill are a consequence of amendments to these conventions adopted recently by the relevant international organisation. The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act empowers Australia to intervene on the high seas in respect of any shipping in-ident resulting in or likely to result in major pollution damage. The amendments to this Act will enable intervention in respect a wider range of environmentally hazardous chemicals. The Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act implements the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL. This is the principal convention in controlling pollution from ships, currently applying to over 90 per cent of world shipping tonnage. The Bill proposes two major amendments to this Act. The first will give effect to Australia's obligations under annex IV of the Protocol on Environment Protection to the Antarctic Treaty relating to the disposal of untreated sewage, oil, chemicals and garbage in the Antarctic area. This annex was drafted with a view to imposing MARPOL-Iike obligations on those countries not a party to the MARPOL convention. Consequently, for Australia there are few additional measures to be implemented. It is thereforeÂ· efficient and sensible to include the proposed amendments in the MARPOL legislation, rather than legislation administered by the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories which will implement the remainder of the Antarctic protocol. The other significant amendment is the introduction of a requirement for ships to have on board an oil pollution emergency plan, which is the result of a recent amendment to the MARPOL convention. This is one of several changes to international 1983 pollution regulations as a result of the lessons learned from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. The emergency plan will consist of four the sea package of basic elements: an outline of procedures for reporting incidents; a list of authorities or persons to be contacted in the event of an incident; a detailed description of the steps to be taken immediately by persons on board to reduce or control discharge of oil following an incident; and a procedure for coordinating response efforts with national and local authorities. Ships visiting Australian ports will be reof quired to have an emergency plan available for inspection by Australian Maritime Safety Authority surveyors as part of the normal port control process, and sanctions are provided for failure to comply with these requirements. Navigation Act 1912 and Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act 1990 Amendments to the Navigation Act 1912 and to the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Act 1990 will correct minor drafting errors. Telecommunications Act 1991 A number of amendments are made to the Telecommunications Act 1991, the most important of which are to allow a dominant carrier to discriminate between customers in certain circumstances, allow particular basic carriage services and particular circumstances in which such services are provided to be excluded from the requirement under section 194 for basic carriage services to be set out in a tariff and to protect the name and symbol of the Australian Telecommunications Authority, AUSTEL. Section 183 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 is amended to allow certain exceptions to the rule that prevents a dominant carrier from discriminating between customers. The purpose of the amendment is to allow the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation to proceed with its proposal to offer concessions to low income and other disadvantaged customers. AOTC has already publicly announced a package of proposals which it proposes to implement on 1 July 1992. The amendment will ensure that AOTC's proposal can proceed. Section 194 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 is amended to enable regulations to be made allowing for the supply of certain basic carriage services or the supply of such services in certain circumstances without the services being included in a tariff, as presently required under section 194. The amendment will enable international transit arrangements to be excluded from the tariffmg requirement. The details of such arrangements are considered to be confidential between the carriers involved. A new section, section 402A, is inserted into the Telecommunications Act 1991 to protect the name and symbol of AUSTEL. New section 402A provides for a penalty of $3,000 for anyone contravening the protection provision. Financial Impact There will be no significant effects on the Commonwealth expenditure or revenue resulting from the amendments. The amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986 dealing with transitional tax provisions will clarify the taxation liability of those organisations. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Jull) adjourned.",126

236,Mr HAND,MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Melbourne-Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (8.00 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill contains a number of important policy initiatives aimed at increasing the control which the Government may exercise over Australia's migration program. In particular, the Bill contains significant measures to strengthen Australia's ability to cope with the increasing number of people claiming refugee status. Provisions have also been included to deter persons, primarily Indonesian nationals, from fishing illegally in Australian waters. The Bill also contains new powers to facilitate the successful operation of the Government's initiative to attract successful business migrants to Australia. Finally, the Bill will make a number of minor technical amendments to the Act. Refugee Initiatives Over the past three years the number of applications for refugee status from persons wishing to remain in Australia has grown dramatically from below 500 applications per year to a current caseload of 22,500. Many of these applicants have been able to continue to delay their departure from Austra1ia by deferring the lodgement of an actual application for refugee status. This is a cynical abuse of the refugee determination process, which will not be tolerated by the Government. Under the present policy based arrangements there are uncertainties about our ability to require applicants to cooperate in pursuing their claims in an expeditious manner. The Government has therefore decided to introduce a regulatory framework to underpin Australia's asylum determination procedures. The Government announced on 12 February 1992 that new arrangements would be introduced to improve the efficiency of Australia's system for processing claims for refugee status. The amendments set out in this Bill will facilitate refugee processing within a regulatory framework that provides certainty and accountability. The Bill will provide the Minister with a clear basis of power in the Act to make regulations for the orderly processing of refugee applications. The new measures developed to improve the refugee determination process will result in a more efficient and equitable system. Incorporating processing arrangements in regulations will produce a more predictable processing environment. All applicants have an equal opportunity to pursue their claims. The amendments in the Bill also relieve the Minister of the obligation to consider refugee applications by persons who hold the special four-year temporary entry permit granted to nationals of the People's Republic of China who were in Australia on 20 June 1989. The rationale for this provision is that these people have already been given protection which satisfies Australia's international obligations. Removing the duty to consider their applications will ensure processing resources are more productively employed for persons who do not have effective protection. The amendments will also allow the Minister to determine processing priorities so that processing of new applications for refugee status is not impeded by the existence of a backlog of unprocessed applications. Applications will no longer be processed in chronological order of receipt. Rather, applications in the backlog will be processed in tandem with new applications. The Government wishes to eliminate any incentive for persons with no claim to refugee status to lodge ill-founded applications simply to achieve continued residence in Australia while awaiting processing of their applications. The amendment will also provide that plications in the backlog shall not be found be subject to an unreasonable delay merely because other applications received more recently are being processed or have already been determined. Illegal Fishermen For some time now, the Government has been concerned about the problem of the incursion of foreign fishing vessels into Australian waters. The vessels are largely Indonesian in origin. The problem is serious, with consequences for the fishing industry, our marine environment and quarantine arrangements. Existing laws have not had the desired deterrent effect. There have been claims that the fishermen apprehended, in serving their gaol sentences, have a 'paid holiday' at the Australian taxpayers' expense. The small gratuities granted by State corrective services to all prisoners for their work may represent a significant amount to an Indonesian fisherman. The scheme outlined in this Bill is the result of discussion between the relevant State and Federal agencies. It is the first step in a much wider strategy and indicates our determination to deal with this problem effectively. The scheme will render any crew member of a fishing vessel apprehended liable for the cost of his custody and removal from Australia. The master, owner, agent or charterer of the relevant vessel will also be liable for that cost. The Secretary of my Department will be able to serve a notice on State and Territory gaols, banks or other financial institutions that may hold funds in trust for these prisoners. The notice will 'require them to pay the funds to my Department up to the amount of a person's liability. The scheme, together with the present capacity to confiscate fishing boats and to impose gaol sentences, increases the disincentives for these fishermen to fish illegally in Australian waters. Business Migration I turn now to the amendments which relate to business migrants who arrive in Australia. apThe Bill provides a legal framework to to implement two aspects of the Government's new business skills migration category, which . I announced on 17 December 1991. The first is a system of mandatory participation by business skills migrants in the monitoring of their business activities after their arrival in Australia. The second is the creation of a power for the Minister to cancel penn anent entry pennits and entry visas of business skills migrants after their arrival in Australia if they do not enter into business activities which meet the objectives of the category or make a genuine effort to do so. These provisions will apply to such migrants within their first three years after arrival in Australia. The Minister cannot cancel entry pennits or visas unless action is initiated"" within the three-year period. The provisions of the Bill relating to mandatory participation in monitoring introduce a requirement for business skills migrants to provide business related information and notification of changes of address after their arrival in Australia. There are financial penalties for non-compliance with these requirements .which are considered and fair. Payment of fines will not release migrants from the requirement to furnish information. I am confident that the information gathered will serve to confinn the value of this fonn of migration. It should minimise much of the criticism of business migration which has been prevalent, but largely unfounded, in recent years. Also, aggregated data from the monitoring will be available to help those involved in planning services to assist migrants in business. The individual information on migrants will of course be protected by the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988. The second part of these changes deal with the power to cancel entry pennits and visas. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts recommended that the new arrangements for business migration should not use a system of conditional visas. The Government accepted that recommendation. Nevertheless, it is appropriate for the Minister to have the power to deal with cases of serious abuse. This concept is incorporated in these provisions. Each business migrant acknowledges at the time of application that he or she understands the business objectives of the category and the expectation that they will make genuine efforts to comply with them. Additionally, each business migrant acknowledges that they and their family members' entry pennits may be cancelled if they do not meet the objectives of the program or make genuine efforts to do so. The Bill gives the Minister clear legislative indicators on which a decision is to be based if cancellation is being considered. The overwhelming majority of business migrants are not likely to be affected by the use of this power. Only those whose intentions are inconsistent with the objectives of the category need have any concern about its use. I do not anticipate that the power will be exercised on more than a few occasions. The Bill includes provisions which mean that the power cannot be used against a business migrant unless the Minister has notified him or her of the interition to do so within three years of the migrant's arrival in Australia. This provision allows business migrants tittle to make sensible business decisions. It also allows sufficient time for an assessment to be made that the business is likely to be of ongoing benefit. It also recognises that, as pennanent residents, business migrants should not be under the threat of cancellation indefinitely. There is a requirement for the Minister to consider any submission by or on behalf of the business migrant. The Bill provides for detenninative review by the AAT. These amendments relating to business migrants will help to ensure the successful operation of the business skills category of the migration program. The Bill will also maximise economic outcomes arising from it and provide the Government with a stronger information base from which to make decisions in future. This is achieved without placing unnecessarily onerous conditions on business skills migrants. Business migrants have proven skills of value to Australia. Their entry has the continuing support of government at all levels as well as of the business community. Finally, I will deal with some of the other, more minor, amendments to the Act. Section 20 (l)(d)(iii) The purpose of the Migration Act is to enable the Commonwealth to exercise its power to control certain persons or categories of persons who may lawfully enter and stay in this country. It has always been the intention of this Government, and previous governments before it, that this power should be exercised with the public interest in mind. One means of ensuring that the public interest is observed is to define those categories of persons whom it is undesirable to have stay in Australia. Such categories include persons who make false or misleading statements or produce bogus documents, or those with highly dangerous and communicable diseases, and those' persons with criminal records. Section 20 of the Migration Act defines these categories. That section requires persons falling within these categories to be recognised as illegal entrants unless the Secretary or his delegate excuses them. The amendment proposed to this section is in response to a Federal Court decision which has limited the power of the Commonwealth to decide who may enter and stay in Australia with regard to persons with criminal records. The intention of the Government has always been that a person who has committed a series of unrelated crimes which have resulted in that person being sentenced, in total, to a period of 12 months or more imprisonment should be categorised as a person to whom section 20 applies. The court decision, however, requires that this provision be interpreted very narrowly. It would apply only to a person in circumstances where there is a court order that several sentences of imprisonreview. ment are to be served consecutively so as to make up one continuous period of detention of at least one year. The amendment proposed to section 20 will make this long standing policy of the Government clear in the legislation and overcome the narrow interpretation of the court. The amendments will not operate retrospectively to apply to persons who have, pursuant to the decision of the Federal Court, been lawfully resident in Australia and whose circumstances meet those described in the amendment to section 20(1)(d)(iii). In respect of these persons who may be Â·outside Australia at the time of commencement of the amendment, they will not be caught by the amendment. In effect, the amendment will not apply to such persons in respect of any convictions which may have occurred before the commencement of the amendment. Amendments to Provisions Affecting Illegal Entrant Status The Bill will make a minor technical amendment to section 14 of the Act to remove unnecessary retrospectivity from the provision. If a person produces bogus documentation or makes misleading statements in respect of the grant of a further entry permit after entry to Australia that person will become an illegal entrant. That status is effective from the date of grant of that entry permit rather than from the date of entry to Australia as presently provided for in the Act. At present, a person to whom section 20 of the Act applies, for example, a person with a criminal record, becomes an illegal entrant upon entering Australia unless a properly endorsed valid entry permit is granted. That requirement is inappropriate in some cases, for example, when official guests of the Government visit Australia. Section 15 of the Act has been amended to allow the regulations. to exempt persons or classes of persons from the consequences of section 20. Review The Bill makes some minor amendments to the provisions relating to statutory merits The most important of these will permit a review authority to remit a case to the primary decision maker to be reconsidered in accordance with the review authority's directions. This amendment, which is supported by the Immigration Review Tribunal, should lead to speedier review decisions in many cases by eliminating unnecessary steps in the process where the review application is successful. The Migration Act has provisions under section 115 and section 137 which permit me to set aside a decision of an internal review officer and the Immigration Review Tribunal respectively, and substitute a more favourable decision. I am required to table a statement in parliament in each such case. Different tabling requirements were imposed under the two provisions because they were enacted at different times. The Bill seeks to amend section 137 to make the tabling requirements in that section identical with those in section 115. The other amendments remove a possible ambiguity relating to the time limits for making review applications. These amendments will ensure that visa applicants have adequate opportunity to seek review of unfavourable decisions.

240,Mr JULL,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"This Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill follows the Government's decision of August 1990 to phase out the airport local ownership plan by transferring all remaining Commonwealth airports to local ownership, thus making local communities responsible for the operation and maintenance of their aerodromes. In recent years the ALOP scheme has been funded by a loading of 3.01Oc per litre on aviation gasoline. The Government is quite proud of the fact that the transfer is now ahead of schedule. Whilst it was originally intended that the ALOP was to be finalised by 1994, we now know it will in fact be finished by June 1993. This is as a result of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in One Nation, in which an additional $25m was allocated to wind up the scheme. As previously agreed, the 3c levy was to be phased out as airports were transferred. The result of this Bill is that there will be an initial drop of lc per litre and a further drop of lc when the number of Commonwealth airports is reduced to 100. Ultimately the levy will be fully phased out by June 1993. With the South Australian airports now out of the ALOP scheme, and with others moving apace to withdraw, the aviation industry has been calling for the reductions and has expressed concern to me that so far nothing has happened. The principal concern was that the Commonwealth and the Government were collecting from the general aviation sector money for services which were no longer being provided. There was simply no longer a funding requirement to be paid for from the levy on avgas in the case of South Australia. n is little wonder that the aviation industry believes it is being treated as simply a source of revenue to fill the Government's coffers. This legislation is the beginning, and the Opposition will not oppose the Bill, but I must say 'the reduction of lc is small beer for an aviation industry which is fast entering a state of crisis. The Opposition is not against the transfer of airports; in fact, we encourage it. The efficiencies and competition that local ownership can bring are to be encouraged. They have the potential to boost regional economies and generate long awaited employment growth. Local ownership can bring benefits to a community. Look at the dominance that Cairns, for example, now has in the international aviation area. Cairns is the fastest growing international airport in Australia, despite what has been a most restrictive international aviation policy during the life of this Government. We can look at the strides that have been made in the development of Mackay, Rockhampton or Coffs Harbour airports since local communities took over these facilities. There are big plans to redevelop airports such as Broome or Port Hedland. In government, the coalition parties will ensure that these regional airports will be able to attract the traffic so that their regions can gain the benefit of a very liberal aviation regime. On the other hand, there are more than 200 other airstrips which will not be prime international, or even national, destinations. However, they do play a vital role in their communities, particularly in permitting medical evacuations or in providing basic air transport services. The Government has made no secret of the fact that with the tennination of the ALOP scheme it could not care less if some of these strips were forced to close as a result of this policy. While some aerodromes will receive tennination funds to bring them up to standard at the end of ALOP, others will get nothing. They will be forced by the Government to close. The Government would argue that there is a social subsidy available, but it is to relatively few airstrips, mainly in Aboriginal communities in the north of Australia. Dozens of local aerodromes, with or without the termination payments, will find it almost impossible to maintain these facilities in the medium tenn. They will be forced to close, and Australia will lose valuable aviation infrastructure, and many remote and regional areas will lose their aviation lifeline. Others, especially those with meagre scheduled services, will have to pass their costs on to commuter operators, who in turn will have to pass them on to passengers. What will be the impact of this if some operators the communities have to undertake that? Let us look at an example, the city of Portland in Victoria, where, to maintain the aerodrome, a charge of $35 to $37 per ticket, or per passenger movement, would have to be levied to meet the maintenance requirements. With a marginal service now, would an extra $70-odd on a return ticket to Melbourne be an attractive proposition to commuters? Obviously not. More likely than not, Kendall Airlines, which operates that route, would drop that service. There are a number of such examples. Lightning Ridge in New South Wales, which is already reeling, could not possibly hope to maintain that strip with a rate-paying population of just over 700. Yet Lightning Ridge is often used by the RAAF and for medical evacuations. There are dozens of full examples where this Government's scrapping of the ALOP scheme will be an absolute disaster. There are few examples which so starkly illustrate the difference in attitude between the Opposition and the Government in their approaches to this issue. The Government's position is clearly outlined in the 1990-91 annual report of the Department of Transport and Communications. Whilst the report concedes that not all aerodromes are commercially viable and that social benefit subsidies will be provided in certain cases, it should not be forgotten that this takes the form of a one-off payment at the time of withdrawal or transfer from ALOP. By phasing out the program by 1993 the Government is effectively saying, 'Take it or leave it'. Local communities which do not withdraw from the program by the cut-off date will simply be left out in the cold; there will be no further money available. Unfortunately, much of what the Government says is little more than empty rhetoric designed to cloud the real picture. The simple fact is that the Government has little regard for that part of Australia outside the major capitals. I would issue this warning: rural and regional Australia cannot be bought off with $25m from the Government that has done more to disadvantage these communities than any other government in recent history. Unfortunately for the Government, these in moves are seen for exactly what they are: simply an economic exercise designed to relieve the Government of having to provide the necessary infrastructure for our aviation industry. While supporting this Bill, and therefore the termination of ALOP, the Opposition recognises the absolutely vital role that aviation plays in regional, rural and remote Australia. That is why in recent weeks we have announced that, despite the end of ALOP, we are prepared, in government, to assist in basic maintenance of rural, remote and regional airports that are not viable under the regime established by this Government. As a community service obligation, we see that policy as essential to maintain basic aviation structures in these areas and, importantly, to cut the costs if these basic air services for all levels of the general aviation industry are to be maintained. We care about the bush, and our bona fides for the non-metropolitan aerodromes are well established. Earlier I said that Australian aviation crisis. The worse recession inÂ· 60 years, the rural downturn, drought and the high cost of aviation charges are helping to ensure that, far from being a world leader in aviation, we are now in a state of decline. The effect of this Bill to reduce the tax on avgas by 3c a litre by June 1993 will in fact do very little indeed to keep so many members of our general aviation community flying. . We can look at the CAA figures for 1991 to see what is in fact happening. For the purpose of the exercise let us look at the general aviation movements at secondary capital city airports: Archerfield in Brisbane is down by 13.4 per cent; Bankstown in the electorate of the Prime Minister is down by 14.7 per cent; Jandakot in Western Australia is down by 13.6 per cent; and Moorabbin in Victoria is down by 7.2 per cent. A report from the Civil Aviation Authority specifically states that cost pressures on general aviation dampen activity in this sector. A lc to 3c drop in avgas will not do too much to help, and that is exactly what this Bill will do. Might I also say that the Fightback package recognises the role of general aviation and its contribution to the Australian economy. It also recognises the enormous cost pressures that general aviation is under. That is why, rather than just give a lc to 3c reduction in avgas, as this Bill will do, we specifically recognise that the complete abolition of excise on avgas would really assist the industry. It is part of our consistent policy to cut business costs. The result of that exercise will be a reduction of a full 27c per litre for all avgas used for business purposes. The GST on all avgas used for business purposes is rebatable. For private and sporting aviation, even with the GST, the saving is a massive 19c per litre. Let us not forget the contribution that sporting and recreational aviation makes to the economy, not only in cash terms but also in technical terms for the development of the industry. Any sales taxes currently applied to aviation will be abolished, and again for all business is in aviation any GST to be applied. will be rebatable. We believe that this will be a real help and in many cases will be the difference between the success or demise of many general aviation operators, including those who provide regional passenger transport. It is very difficult for a number of our regional airlines to stay in business, especially in the depths of the depression wrought upon the nation by the present policies of the Government. In recent months this Government has proclaimed its concern for the aviation industry. However, that concern seems restricted to the glaring need to promote international tourism to Australia in an effort to generate employment opportunities. It in fact pays very little attention to the needs of other sectors of the aviation industry-regional airlines, charter operators, sports aviation and private aircraft owners. Senator Collins, with the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) barking at his heels, appears to be expending most of his energy on the creation of a new international aviation regime, and so he should, with the sale of Australian and part of Qantas and the entry of new operators into domestic aviation and the role of the CAA and the FAC. It is the remainder of the aviation industry that, frankly, is being neglected. Australian aviation is getting less support from the Federal Government but operators are being required to pay more and more. With the advent of corporatisation, both the CAA and FAC are increasingly subJected to the charge of remoteness from the industrythe very client which they should be serving. When either authority adopts a high-handed approach, it is not difficult to understand why resentment. within the industry mounts. I believe there is an urgent need for both bodies to regain the confidence of the aviation community. There is emerging evidence that much of this lack of confidence stems from the perceived inability of both bodies to restrict their financial impostS on the industry. Regrettably, the Government's approach to the whole question of ALOP and the future of regional and rural aerodromes does nothing to inspire confidence that this new leadership that we require is forthcoming. Not content to keep loading aviation with charges, the Government expects us to see the introduction of more legislation today that would land aviation with teris of millions of dollars to pay in the form of the aviation safety charges. I would once again in the House like to pay tribute to the Labor Caucus transport committee for the good work it did yesterday in throwing out a Bill and sending it back to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Cabinet, saying, 'You have got it all wrong. Look at it again'. I sincerely hope that that might be the last we see of this Bill prior to the next election. Already the aviation industry is in turmoil over this particular move, and we saw on Tuesday night a massive meeting at Bankstown in the electorate of the Prime Minister objecting to the imposition, or the would be imposition, of this charge. Aviation does have a most important role in our economic recovery. Australia does have a proud history in aviation. In a nation of sparse population and huge distances we rely on aviation not only for personal supplies and health care, but also in industry and for our national security, and in times of crisis. We look at what happened, for example, in the days of the Darwin cyclone and the role that aviation played then, and in the floods of last year in New South Wales and Queensland. I wonder whether or not under the Government's plan an airstrip such as Charleville, that was so vital, would remain in business. Why this Government seems to be hell-bent on pricing and charging whole sections of aviation out of business, frankly, is really beyond me. The Opposition does have a very real commitment to ensure support and growth of aviation, and in government we will be going far beyond the puny provisions of this Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill to make sure that we see the restoration of this most vital industry for all Australia.",135
241,Mr OKEEFE,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"I always enjoy listening to the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) on matters relating to aviation. I did enjoy hearing him tonight move from a discussion about the Government's plans to phase out a 3c a litre levy on avgas, through to the GST and, in particular, its impact on the aviation industry-in fact, its plans to remove fuel excise altogether. There were a few things that the honourable member for Fadden had to say about these proposals that I would like to pick up on. What puzzles me the most about his contribution, and I am not quite sure whether he really meant to say this, is that he seemed to be giving a commitment that, while supporting the Bill, he is actually opposed to the concept of continuing with the ALOP, the sale of local aerodromes, or the handing over of local aerodromes. In fact, I thought I heard him say during his contribution that the Opposition would not continue with this program, that it would instead continue to support these local aerodromes. Mr Jull-Non-viable aerodromes.",138
242,Mr OKEEFE,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"Non-viable aerodromes. I have great difficulty coming to grips with this concept when the Opposition's stated policy is to privatise airports, as I understand it. At the local level we are offering local ownership to non-viable airports. We are offering it on the basis that if people want to take it over, then they can run it. If they do not want it, we continue to have to work it through. That may mean that it stays under the ownership and control of probably the FAC until we find another answer. Nowhere in that is the Government proposing to actually flog the airports off, when in fact those opposite are. I want to go to some of the inconsistencies in this and tackle this question of the great saving to the industry of the fuel excise. Right through the GST package, the Fightback proposals that have been put together by the Opposition, is this so-called bait for industry that it will have a massive reduction in fuel costs. We have talked to the road transport industry and we haveÂ· said, 'You will be having this big reduction in fuel costs'. We have talked to farmers and said, 'You will be having this big reduction in fuel costs', knowing full well those farmers all get the full diesel rebateMr MCGauran-No, petrol.",138
243,Mr OKEEFE,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"No farmers use petrol. The honourable member knows that. InÂ· fact, I guarantee that on his farm everything that moves and walks and talks is converted to diesel so he can get the full diesel rebate. I would be amazed if anything on his faun other than a motor mower runs on petrol. That is only because he cannot buy a diesel motor mower. He would be getting the full diesel rebate on everything, I guarantee. Th:e point is that whatÂ· 'the Opposition conveniently moves past in this whole discussion of fuel rebates in aviation is the question of the GST on fares. I have not spoken to any people in any of the tourist locations around Australia, to any major airline operators or to any regional airline operators who think it is a real fun thing to tum around and say to their customers, 'Hey, under the Opposition's proposals, we are going to get a reduction in fuel price but you are going to pay 15 per cent more on your air fares'. I am afraid the travelling commuter that those opposite are talking about wanting to service does not think this is all that wonderful an equation either, and it is not. One of the problems that consumers have in coming to grips with all of this is the of the so-called reduction in business wholesale taxes that is meant to accompany the GST. They wonder whether they will actually receive it. They ask themselves: did the hotels pass on the cut in beer excise when the Federal Government dropped excise on beer about two years ago? Everybody knows the answer to that. Yes, finally they the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), went around and we had our price watch operations all around Australia focusing on the hotels that were not passing it on. What happened all during that exercise? Those opposite actually complained about our putting this pressure on the pubs. So we have to ask ourselves: what sort of commitment would those opposite, in government, have to actually making business pass on these discounts to the consumer? Did the banks pass on the interest rate cuts? Of course, everyone knows the answer. We have brought interest rates down 10 per cent in the last 18 months and we are still driving the banks to try to make them pass on those interest rate discounts to the customer. Again, we have not heard anything from those opposite about how bad these banks are. They just continue to criticise the Government for high interest rates when they know very well that the Government has brought the interest rate down 10 points. It is the banks in the community that have not passed it on. Again, where is the commitment to actually make business make it happen for the consumer? So I think everyone in the aviation industry is entitled to have a very big question mark on this proposal that there will be a reduction in fuel costs for airlines, coupled with a 15 per cent GST on fares, and, somehow, the consumers are going to get a benefit. It is nonsense, and we know it is nonsense. I raised earlier the question of privatisation. I had occasion to become a little bit excited about this issue earlier this year when the Committee for Melbourne, which, by the way, is chaired by the founer President of the Liberal Party, Mr Elliott, was pressing for the hand over and sell off of Melbourne Airport. The Victorian Government, in one of its less claim wise wanders down the policy road, thought this might be a good idea. My position on that issue was to say, 'No way known'. We are fine. Our airports are in a Federal structure. Something in the vicinity of $500m is being invested in those airport developments. We have an aviation policy did, after which is bringing togetherMr MCGauran-By whom?",139
244,Mr OKEEFE,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"By the Federal Airports Corporation and the Federal Government, which is committed to making these airports work for Australia. We are not the ones who made the decision during the 1960s and 1970s to put an airport where every State Premier stuck up his hand and said, 'I want an airport'. Â·If one flies into the west coast of the USA, one lands at either Los Angeles or San Francisco; If one flies into the east coast of Australia, one can take one's pick from all of these places. Mr MCGauran-Don't you want Melbourne Airport now? Mr OKEEFE....,...Of course I want it; it is there. The star point about Melbourne Airport is that we have finally unravelled the old two airline policy of those opposite. We have finally unravelled the separation between international and domestic traffic and we have said, 'Yes, the international airlines can merge their operations with the domestic airlines'. Which is the one airport in Australia that stands to gain the most from this-Melbourne Airport. That is the one place-with the exception of Darwin; I notice the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) is at the table and being a big advocate for Darwin he will know that Darwin is in this too-where the domestic terminal and the international terminal are still integrated. They are in the one building. It is the one place where people do not have to take a lO-minute taxi ride around the boundary of the airport in order to get from the international terminal to the domestic terminal. It is the one place that is really set to take offMr Snowdon-Apart from Darwin.",139
245,Mr OKEEFE,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"Apart from Darwin, it is the one place that is really set to take off under this new aviation policy. The investment that is being made in that airport reflects the kind of future it will have. It will be the major airport hub for the southern part of Australia, just as Sydney and Brisbane will evolve as the major international hubs for the central and northern parts of Australia. The point I am making is that the last thing one would do is flog off Melbourne Airport when it is at this point of operating profitably. Last year the airport made $28m, $26m of which was ploughed straight back into investment in infrastructure on the ground. There are $250m worth of capital works taking place right now. It is one of Melbourne's great success stories. In' my electorate, which features part of the airport, people are planning their working lives, their education and where they will live around the job opportunities available at the airport. In other words, important social policy affecting people's futures is geared around the operation of these airports. In that context, the last thing one would do is nog the airports off to John Elliott, or whoever in the private sector thinks he or she can run them. We know full well that there are major social concerns to be worked through and that airports are key job centres for many people. For instance, 10,000 people now work, in one form or another, at Melbourne Airport. That is predicted to increase to 20,000 people by the end of the decade. That is real action; that is the major job centre of the north-west corridor of Melbourne. There is no way known that an operation like that-which has so much important social policy built around it-could be privatised. But that is the position of those on the other side of the House. They want to take not the unprofitable ones, but those govemmentowned operations which are working very successfully at a profit and nog them off. But this certainly will not happen while I have anything to say about it-and I expect to have something to say about it for a long time yet. In terms of the legislation we are passing in the House tonightMr MCGauran-Good of you to talk about it.",140
246,Mr OKEEFE,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,It is interesting you raise that. My friend on the other side,140
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,Mr HolIis)Order! I ask the honourable member for Gippsland to stop interrupting. The honourable member for Burke might ignore the interjections and direct his comments through the Chair rather than across the chamber. The Parliamentary Secretary will hold his peace until he sums up.,140
248,Mr OKEEFE,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am suitably chastised. As you know, earlier in the debate the honourable member for Fadden, who is the aviation spokesman on the other side, spoke for 30 minutes. But in that contribution he spent no more than 2112 minutes on this legislation. He spent the rest of the time telling us how wonderful the Fightback package would be for aviation. I have tended to say, 'Okay, this is a small piece of legislation about a 3c per litre change in the avgas structures. So let's not spend too much time on that. Let's actually talk about the fact. that, under Fightback, people flying on aircraft will pay an extra 15 per cent on their tickets'. No matter how those opposite work that through, I do not see how anybody in the industry-be it those at the tourist destinations, on the major business commuter lines or on the regional lines-could think this is an exciting proposal. Of course it is not. The honourable member for Fadden also said ""that the Opposition will support the legislation. That really means that those opposite do not oppose it, because if they opposed it they would oppose it. They will support it. That is fine; they are supporting it because it is sensible legislation. The honourable member then went on to tell us all of these other things, including the little charmer that those opposite do not like what is actually happening under the ALOP program, but they will maintain it. In fact, they wi,l take it further: they want to flog off the airports. I am saying that under no circumstances will we stand by and see that happen to these valuable and profitable social assets which have been built by public funds under programs of public infrastructure. It is not even the fact that they are owned by the public sector which is the big deal; the big deal is that too many people base their lives around them. People live around airports, they work at airports and they pick up the skills which are associated with airports. There are too many social objectives associated with these airports to talk about privatising them and flogging them off to the public sector. That is something that those on the other side of the House just do not seem to understand. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for bringing me back to the point of the discussion and urging me to ignore the comments of my friend the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran). I think I have said just about all I need to say about this matter. Obviously I support the legislation. The Parliamentary Secretary laid out some very good reasons in his second reading speech as to why this legislation should be passed. The Opposition does not oppose it and I am happy to support it.",140
249,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"I could not possibly let the remarks of the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) go by without responding to them. It was a classic speech-once a socialist, always a socialist; once a commo, always a commo. Let us have a look at what he was trying to tell us. I will remind honourable members of some of his words.",141
250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,Mr Hollis)Order! I am loath to interrupt,141
251,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"I did not say he was a commo; I just said, 'Once a commo, always a commo'.",141
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,I actually find that personally offensive and I ask the honourable member for O'Connor to withdraw the implication contained in his comments so that we can get on with the debate.,141
253,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,I have already said that I did not call him a commo,141
254,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,I ask the honourable member,141
255,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"Once a comrade, always a comrade-you would call him that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I just want to get down to the fundamentals of his speech. The honourableÂ· member should stay for a minute and learn something. He said that we would sell only the profitable airports and not the unprofitable ones. ALOP just happens to be all about unprofitable airports-airports which are unprofitable, not through the inefficiencies we find in all government enterprises, but simply because they are providing a very infrequent service in remote areas. It is a service which is dramatically and drastically needed, but of course the traffic patterns are such that there will never be sufficient revenue-asking any price that is reasonable-to cover the costs. The honourable member for Burke does not understand about the responsibility of government and the responsibility of business. He prefers to keep the profitable enterprises and leave the social responsibility to I do know whom-the Phantom. That is where he is wrong and we are right. We have told this Parliament today that we will maintain a degree of ALOP simply to look after the social responsibility of government. We are all committed to looking after people who are unable to look after themselves, some of them because they cannot earn enough. We hear. plenty about that in this place. But there are others who choose to go out into very remote areas, produce money and take the responsibilities that go with it to help this economy. One day they will urgently need an aeroplane and there will probably be some little private operator who will provide the service, provided that it does not cost him $500 to land his aeroplane-and even that probably would not be enough. It is the responsibility of government to take on the unprofitable enterprises, provided they are efficient. But why in the heck should we be in the business of running Melbourne Airport? Why are all the jobs that the honourable member for Burke worries about going to disappear if they are fair dinkum jobs, if they are needed to run that airport efficiently? He paints the picture that one day Mr Elliott and his mates are going to spend hundreds of millions buying it and the next day they are going to close it down. That is the picture he painted to this Parliament tonight. He stands condemned for frightening the heck out of the people he is supposed to represent. There might be a few out there who have jobs that are featherbedded. That is no help anyone, themselves included. Nobody stands for that any more. If he is protecting that of job, he is not much help to the national economy and other people in it who need the services of government. But if he means that somehow or other privatisation of an airport is bad because it changes the boss and that boss has a profit motive and tries to generate efficiency, I do not know what he is about. If we listen to the rhetoric of his Leader, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on occasions-and if we can believe it-we must not doubt that he understands. Because that is what he was talking about. The legislation today is about accelerating the ALOP arrangements. We support that. Nevertheless, it is going to take some more taxpayers' dollars to do it. That was the other aspect of what the honourable member for Burke apparently does not understand. He is boasting about another $250m of public money being punched into an airport. We have the facade of the Federal Airports Corporation. We tell ourselves that it is not a government body, but there is nobody else in it. We may as well say Qantas is not a government body. But it is public money, as we discovered, that has to be continually fed into it-no risk money, just public, taxpayers' money. Is that a good idea? Of course, the honourable member for Burke threw away a good note. I have forgotten when he came into the Parliament, but on one of the occasions on which I voted with the Labor Party it was to stop Malcolm Fraser reintroducing the two-airline policy. I crossed the floor, something I have never seen him do in the interest of his own constituents. I did not believe in the two-airline policy. Philosophically, I am opposed to it. When this Government started to move in the deregulation direction, I applauded it, until I found out what it was up to. It was another facade. It was not for real. Yes, the airlines can now be competed with. All the new ones have to do is find somewhere to park their aeroplanes and pick up their passengers! It is an outrageous arrangement. The very thing that we are talking about today is airports and airport terminals. The to Government is saying, 'Yes, buy your 50 aeroplanes and put on good services for the sort public of Australia, Mr Compass or Mr Jones . or someone else, but don't you dare try to park alongside one of the terminals originally financed with government money. You can't have equal go there. Our old mates Australian and Ansett have that all stitched up by a special agreement'. There is deregulation one talking day and re-regulation the next. I remember when I had a shadow ministerial responsibility and we looked at the plans for the new airport terminal at Alice Springs. I was able to point out to the Parliament, at some embarrassment to the Government, that there was going to be no third airline into Alice Springs. We were building a brand new government-funded airport terminal. All the plans were there. There was to be an Ansett counter, an Australian counter; an Ansett baggage carousel, an Australian baggage carousel. There was no arrangement for anyone else. I am fortunate that one of the radio commentators in Alice Springs picked that up. He had a few words to say. I think he was a bit put out that a major tourist destination such as Alice Springs was not entitled to a third competitor. There was all this talk by the Government about how it was going to deregulate. It knew that it had to deregulate. It knew that the public would be pulling pickets off the fence. But it did not want to deregulate too far. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, say that our mate over there is not a socialist or whatever else I said about him-I will not repeat it-but the simple fact is that he does not understand. He is not really committed to what he says he is. He is silly; plainly silly. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) has just walked back into the chamber. Does he have anywhere for that third airline at Alice Springs yet? He could not do anything about it. He could not do a thing for the people he claims to represent. I had to stand in this Parliament and tell the people of Alice Springs how little consideration was being given to them. Mr Snowdon-They know all about you, brother.",141
256,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,I bet they do. They will invite me back time and again too. I could get a bigger crowd to listen to me in Alice Springs than the honourable member for the Northern Territory could get in a month. I would get more people to listen to me than the honourable member would if he called a meeting of the wharfies.,143
257,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"Order! We will get back to the Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary will remain silent. The honourable member for O'Connor will get back to the Bill. We do not care how many people he can get in Alice Springs or anywhere else. We are more interested in the aviation fuel revenues Bill. I have allowed a very wide-ranging debate. I think I have allowed it to be too wide-ranging, so we might get back to the Bill that we are debating this evening.",143
258,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"I am sure that when you check the Hansard tomorrow morning, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be surprised. With these little forays, I am just reminding certain members of parliament that it is their responsibility to represent their constituents and get them the sort of airport terminal that they would like so that cut-price operators can bring the tourists that they need. Mr Snowdon-I'll tell you what, brother: come and visit our airport any time you like.",143
259,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,Order! The Parliamentary Secretary will remain silent.,143
260,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"Yes, I will go to the dog show too. I think that when you check the Hansard, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will find that I have been talking about airports in particular because I have in fact been responding to the honourable member for Burke and his comments about airports. In particular, I have been responding to his comments about Melbourne Airport which, of course, is not subject to ALOP, although in our view it probably should be. This is the most remarkable thing about it. Our major airports, of which the honourable member for Burke claims we have too many, will continually be funded by government. But the smaller ones, where people are struggling, are to be dumped onto the local community. That is really what this legislation is about. The honourable member for Burke also raised the hardy annual, the subject of simple arithmetic-and that is not surprising, I guess-which says that a GST adds 15 per cent to the cost of an airline ticket. However, simple arithmetic does not point out that the excise, which this legislation clearly says is 24.7c a litre, is to be progressively reduced by 3c a litre, making it 21.7c a litre. Three cents a litre is to come off the cost of operating airlines, which are very big consumers of fuel. I am unable to tell the Parliament just what percentage of the operating costs of airlines fuel represents, but it is significant and could be as high as 20 or 30 per cent. When it comes off, of course, there will be a substantial fall in the price of tickets. The prices airline tickets will fall through a combination of lower prices and the removal of the sales tax on just about everything an airline buys, including the packaging which is involved with their meals. When all those costs are removedMr MCGauran-And the payroll tax.",143
261,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"and payroll tax is abolished, it is probable that, even with a 15 per cent tax on the cost of the ticket, it will not cost as much as it did before. The honourable member for the Northern Territory should have tourism with a capital T in his mind, because it is probably one of the best financial options for his constituents. When they realise that the fuel people use to drive their vehicles into his huge area will be so much cheaper that people can afford to take those longer journeys, he should be in there cheering. Mr Snowdon-There are no roads. How will they get the roads?",144
262,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,The honourable member should worry about roads in due course. Mr Snowdon-Who will pay for the roads?,144
263,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"If the honourable member cannot get roads for his own people, he is not much of a member of parliament. Mr MCGauran-I raise a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, I really must draw your attention to the behaviour of the Parliamentary Secretary. It is quite intolerable that he is allowed to interject at will.",144
264,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"I have noticed that the honourable member for Gippsland throughout this debate has greatly assisted the honourable member for O'Connor by making comments. The honourable member for Gippsland will know that all interjections are out of order. Perhaps if he had not provoked the Parliamentary Secretary by assisting the honourable member for O'Connor, the Parliamentary Secretary would not have interjected. So we might just get back to the debate and cease all interjections on both sides of the table. I will be much firmer on them.",144
265,Mr TUCKEY,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I might add that being a politician of who has been around for a while, I can always stand an intelligent interjection; and I would like one of those to turn up before the debate is over. It is a fact that this ALOP arrangement has over time-and it was commenced under a Liberal governmentdemonstrated that bit by bit local communities can handle airports. Where the traffic is reasonable in towns such as in Geraldton in my electorate the local authorities have almost found it profitable to be involved. I well remember that in the case of Albany, which is not part of my electorate now, the shire and the town fought over who had responsibility for looking after the airport. The shire happened to have the airport within its boundaries and the shire president sat down and worked out that he could even make a small profit. He was a very smart man, because the town constantly complained about his residents using its library and all the facilities that the town supplied. After that he said, 'Well, don't you complain; I am supplying you the airport'. In fact, he was getting reasonable revenue from the airport, but because, I repeat, Albany is a fairly substantial population centre. That does not alter the fact that the honourable member for Burke raised the various problems that he perceived with our policies, in particular the application of the goods and services tax. I have pointed out a couple of times some of the interjections we have had from the honourable member for the Northern Territory. I represent an area of Western Australia that is sparsely populated. It takes 220,000 square kilometres to gather up 70,000 voters; in the case of the Northern Territory, it would probably be 500,000 square kilometres. It is in these areas that, firstly, we need ALOP and, secondly, we do not want taxes .on fuels for aircraft or motor vehicles. I am astounded to hear members of the Labor Party who represent the isolated areas, particularly of Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia, bucketing a proposal that would take 19c to 26c a litre off the price of fuel, be it for a motorist or for a pilot landing at one of these ALOP airports. I am also astounded when those honourable members stand up and criticise the package which says that people whom they represent typically get higher wages, not because they are substantially better off, but because they need those additional wages to meet the cost of living in those remote areas. Those people will be the biggest beneficiaries of the Fightback tax package. It is amazing that those members who really and truly have a constituent responsibility to see that their constituents get a little bit of help with their remote area airports because it becomes financially impossible to sustain them do not want the cut in fuel prices, although their constituents will benefit the most. Those members know that the wages paid in their districts are higher, so, of course, their constituents are forced into higher tax brackets, yet they criticise a policy that alters those things. I find that amazing because, as I have demonstrated in this place, I have always been prepared to put the welfare of my constituents above any commitment of any other nature. If we cannot come to this place with that responsibility, it is pretty rotten. When people vote for us. in the constituent base that we have, with separate electorates, they expect that we will first represent their interests. This is the real question mark about what is happening because of this legislation, which, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Burke, we do not oppose. It is still part of a policy we support. Suddenly the Prime Minister has had a conversion on tariffs. He does not think he ever told John Laws that he was going to get rid of them altogether. We do not believe the Government should get rid of ALOP support altogether; that is all. That stands in contrast to the Government. There is a point at which we say stop because there is a group of airports, some of which are clearly not included in this hundred that are yet to go, where the local demand will not allow these things to happen. In my final couple of minutes I want to touch on another aspect of airports. Today I have had a telephone call from people in Western. Australia-farmers in my electorate-to tell me that they have had some spare parts airfreighted over by IPEC into Western Australia in an airfreight container and that the container has been stolen from Perth Airport. No-one knows where it .is. It has not been stolen by someone who wants to sell the spare parts. I might add that these people have just had rain, they are trying to do something for the nation and themselves by planting a crop, but because of the lack of spare parts they cannot do it. This particular container has been stolen-whisked away-as a result of an industrial dispute. The worse side of it is that they rang up the police about this. This container has been taken away by a union-I think the Transport Workers Union-because somebody in IPEC got the sack last week. The union has said, like big kids, 'We'll give it back to you when you reinstate this person'. My constituents went to all the police about this-I will not tell honourable members the words that they used when they said how the police dealt with them-but it was not to 'buzz off'. I sent a fax to the Commissioner of Police in Western Australia today asking him what he is going to do about it. I can tell honourable members what he had better do. If that container has been removed from the airport, as I am advised, and if he does not do something about it, he had better not complain again that 'politicians interfere in the way the police try to administer the law'. I have always stood behind the Western Australian police. At times they have some difficult decisions to make and I give them support, because I say that if the law is there, they should apply it-not on the basis of a trade union or someone else, not on the basis of race, not on the basis of anything else, but on the basis of the law. We have the situation in Perth today that I have outlined. I might add that these fuel strikes in airports have also added to delays. in people getting necessary parts and,equipment to carry out their farming exercise. It is a pity, because in the end it will cost the nation and will, of course, generate more job losses to add to the million already. These are other matters that need to .be considered in this place. I hope the Commissioner of Police over there has got the message. I hope he is out doing something about it, because otherwise he deserves condemnation if the facts that I have put to him are correct. The only excuse I will accept is that the goods never left the airport. I know how industrial disputes work. (TIme expired) ' Mr TRUSS (Wide Bay) (9.08 p.m.)-The coalition parties are not opposing this Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill 1992, but this debate does give us an opportunity to lament the passing of the aerodrome local ownership plan. That plan has served Australia well now for about two decades. It has helped considerably to provide and to maintain the necessary infrastructure to support aviation, particularly in rural and provincial areas. This Bill reduces aviation tax for just purpose, and that is because the Government is choosing to opt out of its responsibilities under the aerodrome local ownership plan. It can reduce the tax because it is going to reduce expenditure on local airports. Under the aerodrome local ownership plan, ownership of airports was transferred to local bodies, usually the local authority, but under the arrangements the Commonwealth undertook to make a 50 per cent contribution to approved maintenance and development costs into the future. That arrangement has worked very well and has been accepted by the majority of Australian airports. I am told in 1988-89 there were 363 licensed aerodromes in Australia, arid 277 of them were in the aerodrome local ownership plan. Some of the balance were Commonwealth owned airports in capital cities which did not really fit the mould for the ALOP. The program has been very well accepted. There has been' some local cost. Local communities were expected under the program to meet 50 per cent of the costs of all projects under the scheme. They were obliged to meet that cost, but I think that was a worthwhile aspect of the program because it ensured that the projects which were undertaken had local support. The fact that so many community ,councils and so many local organisations were supportive of the .aerodrome local ownership plan is a clear demonstration of the fact that it was good and working well for Australia. In recent times, particularly since the arrival of the current Government, the program has been starved of funds and there has been a tendency to use what little money has been allocated for some big ticket items, particularly luxury terminal buildings in provincial cities where the Government was trying to pick up a marginal electorate. Nonetheless, the scheme has provided assistance to most of the rural and provincial airports throughout Australia. The Australian Airport Owners Association, which represents the major non-metropolitan airports in Australia-some 85 of them-has always been a strong supporter of ALOP and has bitterly criticised, and rightly so, the Government for its proposals now to axe the one program. The fifty-fifty contribution scheme demonstrates the very best way in which a government can deal with communities: supporting those which are prepared to help themselves. Therefore, I think it is most regrettable that the Government has decided to walk away from its responsibilities to rural and provincial aviation and to abandon this scheme. As I mentioned earlier, there were a few problems. As with every program, there is never enough money to go around and there. are always calls for extra funds. In particular, that the Government's handling of the program was inconsistent, and there was a lack of certainty by' airport owners as to what funds were likely to be available to them. The ' heavy hand of government bureaucracy was always present in this scheme and the administration costs were obviously weighing it down as well. In particular, the Department of Transport and Communications seemed to show little regard for local priorities. As a chairman of a local authority who was involved with the aerodrome local ownership plan before I came to this place, I was conscious of the fact that the projects that were important to us were rarely the ones the Department was prepared to fund, yet some of the things that were important to the Department did not seem of great significance to either the local community or the local airport users. This kind of frustration with the program was fundamentally the reason why the Cairns Port Authority, the local owner of the Cairns Airport, chose to withdraw from the scheme altogether. Cairns, of course, has gone on to become the success story of the Australian airport scene. It has certainly encouraged, through its own entrepreneurial approach, access to Cairns for international airlines, also the tremendous growth in domestic traffic. Cairns was one of the major beneficiaries of the competition created by Compass and its airport has grown extensively. However, the success of Cairns since it has left the ALOP cannot be seen as a model for other Australian airports. It is unrealistic to expect that Eulo, Chinchilla or Wondai, or any other similar airport, could expect such spectacular success, no matter what entrepreneurial spirit they chose to direct to the management of their airports. The fact is that Cairns is a new and major gateway to Australia. That opportunity is not available to most of the other 277 Australian airports in the aerodrome local ownership plan. Those airports do not have the opportunity for enormous expansion that was available to Cairns. In August 1990 the Government announced that it would axe the ALOP. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support at the time, Senator Bob Collins, in his aruiouncement, attempted to gild the lily. He described in his press state-ent of 21 August that what the Government was going to do was to invite local communities 'to take over the management and operation of Commonwealth aerodromes in their own areas'. Those that were already under local ownership were to be encouraged 'to take over full responsibility for aerodromes now jointly funded by the Commonwealth under the ALOP'. But the real message of the press release was the boot that came at the end of it, where the Minister went on to say: For those ALOP aerodromes where the offerthe offer that the Government was going to makeis not accepted by local owners, the Commonwealth will consider ceasing funding support. 'Consider' !The Government had already announced that it was going to axe it entirely. So the clear question for the airports was that either they took the deal which the Government offered them or they would get no money anyhow. In other words, either they took the poison or the Government would shoot them. There was no attempt whatsoever and by the Government to negotiate arrangements with any of the local owners. It merely announced that the program was ending, not because the local communities wanted it to go, but because the government could not care less about country people, country airports and provincial cities and their aviation needs. In announcing the end of the program, the Government indicated that there would be some kind of continuing subsidy program-a social benefits scheme. There were to be basically six categories of airports. There were those that were considered to be viable, which naturally were to receive no subsidy. Then four categories of social subsidy were to be made available, ranging from 100 per cent down to 25 per cent. The very largest group comprised airports which were not viable but were not going to be given any money by the Government anyhow. As one of the previous speakers mentioned tonight, in my own State of Queensland nearly all of the airports that are to receive the 100 per cent subsidy are on Aboriginal communities-but not all of the Aboriginal communities. Bamaga was considered to be viable, and it is not to get any subsidy at all. When we look at the airports that are to get a 100 per cent, 75 per cent, 50 per cent or 25 per cent subsidy, it is impossible to understand the logic of the classifications. The Government devised a curious point system, which was very subjective and seemed to be designed to justify the Government's giving subsidies to whichever airports it chose. So we have quite ridiculous situations in which airports such as those at Dalby, Goondiwindi, Middlemount and Miles were entitled to a 25 per cent subsidy, but airports in places such as Aramac, Dirranbandi and Eulo were to get nothing. Several cities such as Gympie and Redcliffe were classified as non-viable airports but still get nothing at all. Let us look closely at those airports classified as viable. In my electorate, all of the airports were classified within the various groups that are to get no subsidy at all-but for opposite reasons. Two of them were considered to be viable and therefore are not getting any subsidy. The other three were cons-dered not viable but still are not getting any subsidy. There does not seem to be any logic in that kind of an approach. How do we possibly understand the Government's viability test? Maryborough and Hervey Bay were the two airports in my electorate which were classified as being viable. Maryborough was a wartime airport and so has quite extensive facilities which are in reasonably good condition: Its terminal building is an old fibro Army hut. Hervey Bay, on the other hand-one of the fastest growing cities in Australia, with a population now over 30,OOO-has an inadequate runway, no cross-runway at all, and its terminal building is a demountable structure. There have been local proposals to build a new joint airport. The needs of Hervey Bay city will require additional airport facilities before many years pass by. The cost of this sort of a venture is likely to be in the order of $20m. Currently Maryborough and Hervey Bay would move about 30 passengers a day in and out on the regular passenger services. How is a city expected to collect sufficient revenue from that number of passengers to make this airport viable? After all, the Commonwealth Government itself cannot make most of the capital city airports run at a profit. We only have to read the report of the Federal Airports Corporation to realise that most of the airports under its control are not profitable; yet this Government is telling small provincial cities that their airports-let alone the airports in those small country towns that are on the list-are expected to be viable. How will Eulo make a profit out of running its airport? How can it possibly expect to fund the operation of its airport? What about Gympie, Kingaroy and Wondai in my own electorate, none of which have regular passenger services at the present time, but which are all very important for their local communities? The Gympie airport serves an urban population of about 20,000 people, and this Government is telling those people that they do not need an airport. There is no capacity to collect landing fees, and that applies to most of the airports in this non-viable list. The Government is suggesting that the towns should collect money from things such as passenger surcharges-not very helpful if there is no passenger service-and concessions. I have not noticed the car rental companies queuing up to take space at the airport at Dysart, Injune or Innisfail, because there is no chance of making any money there. Noone wants to sell ice-creams or to open up a canteen at those sorts of airports, yet that is what this Government is suggesting airports should do to pay their costs. What about rentals for aircraft and that sort of thing? Clearly, if one airport rents out its space, people will go to another place. The clear answer is that the only way in which those airports can be kept operating is if the ratepayers pick up the tab. I notice the former Minister for Local Government, now the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin), is here. I am disappointed that she was not prepared to stand up for local government, which is left carrying the baby of maintaining airports around Australia because this Government has walked away from its responsibilities in that regard. In the One Nation statement the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that the Government would speed up theÂ·finalisation of the aerodrome local ownership plan. Now the Government is in the process of picking off the airports, one by one, breaking the agreements that it made with the local owners at the time the airports were handed over. Let us not forget that. In each case when these airports were handed over to the local owners, there was an agreement made with those local owners that the Commonwealth would continue to fund maintenance and other approved development works. In some cases that was by way of exchange of correspondence; but in other cases it was by way of a formal contract, a contract that the Government is now walking away from, dishonouring the word that this Government and previous governments have given over previous years. The Government is not walking away entirely. If the airports want to remain operating, they will have to continue to get a licence. If the airports are not maintained at a reasonable standard, they will not keep the licence. The Government, while walking away from any financial responsibility to maintain airports, is still, naturally enough, requiring that the airports be kept to a high standard so that any aircraft wishing to use them can be guaranteed the ability to land in safety. There will be local ownership. The Government will pay nothing, but will still set the standards the new local owners to abide by. Small communities can never afford to maintain or to upgrade their own airports. A newall-weather runway costs between $lm and $5m. Just to reseal an existing runway will cost at least a quarter of a million dollars-more than the entire rate collection for some of the rural shires that are being handed back their airports by the Commonwealth Government now. While country people are expected to do without, city people have hundreds of millions of dollars spent on lavish new airport facilities. One Badgerys Creek would fund the needs of all of the rural and provincial airports of Australia for decades. Indeed, the Government is clearly adopting double standards. The Prime Minister talked about one nation, but he is prepared to offer facilities and a standard of airport maintenance and aircraft services in cities while, at the same time, he walks away from previously existing responsibilities in rural areas. One Nation boosted expenditure on rail and city airport facilities, but it slashed expenditure and walked away entirely from an obligation towards people who need air services in rural or provincial areas. Of course, .rural aviation, like all of the aviation industry, has been a significant contributor to tax revenue. The Australian Airport Owners Association estimated that less than 50 per cent of the tax revenue that the Government collects from aviation is actually spent on rural and provincial aviation. While the legislation before the House will reduce the amount of tax collected, it also signals significant reductions in the amount of expenditure for rural and provincial aviation. Rural and provincial airports are essential elements of our national transport infrastructure. They are vital for communications purposes. They are vital especially in times of emergency. In my own electorate the airports in Maryborough, Hervey Bay and Gympie were the only means of getting to those cities, with populations totalling 70,000, during the recent floods. The Government has taken flooding into account in setting its points test. However, the towns have to be isolated for for continuous periods of four weeks in every year before qualifying for consideration under the flooding criterion. I tell honourable members that a lot can happen and a lot of people can get sick in four weeks. Yet the Government is not prepared to take account of short term flooding needs. Whenever the opportunities arise Government Ministers in VIP aircraft are only too happy to fly into land at these airports which they are not prepared to assist in funding, but they are not prepared to provide basic servicing facilities to ensure that they are there when emergencies occur: when the flying doctor needs to arrive; when the air ambulance needs to land. This Government thinks it has no responsibility whatever to assist in providing financial support to ensure that those airport facilities are made available. In its considerations the' Government is ignoring the importance of rural export ,industries, which make up about 60 per cent of our total exports. Our top 10 export industries come from the rural areas or the mining industries, all of which are dependent upon previously ALOP airports for basic servicing and for their airport needs. Clearly, this Government is walking away from the needs of rural areas and allowing a national asset to waste away. Fortunately, the coalition recognises the importance to Australia of air services. This is a vast land with a sparse population. We have a social responsibility to support the local ownership plan and not to permit the asset that has been built up around Australia over generations to waste away. This is not an expensive program. The most that has been spent on ALOP maintenance in any year was about $9m. The Prime Minister can rush off in a VIP aircraft to the football. Were he to spend that amount of money on local airports, he would maintain and meet many of the essential maintenance needs so that one day he might actually be able to visit some of the country towns of Australia in his VIP aircraft. The way he is moving at. the present time there will be no airports at which he can land whenever he chooses to go to areas outside capital cities. The coalition will continue a subsidy program for essential maintenance. We will ensure that essential airport facilities are retained. I hope that not too many of the airports in Australia will be allowed to degenerate beyond repair before there is a change of government and an opportunity to ensure that the ALOP, the program that has meant so much to Australia, can be continued in a meaningful and useful way so that country people too will have a continuing availability of air services and air facilities.",144
266,Mr SNOWDON,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (9.28 p.m.)in reply-Before I address the myriad of outrageous claims that have been made by some members of the Opposition, most of which have absolutely nothing to do with the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Amendment Bill, I might add, I would remind the House of what this legislation is about and what this debate should have been about. The purpose of the amendments to the legislation is to permit the phasing out of the collection of that proportion of avgas duty that is currently attributed to the Department of Transport and Communications aerodrome cost recovery program. I do not think I heard the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) mention it once. The current rate of duty on avgas is 27.480c per litre, of which 3.01Oc is attributable to aerodrome cost recovery purposes. The balance of the duty is attributable to cost recovery for aviation functions carried out by theÂ· Civil Aviation Authority. I think that is important. I would like honourable members in the House, particularly the honourable member for Wide Bay, to remember that, because later in my speech I want to come to the outrageous assertions that have been made by him and some of his colleagues. This legislation enables the 3.01Oc to be phased out, while retaining the existing level of revenue entitlements that the Civil Aviation Authority has under the present Act. The Bill will allow immediate amendment to the customs and excise tariffs to provide a lc reduction in the avgas duty. A further lc reduction in the avgas duty will take place when the combined number of Commonwealth aerodromes and ALOP aerodromes is reduced to 100. The final component of duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program is scheduled to be removed in June 1993. As I said in the second reading speech, the Bill is a tangible reflection of the benefits which are flowing to the general aviation , industry from the Government's aviation reforms-in particular its policies on aerodrome local ownership. I will come to the honourable member for Wide Bay shortly, but I want to deal firstly with the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who does not seem to have a very good understanding at all of what this legislation is about. He made a statement in his speech about the aerodrome which services his electorate-and I assume he was talking about Bendigo. What he ought to know is that the Bendigo Aerodrome Committee is currently negotiating, as part of the Victorian Municipal Aerodromes Operators Association, a group withdrawal from ALOP. Negotiations started today with the Department of Transport and Communications, and I might say that some very reasonable proposals have been put to the Department by these people. It is hoped that negotiations over the Bendigo airport will be concluded before the end of the financial year. The honourable member omitted to mention that. His fairyland contribution to the debate is made all the more fairyland by a statement he made about what the aerodrome is capable of doing. He said: The airport is quite capable of handling some large aeroplanes. In fact, Prince Charles and Princess Diana visited Bendigo in an RAAF aircraft, which was equivalent to about a 707 size aircraft. I have got news for him. The Bendigo aerodrome is 1,100 metres in length and it is 18 metres wide. The maximum take-off weight of any aircraft from that aerodrome is 5,700 kilograms. The lightest take-off weight for a 707 is 71,000 kilograms. It needs.2,000 metres to land a 707, not 1,100. So, when the honourable member comes into this House parading his knowledge of his, own aerodrome, he ought at least come with the facts. As I said, I guess one could say that in this instance he has had a complete flight of fancy, because that is exactly what it was. He has also made some assertions which indicate again that he has no understanding at all-and I might say this permeates through the Opposition ranksMr Carlton-Who?",150
267,Mr SNOWDON,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"The honourable member for Bendigo. He was here yesterday. He has spoken in the debate. If the honourable member followed the debate and read the Hansard, he would know. I often read them. I am riveted to Hansard. The honourable member for Bendigo also made the assertion that the announcements made by the Government. in One Nation in relation to $26m additional for ALOP is revenue neutral. He said, 'The Government is going to rip it off them from avgas, anyway'. I take honourable members back to what I said earlier in my contribution-that the final component of duty in terms of this aerodrome cost recovery program will be removed in June 1993, but that Qnce we move that amount attributable .to the D-partment of Transport and Communications, or to the Government, the remainder is for the <,:osts of running civil aviation and goes to the Civil Ayiation Authority. The $26m that has been referred to comes off budget. It does not, never did and never was anticipated to come from these aerodrome users. That is another fact which needs to be understood by the Opposition: The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull)-who at least I would have thought quite would have had a better understanding of this piece of legislation-made similar erroneous assertions. I want to emphasise that, once we remove the component of the avgas excise by June 1993, the remainder will be used for a range of air traffic flight services provided to the aviation industry by the Civil Aviation Authority. I note-and I think this is important, and this was referred to in the debate this evening by one of the members of the Opposition-that the Fightback! document, so proudly being touted by the Opposition, states that the whole avgas excise will be removed. It is a lot like the other assertions in that package. It does not tell us how these very necessary services, currently directly funded by the excise on avgas and given over to the Civil Aviation Authority for its functions, will be funded without the excise. It is like a lot of other things in the Fightback package. Those opposite have no idea in the world as to how these facilities, required by the general aviation community, will be funded. Will they be using, perhaps, Monopoly money? What creative accounting ventures will they use to pay for these services which are currently provided by the Civil Aviation Authority? We have heard the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) talk about the massive gains supposed to go to the tourism industry as a result of the removal of this excise which those opposite propose under the Fightback strategy. That shows very clearly a lack of understanding and a lack of any real appreciation or knowledge of the aviation industry because, as the honourable member for O'Connor ought to know, the overwhelming majority of tourists fly on avtur aircraft-a fuel on which there is no excise. I would have thought even the honourable member for Wide Bay would appreciate that point. Goodness knows why the honourable member for O'Connor even bothers to participate in some of these debates. I will have to pick him up on one point because it relates exactly to the sort of thing I have been saying about civil aviation. He even made some outrageous assertions in relation to road transport, and what a boon it would be to thl'. Australian community in terms of their <1ttitude to the excise on fuel on the road transport industry. What he has not told usand we have yet to get it from those opposite-is how they intend to raise the $1,200m identified in the Fightback package to pay for road construction. What they also say in their Fightback package is that they are committed to user 'pays and to a road user charge. I ask those opposite to take them in tandem and see the logic of this position. Here we have an Opposition, which is committed to the idea of full cost recovery and user pays, now saying that it will remove charges which currently apply to both the road transport and general aviation industries, but there will still be roads, and services still be supplied by the Civil Aviation Authority. The very next question is: who will pay if we do not have some sort of - ser pays system? The honourable member for O'Connor also mentioned-and I am sure you will not mind my referring to this, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - the matter of the Alice Springs airport. I do not think that I have ever been prouder than the day I stood in front of the Alice Springs terminal and opened it. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, what a valuable asset that particular airport, run and owned by the FAC, is to the people of Central Australia. This 'galah who hails from somewhere in Western Australia-God knows where and I do not know how they put up with him-says to us that there is something wrong with this airport. I tell the honourable member for O'Connor that very few communities-in fact, I would be so bold as to say no community in Australia of an equivalent size-would have anything like the standard of facilities currently provided in Alice Springs. It is a facility that is given a great deal of status our community and one of which they are justifiably proud. I would invite the honourable member for O'Connor to come to Alice Springs. I am sure he would get a crowd. They would regard him as a monkey in a cage and they would pay to see him, because he is a fool. I guess that is a bit disparaging. It is something that I would not normally say about someone. But in this instance I have to say that I would be prepared to sell the tickets to see the oddity, because that is exactly what he is. The honourable member comes in here and masquerades as a member of parliament and acts as a clown, not only in Question Time but also in these debates.",151
268,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,Mr Hollis)Order! I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to restrict himself to the use of parliamentary terms.,152
269,Mr SNOWDON,AVIATION FUEL REVENUES,"I will tone it down, Mr Deputy Speaker. I just want to make the point will that the contribution of the honourable member for O'Connor to this debate was, as one would expect, in terms of his normal standards. It is a bit of a shame. I dislike inten. sely'the fact that 'someone who would know very little about the electorate of the Northern Territory can make the sorts of assertions that he has and get away with it. I do not believe he ought to be able to. The fact is that these amendments are warranted. I am sure the aviation industry welcomes them .. ""fonight's contributions from those opposite highlight the contradictions that are inherent within the Fightback package and their assertions about full cost recovery. On the one hand, they are saying user pays but on the other hand they are saying that they will provide some sort of social benefit. I ask those opposite to tell us how they intend. to pay for it. I suggest to them that, instead of coming in here with what I regard as a forked-tongue approach to this issue, they ought to be straight with us. The Opposition ought to tell the people of Australia how it intends to raise the funds to pay for these services. The fact is that it has not indicated in any way-nor has it tried to clarify its by position to the satisfaction of the Government, or anyone else for that matter.,-that it has any idea aboutÂ· how these services should be provided. ., Question resolved in the affirmative.

270,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Bradfield) (9.45 p.m.)The Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1992 amends 28 Acts for the purpose of updating provisions relating to superannuation as a consequence of the Superannuation Act 1990 and amendments made to the Superannuation Act 1976. The Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives some time ago. One of the questions the Opposition needs to ask is: why is it that these enactments are being introduced tonight when in fact the legislation was first introduced in 1990, two years ago? The Department of Finance claims that the reasons for the delay were due to administrative and drafting priorities within Attorney-General's Department. This demonstrates yet again the problems the Government is obviously having in getting its legislation drafted in any reasonable sense of time or priority. In regard to the need for transitional arrangements, however, it has been demonstrated since that time that there have apparently been no cases in which people have fallen within the provisions of the Act, which I think is a rather amusing situation. Nevertheless, the legislation was important because it provided initially establishment of the public sector superannuation scheme. In 1990, of course, a new superannuation scheme was introduced for Commonwealth employees which became effective on 1 July 1990. It replaced what was previously known as the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. These amendments are backdated effectively to that period to bring them into line with the closing date for any new entrants to the CSS. Due to the delay in bringing these amendments to the Parliament, the Bill provides for transitional or savings provisions to four Acts so that any action that might inadvertently have been taken that is inconsistent with the amendments will not be invalidated. This legislation presents us with the opportunity to discuss in the wider context the role of public sector superannuation, as well as the whole question of superannuation policy. It is worth noting that the new arrangements were run by the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust. Its annual report for 1991 demonstrates quite clearly that the administration of the trust is responsible for the contributions of some 200,000 public servants, worth approximately $9 billion. It is interesting to look back and see what was said by some people at the time of the passage of the legislation and since then. For example, on 2 July 1991 Senator Bob MCMullan said that Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd, replacing the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, would do even better than its predecessor. Let us take this opportunity to briefly examine the record. In September 1991, the the Queensland-based Kern Corporation collapsed. That put in jeopardy the value of property investments owned by the CFM. In fact, the CFM jointly owns, with Kern, over half of two major office buildings in both Sydney and Melbourne. In 1991, the CFM, according to its annual report, recorded a dismal investment return of negative 0.8 per cent after tax. As of February this year, the CFM still owned the poorly performing central business district properties including Grosvenor Place in Sydney and 101 Collins for the Street in Melbourne. The well-known commentator Daryl Dixon said in the Canberra Times on 23 February 1992: Until the CFM manages to reduce its exposure to these investments, CSS members will not receive the high rates of returns achieved by the CFM in earlier years. For the CFM and the CSS members, recent developments on the CBD property market front do not present even a glimmer of hope. The Canberra Times on 15 November 1991 said: CFM is widely regarded in investment circles as having a high proportion of its assets in property. The current slump in the Australian commercial property market has adversely affected CFM's short term returns to investors in Public Service superannuation funds. In the Australian of 31 January 1992 we read: The Commonwealth funds management organisation has become the latest victim of the drop in values of development sites. Not only has the organisation taken a significant loss on the sale part of the Landmark Tower site in Brisbane but it has also begun the break-up of what was once a sought-after commodity-a development site large enough to incorporate a big office tower. In fact, the CFM subsequently sold its share of the Landmark site at 99 Mary Street for $1.85m, but it should be noted that in 1985, when it bought the same property, it paid $2.6m. In fact that property, which had been seen as a prime investment for so long, demonstrates the fundamental weaknesses of the Australian taxation system because, while superannuation does obviously play an importimt role as a vehicle for savings, as far as the Opposition is concerned it should not be seen as 'the' preferred means of saving but merely as 'a' preferred means of saving. We have very clearly demonstrated that distinction from the current policy in our Fightback proposals. We believe that the heavy investment in property over recent years by superannuation funds has been a problem which has resulted in many people who are now in retirement or who will be in retirement in the near future achieving a lower return on their investment. The Superannuation Fund Investment Trust report, in fact the last report for 1991, stated: In the year ended 30 June 1991 the return to the CSS Fund wasas I saidnegative 0.8 per cent after tax, compared with a positive 8.4 per cent in the previous year. Over the five years ended 30 June 1991 the rate allocated to CSS contributors has averaged 11.03 per cent.per annum. That is a respectable but a not particularly grand result. It continues: The disappointing performance for 1990-91 was caused by the significant downturn in the property sector and, to a lesser extent, poor returns from the international equities sector. The property sector was particularly hard hit by the recession and, coupled with SFIT's relatively high exposure to property, was the major factor contributing to the negative result overall. The sad fact is that ever since the property crash a few years ago, many superannuation funds and certainly the Commonwealth Fund have been running very close to the wind indeed. As I said, many people will find that of there is a cost to that in the longer term. Over 300,000 Commonwealth Government employees are now covered by the scheme. Therefore, not only is it one of Australia's largest investors, but the overall involvement of it in superannuation and its capacity to marshal funds for investment will continue to be of considerable importance to Australians' investment overall. I would like to take this opportunity to widen the debate perhaps to cover the whole issue of superannuation in the context of Australian investment policy. Quite clearly everyone would like to retire with financial security. That is one of the things we hear glibly spoken of, often on both sides of the House and certainly, in recent days, to an excessive extent by members of the Government and by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) himself who, as I have said on a number of occasions already in this House, refused to actually present himself, to take his own legislation yesterday and to give the House the benefit of his views on the comments made by members on both sides. Unfortunately, this demonstrates yet again the contempt in which members of the Government hold this Parliament, and it undoubtedly gives Australian people reason to believe that the Parliament is no longer relevant when they see Ministers of the Government refusing to actually perform and do their duty in the House. As Australia has an ageing population, the cost of providing adequate pensions into the twenty-first century will obviously be a major issue of public policy. At present there is one pensioner for every seven workers paying tax. In 20 years there will be one pensioner to three workers. Clearly one has to ask the question: will those people be able or willing to pay higher taxes to maintain more pensioners? The sad fact is that over the la-t 10 years, despite the considerable reforms which have been introduced by the Government in the superannuation area, the whole subject is incredibly complex and the industry itself is in such a situation that very few, if any, superannuation advisers can in all genuineness be able to say to their clients precisely what their end benefits will be. The outcome of all this is that Labor has failed to establish a fair system which encourages everyone to provide for additional income in retirement. Perhaps the most obvious way to define what is fair in terms of retirement planning is to put to honourable members the simple realities of the situation. At the present time high income earners obtain a benefit in terms of taxation of about 32c in the dollar. For low income. workers, from average income and below, the benefit is as low as 6c in the dollar. The sad fact is that thousands upon thousands of Australian workers who have not in the past been contributing to superannuation are effectively, through their taxation, supporting larger taxation benefits for the top end of town. Yet we hear from a Labor government, which claims of course to be looking after the ordinary people, that that is in fact what it calls fair. The Opposition believes absolutely that this is a clear example of how the Government fails, in terms of policy formulation, to address the fundamental issues which are so important at this time. In addition to that, as I said earlier, Labor has made superannuation very complex and confusing, even to the professionals. Labor has been very generous to high income earners and very unfair to the majority of workers. Labor has used $3.35 billion of tax concessions paid for by ordinary workers largely to subsidise the benefits of higher income earners. Labor has not adequately provided for the retirement income needs of women in particular, especially those who are outside the paid work force or those who are in part time or casual employment, or those with broken work records. Labor's industry based superannuation schemes have cost low income earners, part time and casual workers alike, almost all their contributions in administration and insurance charges and, regrettably, under the current arrangements thousands upon thousands of those people will get little, if anything, from their contributions upon retirement. Labor's loose vesting requirements have meant that many workers may not get superannuation based upon their employer contributions. Labor's compulsory award superannuation in. fact has given employees no choice as to where their moneys are invested nor, in terms of the trustee arrangement, any choice as to who their trustees should be, nor what the investment policies of the schemes to which they are compulsorily required to make a contribution ought to be.",153
271,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,Mr Truss)Order! I would remind the honourable member for Bradfield that we are dealing with the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund and that his remarks would need to be related to the Bill rather than to the general subject of superannuation.,155
272,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am well aware of that. I can assure you that the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund suffers from exactly the same range of problems as every other superannuation fund in Australia.",155
273,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I look forward to the honourable member drawing his remarks closer to the content of the Bill. Mr Langmore- Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill does not relate to the totality of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme; it relates only to very narrow consequential amendments. I think you are quite right to draw attention to the fact that the honourable member for Bradfield is roaming very far from the subject of the Bill.",155
274,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I thank the honourable member for his compliment, but I think the point has already been made to the speaker, and I am sure he will address his remarks to the Bill.",155
275,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"The point has been made, and all I can say in response to my colleague the honourable member for Fraser is that quite clearly he is terribly sensitive about this particular issue. And well he might be, because the Government's record in this area does leave something to be desired. But the legislation before the House is essentially of a technical nature. I have made the point that perhaps it should have been introduced much earlier after the passage of the original Bill rather than, as is currently the situation, almost two years later. Mr Deputy Speaker, I lean upon your leniency in this matter to make the point that we are talking about a superannuation policy which is the basis for this legislation, and while it may relate to certain amendments which were introduced into the system, the fact is that the enabling Bill for the introduction of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund is the very basis upon which this legislation has been developed. It is designed to overcome problems relating to the introduction of the original superannuation fund. I have gone to .some pains tonight in my dissertation to point out the implications of this in tenus of the investment of the funds of over 300,000 Australian public servants. The whole purpose of Government superannuation policy is that it wants a degree of uniformity. The question which must be addressed, therefore, is this: to what extent does the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, in its new visage, of which this legislation is a critical part-although it has taken the best part of two years to be introduced-fit into the overall scheme of government superannuation? I therefore put it to you, Mt Deputy Speaker, that an overall examination of some of the critical elements of superannuation policy, which relates absolutely to the purposes of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund is in fact, as I said earlier, parallel to the whole issue as to what extent this legislation fits into Government overall superannuation policy. On that point, Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you will allow me to continue.",156
276,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"I will not allow the honourable member to make parallel comments, but I will allow him to make comments on the content of the Bill.",156
277,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"The legislation, as I said, is of its nature quite limited. In the many years I have been in this House I have never known a case where, when one discusses a subject of. such profound importance as superannuation policy affecting the contributions, lifestyle and retirement of some 300,000 public servants, in addition to the fact that the enabling legislation also allows this new organisation to go beyond the Public Service-in fact, into the private sector and encourage investments from elsewhere, matters which are covered in the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust annual report, which is the very report to Parliament on this legislation-I dutifully suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that what I am saying is absolutely consistent with the basic requirements of this legislation. Mr Langmore-It has nothing to do with this legislation at all.",156
278,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"This legislation is related to the enabling legislation. I am talking about both because they are both critical to overall superannuation policy. Labor's objective in the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund is to reach the situation where all employees are covered by superannuation. It has gone about that in a two-tiered way. Firstly, we had the 3 per cent award superannuation arrangement which was introduced two or three years ago, and now we have the legislation which was passed through this House yesterday and which I trust will not be passed through the Senate when it comes up for debate there, because I believe the Australian Democrats share with the Opposition a very deep-seated concern about the Government's failure to prove in this House or before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation why the changes it proposes are valid. The point I am trying to get to is simply this: we have now reached a situation where all employers are required to pay 3 per cent under award payments. In addition to that, a . new superannuation plan has been put in place which, if it is introduced, will require by the year 2000 that employers will be funding up to 9 per cent superannuation for public servants as well as private sector people. I am sticking absolutely to the substance of this overall legislation.",156
279,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"The honourable member is also taking care, I hope, to ensure that he is not reflecting on a matter that has already been through the House.",157
280,Mr CONNOLLY,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"No, I am not reflecting on a matter that has already been through the House. I would never do a thing like that; I know my Standing Orders. But it is very significant, I think, that when we are considering, as I said, the investment policy affecting the personal investments of over 300,000 public servants in addition to the contributions of some 1.683 million employees-and that is just in relation to small business, not to mention the number involved in big business-we are looking at well over three to four million people and their families, so the whole issue of how the funding should take place is obviously a matter of great importance indeed. The coalition, therefore, has been concerned about this matter for sometime because it shares with the Government the belief that people must be encouraged to go into superannuation, whether they be public servants or non-public servants. The fundamental issue between us is whether or not people on relatively low incomes ought to be forced into superannuation schemes which result in a diminution in their actual in-hand income. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made clear in Question Time yesterday that under this proposal people would be effectively putting 9 per cent of their income into superannuation, with the effect that there would be a negligible increase in wages, that is, wages in the hand. If I may quote from the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, I point out that it states: The Treasury argued that the increase in contributions to 9 per cent over this decade was likely to be absorbed into general wage demandsworkers would receive the increase in super in lieu of a wage increase paid in cash. . . Mr Keating confirmed that the increase in contributions would be absorbed into wage demands ... This commitment could mean very low cash wage increases over this decade unless workers are able to obtain pay rises for productivity gains. The Opposition on many occasions has made the point that it believes that pay rises and productivity gains quite clearly should go hand in hand. What we are concerned about is the absolute basis of this whole proposition, which simply states, in the words of the Treasury spokesmen before the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, that the Treasury would expect in the preparation of its estimates, in this particular case, that there will be over the next few years an increase of some 14 per cent in productivity. One would have to say that, on the basis of recent years, one can hope for it; but Australia's recent record does not bear that out in terms of what has actually occurred. The difficulty I am putting to the House is simply this: it means, on the face of it, that ordinary workers will be. asked effectively to give up a salary increase of most of 14 per cent-certainly 9 per cent of that 14 per cent, assuming they get there-which leaves only a very small amount of 5 per cent. In addition, the earlier legislation talked about contributions of a further 3 per cent. The Commonwealth superannuation scheme is a two-tiered arrangement by which employers are expected-in other words, the Commonwealth-to fund the 3 per cent award payment quite separately from the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund itself. For the wider community, we are effectively having a third-tier superannuation arrangement put in place. And we are not finished. In the private sector context, there is then a fourth tier, which is the employer funds. If one wants to fund oneself privately, there is a fifth tier, which is a 23FB type superannuation arrangement. As I said in my opening remarks, the Government has done a marvellous job over the last eight years of introducing into Australia undoubtedly the most complex and convoluted superannuation arrangements known anywhere in the world. I urge the House to seriously consider this: what other country has a five-tier superannuation system and has got a government which has the temerity to come into the House, whether it is talking about this public sector scheme or a private sector national scheme, and say, 'We have a simple scheme that covers everybody. '? The basic problem in all of this, and I alluded to it earlier, is: to what extent is the saving going to be made? According to Treasury estimates, whether we are talking about public sector superannuation or private sector superannuation, there will be no savings in terms of the payment of end benefits, that is, age pensions. That is one of the pillars upon which this whole package is meant to stand-whether or not these superannuation changes will have the effect of making long term savings. It is estimated by the Treasury that those savings will not occur before the year 2020. That is an estimate based on demographic trends, ageing of the population and so forth. A significant number-millions-of Australian workers are on average incomes and below and may be in low yielding superannuation schemes. 'Low yielding' fits two definitions, one being the actual return on a person's investment. The fact that Labor has effectively increased superannuation taxes by over 1,000 per cent over the last eight years clearly has an effect on the return on investment, and that affects public service schemes just as much as it affects private sector schemes. In addition, we have the difficulty I have noted already in the SFIT funding arrangements where we have had a taxation system in place which has encouraged fund managers to put an excessive amount of workers' contributions into real estate. The outcome of all that in recent years is that most funds have either had a negative or very near negative response at a time when the rate of inflation has been considerably higher. SFIT talked about a minus 0.8 per cent return in the last year, 1990-91. In truth, if it took inflation account, it would be considerably less again. The difficulty we are facing in Australia today, because of the sheer complexity of the system, is that people are seriously questioning why they should go into superannuation. Public servants have the biggest disadvantage of all in that if people go into a Public Service job they have no choice; they are required by law to put their money into the Commonwealth scheme. It is the view of the Opposition-and it is laid Qut clearly in our policy-that workers, whether they be Commonwealth public servants or private sector servants, should have a degree of choice as to where their investments are placed. This does not necessarily mean that people should switch across every 12 months every time they grab an annual report and say, 'My word! My fund is two points less effective than somebody else's'. But it does mean that people are not locked into a scheme for their entire life-or certainly while they are working for a particular employer-if they genuinely believe that their funds can work better for them elsewhere. That is one of the major problems. The other major problem which the Government has not addressed is the fact that well over one million Australian workersincluding about 25 per cent of public servants who are covered under the proposals in this legislation-are in the difficult situation of being temporary workers. The recent legislation suggests changes which will bring people below certain income levels into the scheme. . But I put to the Government-as we have done elsewhere at other times-the serious proposition that the cost of running those schemes is so high that the end benefit will be severely affected. That is so in many cases. For example, if we are talking about a 3 per cent fund and 1.5 per cent is being spent on insurance and administration costs, the worker has automatically lost half of his or her contribution. There is taxation on top of that. Perhaps workers may leave the work force for a number of months-for example, on maternity leave-and may not continue to fund into their schemes. If workers do that a few times in their lives, then, believe me, it is not difficult to come up with a formula by which it is clear that although people may have thought that they had a contribution which would result in a nice nest egg, in truth there will be very little-if anything-there at all. The Opposition has put Ii lot of thought into this. In 1986 I suggested in our draft policyand I have spoken about this in the House on a number of occasions-that the easiest answer was to try to link together what we call retirement savings accounts, which are precisely directed at part time and temporary workers; especially women. These would act as a bridge between periods in and out of the work force. By and large, the legislation which has been before the House-and is before the House again in terms of the enabling Bill-has a fundamental weakness. At best, a superannuation contribution in the public sector is frozen: there is no way in which one could effectively add to it, unless one is actually a job. For example, if a person took nine months maternity leave-which is a quite normal thing to do in the public sector-that person's rights to superannuation were protected at theÂ· standard rate which applied at the time that person took that leave. But there was no means of making further contributions during that period. If we have a retirement savings accounttype arrangement, it has the big advantage of working just like a bank account. When people have spare money, they put it in. If one is working part time and one's employer makes a contribution of about 3 per cent in terms of the legislation-and the Opposition is committed to accepting that 3 percent in terms of our policy, but we believe that. any further contributions in addition to that should be on the basis of negotiation between employers and employees as part of the overall wages package-by making contributions to a retirement savings account in that form, it acts as a bridge bet-een those periods in and out of the work force. If people then transfer back into the Public Service, their retirement savings account can be closed if they wish and the funds transferred into their mainline scheme. Alternatively-and I made this point earlier-there is a total lack of freedom of choice for public servants in the system at the present time. There again, the retirement savings account has the advantage. If people prefer to use that as their vehicle for long term saving and, ultimately, for providing their retirement income; so be it. The big advantage would be flexibility and the sure knowledge that they would not be caught for large administration costs-which is currently the reality for most superannuation schemes in this country and, in particular, the 3 per cent so-called productivity schemes which were introduced by the Government a few years ago. My final observation is simply this: it is beyond my comprehension, and that of the Opposition, why at this stage-with this reform legislation going through the House and with other legislation on this subject introduced in recent days-the opportunity in has not been taken to lock together the productivity proposals which are in place and the new proposals which the Government hopes to get through the Senate but which I doubt will get through. . As I have said, we have a five-tier superannuation system in Australia today. It is a massive, monumental Tower of Babel. It is not understood by the superannuation industry, which has great difficulty explaining it to its clients. It is certainly not understood by most clients and, regrettably, because of,its complexity it is no longer trusted by a large proportion of the Australian work force.",157
281,Mr LANGMORE,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Fraser) (10.15 p.m.)Despite the undoubted eloquence of the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), this is not a general debate about superannuation. I do think that you indulged him, Mr Deputy Speaker. But it was an interesting speech and it deserves a thorough reply. Unfortunately, now is not the moment when that can be done. I make one point: employees do .seek secure retirement' income. As we all get closer to retirement, we look for ways of ensuring that our retirement income will be guaranteed. It is in order to answer that need that the Government has responded with the legislation which is now on its way through the Parliament. That legislation will ensure that all employees are covered by superannuation. That is a major advance in social policy in Australia. Despite all of the obfuscation and complexity of the speech by the honourable member for Bradfield, the outcome is something that employees would generally welcome. It is certainly something that I welcome strongly. This Bill is, I think, the most inconsequential Bill I have ever debated in this Parliament. It is called the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1992, but it uses the term - consequential , to mean amendments that flow from, not amendments that are important to, the superannuation legislation. The amendments are so technical and so recondite that, as the previous speaker said, they have not covered one person so far. The first amendment is described as referring to the Superannuation Act 1976 or parts of that Act or to aspects of the CSS-the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. The amendments include corresponding references in relation to the Superannuation Act 1990 and the public sector superannuation scheme. If anyone really understands what that means he or she is doing very well-particularly at 20 minutes past 10 at night. I really do not want to say anything significant about this legislation, except make one point. I refer back to the orientation and motivation for this scheme. When' the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) introduced it in 1990, he said: The new scheme will provide: the opportunity of membership to all employees; a choice of lump sum or pension benefits; flexible contribution rates for members; substantially improved resignation benefits; significantly tightened invalidity provisions. All of those are desirable goals and all of those are embodied in the scheme. The only one that has been in any way controversial is the tightening of the invalidity provisions. These provisions were tightened significantly-more than some people were happy about. There were attempts to change that, but they were unsuccessful. The basis of the scheme, its framework and its whole content improve the quality of superannuation for public servants and the Commonwealth public sector generally. This has been welcomed. All new permanent employees and most new temporary employees are becoming members arid the scheme is working well. This Act simply tidies up some tiny aspects of the schetpe. I support the Bill and I hope the Opposition will also support it, because the amendments are so minor. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on it. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Robert Brown) read a third time. NA Motion (by Mr Robert Brown) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Nomad Aircraft",159
282,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"For about two years I have heen pressing the Minister for Defence (Senator Rob-rt Ray) for answers on a number of aspects of the operation of the Australian designed and built Nomad aircraft. Arguably, that aircraft was imposed on the Defence Force some years ago by this Government to avoid any embarrassment about its production and poor commercial attraction. It would be fair to say not only' that it is unsuitable for the types of operations required of the Australian Army Aviation Corps or the RAAF but also that it has a less than satisfactory performance and envelope, arguably under certain conditions degenerating into a longitudinally unstable platform and, in the extreme, a potential threat to the lives of those who fly it. Big operational question marks persist, both in Australia and overseas, where the causes of a number of major in-flight incidents and fatal accidents remain unanswered or where the causes have not been resolved with any degree of certainty. In the last week I have been made aware again of furth'er disturbing developments in terms of such incidents and an increasing disquiet amongst Defence Force aircrew about their ultimate safety: I therefore want to read into the Hansard record a series of seven questions for the Minister for Defence. First, will the Minister confirm that Australian Defence Force Nomad aircraft have again experienced a number of in-flight incidents in recent weeks? Second, will the Minister confirm that such Defence Force aircraft already are operating under officially imposed flight limitations as the result of uncertainties arising from two fatal crashes and other departmental reservations? Third, will the Minister confirm that Aerospace Technologies of Australia, ASTA, is involved in structural redesign modifications to this aircraft type? Fourth, will the Minister confirm that the Civil Aviation Authority recently issued an ultimatum to ASTA to get it right quickly or it would ground all Nomad aircraft throughout the world? This is the most disturbing recent development and highlights the disquiet about Nomad operations under commercial or general aviation conditions. Fifth, is the Minister aware of the increasing reservations of some Australian Defence Force aircrew about the aircraft's inflight stability? Sixth, can the Minister and his colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Richardson) assure the House that the Nomad aircraft is safe and that they and their Government are doing everything to ensure that no further lives are lost through budgetary constraints or a lack of redesign expertise? Finally, will the Minister issue instructions that Australian Defence Force aircraft again be grounded, pending resolution of any structural and/or operational question marks? I ask the Minister to answer these and other questions placed on the Notice Paper in November last year. No-one should be playing around with aircraft safety matters, as appears to be the case at the moment.. For starters, the widow of the young RAAF officer killed over two years ago in one of these aircraft deserves definitive answers and appropriate compensation, not the shrugging of bureaucratic shoulders that we have seen to date. Will the Minister come clean and take some decisions in the interests of both the Australian Defence Force and Nomad aircrew in particular? I am sure that he would not wish to have another serious accident on his hands. I say to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, and to the Parliament in general, 'Please, Senator Ray, let us have some answers and some real action'. Commercial Television Industry",160
283,Mr LANGMORE,ADJOURNMENT,"Fraser) (10.25 p.m.)Tonight I wish to take a critical look at an Australian industry which has managed to escape the national surge towards less protected, freer markets, an industry which . continues to enjoy the shelter of government from open competition, as it has done throughout its 35-year history, but an industry which apparently does not know when enough is enough. I am referring to the commercial television industry, which does not seem to understand the responsibilities to the Australian public that it is expected to shoulder in return for the privileged position that it enjoys. In September 1987 the commercial networks were gi ven the opportunity to demonstrate that they could regulate themselves with regard to the amount of advertising they inflict on their audiences. They had the chance to show that they could be trusted to run themselves in a responsible fashion. When the industry pleaded its case for selfregulation, it said that it was not driven by greed, it did not want to grab more time for advertising and therefore rob viewers of even more programming time. The networks said they simply wanted the freedom to experiment to get a better and more diverse mix of as and programs-for the ultimate benefit of viewers, of course. But the reality of the next three years clearly demonstrated that the commercial networks were not worthy of that public trust. Prior to September 1987 the networks were limited to 13 minutes of advertising per hour. That was already the highest advertising exposure for television in the world. A 1990 comparison showed that even that bastion of capitalism the United States had less advertising on. television than Australia. In America, CBS, ABC and NBC averaged 10 to 12 minutes of advertising per hour during prime time. Britain and France averaged six minutes per hour, New Zealand nine minutes, South Africa less than five minutes, and so on. When the Tribunal eventually reviewed how the networks had perfonned as self-regulators this is theÂ· picture that emerged. Firstly, all three networks had increased their advertising time per hour substantially. An independent study by AIM Data found that TV stations were running as much as 19 minutes of as and non-program material in an hour of prime time viewing. Secondly, the networks deliberately targeted children's television, running more as between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., the peak viewing times for children. This is of particular concern as studies have found a strong correlation between advertising and poor dietary habits in children. Thirdly, the number of as has increased. Instead of fewer 30-second as, the networks are running more IS-second as. Fourthly, the networks have deliberately targeted the second half of feature movies. They have cynically worked out that if viewers have sat through the first half of a movie, they are. going to want to stay till the end. In other words, the networks did the precise opposite of what they said they would do: they cynically exploited their new found freedom to pull in more ad revenue by selling more time and bombarding both children's and adults' prime time. They showed contempt for their audiences, for the Tribunal and for the Government. The networks want their cake and to eat it too. They want the protection of regulation to preserve their privileged oligarchy but, at the same time, they demand the right to regulate themselves inside that broader government umbrella of protection against open com)Jetition. So when the Tribunal recently decided to return to an enforced set of advertising limits, the networks refused to accept the umpire's decision and turned to the Federal Court. I should point out that the standards the Tribunal has decided to apply to the industry are really quite generous. From March the amount of advertising and non-program matter was limited to an average of 14 minutes during prime time, with a maximum of 15 minutes in anyone hour. In September this will come down to 13 minutes, with a limit of 15 minutes in any given hour, still the highest in the Western world. The television industry pleaded that it is in such tough times that the revenue loss would guarantee lower program quality, but it is misleading to base future expectations on the bad times of the past couple of years. Channel Nine's shares on the stock market have quadrupled since Kerry Packer bought it back. Advertising companies have increased their budgets by 7 112 per cent this year, and the signs of a general recovery in the economy are also increasing.' As the Tribunal has pointed out, if the networks simply reduce the time they spend promoting their own programs by one minute in every hour, the new rules would have no effect on advertising revenue at all. The networks have shown they cannot be trusted. They should drop their Federal Court action and accept the umpire's decision. Greiner Government-Parliamentary Seats",161
284,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (10.30 p.m.)The people of New South Wales have reacted with anger at the deal done by the Premier, Mr Greiner, and his Environment Minister, Mr Moore, with Dr Terry Metherell, the renegade Liberal. Metherell's desertion of the Liberal Party and his hypocritical selfproclamation as the 'independent member for Davidson' was bad news for the Greiner minority Government. The Government's slim hold on power, as a minority Government, is under pressure and threatened by investigations of three of its back bench MPs. It is easy to see why Greiner and Moore were tempted to do a deal with Metherell, but that does not excuse their actions. The deal involved Metherell resigning his seat in Parliament so that it could return to the Liberal Party in a by-election. The quid pro quo for Metherell was the appointment to the Senior Executive Service and a five-year contract at $110,000 a year in the new Environment Protection Authority. Whatever the outcome of the current ICAC investigation, the Greiner Government cannot escape some damning facts: the EPA job was specially created for Metherell; he 'lid not compete for it in a proper selection process; the EPA board and its chairman were only informed of the appointment after it was made; Metherell's resignation as the member for Davidson and his appointment to the new job were handled as a single, quick transaction on the same day in Moore's office. Public disgust was shown in the Davidson by-election, which the Government brought on with undue and undemocratic haste. In spite of a two-day nomin.ation period and the lack of an ALP candidate, the Liberal candidate was forced to preferences. Twenty-five per cent of Liberal voters changed their vote. That happened in a seat in which in 1991 Metherell as a Liberal candidate was returned with 65 per cent of the primary vote despite a recent and well-publicised conviction for tax evasion and a sacking from the Ministry. The ICAC in NSW will no doubt look closely at the central question of whether Metherell was offered, in effect, a bribe by senior officers of the NSWGovernment, for the purpose of inducing hit;n to resign his seat in parliament. But this is not the first time in Australia's political history that such a tion has been investigated. A similar investigation was conducted into the disposition of a NSW seat in this House. In the 1928 Scholes Royal Commission an investigation was carried out into the Federal seat of Dalley, resigned in 1927 by William Mahony, an ALP member. In the subsequent election, Edward Theodore, a member of the ALP and a former Premier of Queensland, became the member for Dalley. It was found that Mahony received over Â£5,000 the day before his resignation and that Mahony's explanation-that he won it on the Melbourne Cup-was not believable. Mahony later spent Â£3,000 of the money to buy a pub in Balmain. The Royal Commissioner could not trace the source of most of the money paid to Mahony but did find out that Â£200 of it came direct from Theodore. Royal Commissioner Scholes concluded, in his words: To my mind the presumption that Mr Mahony received this money for his seat is irresistible. Efforts to prosecute the individuals involved came to nothing, apparently because there was no specific offence that would result in a probable conviction. If that is the case, then it seems to me that the Commonwealth criminal laws of the time were sadly lacking. Ross MCMullin, in his book The Light on the Hill, suggests that trading in parliamentary seats is not such a rarity. He mentions a case involving my seat of North Sydney where, in 1922, Â£3,000 was paid to a Nationalist Party official, who apparently had pre-selection, to induce him to stand aside in favour of Billy Hughes. No doubt there are other cases of seat trading that we have not heard about and probably never will. In concluding, I return to my point about the adequacy of Commonwealth criminal laws in this area. If trading in parliamentary seats is not a specific crime, then it ought to be. The exchange of money or anything of value to induce MPs to resign their seats is a crime against parliamentary ethics and the public and it should be treated as 'a serious crime. Goods and Services Tax: Study by Women's Electoral Lobby",162
285,Ms CRAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"Forde) (10.35 p.m.)ques- No doubt many honourable members in this House have heard of the very recent Women's Electoral Lobby study on the goods and consumption tax. The Women's Electoral Lobby took each room in a house and looked at the kinds of costs which exist now and those that would exist under a GST, taking into account the wholesale sales tax. It was assisted by a whole range of companies to pursue the matter, and its findings are, of course, .quite dramatic. In round figures, it looked at roughly 500 items and found that at least 450 would be dearer. Out of this Women's Electoral Lobby stu'dy has emerged a very dark and frightening side of the kind of public debate which we hope we will not have to experience. What the Women's Electoral Lobby was founded for and what it is about is raising those. issues which affect the politics of women, particularly in terms of the electoral system. I have seen a very interesting clipping in this morning's Courier-Mail about abusive telephone calls to members of the Women's Electoral Lobby. I also understand that the leader of the State Parliamentary Liberal Party in Queensland, Joan Sheldon, has said that she is opposed to any threats or abusive calls to WEL. On this basis, I ask whether Mrs Sheldon is going to investigate claims made by the Women's Electoral Lobby coordinator, Sandra Cameron, in this morning's Courier Mail that: . . . a man believed to be a Liberal-endorsed candidate telephoned her threatening to discredit her and WEL. In so doing, she may be able to verify whether the person concerned is in fact a Mr Dick Phillips, the endorsed Liberal candidate  making abusive telephone calls to members of the Women's Electoral Lobby, I am sure we would all like to know what action Mrs Sheldon, on the basis of her statement this morning, and the Queensland Liberal Party intend taking. I would suggest that with the introduction of Fightback into the political arena, any group within our community is entitled to make a reasonable and fair assessment of it and to question the assumptions that are in it and to pursue the kinds of implications for people in our community. Mrs Gallus-It was totally biased.",163
286,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Hawker will cease interjecting.,164
287,Ms CRAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"It is reasonable for the Women's Electoral Lobby to look at household items and to check, with the companies that supply them, the impact of such a tax within our community. Indeed, the women involved-Margaret Carroll, Sandra Cameron and one other-have spent an enormous amount of time on research. They are not politically aligned; they are simply involved in the political process and in questioning the Fightback package. I find it interesting that members of the Opposition are opposed to any realistic and economic debate in terms of the kind of impact which the goods and services tax will have on the community. It is extraordinary that they should suggest that a group as well educated, with such extensive research experience and as highly articulate as the Women's Electoral Lobby should not make a statement about as important a document in the political arena as Fightback!. I presume the Opposition believes Fightback to be important. I believe it presumes that the goods and services tax should be fully investigated. We would all hope that we could have a full and clear look at this tax and imposition on people. When a group such as the Women's Electoral Lobby looks at it, we would hope that in the true Australian tradition they will be given a fair go. City of Wanneroo: Unexploded Ordnance",164
288,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I.rise this evening further to the comments I made in the adjournment debate on Monday evening. The problem of unexploded ordnance and the responsibility of the Federal Government for the detection and removal of UXOs is a matter of great concern to the residents in the .City of Wanneroo, an area within my electorate which is the second fastest growing municipality in Australia. Within Wanneroo there are areas in which, during the Second World War and after, military exercises were conducted and bombs, shells and 'other ordnance were fired or dropped on land where housing development has already taken place, development is under way or is proposed to service the ever increasing demands in a region of tremendous growth. In particular, six areas have been identified by the Department of Defence as affected by the likely presence of unexploded ordnance, or UXOs. These are: Mullaloo Point, an area 15 kilometres north of Perth, where suspected aerial bombing and gunnery target exercises were conducted between 1941 and 1942; Quinns Rock to Mullaloo, a five-kilometre coastal strip, where armoured, artillery and mortar firing took place during the Second World War and during the 1940s; Burns Beach, where an Army firepower demonstration occurred on 14 September 1943; Eglinton, five kilometres south-south-west of Yanchep, where suspected artillery, mortar and air-to-ground gunnery was conducted in World War II; Wreck Point in the Two Rocks area, which the US Navy used as a range during 1942 and where two civilian fishermen were killed within the range boundaries on 3 January 1943; and the region between Moore River and Yanchep and 15 kilometres inland, which was used for aerial bombing, naval bombardment and artillery firing during World War II and up to 1974. The above areas have been identified as presenting a UXO problem as a result of lengthy discussions between the city of Wanneroo and the Department of Defence from the 1980s to 28 February this year, when a letter from the Director-General, Logistics Policy, Department of Defence, summarised all the affected areas to the city of Wanneroo in response to council's inquiries. The area of Mullaloo Point, first mentioned in the letter, was a revelation to the Council and presented a more complex problem as housing development had already taken place. A further letter from the Department on 23 April stated that it was considered that developments could proceed without specific searching. This was also the case, according to the letter, with the Burns Beach area. However, the area between Quinns Rock was mentioned by the Department as being' possibly affected, based on uncorroborated anecdotal sources. It was considered that the sources may have referred only to Burns Beach, and it was stated that the risk of , continuing contamination in the area was low and development could proceed without specific searching. The Eglinton Range area appeared to have been used during World War II for the live firing of mortars and artillery. WA UXO services have surveyed the area and recommended that portions be subjected to 100 per cent searching. Golf Resorts International, the developer of the site, has requested Federal assistance towards the cost of searches and' clearance, which are under way, but to date has been unsuccessful in gaining financial help. In the Two Rocks area, as a result of State Emergency Service research, the SES recommended that no further subdivision take place without a search for UXO being conducted. In discussions between the Department and the city of Wanneroo, the Department advised that the Commonwealth Government is generally under no legal obligation to commit resources to reduce hazards associated with the presence of UXOs. According to the Department, it is considered that persons benefiting from the use or development of UXO-affected land would bear the cost of reducing UXO hazards. Furthermore"" in planning to reduce UXO-related hazards, the Department's ability to assist could depend on the availability of resources to be committed. In the event that the Council elects, to proceed with development proposals, the Commonwealth Government \yould deny any liability that may arise as a consequence of the presence of UXOs. The Commonwealth policy for the management of land affected by the presence of UXOs, finalised on 7 March 1991, breaks down land affected into three categories. The first is land occupied by the Commonwealth; the second is land in which the Commonwealth has divested a legal interest in the land; the third is land wherein the Commonwealth has never had, or has disposed of, its legal interest. It is the third category which appears to relate to the ca,se of the YanchepTwo Rocks area. The Commonwealth's position in this case will be influenced by the nature of the situation. An SES study of that area was presented to the Council in September 1991. That study proved beyond doubt that the area is polluted with UXO. The ' extent to which that is so cannot be stated precisely. I believe it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to assist financially towards the cost of identification and clearance of unexploded ordnance within the city of Wanneroo area. It is an area of great importance to the development of the Perth metropolitan area, and it is a matter of great concern to the many thousands of residents who so far the Government has not undertaken to assist financially, other than a $50,000 preliminary exercise towards the cost of identifying and clearing UXOs within the city of Wanneroo. Australia Post: Liverpool",164
289,Mr GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to bring to the attention of the House the anger of the people of Fowler at the manner in which Australia Post has altered our existing postal arrangements in the city of Liverpool. Specifically, I wish to convey our disappointment at the lack of consultation which surrounded Australia Post's bizarre decision to close and sell our centrally located, freestanding post office in order to move to rented premises on the fringe of the city. Although getting information from Australia Post has been as difficult as extracting teeth, what the people of Liverpool have learned about the corporation's plans has not eased our disquiet on the matter. Firstly, as I have said, we have a decision to shut down - nd sell a post office in the middle of the city so that Westfield, which has just spent millions of dollars extending its complex in Liverpool, can gain an important and large new tenant. Never mind the fact that Westfield is right on the fringe of the city, half a kilometre from the station, nor $250,000 was spent less than two years ago refurbishing the public area of the current post office. Then we had the incredible decision to open two other postal offices apart from the Westfield main post office. One of those is to be a sorting and loading facility out of the Liverpool CBD, while the other is a business centre to cater for those businesses disadvantaged by the move. And where is the new business office going to be? Believe it or not, it is in the vicinity of the current premises, because that is where the business community is, according to Australia Post's regional manager. Given all of this information, one is entitled to ask Australia Post why the move is necessary in the first place. Its answer is that the current premises are too cramped, the people want a post office in Westfield, and the new arrangements represent a good deal. Unfortunately, the hundreds of people and business organisations which have contacted my office on the matter do not seem to see it as such a good deal. They ask the question: if the current premises are so cramped, why will the total space of the three rented premises be approximately the same as the premises available now? As for the contention that the people of Liverpool support the relocation, I must have had the misfortune of running into every malcontent on the subject in my area. Interestingly, those malcontents include the City of Liverpool RSL, the Chairman of the Liverpool City Chamber of Commerce, the Liverpool branch of the Australian Labor Party, and a host of other organisations and individuals. An odd bunch of bedfellows, perhaps, but a fairl- good indicator of the depth of opposition to the move. The claim by Australia Post that I have found most interesting is that the relocation represents a good deal. I do not know what rent Australia Post will be paying in Westfield, because nobody from the corporation will tell me, and the Minister will not tell me. However, I find it difficult to accept that any rental honeymoon deal in that Westfield could be more advantageous to Australia Post than staying where it is. First, Australia Post has to pay two other sets of rent, and sooner or later the Westfield rent will come on stream when the honeymoon is over. The rental in the present premises is nil. Still, I should not forget that there is an opportunity cost in tying up capital in owned premises. It is better, Australia Post tells me, to sell the current premises, gain a tax advantage on the rent paid, and invest the gains in property elsewhere. There are only two problems with that contention. Firstly, conventional wisdom has it that it is unwise to sell a suburban commercial property in the midst of a property downturn. The return has to be low, particularly as Australia Post is denying itself its one big property advantage-its own tenancy. Secondly, Australia Post tells me that the proceeds of the Â·sale are to be skimmed off from Liverpool. In other words, Liverpool does not even receive the benefits of the proceeds. What makes me cranky about the Liverpool post office is that I was not given the tunity to comment on the plans before they went ahead, as indeed other community leaders were not. That is hardly good community relations. Although the people of Liverpool now believe that the city should be renamed 'Westfield Junction', I do not consider this matter over yet. I will have more to say about it in the weeks ahead. Australia Post must produce the documentation to show that it has made a wise decision, rather than done a good deal with a powerful business. I am thankful that when I was in business I did not have the people who are running the post office running my business, because I would be bankrupt. Goods and Services Tax-Disabled People: Carers",166
290,Mrs GALLUS,ADJOURNMENT,"Hawker) (10.49 p.m.)Before I continue on the matter I have raised in the adjournment debate this week on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and now on Thursday night on people with disabilities in South Australia, I would like to address some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford). I think she failed toÂ· mention that the study was conducted by a relative of somebody who sits in the parliamentary Labor Party. Not only that, but there were certain omissions from that study. Although I believe the wholesale sales tax was deducted, there were no deductions made for the payroll tax, for the removal of the 26c per litre excise on petrol, nor other taxes that are presently there. I am sure that, if the honourable member for MCEwen (Mrs Bailey) rises to speak, she will add to those comments. Tonight I just want to conclude some of those comments I have made over the past week on people with disabilities. As I have done in the past, I would like to quote the very words in the letters I have received. First, I refer to a letter from a couple from Barmera in South Australia, who have a daughter aged 20 who has diabetes, cerebral palsy, is profoundly deaf and intellectually disabled. The mother writes: . . . Her behaviour can be extreme with large temper tantrums, dressing and undressing obsessibility sions, mood swings, sleepless nights and mornings, oppor- and a fear of nothing and no-one. The letter also states: As the parent of a severely/multiply disabled person, it is well known the lack of services are prevalent. A petition has gone to the Commonwealth Parliament and one to the State will be presented soon. Letters from Probus, Rotary, CWA, Apex, Lions and Red Cross have been sent to Mr Keating and Mr Bannon as per the enclosed sample. The Ministers Fraternal of BerrifBarmera, Loxton and Renmark have indicated urgent support as have Riverland Local Government Association ... As I have continued learning about the disability . field, I have become more disenchanted with so many parts of it. How the existing $ is spent is a nightmare as well as the quality of some of the persons practising in it. Having described the daughter of this lady, I should mention that the parents cannot get her accommodation, which is what they have been trying for. The letter continues: When I heard Mr Bruggemann, Chief Executive Officer of IDSC tell me of a lady who was dying (within about 2 weeks) asking him for accommodation for her family member so she could have peace of mind, I thought it was a case of 'here's someone worse than you, shut up'. Two weeks after this lady died, accommodation had still not been found. That story always puts me in mind of the 80 year old man here in the Riverland expected to continue to care until he dies. Of her and her husband, the letter states: We are both extremely tired and having physical ailments which makes it more difficult to physically lift ... Finally, it states: As you are well aware, the non payment of the Disability Services Award by both Governments is causing havoc and unnecessary worry to 12-15 Non Government Organisations in South Australia and hundreds within Australia. The State Government says it has allocated its portion of this figure but I understand the Treasury has turned down the first overtures by Dept. Health, Housing & Community Services ... Mr Speaker, had I more time tonight, I would have liked to have followed through that case, as well as the total lack of responsibility of this Government in abrogating its responfor fulfilling that award, therefore, making several organisations close their doors. I move on to a letter from another correspondent. I shall just take one paragraph from this submission. It states: OUf main submission is that wherever we apply for help, the Government seems to be cutting down on the amount of and type of aid which is given. Disabled folk ... cannot be grouped into one category; some need complete care in a hospital or institution, others should have hostel aCCQI)1modation, andÂ· some can live independently. The current policy seems to be to transfer as many people as poSsible from institutions into the general community, whether this is desirable or not; As my time has almost elapsed, I will just finish with a quote from a senior official in the disability field in South AUstralia who says: I have never seen a gove-ment put up the shutters in this way, a government that doesn't want to know about the angst and hurt in the community.",167
291,Mr SAWFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I would like to address the House on the subject of Australian youth and children. Since this Governmept came to office in 1983 there, ha-- been - ignifican,t reforms and improvements introduced which have benefited our youth and were needed to address the inequalities brought about by sheer neglect over the many years of conservative governments. The ranting and raving of the Opposition on the issue' 'of youth unemployment is nothing short of hypocrisy. It is very easy to be a knocker, but when it comes time for positive action the Opposition is left stranded in the starting blocks. Indeed, only today the Opp()sition spokesperson' oil employmentÂ· and industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), said that he wished that Australia could go back to the days when tl:tere were dead-end jobs. He then went on to describe a dead-eJ;ld job as a job that did not involve any kind of training. Commen- like this do nothing for Australia's standing in the international community. If we wereÂ· to go back to the so-called good old ,days; which the honourable member fOT Bennelong reminisces about, we would also be going back to year 12 r-tention rates of less than 30 per cent, of 50 per cent fewer university places, with those places being available going to those who could afford to study, or to a minute few who were able to get a scholarship. Do we abolish Austudy, which is a $1 billion-plus program, or the disadvantaged schools program? Would we forgo Commonwealth assistance for our TAPE systems? I can remember the 1950s and the 1960s in my area of Port Adelaide. Believe me, they were far from being the golden era. To even contemplate a return to the so-called golden era is ludicrous . If we did, I do not think we would have to worry about having a republican debate because even the mother country, along with every other developed nation, would want to disown us. Given the background of the lack of Opposition policies on youth, it is no wonder that my colleagues on this side of the House Youth get frustrated at times when they try to put forward positive policies and ideas for our youth .. No matter what the Opposition claims about .youth unemployment, it is falsepatently false-,to claim that one in three teenagers is unemployed. It would be more correct if those opposite said that one-third of the full time Jouth labour force was unemployed. As a total of the youth population, the number of young people who are unemployed is 9.7 percent. That equates to, 70 per cent who are in education, 20 per cent who are in employment and under 10 per cent who are unemployed. Let us not forget that the majority of that 10 per cent is without skills or any kindÂ· of training, vying for the so-called dead-end jobs that. the honourable member for Benne10ng refers to. I point out that I am not saying for one minute that youth unemployment in this country at its present level is acceptable. Of course,it is not. But this country needs some vision, ideals and some national pride in itself. We can do well without the knockers or the naive, romantics. Youth are the future of this country. They are the ones who will need to support the growing number of elderly people in years to come. Without the skills and qualifications, oUf standard of living will not 'even be able. to be maintained, let alone increased. We need to give our young the care, nurturing and encouragement they deserve. Historically there has been a lack of emphasis placed on children and youth in Australia. In a previous speech I referred to a quote by the Reverend Ted Noffs,. founder of the Life Education Centres in 1974. In relation to drug abuse, he said: ... after ten years of never ceasing crisis ling on drug and related abuse . . . that nothing would be ultimately achieved if the situation continued to be tackled solely at the dire and desperate end of the road stage, and that breakthrough of a positive, lasting quality could only come through prevelltative education of all young children from about four and a half to twelve years of age. As a nation we have not yet understood that a higher quality of education in the primary and junior primary levels w,Ould have far-reaching and positive consequences. Early intervention is cheaper than cure and more effective in the long run. A few of us in this Parliament-I admit, on both sides-do understand that that is needed, but it has been a long slow battle to get that recognition. That is why I would like to congratulate the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) for his suggested terms of reference for an inquiry into this area to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. This inquiry covers the following areas: the range and effectiveness of current methods to identify children at risk of developing literacy problems at an early age; addressing literacy; and the role of the Commonwealth disadvantaged schools program. I believe that early intervention strategies are the key to resolving many of our problems today, and as a member of that Committee, I am looking forward to some watershed changes being recommended to our education system. If the Opposition wants to get fair dinkum about the problems of youth and children, supporting the overall thrust of this Committee would be a positive step in the right direction. Employment-Women's Electoral Lobby",168
292,Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT,"Menzies) (10.59 p.m.)Tonight I had hoped to speak about the situation in Tibet. That situation demands more than the time available to me and so can wait until a later date. In that case I will simply make some responses to the reference by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) to the remarks of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) about dead-end jobs and point out to counselthe honourable member that, in fact, the honourable member for Bennelong was comparing the situation of having a job which may be regarded as a dead-end job with the situation that has been wrought by this Government of 800,000 Australians not having a job at all. If he went out and asked those 800,000 Australians whether they would prefer to have some job, albeit a dead-end job as it may be described, compared to no job at all, I know what the resounding response would be. In relation to the comments of the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) about the WEL study, if WEL will admit the inadequacy and the selectiveness of its assessment of Fightback, perhaps the integrity of WEL may be raised again within the Australian community. Until it does that, WEL stands condemned by its own study.",169

NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 7 May 1992: Public Service Act - Determinations-1992No-. 19,28,29.34,37,39,40,41,42,43. 44,45,46,53,56, 124, 126. The following answers to questions were circulated: . Defence For(!e Person'nel (Question N'-. 1265) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 2 January 1992: Are former Australian Defence Force personnel treated differently from former members of ,the Ready Reserve in the training and preparation programs provided by the' Government for post service employment; and if so, how. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follow$: Yes. Regular Defence Force personnel are eligible for assistance under the Services Vocational and Educational Training Scheme to undertake studieS in their own time to enhance their skills for civilian - mployment. Other assistance is available in the form of a subsidy to obtain a professionally prepared resume; twenty days' Discharge Resettlement Training through participation in an approved and/or on the job training with a future employer; as well as approved absence of three days prior to discharge for job seeking and associated matters. Members are invited to attend Defence run Resettlement Seminars when they are first planning retirement and again closer to severance. These benefits recognise the unique nature of many military employments and the potential difficulties of transition to civilian life. Given the ages of the great majority of ,Ready Reserve members, incentives are designed to attract high calibre young Australians to the Ready Reserve program, by providing tertiary and other vocational training under Defence sponsorship, or facilitated placement into civilian employment by means of a comprehensive high quality structured training, counselling and placement package. ' These incentives are the Education Assistance Scheme and the Job Search Assistance Scheme. In each case they are available on a discretionary basis to Ready Reserve members only during their part time service. Under the Education Assistance Scheme members who undertake full time courses recognised NA under the terms of the AUSTUDY Scheme may be paid an amount equal to the difference between the annual Commitment Bonus and the AUSTUDY aQult independent rate. This amount is tax exempt. Alternatively, members may choose the Job Search Assistance Scheme, which will be provided on completion of full time training, or, in the case of permanent force or general reserve transferees, on their transfer to the Ready Reserve. The Job Search Assistance Scheme is limited to a maximum of $1,000 per member., In addition appropriate job search counselling will be provided during full time training. SES Officers (Question No. 1433) Mr Downer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 25 March 1992: (1) How many cars are provided by the Commonwealth to officers of the Australian Public training course Service (APS). (2) What are the levels of the APS officers who are provided with cars. (3) Are officers of different levels provided with different types of cars; if so, how do they differ. (4) What is the total cost of the cars provided to APS officers. (5) Are cars provided to APS officers as part of their salary package; if so, how is the component of the package taxed. (6) Does the Commonwealth pay for the (a) insurance and (b) registration of vehicles it provides to APS officers. (7) Are other associated costs borne by the Commonwealth; if so, what costs. (8) What is the total cost to the Commonwealth of running and maintaining the cars provided to APS officers. Mr Beddall-The Department of Administrative Services advises that the answer to the question is: (1) Around 1,640 private plated cars are hire<! to agencies for the use of SES officers, including limited private use. In relation to other APS officers, agencies make individual decisions on the extent to which Z-plated vehicles are home garaged. The number of these vehicles is not known to DAS. (2) SES officers are provided with a car as part of their remuneration package. Officers of the Senior Grades (A to C) and other officers may home garage cars, on a regular or casual basis, subject to availability, if approved by the agency head of delegate and deemed to be in the Commonwealth's interest. (3) Within a range of Australian made vehicles, there are higher priced vehicles available for the higher level officers, viz: SES Band 1 and 2 - the upper price limit is currently the Ford Falcon GL station wagon; Deputy Secretaries - the upper price limit is currently the Mitsubishi Magna Elite station wagon; Secretaries and equivalents - the upper price limit is currently the Mitsubishi Verada XI sedan. (4) In relation to cars used by SES officers, total cost to the agencies hiring the vehicles is about $lO.Sm per annum. Individual agencies make decisions on the extent of home garaging of Zplated vehicles and DAS does not know this information. (5) For vehicles provided to SES officers, Fringe Benefits Tax is paid by each agency in relation to the use of the vehicles. Fringe Benefits Tax is also paid by agencies for Z-plated vehicles home garaged by other APS officers. Officers of the Senior Officer Grades who home garage vehicles have a benefit value of $500 in terms of the guidelines on reimbursement of work related expenses issued by DIR. (6) Yes, the Commonwealth meets the cost of insurance and registration. However, the SES are obliged to make an after tax contribution of $500 (for a 4 cylinder vehicle) or $700 (for a 6 cylinder vehicle) towards these costs. (7) Yes, all costs associated with the operation of the vehicles are borne by the Commonwealth including depreciation, repairs and maintenance, overheads and interest. (S) In relation to cars used by SES officers, the total cost to the agencies hiring the vehicles is the about $lO.Sm per annum. Individual agencies make decisions on the extent of home garaging of Zplated vehicles and DAS does not know this information.",169
