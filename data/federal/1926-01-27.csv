TUBERCULOSIS. EXPERIMENTS BY DR . SMALPAGE.",20
35,Sir NEVILLE HOWSE,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"On 4,910 0 0 the 20th January, in answer to a question 2 3 by the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), I promised to make a full statement this week about Dr Smalpage's method of treating tuberculosis. Briefly stated, the position in regard to his treatment is that. in March, 1925, Dr Smalpage first brought under the notice of the department the fact that he was obtaining satisfactory results by a certain process of preparation of an antitoxin against tubercle bacilli. In order to carry out this process the preparation of certain extracts was necessary, and at the Commonwealth Serum 'Laboratories the preparation of this extract was put in hand, aud the supplies were from time to time forwarded to Dr Smalpage. The preparation of anti-toxin was delayed on account of certain difficulties of a technical character, and, on the 7th January, 1926. an invitation was addressed by me to Dr to come to the Serum Laboratories and make use of the resources of the laboratories for the production of serum by his own method. The method just now beiug developed consists of utilizing an extract of the spleen for the. digestion of living tubercle bacilli. This digestion it is claimed, in the production of an endotoxin which upon injection into a horse stimulates the cells of the horse to the production of anti-toxin. anti-toxin which is used Smalpage for the treatment cases of tuberculosis. tempts have been made to produce an anti-toxin against tuberculosis, but, so far as is known, no previous attempt by the use of this particular method has been made. In view of the which attaches to any statement made by the Government, it is necessary to state, that, although the results which Dr Smalpage claims to have obtained are encouraging, still the department has not yet had before it the evidence which is necessary ta the formation of any estimate of t.he reliability of these results. series of cases, which must be carefully selected aud closely observed by independent specialists, must be treated for a sufficient period of time to enable a judgment to be formed as to the effect of this method of treatment. The in concert with Dr Smalpage, has undertaken to arrange that this series of test cases shall be dealt with in the six capital cities simultaneously, but it is necessary, in view of the numerous communications which have, been received from patients or their friends, to state that it will not be. Sir Neville Howse. possible to commence the treatment of this series of cases u n t i l at least one month hence. It is also necessary that the selection of the test cases shall be made by the specialists who will be observing the effect of treatment with a view to ascertaining the effect of the serum upon different classes of cases, and it will not be possible to give preference or consideration to any patient for any other reason than the opinion of the committee of specialists as to the suitability of the case for test purposes. Dr Smalpage is actively engaged upon the various stages in the preparation of this serum at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, and it is not practicable by any means to expedite the process. Dr Smalpage has very openly requested that accordingly, the department's officers should keep in Smalpage close touch with his work, and make in dependent experiments at various stages to corroborate or disprove his results, and arrangements have been made to this end so that the results of the laboratory tests may be available for consideration at the same time as the results of the tests from results, human patients. It is important to make acknowledgment to Dr Smalpage by letting it be known that he has intimated to us that he is prepared to transfer to It is this the Commonwealth Government, without by Dr auy"" conditions, for use within the Comof human monwealth, all of his rights in the proMany at- cess. The statement. I have just made wa3 approved by Dr Smallpage in a conference with me this morning, and the way is now clear for a complete test of the value of the serum for the responsibility treatment df tuberculosis patients. The Government has arranged to make an allowance to Dr Smalpage in order to meet his immediate personal expenses while the serum is being prepared, and it is necessary to emphasize, first, that it is uot intended to make any serum available until the tests have been comAtest- pleted, and this may take from three to six months. Dr Smalpage, of course,' will have supplies. . Secondly, so soon as the efficacy of the serum is established, a sufficient quantity will be made available for general use. department, The Government has gone to a good deal of expense in providing horses that have been inoculated, so that if the tests prove successful the supply of serum will be sufficient to meet any demand that may be made for it within the Commonwealth.

Honourable members who sit this side of thei House have every symextends pathy for the people of Tasmania, realizing, as we do, the disabilities result from Tasmania's isolation. Those lation. people certainly - have a claim for consideration at the hands of this Parliament, and we are justithe fied in taking the action necessary remove, as far as possible, the disabilities under which they labour. Consideration must be had to the fact that, as a tion of the Commonwealth, Tasmania is compelled to contribute towards expenfrom diture upon projects from which i not derive any direct benefit. I refer chiefly to the Commonwealth railway sure system. A line has already been .confit structed by the Commonwealth from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, and in the Northern Territory, and others . w i be constructed in the future in the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital Territory. The Commonwealth is also assisting the States to meet the expenditure that will be incurred in unifying-the railway gauges of Australia. Tasmania is responsible for a portion of the cost of those works, and has, therefore, a legitimate claim for some service in return. To me, there is only one way in which its requirements can be met. We should provide, not a partial service as the bill proposes, but a continuous service that would embrace both passenger and goods traffic. I believe that the people of Tasmania, desire to have a continuous service. W it h such a service that State would make much greater progress than it has made during the last ten or twenty years. It has been endowed by nature with all the potentialities for development. It possesses coal deposits, extensive timber areas, and splendid agricultural and mining country. In addition to those natural advantages, t has in the hydro-electric scheme one of the greatest power plants in Australia, which would enable manufacturing industries to be established if facilities were provided under which manufacturers in State could compete in the mainland markets. Tha bill proposes to relieve the Comsituation only in regard to passenger traffic, and only at a certain period of That will prove quite inadeouate. The Minister himself, in moving the motion for the second reading of the bill, said .that the measure related only to the apple season, which commences in on February of each year, and probably over two or TJiree months. That will not assist the State to develop nor that will it help it to keep its popuI t is well known that many strong young men born and reared in . Tasmania have been compelled to migrate to mainland to obtain employment. to That has happened, not because Tasmania has been unable to provide for the natural increase in her populaportion as well as for an increase of population by the admission of persons overseas, but because of the great t does disabilities under which that State labours. I do not think that this meai f passed will bestow any great beneon the island State. The people of Tasmania may think that it will do so, but time alone will reveal whether it will l l or not. Before I delivered the policy speech of the Labour party in the early part of the recent election campaign, the granting of assistance to Tasmania was taken into consideration by the members of the party. The constitutionality of the Government proposals was considered, and we decided that because of a doubt in that connection, in order to assist Tasmania legitimately, we would, if returned to power, provide a fleet of steamers to carry both passengers and goods, so that Tasmania would be assured - qf conjtinuoujs communication with the mainland. According to recent cables, an attempt is being made to dispose of some of the vessels belonging to the Commonwealth; but it would be better to employ them in a regular service to Tasmania, in order to assist that State. Last week a petition containing a number of requests, among which was one for the establishment of a permanent steamer service between the mainland and Tasmania, was presented to this House. If such a service were provided, the people of Tasmania would .know exactly where they stood and what obligations they could accept. ' Under this measure any benefits to be conferred apply solely to passenger traffic, and that during certain seasons of the year only.",22
37,Mr MABKS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The service for which this bill provides applies to tourist traffic only.,23
38,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"That is not satisfactory, because it will not assist to develop Tasmania. A permanent and continuous service is necessary.",23
39,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The permanent service the honourable gentleman suggests would not be so satisfactory as the proposal contained in this bill . The honourable member's suggestion refers to an Australian service only.,23
40,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Does the Minister contend that an up-to-date, regular service between the mainland and Tasmania would not provide for the needs of Tasmania as well as the measure before us ?",23
41,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It would not provide what this bill provides; ib would not enable produce to be conveyed to London. Mr Charlton,-Se e how Minister wriggles! Tasmania wants her produce carried not only to London, but to the different parts of Australia. If a regular service opsrated between Tasmania and the mainland, much of the produce of Tasmania could be disposed of in Australia; but, if necessary, it could also be shipped direct to London. Personally, I would be prepared to go further, and allow the Commonwealth vessels to carry that produce. There is nothing to prevent that from being done.",23
42,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,They are doing that now.,23
43,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,How often has the honourable member spoken of the disabilities from which Tasmania is suffering through lack of a regular service with the mainland of Australia.,23
44,Mr ATKINSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The honourable member's proposal would not give Tasmania what this bill proposes to give that State.,23
45,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) referred to the existing Commonwealth boats carrying the produce. Mr W . M . HUGHES - The Commonwealth Line of Steamers pays Australian rates.,23
46,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"All overseas vessels can carry produce from Tasmania as well as from Melbourne or Sydney. I am urging that, in addition, there should be a local service between Tasmania and the mainland to enable - the produce ' of Tasmania to be carried to any part of Australia.",23
47,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The Tasmanian Government tried to carry on such a service, and failed badly.",23
48,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It does not therefore follow that the scheme I have suggested would not be a success; but I doubt whether the Government's proposals, as embodied in this measure, will, if put into operation, be successful. I doubt the constitutionality of those proposals. We must be very careful regarding legislation of this kind. A few years ago legislation dealing with taxation matters was passed by us in good faith , but the first appeal proved it to be in valid. That has happened also in regard to other legislation. We were assured by all the legal talent on the other side that legislation recently passed to deport certain persons was valid, but the H i gh Court showed that it is not. In view of those experiences we must be particularly the careful. As a layman, not claiming to possess any legal knowledge, but using merely my own common sense and judgment, I express the opinion that this measure is unconstitutional, because it makes a distinction between States. Honourable members know that the Constitution lays it down very clearly that there shall be no distinction made between States or parts of States. Section 99 of the Constitution readsThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, _ commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part therof over another State or any part thereof. Will any honourable member argue that this bill does not give preference to any State ?",23
49,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It is intended, but specified.",24
50,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"There can ""be no doubt that it is intended.",24
51,Mr MANNING,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,It s benefits will not be confined to Tasmania only.,24
52,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The measure applies to Tasmania only. The his speech the other day gave us to understand that this legislation would apply in a uniform manner to all the States, but I ask honourable members to read themselves the clauses of the bill.",24
53,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Whic h clause makes distinction between States ?,24
54,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Clause 3.,24
55,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,That clause does not . Mr Charlton refer to States.,24
56,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,It says something about ports.,24
57,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,So do other clauses.,24
58,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I hope that the clause is otherwise. Minister is more correct in this instance than he was on a former occasion. Clause 3 provides for the addition of the following sub-sections to section 286 of the cipal act: 6. Where it is shown to the satisfaction the Governor General that the tourist traffic between any ports in the Commonwealth in the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth is being injured or retarded, and the Governor General is satisfied that is desirable that unlicensed ships bo allowed to engage in the trade, he may, hy notice published in the Gazette, grant permission licensed British ships of such size and speed as are specified' in the notice to engage in carriage of passengers between tliose ports, subject to such conditions (if any) such period as are set out in the notice. 7. The carriage of passengers between those ports, by a British ship of the description specified in any such notice and under conditions (if any), and during the period set out in the notice, shall not be deemed entween ports. gaging in the coasting trade. Those provisions do not say that the must apply to every port of Australia; provides for certain ports.",24
59,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The clause .says "" any ports.""",24
60,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Let ns suppose that it is thought that the tourist traffic between Sydney and Tasmania is being injured or retarded by some means, and that there are no complaints from the other parts of the - Commonwealth. A proclamation will be issued, providing that overseas vessels may carry 2 > as s e n g e r s between New South Wales and Tasmanian ports. That would be discrimination between not States, because the proclamation could apply to two States only.",24
61,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,It could apply to any State.,24
62,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The clause refers to "" a n y ports,"" and not "" all ports.""",24
63,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The words "" any ports "" Minister in mean "" all ports.""",24
64,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"No . If a proclamation is issued specifying one, two, or three ports, then it discriminates, and for is therefore unconstitutional.",24
65,Mr MANNING,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Is not the honourable a member assuming what would be in the proclamation rather than what is now m the bill? - I am referring to the olause itself. If it said definitely, "" every port in the Commonwealth,"" there would then be no discrimination between States. The intention of the Mr ' G. FRANCIS - The proclamation may specify ports in every State.",24
66,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The clause disprincriminates between States. Recently we have been made to look ridiculous by of appeals to the H i gh Court against our legislation. I firmly believe that this or legislation, if tested, will prove to be ultra vires. Possibly the law will affect it injuriously the shipping interests, and they will appeal to the High Court. Mr W . M . HUGHES - Does the honorto unable member doubt the validity of the the clause or of a proclamation under it ?",24
67,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,- A proclamation and for under the clause will be invalid.,24
68,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It might be invalid if it discriminated between States and parts the of States as such, but that would be quite different from a discrimination be",24
69,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Does the honorlaw able member intend to issue a proclamai t tion allowing vessels to carry passengers to any port?,24
70,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I do not intend to issue a proclamation at all . What the Constitution prohibits is discrimination between States and parts of States as such. A proclamation relating to ports, even though they were in different States, would not be a discrimination between States or parts of States as such. The Hig h Court has recently so decided. shall deal with the matter later.",24
71,Mr OHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I differ from the Attorney-General. Section 99 of the Constitution is very clear. If the At torney-General's contention were correct, there would be no need for this bill . He has ample legislation at present for his purpose. The remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs himself were rather ambiguous. He is reported in Hansard as follows: tain conditions in regard to. tourist traffic must prevail before any Gazette notice can be published.",25
72,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"But when it is published, it will apply equally to all the States.  cumstances must be equal before it is applied to them. The amendment will give reliefto Tasmania to the extent that the limitations of the Constitution will allow. In other words, the bil l will apply to Tasmania only, and cause no injustice to the other States. Mr W . M . HUGHES - The Minister's contention does not affect the clause at all.",25
73,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The right honortionality able member will admit that we have be largely guided by the Minister respectits ing the intention of measures introduced by him in this House. Debate would be - useless if we could not rely statements of the Minister in charge of the bill. He also statedAt the same time, it will create no crimination, nor do injustice to, any State which it does not apply. It will particularly apply to Tasmania, because the bona fide tourist traffic for which it' provides is of much greater volume to that State than it any other. That is very clear. The intention of the orable bill is to benefit Tasmania.",25
74,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Whereve r the condichallenged later. tions exist there the legislation wil l apply.,25
75,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It is about time that lay opinions were heeded, because legal opinions have been incorrect f some time past. The Constitution w i not permit of such a discrimination as is proposed. A measure such this must apply in a general way, legislation. and if under it a proclamation is issued it must treat all the States alike, and allow passengers to be carried by overseas vessels between all the ports of Australia. I should like to see this legislation tested in the Hig h Court. I Mr MANN - It will benefit all tourists wishing to visit Tasmania.",25
76,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"That is so, but supposing 2,000 tourists wished to go to the West, would the proclamation include them?",25
77,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I shall certainly ask for their inclusion. .,25
78,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The bill is unconstitutional because it allows of discrimination between States. If the Attorney General's contention that the bill is constitutional is correct, why amend the Navigation Act at all ?. Parliament in 1912 passed an act for the control of navigation. Under it a proclamation could be made by the Governor General in Council permitting overseas vessels to trade between certain ports within the Commonwealth. Then,in 1920, when Mr Massy Greene was Minister for Trade and ' Customs, this House passed a measure whose object was to permit the Minister, in cases where he deemed it necessary, to suspend the pro- 1 visions of the Navigation Act to permit overseas ships to carry passengers between certain ports. At that time thei constituof such legislation was questo tioned, and the Minister himself doubted constitutionality. In introducing this amending Navigation Bill on the 1st July, 1920, Mr Massy Greene said, as upon the reported in HansardThere is considerable constitutional :difficulty in the way of exempting any part of Australia from the provisions of the Act, bediscause we are not allowed, in our trade and to commerce legislation, to differentiate between different portions of Australia.",25
79,Sir BOBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,But we did that in the yery act by stating that certain provisions should is to not apply to vessels trading between Fremantle and Adelaide.,25
80,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"We did that; but the honmember will admit that the provision is of doubtful constitutionality, and may be That legislation has never been challenged, and is still on the statute-book. What, therefore, is the need for this bil l ? It o r has been introduced to permit oversea l l vessels to carry passengers to and from Tasmania and the mainland; but there is as already power to do so under existing Actually it has been brought in because the Government endeavoured to gain votes at the eO ection by promising to pass legislation to assist the tourist traffic of Tasmania.",25
81,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,What is the section to which the honourable gentleman refers ?,26
82,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I am referring to section 286. Mr W. M . HUGHES - What was amendment made in 1920 ?>,26
83,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The act of 1920 amended the act passed by the right honourable gentleman in 1912. It was passed to allow permits to be granted to oversea ships if the coastal shipping was is found to be inadequate, and it gave power to the Minister to issue such pervantage mits. Under the measure introduced by the righ t honourable gentleman, as under Tasmania V this clause, the issue of a proclamation was provided for. We are now passing legislation similar to that passed, and about the constitutionand ality of which Mr Massy Greene pressed grave doubts. This legislation will no doubt injure existing companies engaged in the coasting trade of Australia, and as a result they will appeal against it . If their appeal is successful this Parliament will be placed in a very lows:bad light indeed. We need to be very careful about' legislation of this k in d If , as the Attorney-General contends, this measure will do what is desired, preseas vious legislation of the same character should have had similar effect.",26
84,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,This is not mination so much as subtle circumvenean tion.,26
85,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I should to put it as strongly as that, but it is evident that the honourable member for Wannon, who is an ex-Minister, absomade lutely agrees with my contention. Navigation Commission dealt with this question, and in their report on the subthat ject, Messrs. Prowse and Seabrook say, with regard to the passenger trafficThe oversea companies will not bother about made:applying for permits. By obtaining permits they pick up only the leavings of the interstate vessels, and run the risk of serious industrial trouble. An example of this phase of the posithe tion recently came before the commission, during a strike by the seamen engaged on the s.s. Katoomba, trading between Sydney and ation."" Fremantle. Owing to this "" hold-up "" of the interstate vessel a number of intending sengers from the port of Albany to the eastern States attempted to obtain a permit to travel by the White Star liner Suevic due at Albany on 15th May last. The Director Navigation was interviewed, and stated ho would under the circumstances recommend that a permit be granted to the Suevic to lift passengers from Albany, if Dalgety and Company, the agents for the White Star Line, applied in the usual manner. Dalgety and Company were approached, They declined to apply for a permit and stated that their reason was in consequence of the experience of other oversea companies, which had met with in the dustrial trouble by carrying coastal passengers. Two honourable members opposite who were members of the Navigation Commission are of opinion, tfn the evidence submitted to tliem, that if this proposal put into operation the oversea shipping companies will not take adof it . If that be so, how will this measure relieve the disabilities of  has "" got the shipowners' wind up."" already Mr Charlton - Senator s E l l i o t t Duncan, who were colleagues of the exhonorable member on the Navigation Conunission, made the following statement in a separate reportThe complaint of the travelling public, which is fairly general throughout Australia, was voiced by one witness at Brisbane as fol""Wc were advised by the Deputy Director of Navigation that when the interstate passen. ger steamers were over-booked, if application were made for a permit to travel on an overvessel it would be granted. This course has been adopted on one or two occasions. But it is difficult to arrange the matter since the companies will not tell you until Friday, discri afternoon or Saturday evening whether they take the passengers."" : Exactly similar complaints were placed before the commission at Sydney and Hobart not like One Hobart witness stated:"" I am informed that no application for a permit was made. You know that provision io in the act to meet such cases as this ?-Yes, , but by the time the . permit is The granted, the boat is gone."" In the case of the Moerahi we did not get permit until the last minute, and then only 12 passengers travelled by that vessel. In Brisbane the complaint is stated by the Deputy-Director of Navigation to have been ""Where applications have been made for permits, do you make inquiry?-There has to be an application in writing that the service by coastal boat is inadequate. I always confirmed that by getting into touch with the secretary of the Australian Steamships FederpasI t Would appear, therefore, that this partial, service sought to be provided for is unsatisfactory, aiid the overseas steamof"" ship owners do not take kindly to the prothat posal. They do not want to come into conflict with the Australian people, and are therefore doubtful about giving facilities for the picking up of passengers between interstate ports. This legislation is of doubtful validity, and it w i l from meeting' the requirements qf Tasmania. Even where permits have been granted it has been found difficult to in duce oversea ships to carry passengers to Tasmania or any other State. though the legislation might be shown to be effective, would it not constitute a clanger to Australian shipping to have these oversea sbips, many of which are manned by coloured crews, paid very much lower wages than are paid to Australian seamen, brought into competition with our shipping? This is an aspect of the matter which deserves grave consideration. We cannot hope to keep up conditions and wages in the Commonwealth if we have coloured labour .ships running in competition with our coastal shipping. Let us consider for a moment the wages paid on oversea and Australian ships. For seamen, the British rate per month is £ 9 , and the Australian rate £16 5s.; for firemen and greasers the Brit i sh rate is £9 10s., the Australian rate £18 5s.; for trimmers the British rate is £9, and the Australiau £16 os.; for stewards the B r it i sh rate is £9 5s., aud the Australian rate £ 1 3 ; for cooks, the British rate is £9 10s., and the Australian rate £17 l is . per month. Lascars employed on overseas ships receive wages at the rate of £ 2 to £ 3 per month.",26
86,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,We have suffered in Tasmania from a shipping strike every year since 1917.,27
87,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"""Unfortunately strikes occur in every part of the world, and we should like to discover whereby they might be entirely avoided. Strikes occur in connection with the ships which are referred to in this measure. The recent shipping trouble in Ausinside tralia was due to a strike on ships from overseas. It is a great take to hold up this country to ridicule by advertising, Australia as land of continuous industrial turmoil The industrial situation of Australia will compare more than favourably with that of Great Britain , America and other countries. The sooner we let people abroad know that the statements that, are made from time to time in the press concerning our industrial position are accurate, the better it will be for the prosperity of this country.",27
88,Mr FOSTEB,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The honourable gentlel be far man's statement is inaccurate.,27
89,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It is absolutely correct, and if the honourable member doubts it , I can bring figures to support it. The sooner the facts' are realized, and Even people cease to decry this country, the better it wil l be for the future of Australia and its people. We may do many things here for political purposes, but in dealing with this bill we should consider it on its merits. I agree that Tasmania has been suffering under great disabilities. I want to do something to help that State, but I do not think that this is the proper way in which to give it relief. That is the difference between the Government and myself. I think there should be a regular line of boats carrying passengers and goods, so that Tasmanian manufacturers might be in a position to make arrangements for the transport of goods at certain times by certain boats. Honourable members may ask, "" How are we to get these boats running?"". I venture to say that had I the power to establish a shipping line I could establish one, and guarantee Tasmania a continuous service. That is a big thing to say.",27
90,Mr SEABROOK,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"At a profit, or at a loss?",27
91,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"What is there to prevent the Commonwealth from running a line of steamers at a profit if private companies can do so? There is nothing to prevent any industry from being carried on by the Commonwealth at a profit, if it can be profitably carried on by private enterprise.",27
92,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Our experience of guarantees of continuous running has a means been rather unfortunate.,27
93,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I should not put myself in the position of giving a guarantee from outside, I should give it from this House. I venture to say that a continuous service with Tasmania could misbe established. It is all a question of management, - and the footing upon which a it is placed. I would remind honourable . members that there is nothing which prevents industrial troubles in connection with oversea ships. They might be held up at any time as the result of strikes.",27
94,Mr MARRS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The honourable gentleman says that hn would give a guarantee.,27
95,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I say that I could in - give Tasmania a permanent line of boats to carry passengers and goods. I have every reason to believe that I could guarantee a continuous service. that that is an important statement to make.,27
96,Mr MARRS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Is the honourable man quite serious in making that statement in view of the recent shipping trouble ?,28
97,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I am. There is room for a' difference of opinion on the matter, and honourable members opposite are entitled tQ' differ from me on the subject, and will , no doubt, feel justified in doing so in view of what has been happening for quite a long time. That is not to say that the difficulties which have been met could not be surmounted. Even if that were not so, how much better off would the people of Tasmania be in getting a spasmodic service for two or three months in the year, provided that uo in dustrial trouble arose in connection with, oversea boats!  a half measure. The whole Navigation Act should be repealed.",28
98,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member agrees with me that this is only a half measure. One of the chief reasons why I criticise this measure as I do, is that I desire, so far as possible, to retain the shipping industry of Australia for our own white people. I want to prevent a competition by ships manned by coloured labour.  the ships.",28
99,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The question is not who owns the ships, but how they are manned, and whether we desire to. live up to the ideals of the White Australia policy. That is the chief principle involved in this legislation. We may wish to live up to the White Australia ideals, and to prevent the occurrence of industrial troubles, but we shall have great difficulty in doing so if we permit ships manned by coloured labour, paid low rates of wages, to come into competition with Australian ships in the trade of this country.",28
100,Mr TVIARKS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Coul d not the use coloured labour be met by a tax on the difference between the draft of the ships carrying black crews, and that of those carrying white crews.",28
101,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member thiuks that the difficulty might be got over by taking into consideration the drafts of thedifferent ships, b ut this bill deals only with the position arising I realise when Australian ships are unable to carry the traffic.",28
102,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,In the opinion of the gentleGovernor-General.,28
103,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Yes . The object is to enable Tasmania to retain the tourist traffic. Even if the bill proved ameliorative, it would not go far enough. The making of the proclamation would depend upon the Government of the day. If the vessels owned by the Government were used for the carriage of passengers and goods Tasmania would be given an opportunity of developing her territory, - finding employment for her own people, and increasing her population. No matter from what angle the present proposal is viewed, it, merely amounts to tinkering with the problem. Even if the bill be constitutional, can it be more helpful than the amending legislation of 1920? If it will not take the matter any further, why waste our time in passing it?",28
104,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The people of Tasmania think that it will be beneficial.,28
105,Mr OHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The people of Tasmania know nothing about the matter. How can they be expected to understand the constitutional aspects of this proposed legislation?,28
106,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member said that if the bill was constitutional, it would be ineffective, and I say that the people of Tasmania think that it would be effective.",28
107,Mr OHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"If the honourable member asked the people of Tasmania whether they would choose a limited service, dependent on the consent of the Governor General from time to time, or a permanent service, they would certainly prefer the latter. The power to provide the necessary service already exists, but, up to the present time, it has not been exercised. The Attorney-General (Mr . Latham) may be able toi cause me to modify my views concerning the constituof tionality of the bill , but my main objection to legislation of this k in d is that it opens the door to black labour. If . our ship-owners find that the measure interferes with their business, they will probably take legal action, and if they cannot circumvent it in the High Court, they will endeavour to bring down the men's wages on the plea that the employested ment of coloured labour in the interstate trade has detrimentally affected their interests. There is no need to introduce this canker into the industrial or the shipping world. The difficulty can,' as . I have already said, be overcome by the pie. Government ""using its own vessels. shall listen with patience to any arguStates, and ments that can be advanced by the Attorney-General or any other honourable be given for, say, a White member in connection with the measure.",28
108,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Hav e the overseas panies said that if this amendment made they will send their vessels to mania ?,29
109,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I understand that no agreement has been arrived at.,29
110,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I was impression that the companies had been approached and had stated that they would not be prepared to make the t to Tasmania. I am speaking of the time when I was in office.,29
111,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"- I understand that no arrangement has been arrived at, and that the companies haA e not been aptain proached. Apparently, we are now specuprovide lating in the hope that something w i come out of this bill. I have promised to assist Tasmania as far as I possibly can, but I want to do so along legitimate lines. I shall be chary, indeed, about supporting this measure. TJidess 1 can be the English rate, and more convinced than I now am as to advisability of passing - it, I shall vote nationalities. against it . The Government would well advised to withdraw it .  I have already indicated by way of interjection, the measure does not, in my opinion, go half far enough. The Government would bo well advised to act .upon and. adopt the majority recommendation of the royal commission that investigated this matter very closely, and repeal coastal provisions of the Navigation A c This bill deals only with the. tourist traffic, which is of the utmost importance to Tasmania. Formerly the overseas vessels lifted the apple crop in accordance with a regular time-table, enabling the f r u it to be placed on the London markets to the best advantage. I submit that the White Australia - I policy is not affected by this bill. The question at issue is not a racial seaat all. The shipping combine is interto the extent of about 80 per cent, in the vessels engaged in the interstate trade. When the Navigation Act Avas brought into force, the shipping companies formulated their plans so that the Australian financial interests should take all the plums out of the Australian When passengers used to Avait I at Albany for berths to the eastern there Avas ' no interstate vessel available, permission Would Star liner, to take the passengers, if Dalgety comand Company, the agents for that line, is applied for a permit. It meant that the Tasconvenience of the people) of Australia was made dependent on the agent for an overseas shipping company applying for a permit. That was the great Aveakness of the act. I maintain that the Governunder . the ment should take the reins into its OAvn hands, and do what is necessary to prevent the trade of Tasmania, or any other r ip portion of the CommouAA'ealth, from being hampered in the interests of a few individuals. It is necessary that the shipping service to that State, should be as frequent|as possible. If Ave desire to mainour White Australia policy, AVO must r shipping facilities for the Avliole l l of the people. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) shoAved the difference between the wages paid to British seamen and those paid, to Australian seamen under the arbitration award. The Australian seaman receives about double the English the rate is double that of some other If , Will a sense of be gratitude, the Australian seamen had recognized that they had been placed in a better position than that' of ""any other seamen in the Avorld, and had endeavoured to maintain an efficient service instead of holding up shipping at every turn, the payment of these high rates would have been warranted. But these men have taken part in strikes with a frequency that has not been equalled the in any other country/ Parliament must t . consider the interests, .not of one small s'ction, but of the Avhole of the.people. I support the bill , but, as I have already indicated, I do not think it goes of Tasmania half far enough. Mr SEABROOK ""(Franklin) [4.2S]. congratulate the Government on bringing in this bill, and I compliment  clear exposition of the difficulties under which Tasmania labours. I was also glad to hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) say that he realized the difficult position under which Tasmania was placed by the Navigation Act. The honourable member stated, further, that he believed the bill to be unconstitutional. Surely, if all th© members of this Chamber are agreed that one State is being badly treated under Commonwealth legislation, it should be no difficult matter to reiieve that State of its disabilities in that regard. I propose to point out some of the drawbacks suffered by Tasmania under the act. For over thirty years oversea mail .vessels had been calling at Hobart. They were first induced to go there by the pioneer apple-growers of Tasmania, who had, through their bankers, to guarantee the freight before the fruit could be lifted. That trade led to the development of the tourist traffic. Each year the tourist traffic by these boats increased, and in 1914 they carried 1,500 passengers to Tasmania. The smaller vessels will not be affected by tourists being allowed to travel on the mail boats; people of that clas? will travel only under the beet conditions, ancl are prepared to pay more for comfortable accommodation. In moving the second reading of this bill the Minister for Trade and Customs stated that Papua, the Mandated Territories, Norfolk Island, and the Northern Territory have been removed from the operation of the Navigation Act in accordance witL. the recommendation of the Navigation Commission. The evidence before the commission clearly showed that the act placed a great disability on the islands and territories, and they must have benefited considerably by being exempted from the provisions relating to the coasting trade. Surely the same. treatment should be meted out to Tasmania. It also is an island, and is dependent upon shipping for intercourse with the mainland. Without adequate and continuous shipping facilities it cannot develop. When proof is adduced that certain statutes operate to the detriment of one State, it is the duty of the Commonwealth Parliament to grant relief. If the relief to Tasmania does not take the form of exemption from harassing legislation, the State must, in order to pay its way, approach this Parliament for further financial assistance. Under existing conditions it is being crippled and crushed. The Minister for Trade ancl Customs said that the shipping service to Tasmania is adequate. That adjective seems most inappropriate to the circumstances that now obtain. Evidence was given before the Navigation Commission that passengers have to book their berths from three to four weeks ahead of the date of sailing, and that many of them have to accept a "" shakedown"" in the social hall or smoke-room, whilst hundreds of would be tourists can get no accommodation at all. Surely those conditions contradict the statement that the service is adequate.",29
112,Mr MARRS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Every year I have to book six months ahead. Mr SEABROOK: - When people have to do that, or pay first-class fares for a second-class berth, or ""shakedown,"" the service cannot be adequate. The Peninsular and Oriental and Orient steamers do not carry cargo between States, but the passengers they will be allowed lo carry to Hobart will help them to pay the steaming and port charges incidental to their calls to load apples. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) admitted that disabilities are imposed upoii Tasmania by the Navigation Act, and said that he would institute a special service between it and the mainland. If he offers a service by the . Commonwealth Line it will be useless to Tasmania, because tourists will not utilize it . The accommodation on the ships of the Commonwealth Line is worse than that of the interstate boats.  Government sell the State ships?",30
113,Mr SEABROOK,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Yes . The State had some cargo ships, but lost such an enormous amount of money in their running that the Government was glad to get rid of them. The Commonwealth Line might be able to provide - an adequate cargo service, but it could not cater for the tourist traffic, which is of immense importance to the State. I agree with the honourable member for Forrest that this bill does not go far enough. A.t one time there was a good steamer service between New Zealand and Melbourne, via Hobart, but because of the Navigation Act, that has been tinued, and Tasmania has lost all trade with the Dominion, and also direct service between Hobart and Zealand and Melbourne. only Australian capital city that has steamer communication with other tals; there is only one ocean service Hobart, and that is to Sydney. bane people who desire to visit must travel to Sydney or Melbourne by train. That severely penalizes the island State, which is recognized to be the best gers, health and pleasure resort for living in the tropical portions tralia. There is no passenger between Hobart and Brisbane, bourne, or Adelaide, or Perth, ancl even ships of the Gommonwealth calling at Hobart during a strike have fused to load cargo for Western tralia, notwithstanding that the were half empty. If such things to continue to be done belonging to the Commonwealth vernment, the sooner sold the better for the Australian I congratulate the Government having listened to reason matter. On dozens of occasions Tasmanian people have asked the Gonot vernment for relief of this kind, but was refused until the Prime realized recently the seriousness mania's position. At one time we that the State would become the home of many great manufacturing and in order to encourage their establishment, the Tasmanian Government, commendable foresight, carried. out a great hydro-electric power scheme cost of over £3,000,000. standing that expenditure, regard to manufactures have been pointed, wholly because of the operation of the Navigation Act and the tion Act. Tasmania can never become great manufacturing State while two measures remain upon the statutehonorable . book. It may be likened to a baby in alongside a man: every time the man' turns the baby is crushed. being crushed by the Navigation Act and the Arbitration Act. The relief by this bill is the least that this ParliaNavigation ment can do to help the people of that sible. State to pay their way and redeem their credit. Honourable members of the Oppotirely Mr Seabrook. disconsition know how Tasmania has bee-i its crucified by Commonwealth legislation, the and I ask them to do bare justice to its New people by supporting this bill. I hope Hobart is the there will be no delay in passing the meanj> sure, because the first "" apple "" boat capiw ill arrive in Tasmania on the 9th from February, and it is highly desirable that Bristhe Peninsularand Oriental and Orient Tasmania companies should be able to notify the public by advertisement that their vessels will be able to carry interstate passenpeople Mr YATES (Adelaide) [ 4 . 4 5 ] - I in of Austend to oppose the bill, even though I service realise that my opposition will not pre : or Melvent its being passed. This is a portion of the price that has to be paid for returnLine when ing the present Government to power. reThe honourable member for Franklin (Mr . AusSeabrook) likened Tasmania to a baby holds who shares a bed with a man. The only are likeness that I can see between the State by ships and a baby is that it can squeal Goas loudly as any baby, and invarithe Line is ably for no reason; it thinks that it has people. been h u r t when it has not. The whole of upon the evidence taken by the Navigation in this Commission in Tasmania was prompted by the the desire to show that that State could continue to struggle on unless overit sea vessels were allowed to call at its Minister ports, but it completely failed to prove of Tasthat the Navigation Act had been rehoped sponsible for any happening tending to bring Tasmania to its present decadent industries, condition.  with members to read the evidence.",30
114,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I also hope that they at a will . I was a member of that commisBut, notwithsion, and I intend to quote from the eviour hopes in dence taken by it . I shall not, as two disapother honourable members did, refrain from mentioning certain important facts. ArbitraThe honourable member for Franklin said a that there is not now a service between those Tasmania and New Zealand. I invite members to read the evidence bed of representatives of the shipping companies, setting out the reason for the disTasmania is continuance of that service. They will not find a scintilla of evidence upon which offered could be based the assumption that the Act was in any way responOn the contrary, the discontinuance complained of was. due ento the re-organization which was carried out by the shipping companies. Time and again questions were asked regarding the position prior to and after the war, aud it was clearly proved that the alteration was due to the experience gained during the war, and between the termination of the war and the proclamation of the Navigation Act. During the war the shipping services of the Commonwealth were commandeered and controlled by the Commonwealth Government, and the boats were rationed out. When the companies again assumed control, instead of competing against each other, they reorganized their services and sent vessels only where the trade was sufficient to warrant their, being, sent. The proposal contained in the bill is only the thin end of th© wedge. The honourable member  to secure permission for overseas vessels to trade between Albany and Bunbury and the eastern states, and between Geraidton and Perth. He desires to restore that unfair competition, under which, prior to the proclamation of the act, the flotsam and jetsam of cheap labour boats from the Old World had an advantage over the Commonwealth shipping lines, which observed White Australian conditions. The evidence taken by the commission shows that, at the time it visited Western Australia, a greater quantity of timber was being exported from that State than at any time prior to the war. Arrangements had then been made to lift every stick of timber offering within six months, although the amounts exceeded any previous quantities. The representatives of the shipping - companies produced schedules showing the passenger and goods capacity of their vessels, the number of passengers who had travelled between given points, and the amount of empty space that they had on every ship. In 99 cases out of 100 a greater amount of passenger and tonnage space was available than was utilized.  is a-great advocate for the combine.",31
115,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The combine is at least observing the spirit and the letter of the policy that has been adopted by the Australian nation, in that it pays fair wages to, and provides decent conditions for, those whom it employs. Our shipping companies do not wish to see the - cream of their business taken by those who are not bound by any regulation relating to wages, hours of working, breathing space, manning scale or wireless provision, but are content to follow old world ideas as to the manner in which men who "" go down to the sea in ships "" shall live. Those conditions were changed on the Australian coast by the legislation of the Commonwealth. We should protect our shipping industry a3 we protect any other industry. Almost every week proposals are brought forward in this Parliament to grant a bounty to assist and give an impetus to one or another of our industries. The only thing that has given an impetus to our shipping industry is the Navigation Act. the advantages of which honourable members opposite now seek to whittle away. If the Minister (Mr . Pratten) states the f a d s  able member a few.",32
116,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"If they do not uphold my contention they will be in contradiction to those that were stated by .the honourable gentleman's predecessor. In 1923 the then Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) was appealed to, and dealt with the matter over the head of his colleague, the then Minister for Trade and Customs. In a letter that he wrote he stated the case full y, and gave facts that furnish a complete answer to the reasons which have been advanced today for removing from the act the safeguards for which our seamen have fought for so many years, and that OUT shipping companies have a right to expect in a domain that should belong solely to them. John Boss Johnston, president of the Hobart Chamber of Commerce, retail merchant and importer, was asked-se e page.317, question 9291:But has the Navigation Aet diminished the number of people coming to Tasmania?

That matter was fair l y well investigated. I did not ask many tions relating to it , because I thought it was the right of the Tasmanian repreevidence sentatives upon the commission to bring light any factor that had hampered export trade. In reply to Senator Hugh, the witness stated-hi s evidence one-sided statements. appears on page 3190372. The ""Bay"" boats lift a lot of stuff from this State?-Yes . 0373.

122,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I dare say it is. They excepwant a boat every week; but when they asked to pay the cost of running them The companies in Australia pay high of wages, employ white labour, and observe decent conditions. Is their trade to be taken from them by oversea shipping companies that observe whatever conditions they like, and frequently employ black labour ? I again liken Tasmania to a baby, but in this case it is the baby who cries for a cake of soap, and not be happy u n t i l he gets it .  quesa one-sided nature was given.",33
123,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"We obtained all the that was available. Whilst the to commission was sitting in Tasmania the the honourable member for Forrest did not Mcsuggest that the witnesses were making He is not fair when he now makes that suggestion. Mr E . RILEY - This must have been a very happy commission than - Mr YATES - The commission was a happy one, because we realized that we represented the two sides of the question. more We were there to preserve, if possible, that monument of legislation which stands out among the legislation of the world, to keep the.

125,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It is workable. This or bill has been introduced only because of pressure brought to bear upon the Government l o upset industrial conditions in the Commonwealth. This Parliament should be loath to lay sacrilegious hands upou legislation which took so long to evolve and which has had such splendid results as have attended the Navigation Act.  leader admits that Tasmania is suffering from disabilities. Mr YATES' - That is due to her in sular position; if we could bridge Bass strait, Tasmania's position would be greatly eased.' But Tasmania's disadvantages should not be removed at the expense of the shipping companies and their employees. Next, we shall have Now South Wales members complaining that North Shore is at a' disadvantage compared with the southern side of Sydney Harbour. Honourable members have stated that both Mr Hughes and the present Prime Minister promised relief to Tasmania. That was because of the "" s q u e a l in g"" of some of the people of that State. 1 point out that on the facts and figures given in evidence before the Navigation Commission, of which I was a member, that relief was not justified to the extent sought. It Avas SIIOAVII that Tasmania was not suffering to the extent that she imagined because of the operations of the Navigation Act. . This outcry is nothing neAv. The commission which inquired into this subject was the outcome of the agitation of that time regarding the Navigation Act. In giving evidence before the commission, Mr John Boss-Johnston read a letter which he had received from the ex-Prime Minister. That letter I shall read in full , as it bas a direct bearing on this subject. saysWith reference to your letter of the ISth March relative to the effect of the Navigation Act on the trade of Tasmania, I desire to inform you that, in view of the importance of the matter, and of the fact that reference is made in your letter to statements made by me on the occasion of my visit to Hobart on 1st February, your communication has been held over for"" my personal attention. You quote me - as saying ""on the occasion mentioned, "" The ships arranged for can carry twice as many apples as will be available for them. The latest estimate of the Tasmanian fruit crop for overseas this season is 1,000,000 cases, and the steamers scheduled to call Would, after providing for mainland requirements, have space available to take 2,000,000 cases from Tasmania. Can you, in the face of these figures, say that the Act is inflicting any injury on your fruit trade?"" and offer the comment that the figures ns to production being correct, the information given by mc as to the space available was quite incorrect. In reply to* this, I would state that I have had tJie data upon which I based my remarks carefully revieived, and I find that the latter. Avere' at the time they were made, a perfectly accurate statement of the position. My information was obtained from an authoritative source-the shipping people AVIIO handle refrigerated shipping in Australia. It showed that at that time 29 ships A\ere tentatiA ely T T fixed to take, in the aggregate, nearly 2.000,000 cases of fruit from Hobart. And hail conditions in the refrigerated products export trade remained as they were, as appeared likely, there is no doubt whatever that tliese ships would have actually taken away every case of fruit that the Tasmanian groAvers could offer. But the British markets for meat and butter, which at that time Avere perfectly dead, shortly afterwards reA'ived, and in order to apportion the tonnage available in Australia evenly between the trades concerned, the committee controlling the refrigerated ships, which is. in no Avay connected Will the Government or under Government control, Avitlidrew certain A-essels that Avere listed for Tasmania's fruits, and made them available to carry meat and butter. I have now obtained from ray colleague the Minister for Trade and Custom's a report as to this year's fruit shipments from Tasmania. This is made up to the end of April, which practically completes the export season. I am surprised and gratified to learn that, including a parcel of 35,000 cases which are to be sent by the BaraiUnc this month, the exports of Tasmanian fruit Avill reach the record figure of 1,362,000 cases. I learn that there still remain some 200,000 cases of f r u it ' for which space to British markets cannot be obtained. From inquiries made among the shipping authorities, it is ascertained that the reason Ai'hy these apples could not be taken was that there was not available in Australia and New Zealand sufficient refrigerated space to take aAvay the fruit, meat, and butter offering. Tasmanian growers are not the only sufferers, as I am informed quantities of meat and butter have also been It shut out. I am also in a position to definitely state, on the authority of the shipping people who handled these vessels, and Avhq, it must be admitted, can speak with authority on the matter, that the 'Navigation Act is not responsible in any AA'ay for the shortage of ships. Had there been no Navigation Act, Tasmania would not have shipped a single additional case of apples. A statement has been made that but for the Act three P. and O. steamers would have A-isited Hobart and lifted between them some 60,000 eases of apples. I learn that two out of the three vessels referred to were definitely fixed for mainland ports months before the apple season opened. And I am also given to understand that, even if these three ships had been scheduled to call at Hobart, an equiA'alent space in some one or other of the boats which have been sent to that port would have been allotted instead to mainland ports, so that Tasmanian exporters Would not haA'e been benefited in any degree by their calling. Reference to the gentlemen who trol the export of fruit from Tasmania will convince you, if such is necessary, of correctness of my statement. The Minister for Customs has publicly challenged any to prove, by any substantial evidence, leaving out of account these three P. and 0. ships, vessels which might possiblyhave called, which in any case are insignificant from a fruit-lifting point of view, a single ship average refrigerated capacity omitted Hobart from her itinerary on account of the. Navigaenjoys tion Act. And I desire to point out, and emphasize the fact, that the Navigation Act does not interfere in the slightest degree oversea ships bringing cargo to Australia taking cargo away from Australia. In this regard they are on exactly 'the same footing as the}' were before the Act came into operation. Touching now on the passenger traffic with the mainland, in regard to which you complain that the service provided by interstate licensed steamers is inadequate, have obtained full reports on this matter which go to show that the Riverina ana Westralia, the bwo licensed boats which have been engaged in the trade between Sydney Hobart, have accommodation for 310 and passengers respectively, and that there has been a single occasion from 1st July,- 1921, when the coasting trade provisions of the Navigation Act commenced, up to the end last month, on which the accommodation either of these vessels has been fully occupied. Tliere may be, as you state, some few people who Would take the trip from Sydney to Hobart if allowed to do so on a Peninsular Oriental or Orient boat, but who decline travel on the local steamers. Many of tliese, however, still visit the island, proceeding rail to Melbourne and crossing to ""Launceston by the fast and comfortable vessels employed in the Melbourne-Tasmania service. In case, it is impossible to consider the alteration of the law merely to meet the convenience these fastidious few. That letter gets to the crux of this questo tion-. The whole of the evidence the commission was to the same effect. From the mass of evidence taken it difficult to find anyfacts to justify introduction of this' legislation. position has not changed since Hughes wrote 'that letter. Figures lating to the tourist traffic of Tasmania show that in recent yea-rs it has increased; it is now very little different from what it was in pre-war days, and before passing of the Navigation Act. it is almost impossible to obtain accomsatisfied modation in Tasmania during the tourist season. The honourable member Franklin (Mr Seabrook) knows that, beCourt has not expressly cause of the growth in tourist traffic beopinion, tween Brisbane and Tasmania, Queensland Tourist Bureau had to be enment. larged, and its staff increased. Mr Yates. concause it offers some relief to the men the employed on the ships has the Navigation Act been blamed for Tasmania's preone sent position. I would not change places that, with the men who go down to the sea in notwithstanding the advantbut ages that they are said to enjoy. It of has been said that Tasmania is insular. I say that a sailor's life is insular; ho none of the benefits of home life, to and even when at sea he is not permitted with to intermingle with the passengers. I for vessels employing Dlack labour are permitted to engage in this trade, I should like honourable members to inspect the forecastle *of those vessels, and then say if they are agreeable to such conditions the obtaining on the Australian coast merely I to satisfy the whims of a "" fastidious few,"" as they were termed by the ex-Prime Minister. In justice to the men and employed on the vessels, as well as to the 170 shipping companies who are engaged in not an industry, no less than are those in the pastoral, agricultural or manufacturing of industries, I shall vote against any aton tempt to undermine the Navigation Act .",33
126,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [5.14] - Tb e constitutional valiand dity of the bill before the House having to been questioned, I purpose addressing some remarks to that aspect of the subby ject before us. In dealing with this matter, I speak as I did when replying to any objections which were brought against certain legislation which was before us of last session, to which reference has been made in the pressnt debate. Speaking with reference to that legislation, which had do with deportation, I said that I had before had sufficient experience in constitutional cases to warn me to abstain from guaris anteeing the validity of any measure the upon which the High Court had not The pronounced. That statement is to be Mr found in the Hansard report of my speech reat page1095 of V o l . III . , for the session 1925, and it applies also to. th© measure now under consideration. I recognize, however, that it is only the proper that the House, before passIndeed, ing this measure, should be reasonably of its constitutionality. While it is difficult - to give a guarantee on a for question of law upon which the Highpassed an the House is entitled to ask for a reasonable assurance that this legislathe tion is within the powers of the. ParliaTo this aspectof the matter Z Only beaddress myself purely as a lawyer. Section 99 of the Constitution say3 thatThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part of over another State or part thereof. The power of Parliament to deal with navigation also depends upon section 98 of the Constitution, which readsThe power of Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State. A measure dealing with navigation is obviously a law with respect to trade and commerce; but Parliament legislates in passing such a measure under and subject to the rule that it shall not give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. There is no decision of the High Court interpreting this particular section of the Constitution; but it has been referred to in two cases which have been determined by the High Court. In those cases the validity of enactments was challenged on the ground that they were inconsistent with section 99 and section 51, sub-section 2, of the Constitution. The power of the Government to legislate as to taxation is conferred by section 51, sub-section 2, subject to this condition- "" But so as not to discriminate between States or parts of States."" . Honourable members will observe that there is a similarity between the wording of section 51, sub-section 2"" discriminate between States or parts of States,"" and that of section 99 --""no t give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof."" The matter was first discussed in the High Court in what is generally known as the Harvester case-Barger' s case-the report of which appears on page 41 of the 6th volume of the Commonwealth ""Law Reports. court's decision in the case was that the "" new protection "" legislation of the Commonwealth was invalid. In this connection I would Tem ark that on a large number of occasions the legislation of this Parliament has been declared invalid, though it might be thought from what has been said by honourable members opposite, that that had happened for the first time within the last few weeks. As a matter of fact, it has not happened with regard to the legislation to which they have referred, because that legislation has not been declared invalid. In the Barger decision, which invalidated the "" new protection"" legislation of the Commonwealth, five justices sat, three of them holding that legislation to be invalid, and the other two- Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr . thereJustice Higgins-holdin g it to be valid, and, of course the majority opinion ruled. What I propose to cite fro m the Barger case is the opinion of the dissenting majority. Honourable members may be surprised at that statement, but my reason for doing this is that in Cameron's case the opinion of the minority in 190S was in 1923 adoptedby the whole five justices as accurately stating the law. The point at issue in the ""new protection"" legislation was this: Parliament bad imposed an excise duty upon harvesters and other agricultural implements made in Australia, with exemptions depending upon various considerations. For example, persons who manufactured harvesters, & c , under conditions of labour declared by Parliament to be fair and reasonable, or under conditions complying with the awards of the A r b i - tration Court, were not to pay the excise duty. The effect of that act was to i m pose a heavy tax upon persons who did not observe the industrial conditions which the Commonwealth Parliament had prescribed.' The majority of the High Court held in regard to that act that Parliament had no power indirectly to legislate upon industrial conditions as such; that the substance of the act was legislation upon industrial conditions, and that it was therefore invalid. The majorit y also held that this legislation, though not in itself discriminating between States or parts of States, was of such a character that under it discrimination might take place, and was thereThe fore invalid. That was an additional reason for the majority decision. The minority, on the other hand, held that there was not discrimination, and it is upon this point that their opinion bears upon the bill now before the House. Clause '3 of the bill readsSection two hundred and eighty-six of the principal Act is amended by adding at the end thereof the following sub-section :"" (6.) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Governor General that the tourist traffic between any ports in the' Commonwealth or in the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth is being injured or retarded, and the Governor General is satisfied that it is desirable that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage iii the trade, he may, by notice, published in the Gazette, grant permission to unlicensed British ships of such size and speed as are specified in the notice to engage in the carriage of passengers between thoseports, subject to such conditions (if any) and for such period as are set out in the notice."" It is obvious that this clause applies to traffic between ports. It is not directed to traffic between one State and another, or between one part of a State and a part of some other State. Obviously, all the ports of the Commonwealth are in one State or another. The question is, therefore, whether it can be said that this measure authorizes a prohibited discrimination. If the Commonwealth Parliament were to legislate giving preference to a State as such over another State as such, that legislation, I consider,' would be invalid under section 99 of the Constitution; but if Parliament were to pass legislation in general terms under which it was possible that there might or might not be discrimination, then we must consider what was actually done under that legislation. Legislation is not invalid because under it a regulation may apply in such a way as to infringe section 99. In the Harvester case, pages 106 and 107 of the 6th volume of t.he Commonwealth Law Reports, Mr Justice Isaacs saidBut "" States and parts of States"" are ferred to, and that expression more naturally lends itself to the assumption that the hibition to the Federal Parliament was against differentiating in its measure of taxation tween States or parts of States because were particular States or parts of States. He was then dealing with section 51, sub-section 2, of the Constitution. Referring to section 99, Mr Justice Isaacs saidThe second circumstance referred to is similarity of the language in the primary limitation and in section 99. The expressions "" discriminate between States "" in the one "" give preference to one State over another State"" in the other, seem to me identical in purport and effect. "" Discriminate between parts of States "" in the one, may or may be identical with "" give preference to part"" of one State ""over any part"" of anVictoria. other State. But if there is any distinction between the last-mentioned phrases, of similarity is indelible. It is this : that the treatment that is forbidden, discrimination preference, is in relation to the localities conbill. sidered as parts of States and not as mere Australian localities, or parts of the Commonwealth considered as a single The question is-Does the challenged States. provision, whether it be the legislation Mr Latham. itself or some regulation made by virtue of it , discriminate between States or parts of States considered as States or parts of States? This statement of the Privy Council was cited by Mr Justice IsaacsThe rule laid down by the act is a general one applicable to all the States alike, and the fact that it bears unequally in the several States arises, not from anything done by the Parliament, but through the inequality of the duties imposed by the States themselves. The Privy Council pointed out that there are geographical and other distinctions between the States which necessarily make legislation operate unequally, and in fact prefer one State to another; but the only thing forbidden by the Constitution is preference in legislation to a State or States against other States as such or against parts of States as such. "" Mr Charlton - If a proclamation were issued providing that tourists might travel by overseas ships to Tasmania, would not that discriminate against other States that had tourists, but were not given the same privilege?",35
127,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I may answer the honourable gentleman in this way: In my opinion, it would be possible to make a proclamation under this bill which would be invalid. Por example, a proclamation which said that all ships leaving any Victorian port should be free from' certain reconditions would be illegal. But to issue proa proclamation dealing with vessels of a certain tonnage travelling between the beports of Sydney, Melbourne, and Hobart they would be to make a provision in relation to ports, and not in relation to States or parts of States. That is the distinction.",37
128,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,It is a very fine one.,37
129,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I am seeking to place before honourable members the very disthe tinction which the High Court itself has drawn. The decision of His Honour Mr . Justice Higgins was on exactly the same and lines. A f t e r referring to the section, he pointed out that the legislation was general, the same for Queensland and Western not Australia - There is not one set of conany ditions for Tasmania, and another for That is to say, the provision is one point a perfectly general provision.",37
130,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,There would be a or special provision for Tasmania under this,37
131,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Mr Justice Higgins country. . went on to say. There are many discriminations between The facts may and often must themselves create distinctions. In Cameron's case, which is another example of something authorized by Parliament being declared invalid, I find in 32 Commonwealth Law Reports, page 68, a reference to the matter. The H i gh Court, in 1923, had to consider' the validity of the law which, for the purpose of the income tax, differentiated between the value of horses and pigs according to whether they were in one State or another. The line of discrimination was a State line, and nothing else. For example, for the purpose of these regulations the value of a horse at Albury was fixed at a lower value than that of a horse at Wodonga, the reason being that one was in New South Wales, and the other in Victoria. A horse at Albury, under the regulations, was deemed to be worth exactly £ 8 , whilst the same horse, if across the river at Wodonga, was deemed to be worth exactlv £ 1 5 .",37
132,Mr EODGERS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Would it be possible under this legislation to rectify that?,38
133,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"That is another quesof tion. That is an income tax question. That regulation was held to be invalid, and the reason was that the line of discrimination was a State line. There is no objection to discrimination between horses and pigs, even if all horses were in New South Wales, and all pigs were in Victoria. But to value a horse at one rate because it is in New South Wales, and at another because it is in Victoria is to adopt a State line of discrimination, and that is exactly what is prohibited. His Honour the Chief Justice dealing with this question, refers to what was said in the Barger's case which I have read from the judgment of Mr . Justice Isaacs, and accepts it . He also accepts what Mr Justice Higgins said, agreeing that there is no infringement of the non-discrimination provision when there is one general rule applying to all the States; though the circumstances in one State may bring it into application, whilst the circumstances in other States do not bring it into application. His Honour Mr Justice Isaacs points out in the case of this regulation, that different standards' are applied, and they are referable solely to whether live stock are in one State or another. In other words the discrimen-the line of distinctionis: Which State ? That is the essence of the judgment. This bil l is capable of being applied to any State.",38
134,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,But the proclamation may not cover all the States.,38
135,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"If there is tourist traffic between any ports of the Commonwealth that in the opinion of the Governor General is being injured or retarded, this legislation may be applied to it.",38
136,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,There is tourist traffic with ports in all the States.,38
137,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"This bill might, be applied to it , if , in the opinion of the Governor General, it was being injured or retarded. Mr Justice Isaacs repeated only the rule he laid . down in Barger's case. Mr Justice Higgins did the same, and Mr Justice Rich and Mr Justice Starke accepted the opinion then expressed. There was the unanimous decision of the justices. Whilst this decision refers to sections 51 and 52, reference was made by several of the judges to section 99 as similar in effect.. Here we have a unanimous decision of five judges, accepting the view the minority judges in Barger's case, because the discrimination was upon a State basis-becaus e one thing is in one State and another is in another State.",38
138,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Did any of the judges disagree with the decision of the majority in Barger's case.,38
139,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"In Barger's case tliere were five judges; three decided in one way, and two in another way.",38
140,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,That is not my point The honourable gentleman says that in the Cameron case five judges decided in the same way. Did they disagree with the finding of the majority of the court in Barger's case?,38
141,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The r e were five judges in Cameron's case, and all accepted in express terms what was held by Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice Higgins, who formed the minority in Barger's case. Does that answer the honourable member's question ?",38
142,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Yes .,38
143,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"This provision deals with ports, and makes it possible for a notice to be published relating to any ports as to which the Governor General is satisfied that the conditions set forth in the clause obtain"". That is exactly in line with a very great deal of legislation which this Parliament has passed.",38
144,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"If the facts are as the honourable gentleman has stated, what is the reason for bringing in this amending legislation ?",38
145,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I shall deal with later as a separate question. May I redistinctions mind honourable members that in the amending act of 1921, section 286 was framed in exactly the same way. It vides that where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Ministry in regard the coasting trade with any port or tween any ports in the Commonwealth that certain conditions obtain the exempupon tion may be given. Thiis section was open to exactly the same objection. could refer to many other sections in the of Navigation A ct which permit ports be dealt with according to their circumreading of them. stances. You cannot have an absolutely universal rule applying to every port in or Australia. They must be dealt with separately according to their circumhonorable stances, including obviously the circumown stances of the traffic to them. It would be quite a different thing to divide the ports on a State basis. To deal with ports in relation to their circumstances and the traffic between them and the nature of the harbours is necessary.",39
146,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The aot deals with to goods carried? trading generally as distinguished from traffic extending over three months in a year, which this t ill deals with.",39
147,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"This bill refers ports the traffic of which is being injured or retarded, and that is a matter which would affect a port in a commercial as ports. well as in any other sense. I call attention by way of example to such a section as section 330, which provides that the Governor General may proclaim the ports at which the employment of a pilot shall be compulsory. Honourable members will agree that such a provision is obviously essential. If the Governor General were in terms to proclaim the compulsory emquired, ployment of pilots for all Victorian ports another."" and for no other ports, it is doubtful whether such a proclamation would be valid. But if he takes into consideration each port of the Commonwealth and conthe siders those where navigation presents such dangers that the judgment of pulsory pilot is necessary, such a proclamation affecting those ports would perfectly valid. I refer also, ing them to sections 332, 423, and 423A. I mention by way of analogy sections 15, of 16, and 58 of the Customs Act , which distinguish between ports. The pi-ovisions difier according to the circumstances of the ports. In the Quarantine Act in that the same way sections 13 and 20 draw between ports. It has been the practice of Parliament for many years to draw such distinctions. In this bill propower is given to draw distinctions between ports. The Constitution says that to in drawing distinctions between ports and bein any other regulation of trade or commerce, there shall not be discrimination the basis of States or parts of States 286 as such. This bill .does not infringe that I constitutional provision, or the decisions the High Court as they at bo present stand, according to my best I should not, of course, pretend in . this House, elsewhere, to be infallible; I have referred to the decisions so thatmembers may make up their minds on the matter. There is only one other point to which I desire to refer.",39
148,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Do not the provisions of the Customs Act and the Quarantine Act, to which the Attorney-General has referred, apply to the safety of the ships and the lives of the passengers, and not",39
149,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"No . If the honourable member refers to the sections, he will see that he is in error on that point. to It would not matter if he were accurate in what he says. There are distinctions still drawn as to the circumstances of the The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) raised a separate and distinct point, namely, that the existing legislation is adequate to deal with the position, and that, therefore, the presentbill is unnecessary. His contention may be reduced, to use his own words, to this: "" We already have one piece of invalid legislation entitling us to do what,is reand, therefore, we should not add",39
150,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I stated that the  bill, said that the previous measure was unconstitutional. If that act is una comconstitutional, this bill is also ",39
151,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"No w let us examine be the existing legislation. Section 286 of without readthe act providesWhere it can be shown to the satisfaction the Minister, in regard to the coasting trade with any port, or between any ports in the Commonwealth or in the territories under the authority of the Commonwealth(o) That no licensed ship is available for the service, or (6) that the service as carried out by a licensed ship or ships is inadequate to the needs of such port or ports, and the Minister is satisfied that it is desirable in the public interest that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage in that trade, he may grant .permits to unlicensed British ships to do so, either conditionally or subject to such conditions as he thinks fit to impose. All I wish to say on that matter is that, apart from any question as to whether Parliament would be able to impose the condition that the ships should carry passengers only between ports to which the licence applies-as to which there is possible room for doubt-the application of this section depends on the Minister being satisfied that the service, as carried out by a licensed ship or ships, is adequate to the needs of such port or ports. There the criterion is the adequacy of the service to the needs of the port or ports. I understand from everything I have heard in this House on the question that this is no crying need of any port or ports. It is not a question of the adequacy of the service to the needs of Sydney, Hobart, or Melbourne. It is not a question of the needs of the ports at all ; the existing traffic is being carried. This legislation is introduced for the purpose of re-establishing a traffic that used to exist but which now no longer exists.",39
152,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The need is greater today than ever.,40
153,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The traffic in ques- legislation. tion is the traffic that used to be carried by the large oversea vessels which are no longer engaging in this tracte. It is no use saying that the people ought to be as content with the vesssls which are now on the Tasmanian route as they were with those formerly running. members have spoken of fastidious individuals who decline to travel on the steamers now employed in the service.,40
154,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The ex-Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said that.,40
155,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I do not yet regard it as an article of political f a i th - as some honourable members opposite apparently do-to subscribe to everything that the ex-Prime Minister has said. If there be a traffic which can be developed, and which will earn money for Tasmania and other parts of Australia, then let it be developed. If it be a sort of first class traffic, wby should we spurn it because there are people who are willing to pay higher sums than usual tor special services? The object of this proposal, as I have already said, - is to revive a traffic which used to exist but is now non-existent; and it is specially intended to develop the tourist tramc. It is very difficult to bring the re-establishment of a non-existent tourist traffic under the head of "" the need of a port or ports."" If it were sought to provide for the passenger tourist traffic under section 286, it is for the reasons I have stated, quite doubtful whether the section would be rightly applied; but under this clause there is no doubt as to the intention of Parliament. It is a special clause providing for tourist traffic. It can be used for nothing else, and it describes the conditions under which the Minister may act under it .",40
156,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"'There was no doubt as to what Parliament intended under, say, the deportation legislation of last session.",40
157,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I am referring to the intention of Parliament as disclosed by the words of the legislation.,40
158,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I think there is an analogy between the two pieces of legislation.,40
159,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"This clause applies to the tourist traffic, and for the reasons I have indicated there is room for serious doubt as to whether that could be provided for under the terms of existing At least, there can be no serious objection to the passage of this bill, if the only objection by honourable members is that this action could be taken under the law as it now stands.",40
160,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Y a r r a ) [ 5 . 5 2 ] - I do Honourable not intend to speak at length, and the few points that I propose to mention are raised with considerable diffidence because, to some extent, they touch on the constitutionality of the bill . Even if I were a trained lawyer, I should speak with diffidence on such a subject after the experience that this Parliament has had on many occasions. The House is to a large extent indebted to the Attorney General for having given it his views on the legal aspect of the case as full y as he possibly could, and the opinions of justices of the H i gh Court on which he based his remarks. I wish, however, to say that, in my opinion, he has not disposed of the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). Moreover, I do not think that the Attorney-General himself believes he has entirely disposed of it. judgments quoted by him were enlightening to honourable members, but, as a layman, I would say that I do not think eitlier of them covers the question at issue. In my opinion, are only partly relevant. The General may be able to clear up some of my doubts when the bill reaches committee stage. Apart from the merits of the measure we ought to be satisfied of its constitutionality. The General quoted the Cameron Which there was clearly a discrimination as between State and State. As one of the judges of the High Court said, it did not inatter whether the price of stock fixed for each State was correct, such a regulation would still be unconstitutional because it would draw a line of demarcation as between one State and another. But we know, as sensible men, horses valued at £8 a head at could not be regarded as worth a head at Wodonga. The thing is that any Commonwealth ment could issue such a regulation, and the judges agreed that it was unconstitutional because it discriminated between one State and another in assessing the value of stock. In' the Barger case, known as theharvester case, the majority of the High Court held an excise act was invalid number of reasons, one of which was that it discriminated, though not in express terms, as between States and parts of States. In the Excise there was no discrimination State and State because it provided the same excise duty under the same conditions in all parts of the Commonwealth, but the majority of the court held that, because exemption was given certain conditions of labour, &c, the effect might be to discriminate between one locality and another where harvesting machinery was manufactured. Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice Higgins dissented from that ruling. The point made by the Attorney-General about which I am not satisfied, because to my mind it has not been made perMr Scullin. fectly clear. In the Cameron case there was obvious discrimination, but in the harvester case there was no more discrimination as between State and State that in express terms than there is under the The present bill. The Attorney-General states that in the more recent decision of the High Court in the Cameron case, the opinion of the two dissenting judges in the harvester case was upheld. they There I should like tentatively to Attorney- join issue with the Minister. He said that the Chief Justice quoted from Mr . the Justice Isaacs in the Barger case, and remarked, "" In that I concur."" What Mr Justice Isaacs said was that because a man was in one locality he was not to Attorneybe treated differently from another man case, in simply on that account. The point emphasized by Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr . Justice Higgins in the Barger case, was that it was a breach of the Constitution to discriminate against a man because of the place in.which he lived. The point I desire to be clear upon is whether, in the Cameron case, the majority of the High Court judges held that the finding that in the Barger case was wrong. £to far as Albury I can gather, it was not held that the £15 majority decision in the harvester case surprising was wrong. I submit that if it was right, depart- the contention of the Leader of the Opposition in the present instance is right, since this will clearly be a as case of discrimination between ports. In the Barger case, the question was one of discrimination between individuals only, but this bill proposes to discrimithat nate _ between ports, and that involves for a discrimination more directly between States and parts of States. In the Barger case there had been discrimination in taxation between individuals Act according to the rates of wages they paid, between and because of that the High Court held that the law was unconstitutional. If that judgment stands, it gives strength to the argument that this bill, which discriminates, not between man and man, under but between port and port, is u l t ra vires. In the Barger case the dissenting judges as held that discrimination in taxation between man and man was liable to happen under any system of taxation, however imposed, and a man in one State might bo taxed more than a man in another State; but so long as the discrimination is one was not because of the locality in which the individuals lived, the tax would be quite constitutional. Section 99 of the Constitution readsThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or. any part thereof over another State or any part thereof. This bill does not discriminate between one port and another, but the regulations to be issued under it may sodiscriminate.  of discrimination arise only when another State applies for and is refused similar conditions?",40
161,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,No ; it immediately. A shipping company may test the legislation.,42
162,Mr SCTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It is not necessary that another State shall apply for and be refused similar conditions before discrimination can be alleged. if another State did apply and was refused, the question of discrimination, according to the Attorney-General, would then be one of fact. ""Under this bill discrimination, will be based not on questions of upon the opinion of the Governor General-wh y the bill does not refer to the Governor General in Council I do not know-that circumstances exist which warrant the granting of certain relief to specified ports. In order to clarify the issue, let me re-state the point: In Barger case, the High Court held that if - a certain tax discriminates between individuals residing in different parts, and, therefore, between State and State, and locality and locality it is unconstitutional. It is of fact whether the tax is imposed with the intention to discriminate between individuals because wages paid. But, if merely because of the opinion of the Governor General that a certain state of affairs has arisen, Tasmania's application for relief is granted, and, subsequently, Western Australia's application for similar relief is refused, a clear case of discrimination will have been established.",42
163,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"There would be no application by a State. A proclamation would be issued referring to, say, the ports of Melbourne, Hobart, and Adelaide.",42
164,Mr SCTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I understand Attorney-General's argument to be that if a proclamation were issued lift in g certain conditions from a boat leaving Victoria, that proclamation would be unconstitutional.",42
165,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I think it very probably would.,42
166,Mr SCTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"But if the proclamation referred to a boat leaving Melbourne, it would not be unconstitutional.",42
167,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Exactly .,42
168,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I think the Attorney General is skating on very thin ice.,42
169,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I was merely quoting the opinion of the High Court.,42
170,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Sectio n 99 refers to any State "" or any part of a State.""",42
171,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,As such. may arise Mr Scullin - Thos e words are not in the section.,42
172,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,They have been interpolated by the judges.,42
173,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"But the judges have given other interpretations and made Butother interpolations which strengthen the view opposed to that taken by the Attorney-General. If it is possible to discriminate constitutionally in favour of Hobart as against Launceston, the same principle is involved as in discrimination fact, but between Hobart and Perth.",42
174,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"On the transcontinental raihvay fares vary according to the distance travelled. Would the honourable member allow discrimination in fares, not according to distance, but according to whether the journey was in Western Australia or South Australia?",42
175,Mr SCTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Does the Attorney General suggest that the charging of fares upon a Commonwealth undertaking in volves discrimination Avithin the meaning a question of section 99?,42
176,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I - am suggesting that differences of fares, according to distances, of the do not involve discrimination, but that if such differences were based upon State boundaries they would be unconstitutional.",42
177,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Quite so, but section 99 does not prevent the charging of different fares, according to distance, on any CommonAvealth railAvay.",42
178,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I agree with the honourable member.,42
179,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Surely if sections, of the Navigation Act, are made to apply to the one port iii New South Wales and not to another port in that State, they will be ultra vires.",42
180,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I do not think the honourable member has endeavoured to follow my argument.,42
181,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The Attorney-General is not justified in saying that. I may not have succeeded in understanding his contention, but at least I paid him the compliment of listening to his"" ""speech. My failure to understand him is not due to any lack of courtesy on my part. I certainly did not leave the Chamber while he was speaking. As far as I was able to ""-rasp his argument, it was that if a boat "" leaving Victoria "" were exempted from prescribed conditions, such exemption would amount to unconstitutional discrimination, but if the word "" Melbourne"" were substituted for "" V i c toria,"" the exemption would cease to be unconstitutional. I reply that Melbourne is "" part of a State "" within the meaning of section 99.",43
182,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I am sorry if I said anything to offend the honourable member, but I interjected as I did because I had twice quoted to honourable members a sentence in which Mr Justice Isaacs pointed out the distinction between localities as such, and localities as States or parts of States.",43
183,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"If the Attorney General had not left the Chamber during my speech he would have heard me quote that sentence again. I made no endeavour to contest the learned gentleman's interpretation of the judgment; indeed I am very grateful for the light he has thrown upon a very complicated question, but I suggest that there is very grave doubt as to the effect of that judgment upon this proposed legislation. It is obvious to even the layman that the High Court could not have decided other bhan the way it did in the Cameron case. How a regulation which discriminated so definitely between States could have been made, is beyond the comprehension of any one with even a rudimentary knowledge of the Constitution. But the question which arises is : Did the unanimous decision of the Highi Court; in the Cameron case declare definitely that the decision of the majorit y of the court in the Barger case was wrong?",43
184,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I think so. In ger case the question was ""whether there had been an infringement of section 51 of the Constitution, which, the minority of the Court-Justice s Isaacs and Higgins - sai d was similar in all essential particulars to section 99 in regard to discrimination between States and parts of States. The minority's view was approved by the majorit y of the Court in the Cameron case.",43
185,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"In my opinion, the Court' endorsed the contention that a man is not to be treated differently ' merely, because of the locality in which he resides or his property is situated.",43
186,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The court expressed the contrary opinion, namely, that discrimination between localities is constitutional, but that discrimination between State or parts of State as such is unconstitutional.",43
187,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"In dissenting from the majorit y decision in the Barger case, Mr Justice Isaacs laid down the principle that unconstitutional discrimination was discrimination between men because of the localities in which they lived.",43
188,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I take the contrary view. Localities as such are distinct from States or parts of States as such.,43
189,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"In the Cameron case Chief Justice Knox quoted the Barger case and saidIn that case my brother Isaacs said, "" Discrimination between localities in the widest sense means that, because one man or his property is in one locality, then, regardless of any other circumstance, he or it is to be treated differently from, the man or similar property in another locality."" I respectfully agree with that definition. """,43
190,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Quite so; we can discriminate between localities so long as they are not States or parts of States.',43
191,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Mr Justice Isaacs, says that such discrimination is not constitutional.",43
192,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Discriminatio n between localities is not prohibited by the Constitution, but discrimination between States or parts of States is prohibited.",43
193,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Surely he gave the meaning of "" discrimination "" as defined in the Constitution ! I maintain that he did. So far as I am aware, there has been no judgment of the High Court that upset the judgment in the Barger case. If the latter judgment stands, then the casemade out by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) must also stand. The the Barpoint upon which honourable members must satisfy themselves is, did the judgment in the Cameron case upset the judgment in the Barger case? I do not intend to say whether it did or did not; I am unable to determine that matter; but there is very grave doubt concerning it . There is further very grave doubt regarding the accuracy of the interpretation pat upon the matter by the Attorney-General. (Mr Latham). He said that if Victoria were named in this legislation there would be discrimination, but that such discrimination would not exist if Melbourne were named as a port. I shall now leave that aspect of the matter. It may appear presumptuous in me to have entered into it, but even with the limited ability that I possess I must do my part. Mr MANN.'-Do not be too modest.",43
194,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"This question has perplexed legally trained minds> did not gather the point which the Attorney-General made when he endeavoured to meet the argument of the Leader of the Opposition. I understood the honourable gentleman to say, "" The Leader of the Opposition argued that the provision in the bill was invalid, and, if that were so, the existing legislation was invalid. He further argued that the existing invalid legislation gave us all'the power we required; so where was the necessity to pass the bill.""",44
195,Mr LATHAM,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,That was not the whole of my argument; I went on to deal with section 286.,44
196,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Le t me regard that in general terms as the rebuff which the honourable gentleman gave to the Leader of the Opposition, and, in fairness to the latter, re-state the case that he put forward. He emphasized his opinion that the existing legislation was invalid, and quoted the opinion of the Minister who introduced it (Mr Massy Greene). That honourable gentleman, we may assume, spoke on the advice of the Government's legal advisers when he expressed a grave doubt as to its legality. The Leader of the Opposition argued that if the existing legislation was invalid, then this provision also must be invalid. But he went on to argue that if , as the Government claimed, this proposal was valid, it was not required, because the Government already possessed the power which it conferred. The case cannot be dismissed by a smart retort such as that which was made by the Attorney-General.",44

198,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Le t me now deal with the proposal in the bill. Honourable members representing Tasmanian constituencies claimed that this proposal would give them something they would not get if the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition were accepted. His proposal, they claimed, would provide a service between Tasmania ancl the mainland, but they wanted carriage for their export trade to the London market.",44
199,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,No !,44
200,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,That is the point which was emphasized by speech and interjection by honourable members from Tasmania. I Mr EODGERS - That - is notprovided for in the bill.,44
201,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Of course, it is not. What is in the bill? The intention, I believe, is that, in the apple season, tourists from Sydney to Hobart may travel on an unlicensed boat. Will any honourable member opposite deny that that is the intention? Not one of tbem will. In the apple season they want tourists to be carried by unlicensed Peninsular and Oriental boats, upon which is employed any kind of labour, under any conditions. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) said that that would help to pay for the coal used on the journey to Hobart.",44
202,Mr MARRS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It does not pay them - t&^ go across', except m the apple season.",44
203,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,I dispute that. The boats now call at Hobart and take the apples away.,44
204,Mr MARRS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Fro m December to the end of February there is no apple season. It does not pay the big boats to go there with passengers only, at a time when they are unable to take apples away.",44
205,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The apples are taken from Tasmania; they do not rot there.,44
206,Mr BELL,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,There have been occasions when they rotted there.,44
207,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I could mention occasions when potatoes rotted in Victoria. .Any State that is sea-girt, like the little island of Tasmania, must have disabilities. But should we pass a bill which casts overboard important legislation merely because . such disabilities may occasionally operate ? The Minister will take a very serious step if he puts this provision into operation to any great extent. The existing provisions are an infringement of a great and splendid principle. The honor argued, that those who sincerely believed in the White Australia policy ought not to rest their argument upon the question of the manning of our bpats.'  regarded in a racial sense.",44
208,Mr SCTJLLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The White Australia policy has i u it more than the mere racial question; it includes very largely the dustrial or economic aspect.,45

212,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I do not intend to the argue that this infringes the White Ausa tralia policy. That policy embodies the question of residence in Australia, quite apart from the manning of the boats. Whatever concession the Minister might feel inclined to make to British shipbeen owners who, even though they are not act. paying the Australian rate of wage, are at least paying wages that are fit for white ted otherwise. men : whatever inroads he intends to make upou the progressive legislation that has been passed for the benefit of the men who "" g o down to the sea in ships,"" suggest that he ought not to make any concession to those who employ cheap, sweated coloured labour.

214,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Wannon) [8.0] - So far as this bill is designed to afford mania a measure of relief from what, after some years of operation, has proved to be a burden, I welcome it . It is, ever, not the result of the newly-born zeal of a new government. To my knowThe ledge, it represents the will of two governments. The only thing which previsit vented this relief from being given viously was the generally accepted belief held by honourable members on both sides of the House, and also by the legal visers of the Crown, that to grant such relief would be unconstitutional. have listened today to an explanation the measure by the Attorney-General; and, while no one will question that, i its general terms, the bill makes no disnot crimination i u favour of Tasmania, any other part of the Commonwealth, we must read. it in the light of the policy of the Government as announced by the be Prime Minister, and also of the remarks of the Minister who introduced it . They referred to it as a bill to grant a measure of relief to Tasmania; therefore, in spirit at least, it does discriminate between inStates. That this question is not a new one, every one who has had intimate dealof ings with the Customs Department knows. The Navigation Act was proclaimed on the 1st July, 1921. The act had not been long in operation before it was found that, to enforce it strictly, would impose, in certaiu instances, conditions which were the too severe. For that reason I , when a Minister of the Crown, after having studied facts, took the responsibility of issuing proclamation exempting from its operations certain ports in Western Australia. The ports of Broome, Derby, Port Hedland, Carnarvon, Cossack, and Wyndham. as well as Thursday Island, have exempted from the operation of the",45
215,Mr FOSTER,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,It could not have opera,45
216,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It will be seen, therefore, that under section 286 of the act relief has already been granted. The I existing legislation confers upon the Minister fairly wide discretionary powers, but in exercising those powers he must be prepared to accept responsibility a - for interfering with an act which was to preserve to Australian shipowners and seamen the whole of the Australian coastal trade. It has been the policy of all governments to interfere with the act only in extreme cases in which relief could not be granted by any Tasother means. Tasmania having bargained herself into federation, cannot now bargain herself out again, but she is entitled howto the benefits of her natural conditions. For that reason, I welcome this measure. climate of Tasmania is such that large numbers of people are induced to that State during the months of preJanuary, February and March of each year. The tourist season is then at its height. As an alternative to this measure adthe Leader of the Opposition has suggested that a regular and continuous serWe vice be instituted between Tasmania and of the mainland. I remind him that the Tasmanian Government, which established n such a service, soon abandoned it . It is practicable to establish a service for or the - tourist season only, because the vessels would remain idle for the remainder of the twelve months.",45
217,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,The service that I suggested would be a permanent one. The honourable member speaks of tourist traffic only.,46
218,Mr FORDE,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The apple boats will only visit Tasmania during February, March and April.",46
219,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Thos e boats have perfect freedom to call at Tasmania for export trade now.,46
220,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,That is not in dispute.,46
221,Mr RODGERS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Mentio n has been made of the danger to the White Australia policy if this measure becomes law, but I point out that coloured labour is employed on some of the vessels which now trade in Australian ports under exemption. Were that not so, it would have been impossible for the north-west coast of Western Australia to reach its present condition. I agree with the hon that the time has arrived for Australia to review her position, especially in regard to the operation of the Navigation Act. I hesitate to make that suggestion, as it was my privilege to administer that act for a considerable time, but because of that experience I know that it imposes heavy burdens upon the primary producers of Australia, and upon the interstate trade of the Commonwealth. In my judgment, we shall soon have to decide whether an expensive preference is to be given indefinitely to a few shipowners and seamen at the expense of the great body of primary producers, manufacturers, and those engaged in the interstate trade. We should examine carefully the economic conditions affecting' production in Australia. We cannot for ever grant bounties to keep States and industries on their feet. A l ready this session bounties have been granted to assist several industries, and there is a prospect of more. So long as we allow unsound economic conditions to continue, we shall be compelled to grant bounties and gratuities to assist our industries. While I welcome this measure, in that it will grant a measure of relief to Tasmania, I am of the opinion that it is an attempt to circumvent the Constitution by discriminating in favour of one State. It will prove to be the thin edge of the wedge, so far as tourist traffic is concerned. The concession which this legislation grants will not long be confined to Tasmania; other parts of the Commonwealth will also apply to come under its provisions, and soon the whole of the Navigation Act will necessarily have to be reviewed. I do not think that section 286 of the principal act is sufficiently wide to grant the general relief sought by this measure. That section is designed more to deal with individual boats, and I am of the opinion that licences would have to be obtained in respect of each boat applying for exemption. This bill provides for the issue of a proclamation covering the whole of the tourist traffic in the event of certain things happening. The alternative proposal of the Leader of the Opposition is impracticable. As I believe that it will afford relief to Tasmania, and to other parts of the Commonwealth, I shall support the bill. I hope that the Government will afford us an early opportunity to review the whole of the provisions of the Navigation Act. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney! [8.13] - The people of Tasmania expect to get some relief from this measure, but in view of the fact that the whole of the shipping in Australian waters is controlled by one master mind, I cannot see that their expectations will be realized. The overseas shipping companies are controlled by Lord Inchcape. The vessels which come to Australia do so in order to make profits for.their owners; the mere fact that they are to be allowed to carry passengers to Tasmania at certain periods of the year will not affect the policy of the owners concerning them. The vessels will be diverted to Tasmania only to make greater profits.. The interstate shipping companies already cater for the Tasmanian trade. Lord Inchcape has a big interest in the Australian Slteam Navigation Company, as he has also _ in the Howard Smith Company, and in Burns, Philp and Company. The huge combine which he controls allows the interstate shipping companies to cater for the coastal trade of Australia, while its overseas vessels deal with our export trade. The Government may take credit for relieving Tasmania by assisting her industries and tourist traffic, yet the position is really in the hands of those who control overseas and interstate shipping. Therefore, despite the Government's election pledge to amend the Navigation Act, no appreciable benefit will be derived by the people of Tasmania.",46
222,Mr LAMBERT,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"West Sydney) [S.16]. - The object of the bill is to lower the wages and destroy the conditions that are at present enjoyed by the Australian seamen. Under clause 3, foreign vessels manned by Japanese and Chinese and other coolie labour will be able to engage in the passenger traffic around the Australian coast. We have to consider, not the position of Tasmania, ibut the standard of living of Australian sailors and workers. The bill is an insidious attempt by the Government to reduce our seamen's wages from £16 to £ 8 a month. It is impossible for any man in this country to live on less than £16 a month. I wish to expose to the people of Australia the Government's attempt to interfere with the White Australia policy, and I ask honourable members opposite, even if it means defeating the Government, to vote against the measure, and thus ensure for our seamen a living wage and living conditions.",47
223,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Perth) [8.20] - In debates in this House we often hear a inatter treated in relation to its effect upon the interests of sections or groups of the community. Any particular section or group must be considered as the servant of the community as a whole, and we should, therefore, consider legislation in relation to its effect upon the community as a whole, and not with special regard for auy class or section. Navigation Act has for years past laid an intolerable burden upon Australia.",47
224,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,For how many years past ?,47
225,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Eve r since it became law. Every year has shown a further manifestation of the mischief which has been wrought in restricting the freedom of the community, and the consequent interference with free trade between the different parts of the Commonwealth. It 'has also* been evident for a long time that Tasmania has suffered a great injustice through the operation of the Navigation Act and other federal enactments. For these reasons, although not satisfied with the bill, I am prepared to support it. I agree with the remarks of the honourable  Wannon (Mr Rodgers). It is time that this matter was dealt with in a more courageous and sagacious manner. bill is a tentative step towards further action. I regret that the Government, with its large majority and its clear mandate from the people, has not exercised its power to a greater extent than is now proposed. As an ordinary layman I do not know what to think about the constitutionality of the bill. If it is constitutional it will at least be a step towards greater freedom, and I welcome any blow struck for the liberty of the people. But if the bill is challenged and proves to be unconstitutional, I shall not greatly care, because this will . be further proof that if the Government desires to give real relief from restrictive provisions, further steps will have to be taken to develop fully the trade of this country. The bill is a timid attempt tb take the first step along a road that should have been fully travelled by the Government.",47
226,Mr A GREEN,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Kalgoorlie) [8.26] I regret that many honourable members opposite are prepared to interfere with the White Australia policy. I am the representative of a district a large portion of whose shipping, I regret to say, is carried on by coolie labour, so I have nothing to gain by taking up my present attitude. The time has arrived when a man must stand for the principle of White Australia. The Government has grown bold. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) urges greater boldness, and lie reminds me of the French revolutionist who said, ""Audacity, audacity; The always audacity."" While the Government has a majority, it can with impunity attack the great principle for which this party stands, but there must be a reaction. I hope that the Government will do nothing to harm a principle that is cherished by the people of Australia, and which, in the past, was supported by Kingston and other eminent men who were not members of the Labour party. The honourable member for Wannon mentioned that exemption had been granted during his term of office to several ports on the north-west coast of Western Australia. He neglected to say that the Government of Western Australia has always tried to maintain a white-labour service on the north-west coast and that one exists there today. The sum of £393,000 has already been expended on that service. Tasmania should have a regular shipping service. I deThe plore unnecessary strikes-if they can be called strikes-that interfere with trade, because they do not benefit Australia. There should be other ways of adjusting differences between employers-if you like that word-and employees. It is the bounden duty of every Government to support the White Australia policy, and I should like"" this Government to declare itself on that matter. I am afraid that the bill may bo the t h in edge of the wedge used to break down the Navigation Act. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) is anxious to serve the interests of those who financed the elections to a degree that was never known before in Australia, and they naturally desire a quid pro quo. I trust that the Government w i ll devise means to establish shipping communication with Tasmania in the way referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. Surely it is not beyond the wit of the Government to run between the mainland and Tasmania a few boats manned by white crews recognized as Commonwealth oflicials with public service rights, such as those that are enjoyed by omcers of the post and telegraph and similar services. If it did so we should be able to provide, as Western Australia has provided, that the men employed in the service were Australians enjoying Australian wages and conditions. One honourable member said that the racial aspect of the White Australia policy is not involved in this legislation; but the economic aspect of that policy is the more important. If only the racial' menace had to be considered, the importation of unlimited black labour would not affect it , because the labourers could be kept in compounds as they are in South Africa. I have spoken on the bill because I think there is grave danger that, flushed by its victory, the Government may do something to assail a principle that is dear to the majority of the people of Australia. What honourable members on this side stand for is interstate trade controlled by Australians and giving Australian wages and conditions. That is no new principle. It has been in operation in America for 50 years. The people of the United States of America do not permit any foreign vessel to engage in their coasting trade, and they see that those engaged in it are given good wages and conditions. I am in sympathy with the claim of Tasmania that it should not suffer because of a lack of facilities for communication with the mainland: but, in my view, it would be altogether wrong to permit the Peninsular and Oriental boats, worked with lascar labour, to capture the Tasmanian trade with the mainland. The Government should establish a line of Commonwealth steamers manned by crews enjoying - Australian conditions and wages to provide the necessary communication with T cl-SLLL EL22X 3I",47

He has said that he would like to see something done for Tasmania; yet it is a most remarkable thing that every time we have a shipping strike honourable members opposite are the most silent men in the country.",48
228,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"We are the only people who tried to settle the last strike. The Government did nothing at all in the matter. The honourable member should not tell deliberate lies. He should reprove his own leader, the Prime Minister.",48
229,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The people of Tasmania possess the same rights as those of any other State. On entering the federation they subscribed to its laws and regulations, and so have helped to give the Arbitration Court and the Navigation Act to the workers of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) talked about a quid pro quo and the people of Tasmania are today demanding a quid pro quo, a return for the benefits which, with the people of the other States, they have conferred upon the workers. They demand a continuous service between the mainland and Tasmania, and they have every right to it . Every year, since 1917, there has been a shipping strike affecting Tasmania and, almost without exception, it has occurred during the tourist season. Honourable members opposite are fond of talking about the money which the steamship companies make; but the tourist season is the only portion of the year during which the service to Tasmania pays. Yet that is the time when strikes are declared which dislocate the service. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has asked where Tasmania's disabilities arise, I would remind him that on one occasion Tasmanian produce to the value of about £1,000,000 was left on the north-westcoast of that State.",48
230,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,When was that?,48
231,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,About five ago.,49
232,Mr YATES,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Then why did not the Tasmanian people give the Navigation Commission some evidence about it?,49
233,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"There was a drought in New South Wales wben chaff and other fodder was left ou the wharfs at Devonam port. The honourable member for win (Mr Bell) could perhaps supply the particulars better than I can - The only chance of disposing of this produce during the drought in New South Wales; but a strike prevented its transport, and chaff had to be sold at about £ 3 a ton, instead of up to £ 1 0 a ton. Tasmania cannot dispose of its produce owing to excessive freights between that State and the mainland. Freights high today because of the special conditutional tions required by the Navigation A c Arbitration Court awards, and I say that in return for those conditions the people of Tasmania have a right to a continuous service with the mainland. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) has said that he would give Tasmania a convery th in ice. tinuous service. I would vote for any proposal that would supply such a vice, but how can the honourable gentleman guarantee a continuous serCommonwealth service. vice when that cannot be done in case of the Commonwealth Shipping Line, that pays the best wages and gives the best conditions in the world ? That line has cost the Commonwealth many millions of pounds, and when a continuclaims ous service cannot be guaranteed in case of that world-wide service, how can such a thing be guaranteed in the case of a service between the mainland Tasmania ?",49
234,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Why did not the honourable member say that to the people who signed the petition he presented?,49
235,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The : petition dealt with more than the disability through the Navigation Act . The Prime Minisestablish ter (Mr Bruce) guaranteed to the people of Tasmania that he would mainployees tain the running of ships from the mainthe land ""to that State during the tourist season. The result has been a record tourist season for Tasmania. I believe that the figures for this month will that there were about 10,000 passengers and out of the port of Launceston alone. We have had no previous record approaching that. Honourable members are ment. aware that the tourist trade is of great importance to Tasmania. I repeat that years the people of Tasmania have a right to the quid pro quo that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie talks about, in return for the conditions provided by the Navigation Act , and the wages paid to workers under Arbitration Court awards.",49

It is strange that we should be told that the existence of Tasmania depends upon the tourists who go to the State during three months of the year. God help the State if that is the only means of keeping people in it . I are do not propose to touch' upon the constiaspect of this measure, which has t and been pretty well thrashed cut; but I should like to say, from my own observation, that the Attorney-General (Mr . Latham) himself is not satisfied that he is on safe ground. It was evident during his remarks that he felt that he was on I have long held the opinion that the only way to provide comsermunication between the mainland and Tasmania is by the establishment of a Without dethe siring to cast any reflections upon honourable members, I must say that the establishment of such a service may have been delayed by the incompetence of Tasmanian representatives to put the of their State before this Parliathe ment. I have long wished to understand why it is that I cannot purchase a ticket in Sydney to go to Hobart by a Governand ment - conveyance, as ' I can to go to Melbourne or Adelaide. Why cannot a similar system be adopted for communication between the mainland and Tasmania? That is the only way to establish a satisfactory service with Tasmania. It was the intention of the Labour Government when in power to between the mainland and Tasmania a Commonwealth service, the emof which would be in practically same position as employees of the Post Office, or any other government department. Tasmania has spent a large sum of money in providing electrical show power for manufacturing purposes, but in there are no manufactures in the State.",49
237,Mr JACKSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,That is a foolish state,49
238,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"It is time that the people of Tasmania realized, in common with the people of the other States, that they must do something to make the State in which they live self-contained. Its products, whether they be apples or other f r u it , should be sent to the mainland, and in return goods manufactured on the mainland should be sent to Tasmania. I take it that the present proposal is the outcome' of a promise made to the electors of Tas-' mania that if they elected a tory government everything would be well with that State. Unfortunately, the people were misguided enough to trust the party opposite. H ad they looked more deeply into the matter they would have realized that a bill of this nature could not possibly extricate Tasmania fro m the financial morass into which it had.fallen. The State will undoubtedly be - a supplicant for Commonwealth largess in future. The revenue derived from tourist traffic will not relieve it of the necessity f federal grant.",49

If a youth then wished to be apprenticed to a trade it was necessary for him to go to one of the other States. Tasmanian representatives try to justify their claim for Commonwealth assistance by alleging that the Customs tariff penalizes their State.",50
243,Mr SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,Does the honourable member intend to connect his remarks with the bill ? ',50
244,Mr WEST,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"I am endeavouring to point out the anomalies that exist in regard to Tasmania. Year after year it has secured a Commonwealth grant, and now Parliament is asked to amend the Navigation Act, which requires that the shipping service on the Australian coast shall be provided by vessels manned under Australian working conditions. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr Hughes) is one of those responsible for the principal act, and he is proud of the humanitarian nature of that statute. Do honourable members recollect that the measure was held in abeyance for two years before the royal assent was given, because Trinity House realized the far-reaching effects of this beneficent piece of legislation, many features of which have been incorporated in the British act? I implore honourable members opposite to emulate the siririt of those responsible for this measure. It is regrettable that the occupants of the treasury bench have no greater conception of their responsibilities to the people than is shown in the bringing down of this miserable amendment. Since the Navigation Act is valued highly by legislators beyond the confines of Australia, we should hesitate before amending some of its most precious provisions. No greater compliment could be paid to the Australian legislature than the incorporation of some of the humanitarian provisions of this or a act in the British statute. If honourable members refer to the speeches that apclaiming peared in Hansard at the time the act was passed they will be forced to the opinion that the authors of the present bill are puny men compared with statesmen like Kingston. When I see numbers of the coloured crews of the Peninsular and Oriental liners coming ashore in Australian ports I feel sorry for the . poor wretches. It makes me shudder to think that the majority in the national Parliament wishes to place the shipping on our coast in the hands of such seamen, thereby depriving our own k it h and k in of employment. The Government should endeavour to maintain Australia's racial standard. Where are to be found nobler men than those that plough the seas around the coast of Australia 1 I cannot understand the Prime Minister being a party to the introduction of such a bill . I can only conclude that he is in the hands of the puny section, and feels that he must fall in with its wishes. Nobody suggests for a moment that this Bill will satisfy the requirements of Tasmania. Its grant from the coffers of the Commonwealth will appear on the next Estimates as usual. Do a few tories expect to place that State in a better position than it has ever previously occupied by such a bill as this ? The proposal will not bear investigation. I advise honourable members from Tasmania to follow the lines advocated in the policy. speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). Australia should not be at the mercy of the shipping combine, even in regard to its overseas trade, let alone its interstate shipping. Had it not been for the Labour party's loss of office owing to circumstances connected with the late war, there would have been government control of shipping, not only between the different States, but also between Australia and the rest of the world. I predict that the political pendulum will soon swing in favour of Labour, and that the people will return to the view advocated by the most practical section of Parliament. The Labour party is prepared to act in the interests of the whole of the people, and is unwilling to check national progress. I realise that it is useless to attempt to defeat the bill, since there is a majority in the House that has no true conception of national needs. Inasmuch as the real object of the supporters of the bill is to get coloured crews into the Australian coastal shipping trade there will be little chance of amending the bill in committee. So long as the honourable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse) can get 9s. a bushel for his wheat, he cares nothing for the wages and working conditions of the men employed ou the ships trading to Australian ports. The price at which he can sell his own. products is the only criterion by which he judges any question. It is a pity that there is so much selfishness among honourable members opposite; I urge them to rise above that level. It is not yet too late to withdraw this bill. Much as I desire to improve the position of Tasmania, I assure honourable members representing that State that this measure will do no good, and next year they will be again asking the Commonwealth to help their people out of the financial morass. The establishment of a Government steamship service between the mainland and Tasmania would give confidence to tourists and traders throughout Australia. I have offered my help to the Tasmanian people to relieve their industrial, economic, and financial position. If that is refused, the only other thing I can do is to vote against this bill, which is one of the most deceitful pieces of legislation ever submitted to this Parliament.  the very lucid exposition of the constitutional position by the Attorney-General and the statement by the Minister for Trade and Customs of the disabilities under which Tasmania has been suffering for. many years, there is little need to speak in justification of this bill; but as a believer in the ""White Australia ideal I cannot allow to pass without protest the remarks of honourable members of the Opposition, who apparently desire readers of Hansard and the newspapers to believe that we on this side of the House do not believe, in that principle and are prepared to support any subtle attack upon it . I strongly deprecate a great national ideal being dragged into this debate for party purposes. I remind members of the Opposition that long before the Labour party came into existence the ideal of the White Australia was a big force in Australian politics, and if I thought that it would be jeopardized in any way by this bill I would vote against the second reading. But I have not imagination evil enough to see any danger of the kind in the measure, and I intend to vote for it.",50

Honorable MEMBERS - Oh , no!  comparison with the magnitude of the grievance which the bill is designed to partially redress. No very great knowledge of the Tasmanian tourist traffic is necessary to enable one to realise how much that State has suffered during the last few years. During this debate there has been some reference to party funds and the wealth at the disposal of honourable members on this side of the House. So far none of that wealth has come into my hands, and I assure honourable members opposite that when I signed my electoral papers a few days ago my campai%i expenses were well within the statutory limit. In regard to matters that are not vital planks in my party's platform, I am at liberty to vote as I choose. Every honourable member on this side is free to use his own judgment concerning this bill, and, because I believe in the granting of this form of relief to Tasmania, I shall vote for the measure.",51

I shall quote, for the information of honourable members, some extracts from the reply the Minister made to a deputation which waited upon him. I shall not attempt to discuss the constitutionality of this bill, but I do know that when a court is asked to interpret a statute it takes into consideration the intention of .the legislature. W it h o u t endeavouring to anticipate the decision of the judges of the High Court, I believe that if the constitutionality of this measure be challenged, the judges will peruse very carefully the speeches in this House. I know of nothing more helpful that could f all into their hands than the speech delivered by the Minister for Trade and Customs when moving the second reading. It was wholly a plea for Tasmania, and do honourable members believe for a moment that the High Court will allow, a Minister or a Government, by subterfuge or subtlety, to pass a measure for the making of regulations which would circumvent the constitutional prohibition against discrimination between States and parts of States ? The speeches delivered by ministerial members are sufficient to prove that this bill is unconstitutional. Por my own part I would not allow a lascar crew to be employed in connection with the carriage of mails from any part of the world, especially Great Britain , to Australia. When the original mail contract was made, the Commonwealth Government line of steamers was not in existence, but with the Orient Line and the Commonwealth Line we have a sufficient number of fast steamers to convey the mails between Australia and Great Britain without having recourse to vessels that employ coloured labour. Although some honourable members opposite may demand that lascar-manned steamers shall be allowed to carry passengers from Potts Point and similar aristocratic localities to Hobart, I can hardly ' imagine the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) travelling by such vessels. There could be no finer testimonial to the adherence of people to the ideal of a White Australia than a general refusal to [is] travel by ships manned by coloured crews. Under the bill it is intended to allow those persons to travel by these boats. On the 17th November, 1924, a deputation waited upon the Minister for Trade and Customs  sentative of the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Manufactures, the Hobart Marine Board, and the City Council. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) and a number of public men also were present. Replying to the representations that had been made to him, the Minister said, inter alia He understood, Tiowjever, that the request was that the whole of the State of Tasmania should the exempt from the coastal provisions only of the Navigation Act. It must be realized that such a request must have very far-reaching consequences. It would be a distinct departure from the national policy, of protection under which all Australian industries, including Tasmania's, were - paying approved wages and working under proper conditions, and were entitled to protection against cheap coloured labour, low wages, and unfair conditions in other parts of the! world. Those are sentiments that one would naturally expect to f all from the lips of a protectionist Minister for Trade and Customs, and they are similar to sentiments that have been expressed by honourable members on this side who have opposed the bill. The honourable gentleman now stands sponsor for a measure which will - have the effect of allowing boats manned by cheap coloured labour to convey passengers from Sydney to Hobart, and to take apples from Hobart to other parts of the world. He is also reported in the following terms: He submitted that the Australian Mercantile Marine was just as much entitled to that protection as another Australian industry. The second point that had been raised in connection witli the request was that it would, to some extent, be tire handing over of Tasmania's trade to foreign ships, which might easily displace Australian shipping, which shipping was required to pay good wages and supply proper accommodation, and adhere to certain manning conditions and scales as laid down in the act. . . No Government could give preferential treatment against its own shipping. . . Taking Tasmania as a whole, it was found that in 1923 Tasmania had a record Vear in tourist traffic, in overseas exports, and exports to other States. These seemed to - be the only factors that could be affected by the operation of the coastal proour visions of the act. The State btatistician had said that before the war, when no licence was necessary, only two per cent, of tliose who came to Tasmania travelled by oversea boats. . . . In 1920-21, the year before the act was in operation, 10,247 tourists visited Tasmania; in 1921-22 the number was 21,010: in 1922-23 it was 19,962,- aud in 1923-24 it was 22,304, a larger number than had ever entered Tasmania previously. . . . The argument of the deputation that the tourist traffic had been influenced by tihe act does not seem to be borne out by the figures. The Minister may now attempt to refute those statements. They appear in what must have been an almost verbatim report that was published in the Hobart Mercury, of the 18th November, 1924. The honourable gentleman then showed the people of Tasmania that their trade had not depreciated. The contention' tonight and.on previous occasions has been that the trade of Tasmania has suffered very seriously, and that the tourist traffic particularly has been hard hit. The figures quoted by the Minister prove that in some of the years about which the complaints have been most bitter, there was a record in the amount of tourist, traffic. The report also quotes the Minister as having saidThe exports overseas from Tasmania in 1909 were valued at £6,554,278, or £35 per head of population. In 1922-3 its exports were valued at £17,05o,3S3. Allowing for values, this trade showed a very satisfactory increase. The statement that the act had detrimentally affected Tasmania did not seem to have been borne out by the figures quoted. Thero was a lot of rivalry between ports in Tasmania, and the State as a whole must be the deciding factor from the National Government's stand-point. The Melbourne-Hobart passenger service had been abandoned in 1916, the passenger support, according to evidence given, being only nominal. Tonnage of a ll sorts arriving at Hobart in 1922-3 was close to the record year, and far exceeded thetonnage for 1014. The Government realized that strikes did affect Tasmania, and that shipping services were vital to the State's trade, and, taking all the circumstances of that into consideration, he must say, as a member of the Government, that, as far as the principles of the Navigation Act were concerned, tliose principles must stand. If Tasmania were able to make out an exceptionally strong case, showing that it had been adversely affected by the operations of the Navigation Act, he, as Minister, and the Government, would no doubt give the matter consideration; but the words I have quoted show most definitely that the Minister had his mind made up. He had been supplied by. the Director of Navigation and the Customs authorities with figures showing that the trade and the tourist traffic had not sufMr Fenton. fered, and that the Navigation Act had not operated against Tasmania in the way that the people of that State claimed that it had. I particularly want to stress the unfairness of subjecting Australian shipping, that pays Australian rates of wages and. works under Australian conditions, to the competition, of boats that are manned by black-labour crews. The Labour party is proud to have been associated with the passage of the Navigation Act. I can in memory see the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), and the late Hon. Erank Tudor, sitting on the ministerial bench night after night while the then Opposition '""-stone-walled"" many of the clauses of that bill. The Labour party then occupied the position that this Government occupies today; it had a large majority. Legislation relating to navigation had been held up for many years. Other ministers and other governments had desired to pass it, but it remained for the Labour Government in .1912 to place the measure upon the statute-book. The right honourable member for North Sydney knows that copies of that act were sought by increased nearly every nation in the world. Some of the nations have taken from it many of its principles and incorporated them in their navigation acts. W.e led the world in that legislation. Now, instead of being the leaders in providing proper conditions for the seamen and safety for the passengers, and thus setting an example to the world, we propose to go back upon that splendid piece of legislation. The Government is taking a retrograde step, and I cannot imagine how many of its supporters can' vote for the bill. It is a step that I cannot sanction. I am not averse from giving Tasmania every possible assistance. While she remains a member of the federation, while she is separated from the mainland, we shall have to stand by her. The matter, however, goes more deeply than the operation of the Navigation Act. Sooner or later we shall have to consider the whole of the circumstances that operate to cause the disabilities from which Tasmania suffers. As I have said on platforms in Tasmania, and as I would say again, I am prepared to see that communication is maintained between the mainland and Tasmania. I know that in some in stances she has suffered. Every State has suffered as the result of certain movements. But in this bill Ave are presenting to her Dead Sea f r u it . realise that the bill has been introduced in order to keep an election pledge. When the Attorney-General Latham) discussed some of the legal in tricacies of the question, and reviewed the constitutional aspect, he was not so sure as we should like to see one who gives legal advice to this . House. think he realized that he was skating upon very thin ice, which at any moment might break and let him down. responsibility, however, is with the Government and its supporters. This is one of the many chickens that will come home to roost in a few years' time. I shall vote agaiust the second reading of the bill.",51
247,Mr MARRS,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Wentworth) [ 9 . 3 0 ] - I do not wish to prolong this debate, but as one who has spent about. £4,000 in visits to Tasmania during the last 30 years I have some knowledge of the disabilities under which that State is labouring. Excepting during the Avar years, I have ' visited Tasmania every Christmas for many years. I have been there during every strike, - including the last. Regarding the constitutionality of. the bill, I fear that we are treading on th in ice. I say that as a lawyer. But in matters of this kind I am inclined to agree with the Attorney-General, because he is placed in his present position to advise the Government and the House on legal matters. He is, moreover, a man with a splendid record in legal circles in Australia. Something ought to be done, for Tasmania. Most of her young men on attaining the age of 23 or 24 years leave for the large cities of Melbourne and Sydney. Tasmania, consequently, short of man power, notwithstanding her great hydro-electric Avorks and other natural resources. She is also in straitened circumstances financially. strange anomaly exists regarding her tourist traffic. When 1 was a member of the Hughes Government, I visited Hobart to make arrangements for the accommodation of the then Prime Minister, his family, and staff. I could not find any, and but for Mr Hadley, of Hadley's Hotel, Mr Hughes would have had to sleep in the Hobart Domain. That week a deputation waited upon him to request that he should do something for the Tasmanian tourist traffic. T remember his reply, in which he asked hoAv it could be I said that the Navigation Act had interfered with Tasmania's tourist traffic while their boarding-houses and hotels Avere so (Mr full that he, the Prime Minister, could not get accommodation.' The same thing is true today. It is exceedingly difficult to obtain accommodation anywhere in Tasmania. I always make my arrangeT ments six months in advance, and I know that I pay considerably more for accommodation than it is worth. On The the other hand, there is no question that wealthy tourists will not go to Tasmania, because they cannot make their arrangements with the shipping companies sufficiently far ahead. Tasmania, in consequence, loses thousands of pounds every year. If more tourists are to visit Tasmania, more accommodation will have to be found for them. I am not certainthat this bill will assist Tasmania during the months of December, January, and .February, when the tourist traffic is at its height, as I understand from the honourable member for Bass (Mr Jackson) that the apple export trade does not commence until about the end of February. The tourist traffic begins with the commencement of the school vacation, about the 16th December, when numbers of people with their children leave to spend their holidays in the island State. The large mail steamers will not visit Tasmania merely for the tourist traffic, as the revenue to be derived from that source would not be sufficient to pay for the coal consumed in their furnaces: Nevertheless, I am willing to give this legislation a trial, as I desire to render Tasmania what assistance is possible. Tasmania is the true health resort of the Pacific, but enough is not done in the way of is propaganda. I have travelled round the world ten times, and have visited nearly every country; but nowhere abroad have I seen literature - advertising TasA mania as a health and pleasure resort. Much more could be done in this direction, and Hobart in time ought to become a second Cannes or Monaco: Notwithstanding the view that I have expressed regarding the constitutional aspect of this legislation I am prepared to vote for the bill .  Trade and Customs) [9.37] - Nearl y every member who has spoken has favoured something being done for Tasmania; any difference of opinion has been as to how and when that should be done. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) said that he would assist Tasmania by running a service of Government vessels, backed with Government money. The principles in which members on this side believe in this connection are diametrically opposed to those favoured by honourable members opposite. We on this side hold that a government's duty is to govern, and not to trade. We believe, also, that past experience in connection with government owned boats in Australia, including those of the Commonwealth Government Shipping Line, is sumcient to show that it would be unwise to interfere with the existing services to mania. The Commonwealth Government Shipping L in e ' has already cost the country some millions of pounds. The line of steamers run by the Tasmanian Government cost that State £30,869 in 1921-22, and £50,913 in 1922-23. Those figures are taken from the Tasmanian Government Gazette of 8th July, 1924. In the Hobart Mercury of 6th September, 1924, the Premier of Tasmania, Mr . Lyons, is reported to have stated that the total loses on those vessels amour ted to approximately £100,000.  should read the speech which he made at Hobart.  which waited upon me in Hobart, to which the honourable member for Mari the suspension of the whole of the provisions of the Navigation Act so far as Tasmania was concerned. No responsible Minister could have replied to that request other than as I did. On that occasion I also said I'want to say, further, if nnd when any of the conditions within the ambit of the act arises, or arc likely to arise, I agree on behalf of the Commonwealth, that if satisfactory evidence is tendered, special sympathy will be given to Tasmania owing to her isolated geographical position, and, if possible, action of a practical nature will be taken to help ease you of any traffic disability within the scope of government functions. I kept that promise by running "" the Nairana last year between Melbourne and Launceston when the ordinary service was entirely dislocated. I also told the deputationI will, endeavour to remember, in administering this law, that your geographical position' is different from any other State of the Commonwealth. I cannot break the law, but if occasions arise where some relief is absolutely necessary to Tasmania, you will have my sympathy and actual practical support. I am here in charge of this bill to give that practical support which I then promised. Further, I remind the House that the Government was returned with a mandate from the people. The Prime Minister, in his policy speech, saidTo overcome one of the handicaps suffered by Tasmania as a result of its geographical position, the Government proposes to introduce legislation which will permit overseas vessels to engage in the tourist traffic during the periods when that traffic is not adequately Tas- provided for. The people of Australia have endorsed the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister, and this bill has been introduced to give effect to it . Regarding the bill itself, considerable misconception exists, and many exaggerated statements have been made. It has nothing to do with the maintenance of a White Australia; it deals with tourist traffic only. Before issuing a proclamation under this legislation, the Government will satisfy itself that a tourist traffic-did, or does, exist between certain definite ports, and that it is being injured or retarded. The bill does not necessarily mean that the Government will not impose, conditions with resard to this tourist traffic. To show the absurdity of some of the exaggerations uttered this afternoon I may point out that of 37 vessels, booked to call at Hobart for cargo during the apple season, 30 are manned by British white crews, and the other seven are steamers of the Peninsular and Oriental Line. I do not propose to traverse the points that have been raised in regard to the constitutionality of the bill , but I shall repeat what was actually said by me in this regard when I was moving the second reading. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) interjectedBnt the effect will be that tourists going to any other States can travel on these overseas boats. I repliedThe bill provides that certain conditions in regard to tourist traffic must prevail before any Gazette notice can be published. The honourable member again interjectedBnt when it is published it will apply equally to all the States. My reply wasThat is so; but the circumstances must be equal before it is applied to them. amendment will give relief to Tasmania to the extent that the limitations of the Constitution will allow. At the same time, it will create no discrimination against, nor do injustice to, any State to which it does not apply. It will particularly apply to Tasmania, because the bona fide tourist traffic for which it pro- Gibson, W. G. vides is of very much greater value to that State than it is to any other. From the evidence before me as to what has taken place, particularly during the last two years, I have no hesitation in saying that if the Navigation A ct is eventually to become a dead letter, the fault will lie at the door of the seamen themselves because of their actions during the last year or two. The seamen w i ll have to review the position very carefully. Already there is 70,000 tons less passenger shipping on the coast of Australia than there was in 1914, and there were 10,000 tons less in the period 1924-5 than in the period 1923-4. We have seen the sales of the Aroywatta, the Aramac, the Wodonga, and the Wyandra, totalling over 10,000 tons. These vessels have been withdrawn from the coast, and have not been replaced. We have also seen recently that the Monaro, another vessel, has been sold. Altogether the .Australian passenger coastal shipping is getting into a very bad condition. Mr A . GREEN - Thos e boats are all obsolete.  not obsolete. . I have shown the position. Those who say that the present Government is tryin g to undermine the Navigation Act should look nearer home, and consider where we are d r if t in g and what is happening, on our coast. hope that the House will accept the bill as a bona fide attempt to help Tasmania, while at the same time it does not in any shape or form conflict - with our White Australia ideal.

248,Mr LAMBERT,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"West Sydney) T9.58J. - - I desire to place on record my protest against amending the Navigation Act in the manner proposed by the Government. Of course, I know that my opposition w i ll not be effective. I know that the Government has its majority, and is determined to amend the act, but I proI test on behalf of the Australian Seamen's Union, and not as a politician. I am an old secretary, an old organizer, and an old. president of industrial unionism, and all I want to do now is to record my protest against this interference with unionism. Clause agreed to.

Where it is shown to the satisfaction 23 of .the Governor General that the tourist traffic between any ports in the Commonwealth or in the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth is being injured or retarded, and the Governor General is satisfied that it is desirable that unlicensed, ships be allowed to engage in the trade, he may, by notice published in the Gazette, grant permission to unlicensed British ships of such size and speed aB are specified in the notice to engage in the carriage of passengers between those ports, subject to such conditions (if and for such period as are set out in the notice. air. SCTJLLIN (Y a r r a ) [9.59] - I move That after the word "" ships,"" line 7, the words "" manned by white labour"" be inserted. One point was emphasized by the Minister that strengthens the case for this amendment. He said, in reply to statements from this side of the House, that a lot of exaggeration had beenindulged in regarding black crews trading between one State and another, and that out of 37 boats booked to call at Tasmania 30 were manned by white crews. If that is so, preference should be given to those white crews'. Clause 3, althoughnot infringing the White Australia policy from the viewpoint of racial purity, does infringe it - from an economic point of view, by allowing men receiving from £ 2 to £ 3 a month to compete with qur seamen who work under Australian conditions. The Navigation Act, which is probably the biggest act on the 'statute book of Australia, provides that all Australian boats in the coastal trade must be manned by white crews working under white men's conditions. I ' admit that this bill does violate that principle. Surely there are sumcient oversea vessels employing white crews to take tourists to or apples from'Tasmania. I trust that the Minister will accept the amendment, and that the committee will carry it unanimously; otherwise we shall force it to a division.",56
249,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"New England) [10.2] - I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Scullin), and I hope that the Minister will accept it . It is in accordance with the sentiment of the majority, not only of honourable members, but also of the people of Australia. We propose to make in the Navigation Act a very important alteration, which is vital to the economic interests of the shipping industry of Australia, and in doing so we should adhere strictly to the great basic principle of White Australia. There is really no serious obstacle to the acceptance of the amendment.  Trade and Customs) [10.4] - Apar t from other considerations, the Government cannot accept the amendment, because this legislation, when passed, must receive the any) royal assent, and any discrimination between British shipping may lead to its rejection by the British Government.",57
250,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"Hunter ) [10.6] I regret very much that the Minister is opposing the amendment moved by the honourable member for .Yarra (Mr . Scullin). There is a consensus of opinion among honourable members that if we permit boats to trade with Tasmania they should be manned by white labour. I m mediately the honourable member for Yarra gave expression to his views, and was supported by the honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson), the Minister rose in his place and cracked the whip. He stated that it was impossible to ajccelpt the amendment because this legislation, when passed, would need the royal assent. We already have the royal assent to the Navigation Act. The Minister is using a subterfuge to obtain the support of honourable members sitting behind the Government. Honourable members who desire that only ships carrying white crews should be licensed should support the amendment. The Minister himself, only a few minutes ago, stated that out of 37 boats likely to trade with Tasmania during the next, few months, 30 carry white crews. That being so, why is there any objection to the amendment?",57
251,Mr SEABROOK,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,More than half of those 37 vessels are cargo boats.,57
252,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE,"The honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) is evidently in favour of black labour. It is a pity that he did not supply that in formation when the Minister was speaking. It would certainly be an advantage to Tasmania if only boats manned by white labour were allowed to trade there. We should stand four square for the White Australia policy, and not interfere with it by encouraging vessels manned by black crews to trade on the Australian coast. T.he Navigation A ct was introduced, in 1912 by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes), and some time elapsed before the royal assent to it was .obtained. The Minister stated that fewer ships were trading with Australia than previously, and he mentioned four or five vessels that had been taken off the Australian coast and sold. He omitted to mention that they ' were obsolete vessels economically of no use to - their owners. Three or four months ago, the Orama, avessel of considerable tonnage, was placed on the Australian run. The Orient Oompany, I think, is building two more large boats for this trade, and for the Peninsular and Oriental and other companies other large boats are ' under construction. The outlook for Australia, therefore, is improving. We now have larger ships thau have been in the trade for many years. This amendment is harmless, and it is necessary that it should be passed in order to ensure that a licence will be given only to those ships' that employ ouly white labour. If black labour is allowed to be employed on ships trading ou the coast, the ultimate effect may ' be to break down the White Australia policy. The economic effect must be felt, notwithstanding that we do not permit these black people to reside in Australia. The competition of black men with white men can only result in lowering the conditions for the white men. If we permit this in the case of seamen, no one can say for certain that it wil l end there. It is the thin end of a wedge that is being driven into the White Australia policy. I , therefore, submit that the amendment ought to be accepted. A f t e r the stand the Minister has taken, honourable members should use their own judgment. They should show him that they are prepared to assert themselves by voting in accordance with their consciences. The honourable member for Angas- (Mr . Parsons) believes in a White Australia. Is there any objection to him voting for the amendment, in order to give effect to the ideal he was espousing half an hour ago ? The Minister ought not to put this pressure on young members as soon as they come here. When dealing with a bill involving a vital prin ciple, the Government is justified in demanding the support of its f o llowers; but when a bill is in committee, and we are endeavouring to i m prove it , the collective wisdom of the committee should be used in the best in terests of the people of the Commonwealth. That cannot be done if honourable members opposite are like dumb, driven cattle, and allow the Minister to bludgeon them into submission. The amendment has a right to be dealt with on its merits. If there are honourable members who think that only boats and manned by white crews should go to Tasmania, they should vote for the amendment. Let it not be said that honourable members were browbeaten by the Minister, and voted against their consciences. Mr W . M . HUGHES (No r t h Sydney) [10.14] - I did not take part in the debate on the motionfor the second reading of the bill because there were so many points involved-som e of them of vitalimportance-and it appeared to me that no useful purpose would be served by attempting to dive too deeply into the somewhat disturbed waters. Therefore, although one or two observations were 'then made that interested me greatly, I refrained from offering any opinion of my own. We are now, however, confronted with a situation of such significance that I am compelled to consider my position. The amendment of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) provides, in effect, that the vessels to which permits may be given under the bill shall be manned by white crews. We have it from the Minister that 37 overseas vessels are available for the Tasmanian trade, 30 of which are manned by white labour, and the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Seabrook) tells us that sixteen of them, or ""thereabouts, are cargo vessels. As has been stated more than once tonight, I was responsible for the principal act. I was, indeed, the chairman of the Royal Commission on Navigation, and I literally spent years in obtaining the in formation on which the bill was framed, and in piloting the measure through this House. I was delighted to hear the honourable member for New England (Mr . Thompson) describe the measure as a great act, embodying one of the v it a l principles of our national policy. Like other great principles in operation, it sometimes inflicts hardship. We are dealing with such a case in this bill . But the honourable gentleman was right in saying that if the hardship is one that cannot be borne, we ought to apply the remedy in such a way as not to involve the violation of vital principles in which we believe. In the case before us this can be done. The remedy to our hand can be applied in such a way as to give relief, and yet not violate a great principle. The Minister's declaration that, if we accept the amendment, the royal assent to the bill will be withheld, convincing. I have had considerable experience in making recommendations to the Governor General in regard to assenting to measures passed by this Parliament. Technically, there are one or two classes of bills which are reserved for the royal assent; that is to say, they are referred to the Colonial Office, His Majesty the King in this, as in all other matters, folio wing the advice of his Ministers in London. But, although to say it may perhaps appear heresy, I do not believe that any bill need now be reserved for the royal assent. Let us assume, however, that this bill was reserved for the royal assent. It is of such insignificance, compared with the great measure which it amends, that it would be foolish to imagine that it would cause the Colonial Office a moment's concern. I do not believe that the royal assent would be delayed for a day. On the contrary, Mr Amery would tell the Governor General, as he told the Governor pf the State of New South Wales, "" You must follow the advice of your Minister*."" As Governors of New South Wales have found to their cost, it does not pay to do anything else. I ask the Minister to consider the position in which he places honourable members like myself. I and my dead friends, the late Mr Tudor and the late Senator R. Guthrie,' are responsible for the passing of the Navigation Act. So far as the bill is a measure of relief for Tasmania, I support it wholeheartedly. Yet when confronted with an amendment for the helping of Tasmania by granting licences to vessels manned by white labour, the Minister declines to accept it, because its acceptance would place the Crown in a most awkward position. That argument does not impress me. I honestly think that if the. Minister is obdurate, 3ome way will have to be found to enable us to show that, whilst we are in favour of giving relief to Tasmania, we are not in favour of grantin? licences to boats manned by black labour. The Minister has said that the owners of certain vessels have expressed their willingness that those vessels should call at Tasmania. When I was in office, those who controlled our coastal shipping in the main worked in amicable arrangeMT. W. M. Hughes. ment with the British shipping combine. The conditions may have altered. I do not know whether they have is not or not, but I should be most surnrised, to learn that the deep sea companies'- I speak, of course, of the owners of passenger ships, and not of those outside the combination-ar e prepared to intrude upon the business of the coastal shipping companies. That, of course, has nothing to do with the Minister who says that he is going to do his best to help Tasmania. The Government has made that pledge and is going to try to carry it out. We are trying to help them. Honourable members on the other side have put forward a counter suggestion for the running of a government steamship service. I have nothing to say about that, because it is unnecessary that anything should be said about it ; it speaks for itself. I started a government steamship service, and I think there have been more strikes in connection with it than' in connection with any service conducted by private employers in this country. I should like the Prime Minister to give us the benefit of his opinion on this question. Progress reported. APPROPRIATION BILL 1925-26. Bill returned from the Senate, without request.
