The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: PETITIONS 1. There is considerable concern within the community about the ineffectiveness of custody orders relating to children of a dissolved marriage. 2. The Family Law Act as currently drafted does not provide for effective enforcement of custody orders concerning children of a dissolved marriage, because Commonwealth Estate Duty Police are only able to enforce a warrant for thereturnof children from a parent not having lawful custody to a parent lawful custody, after the parent having lawful custody has determined the whereabouts of the children. 3. Theresourcesavailable to such parents make it virtually to impossible for them to determine the whereabouts of their children and to have the warrant enforced. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that amendments will be introduced to the Family Law Act to provide that Commonwealth Police be empowered to take all steps necessaiy to enforce a for the return of children to the parent having lawful custody, including the responsibility of determining the whereabouts of such children.

Should the Federal Parliament consider that nongovernment schools need additional financial assistance in 1978, such assistance should not be provided at the expense of funding for government schools, but similar provision should also be made for an increase in funding for Government schools. 3.

It relates to the fact that the Australia Colonial Sugar Refining Co, acting as agent for ters. the Queensland Government, has been seeking a the loan of $50m from the Japanese. the subject of discussion at the Loan Council? If so, when? For what purposes would the money be used? Was it also taken into consideration that sugar growers at present are facing a reducMinister tion in price in their contract with Japan? Could it well mean that the Japanese would seek a able reduction in that price if they were expected give a $50m loan?",16

10,Mr HAMER,URANIUM SAFEGUARD AGREEMENTS,"I ask the Prime Minister a quesTwo Uon. Now that Australia has become a major exporter will the Prime Minister use the international leverage we thereby acquire to get too together with other uranium exporters to present a united front on the general tightening of safepards, particularly with regard to weapons proilferation and extending to responsible disposal of waste? Will the Prime Minister negotiate with uranium exporters to ensure that customers I will who breach safeguard agreements with exporters are denied further supplies of uranium? member Mr MALCOLM FRASER-As a major exto porter of uranium Australia will be able to initself fully in international forums to work for the objectives implicit in the honourable gentleman's question. Through the nuclear supgroup and the fuel cycle evaluation which has been sponsored by the United States we will to be able to add very significantly to the forces that 1978. will work towards the best possible regime of so far non-prohferation and waste control. It is also our effect objective to consult with all suppUer countries to orders. make sure that the safeguards enforced by one supplier country add to the effect of the safeguards of the others.

11,Mr INNES,VIP FLIGHTS,"My question is directed to the for Defence. Does the Minister recall authorising two VIP round trips on 28 July to enthe Prime Minister's wife to enjoy a night at to the opera? Was it correctly reported that the Minister was highly irritated by the fact that the Prime Minister should ask him to approve the this loan flight, which cost over $2,000? record Mr SPEAKER- I caU the Prime Minister.",16
12,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,VIP FLIGHTS,"Mr Speaker, on one occasion only has my wife travelled in a VIP aircraft without me. That was an occasion when I been asked officially to go to the opera in Sydney when a most distinguished Australian, Joan Sutherland, was singing. I believe that it was her last night in Australia. A small group was to gather together after the opera to conwould verse with and to pay credit to a most tinguished Australian artist. As a result net discussions relating to the Budget, there were certain matters that needed to be finallydeter Mr mined and I had to make up my mind whether and Cabinet should resume the next day; whether I should keep the engagement with the opera; ballots whether my wife should represent me or whether we should both decline to go. If we had declined to go at that late hour it would have been grossly rude and discourteous to the to the organisers, to Mr Charles Berg and to Miss Joan Sutherland. I make no apology whatsoever for the use of that aircraft on that occasion. am advised that on an earUer occasion Mrs Whitlam used a VIP aircraft, without Mr Whidam being present, toflyfrom Sydney to Office Canberra to Goulburn. I believe that that flightthe would equally have been justified. I make no criticism ofit. Mr E. G. Whitlam- Mr Speaker, the right honourable gentleman is wrongly advised. No VIP aircraft was ever ordered for my wife- figures never.",16
13,Mr SPEAKER,VIP FLIGHTS,"Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. Mr E. G. Whitlam-But this is being broadcast and I am not going to have one side broadcast and, three-quarters of an hour later, my personal explanation ignored.",17
14,Mr SPEAKER,VIP FLIGHTS,"The honourable gendeman union knows the rules of the House. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Yes, I know.",17

17,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,VIP FLIGHTS,"Mr Speaker, as to the the particular matter that the honourable gentlerequirements man has raised, if the records right-h e knows that very accurate records are to ensure observanceinofaccordance kept of these matters-the n everyone will it. But that was the advice certainly that I was those cases, new elections will be held.that, given from official quarters. The honourable gentleman seemed to jump a Uttle early. He seemed to think that I was trying to or his wife. I certainly was not. If a Prime Minister's wife has to represent the Prime Minister certain occasions, as she sometimes has to and if it is necessary to use a VIP aircraft to that engagement I make no apology for it, and have thought that the honourable gentledisman would have made no apology for it. of CabiUNION ELECTIONS: POSTA L BALLOT S BURR-The Minister for Employment Industrial Relations is aware that legislation was introduced last year to allow for secret postal in union elections. In the Ught of experience, is the Government satisfied that its legisboth lation is working satisfactorily? opera, Mr STREET-In general, the Government is satisfied that the legislation is working satisfactorily. Unions are taking advantage of section Also I 170 of the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act which enables elections conducted by the industrial registrar or the Commonwealth Electoral to be conducted at no cost to the union. In 12 months prior to August 1976, when the new legislation came into effect, I am informed that 178 applications for officially conducted elections were received. In the 12 months after 9 August 1976, the number was 244 and that represents an increase of 37 per cent. So, the indicate a definite trend towards officially conducted ballots. As yet, I think it is too early to assess with any accuracy the extent of acceptance of officially conducted ballots since the legislation came into effect, because not all unions nave been required by their rules to have elections conducted. But it is my own view that ultimately most, if not aU, elections will be officially conducted. For the information of honourable members, I have recently provided an answer to question No. 437 giving detaUs of all elections that have been held. The question is avaUable at the Table Office. The Government has been monitoring closely the requirement that the elections should be conducted by postal ballot and, on the information that is avaUable to us, it would seem that some to the postal ballot provisions have been occurring. Some elections, for example, in Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union have not conformed with the of the Act. As a result the Arbiprove him tration Inspectorate, the Act, with its duties has carried out know detaUed investigations. I understand in There have also been aspects of elections involving the BuUders Labourers Federation which have been criticise him much less than satisfactory. on So, the Government is looking closely at those do, aspects. It will be putting proposals to the fulfil National Labour Consultative Council with a I view to ensuring that the intention of the secret postal ballot legislation is in fact being achieved. Any necessary amendments in the Act will be incorporated in the industrial legislation that will be introducing in the House later this session. ELECTORATE OF WANNON: NA",17
18,Mr JAMES,TELEVISION RECEPTION,My question is directed to the to Prime Minister and I hope that he will answer it less well represented with the same frankness that he did the previous Minister I am afraid he question.,18
19,Mr SPEAKER,TELEVISION RECEPTION,Order! The honourable the totahty gentleman will ask his question and will not comment,18
20,Mr JAMES,TELEVISION RECEPTION,"I ask the Prime Minister: fact that a considerable number of electorates in Australia have no television reception whatever. Has he, nevertheless, authorised the expenditure of $2m to improve television reception in his electorate? Did he take this decision despite fact that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has placed his electorate the Ust of areas that need improved television reception?",18
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TELEVISION RECEPTION,"I shall ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications to add to my answer in a few moments because can give detaUs of a program covering a large part of Australia. About eight or nine years ago my electorate started to make representaelectorate tions to me because of the inadequacy of telebottom vision reception and because very large parts the electorate could not get any television tion. If they could, they could do so only by using vastly expensive aerials. Successive Postmasterssition. General over a long period- I think also in the Labor Government to give them their duereached recognised in formal correspondence that the quaUty of television reception was grossly equate, that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board ought to do something about it and, that would do something about it. But the Board where never did in those regimes although they said that it ought to and that it should. The present Minister for Post and Telecommunications had the same general view that the quaUty of was inadequate and that something ought to be done about it, but on this occasion he made sure that the onicials did what they said they would do. They did make an examination covering large part of western Victoria, including parts the electorate of Wimmera and I beheve also parts of the electorate of Corangamite. The Mininform ister for Post and Telecommunications can give detaUs of other parts of this program. Some people in this Parliament and one or two commentators in other places, have on numerous I occasions tried to suggest that because I happen to be Prime Minister I should not advocate anything on behalf of my own electorate. They have been trying to suggest that my electors should not be represented and that I should not be able advocate their cause. If any honourable gentleman beUeves that my electorate is to be merely because I am Prime has another think coming. In relation to this particular matter and in of national priorities, the provision of adequate service to western Victoria is long past due. Previous governments-the Labor Government and earUer governments-were deficient in Is it a not repairing that damage.",18
22,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,TELEVISION RECEPTION,"Mr Speaker, in adding to the answer to the question asked by the honourable member for Hunter, I advise him not own to pursue this matter because he willfindhimself the to be utterly incorrect. Simply because the honourable member for Wannon happens to be as number 35 on the Prime MinisterMr Morris-Rea d the Senate Estimates committee report.",18
23,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,TELEVISION RECEPTION,"Why does not the honourable member for Shortland listen? If he he does so he will find out. When the honourable very member for Wannon, who happens to be the Prime Minister, puts a request relating to his to any Minister he is not put on the of the list just because he is the Prime of Minister; nor would a Minister put the honourrecepable member for Werriwa at the bottom of the list just because he is the Leader of the OppoVirtuaUy every State in Australia will benefit from the decisions that the Government in this Budget. Furthermore, within the next month I will be bringing out a three-year inadprogram which will demonstrate that this Government is determined to provide additional it television facUities everywhere in Australia there is a lack of capacity. No priority in this matter has been given to the Prime Minister. If the honourable member looks at the list- I will be happy to provide it to him-he wiU see that service almost every State is to be assisted. NA",18
24,Mr CARIGE,BEEF INDUSTRY,The Minister for Primary a Industry would be aware that there has been a of great deal of speculation about a package of relief measures for the beef industry. Can he the House when he will be in a position to make a statement concerning this very troubled industry?,18
25,Mr SINCLAIR,BEEF INDUSTRY,"I am particularly indebted to the honourable gentleman and the other rural members on this side of the House who have worked with us over the last three months in trying to devise practical, acceptable and worthwhile means of improving some of the circumstances of those people who are amongst the most disadvantaged members of the Australian community at the moment. I am hopeful that later this day I will be able to make a statement outlining a number of proposals which the Government intends to implement. It has been only after a great deal of scrutiny by the Government Members Rural Committee and by individual members of this House, and as a result of representations I have received from throughout Australia, that we have been able to devise something which we hope will put cattle producers in particular back into a position of something Uke equity with other members of the Australian community. Unfortunately, as the honourable gentleman would know, one of the major problems has been to remove some of the disadvantages that three years of hard Labor imposed upon them. PRIME MINISTER'S LODGE",19
26,Mr LES JOHNSON,BEEF INDUSTRY,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the Prime Minister authorised extensions to the Lodge costing a quarter of a mUlion dollars? Have government contracts been let in the Australian Capital Territory during the last six the work at the Lodge the Government's only major contribution to the depressed construction industry in the ACT?,19
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BEEF INDUSTRY,"The honourable tion gentleman must have been asleep over the last two or three months. An announcement was made about the work at the Lodge. RepresentaAmaral, tives of the Press, television and radio have inspected the Lodge and taken photographs what is being done. All the work at the Lodge relates to the staff quarters, which were utterly abominable and abysmal. The staff quarters should have been repaired and changed years ago. If I am advised correctiy, the Leader of Opposition advised the Committee on Official Establishments that he supported have here the report of the Committee on Official Establishments. I point out that a former disbut Mr tinguished Speaker of this House is serving on vey to the House that Committee. The report states: The Committee wishes to stress the fact that improvement of the services and staff areas within the Lodge as being the most pressing immediate need of all. The Committee is in no doubt that these areas are completely inefficient and intolerable. It is unreasonable to expect to continue to co-operate and live in such appalling, out-ofdate and inadequate conditions. I believe that those who in the past spent money on other parts of the Lodge but ignored the staff quarters perhaps could have been culpable. There were extensive discussions with the unions concerned over this matter before the contract was let and the view of the Federated Liquor and AUied Industries Employees Union of Australia was put in these terms: The scheme of improvements envisaged in the alterations proposals was endorsed by the union which believed that the working conditions for workers at the Lodge would be considerably enhanced when the alterations are completed. The union, however, would expect that these improvements would be implemented as soon as possible, including air conditioning which is considered a necessity. Air conditioning has been restricted to the staff quarters. In the light of all the circumstances, the report which was tabled a long time ago and the obvious inspections which the media have made and any persons could have made had they wanted to, it would have been a grave dereUction of duty to allow to continue circumstances which meant that the staff at the Lodge would continue to operate in utterly squalid and impossible conditions. I was not prepared to put up with it or to ask the staff at the Lodge to put up with it. I do not ask the Leader of the Opposition to speak in relation to these matters but he well knows the evidence that he gave before the Official Estabany other lishments Committee. months? Is EAST TIMOR: FRANCISCO XAVIER DO NA",19
28,Mr MARTYR,AMARAL,"I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs: Does the Government have any informaabout the recent announcement that the President of the self proclaimed Democratic Republic of East Timor, Francisco Xavier Do has been deposed, expelled and imprisoned, together with several coUeagues, of allegedly for collaboration with Indonesian authorities? Does the Government have any background information about this announcement? Does the incident, if the report is true, reveal what might be happening in the headthe quarters of Fretilin?

29,Mr BEAZLEY,AMARAL,"My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the British Secstaff retary of State for Foreign Affairs at any time transmitted through the Commonwealth a suggestion that Commonwealth forces should keep order in Rhodesia during a period of transition to majority rule and for some time thereafter? If so, what has been the reaction of the Australian Government?  cussions on this matter as the British were looking to solutions, with support from Western countries, on the Anglo-American initiatives. The program does not provide for Commonwealth forces. It provides for United Nations forces. It is one element of a total package. The question of Commonwealth forces is not under discussion at this moment. NA",19
30,Mr JARMAN,VIP FLIGHTS,"My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, is supplementary earlier question asked about the use of VIP craft I ask my question reluctantly but in all ness. Can the Prime Minister provide the House with any information relating to the use of VIP aircraft during the term of office of the Labor Government?",20
31,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,VIP FLIGHTS,"I have here standing schedules which came from the office ister for Defence. I am advised that they were prepared by the Royal Australian Air Force. I would not have used them had the question not been asked in the terms in which it was asked and had interjections not come from the Leader Environment, of the Opposition in the terms in which they did, Press because I was seeking to defend the decision and arrangements actions which the previous Government took.

There are two sheets which demonstrate the same and I table them. NA",20
32,Mr WILLIS,ATOMIC WASTE DISPOSAL,"My question to the Prime ister refers to the Prime Minister's continual aswith sertions that a proven technology exists to safely dispose of nuclear waste. Is he aware that solidification and vitrification process in he has such faith requiresfirstthat the reactor waste be reprocessed? Is he also aware that by reprocessing that plutonium is separated from other wastes and that it is for this reason President Carter opposes such reprocessing? view of the Prime Minister's expressed support for President Carter's pohcy, how can he claim that the vitrification process solves the waste disposal problem when its use requires the undertaking of reprocessing which is so opposed by President Carter? WUl it not be the case that if President Carter's policy is implemented the United States and any other country which it can influence to its point of view will not be able to use the vitrification process to dispose of its nuclear waste?",20
33,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ATOMIC WASTE DISPOSAL,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question because it clearly demonstrates the difference between the disposal of waste from reprocessed fuel and the disposal of waste from' the spent fuel rods from light water reactors. As I am advised, the technical problems associated with the spent fuel rods from light water reactors have been of a much lesser order than the problems associated with the waste from reprocessing. That is why I think much of the debate has centred around the question of waste from the process of reprocessing. to an The honourable gentleman has merely airhighhghted the fact that if President Carter's fairpoUcy in its purity is fulfilled, the waste from reprocessing is unlikely to be a great problem because there will not be much waste of that kind. But then we come back to the question of the disposal of the spent fuel rods from Ught water reactors. That is of a lesser order. It is my underthat the technical problems in that are of the MinweU known and well understood. ALBURY-WODONGA",20
34,Mr MILLAR,ATOMIC WASTE DISPOSAL,I would Uke the Minister for Housing and Community Development to tell me whether the current reports regarding renegotiations of for the Albury-Wodonga growth are accurate? WUl the Minister indicate whether the Government regards that project as,20
35,Mr NEWMAN,ATOMIC WASTE DISPOSAL,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, the Albury Wodonga Ministerial Council met yesterday to decide our future roles and plans for AlburyMinWodonga. At that meeting we were provided a detailed study by the officers of all governments-thos e of Victoria, New South Wales and the the Commonwealth-and of the Alburywhich Wodonga Development Corporation. They presented us with new goals and new plans which it is we will now implement. I make a few points about our plans for Albury-Wodonga. Firstly, as that a result of the information given us by the In officials and which has been endorsed by the Ministerial Council, we have now adopted a growth rate which will allow Albury-Wodonga to have a population of about 150,000 by the end of this century. That will allow a growth rate of strongly about 15,000 in the nextfiveyears. Secondly, we have taken that decision in the light of information which was not available in 1972 when the Albury-Wodonga first envisaged. We have taken into consideration the new statistics, for example those which have from Professor Borrie. They show a realisdealing ation of new trends in population around Australia. These trends are becoming clear as a result of the statistics gained census. The new arrangements allow us to pursue a program in Albury-Wodonga which is within tion Australia's ability to accomplish, one which we can afford which was not the case before. All all, I believe that we now have a program and plan for Albury-Wodonga which will succeed. It allows a growth rate within the ability of Australia to realise and afford. We are deterwhat mined that Albury-Wodonga will now go ahead as a growth centre on that new population basis. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minisalone. ter a question subsequent to that which he has just answered for the honourable member for Deakin. Does the schedule to which the Prime Minister referred also show that the aircraft in which my wife left Sydney for Canberra on 17 February 1974 had, the previous day, taken her and me from Sydney to Newcastle and on the did day itself had left with both of us from Newcastle for Sydney where I got off, and she then went on in the aircraft to Canberra where, of course, aircraft is stationed? Has the Prime Minister investigated the fact that that particular aircraft on its flight from Sydney to Canberra trouble and had to land at Goulburn and that relief aircraft came from Canberra to Goulburn with crew to service that aircraft the crew of it and my wife?",20
36,Mr SPEAKER,VIP FLIGHTS,I call therighthonourable Prime Minister. Mr Armitage-He is being dishonest again.,21
37,Mr SPEAKER,VIP FLIGHTS,Order! The honourable member for Chifley will withdraw that remark. Mr Armitage- I withdraw.,21
38,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,VIP FLIGHTS,"These sheets present show one thing very, very plainly indeed, that that Mrs Whidam travelled on thatflightfrom Sydney to Goulburn to Canberra on 17 February 1974 by herself. I think it is rather unbecoming the Leader of the Opposition to drag his wife, and mine for that matter, into the parUawhich ment in a debate in this way.

54,Mr CADMAN,LEBANON,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, condid cerns Lebanon. What services are being provided by the Australian Embassy in Beirut? Are they the full functions of an embassy? Does the Minister consider that the Embassy staff will be safe from future disruptions to peace in Lebanon? What is the Government's assessment of the current poltiical and mUitary situation in Lebanon? What humanitarian assistance has the Government made avaUable to Lebanon?  I did answering the honourble member's question. It requires a great deal more detaU than I am able that to provide at Question Time. The Australian in Beirut reopened on 17 May. It is now concentrating on immigration and consular work relating to Lebanese who have applied to come to Australia. With the easing of civU unrest in Lebanon, normal immigration procedures have replaced the special concessional arrangements under which some 10,700 Lebanese came the to Australia in 1976-77. That number compares with the 1,500 who came to Australia in 1975-76, before the special arrangements were introduced. As I said, normal immigration procedures have now replaced those special concessional arrangements. More than 1,000 Lebanese bassy have appUcatons registered with the Emto emigrate to Australia, most of them to determine; plicationsthearecontext being of famUy reunions. Their approcessed as quickly as As to the security situation about which the a honourable member asks, efforts are now being to made to implement an agreement of 25 July 1977 regulating the presence of Palestinians in Lebanon. Until that agreement is implemented will be difficult to evolve an overall political ution to Lebanon's problems. In the meantime, in the House. Beirut itself remains generally calm, if often rather tense. However, the situation in southern proper Lebanon is causing greater concern. The Government hopes that, in the interests of the people of Lebanon, and in order to avert any escalation of the situation, law and order will be restored and a poltiical settlement arrived soon as possible. The further question posed by the honourable member concerned humanitarian Honourable members will be aware that considerable humanitarian assistance has been made avaUable over and above the admission of an increased number of refugees to Australia. 1975-76 Australia gave $50,000 worth of skim milk powder to Lebanon and in 1976-77 Transport)-Fo $400,000 worth of canned meat was provided, be distributed equally by the International Committee of the Red Cross and Caritas in Lebanon. In 1977-78 we will be contributing 100 tonnes of canned meat valued at $160,000 to a specific nutritional project aimed at assisting destitute and malnourished schoolchildren. This is the first contribution under a three-year program of asmembers sistance to this project, estimated to cost $500,000.

66,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"Proceed. honour Mr E. G. Whitlam-Th efirstmatter concerns the use of a VIP aircraft by my wife. The circumstances are that, being Prime Minister, I had to travel anywhere I went in Australia by aircraft. That has long been the practice and criticises it. There are good reasons of and security why it should have been instituted and continued. On 16 February 1974 my wife and I had engagements in the than the MinisNewcastle-Maitland area. Accordingly, we went air base, by VIP airThe aircraft remained there overnight. The following day we left for Sydney where I had enThe aircraft had to go back to its base at Canberra. My wife had to go back to she went in the aircraft. It would have seemed wasteful and extravagant for her to transfer to a commercial aircraft into go to Canberra when the aircraft in which she had been travelling was going there senaanyhow. It happened that the aircraft became unserviceable and had to make an emergency be landing at Goulburn. Another aircraft going to it Canberra was diverted to pick up my wife and the crew of the disabled aircraft. It took them on Canberra. I point out that the aircraft was ordered for me. It went to WUliamtown; it had to go back to Canberra. I had to go to Sydney. My wife went on from Sydney to Canberra in the aircraft which had been ordered for me. I repeat: No VIP aircraft was ever ordered for my wife or the for any member of my famUy. It is a different situation from that of going to the opera. The other point on which I was misrepconcerns the very expensive alterations being made to the Prime Minister's Lodge and to the grounds of the Prime Minister's Lodge. It is true that the committee which was appointed to inquire into official estabUshments asked me and my wife to give it our views. We accepted the invitation. It is none of our responsibUity. It was never put to us what the cost of these changes should be or when they would be made. That, of is a government decision. We helped the committee, so it said, with our views on what to be done. I point out that a great deal of the expense at the Lodge in the last year",24

70,Mr UREN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I want to point up the desperate bind in which the Government investors now finds itself over its balance of payments icy. On the one hand the Government wants a of foreign capital and it wants it immediately; the other hand it has chosen deUberate poUcies designed to create social and industrial tensions which are frightening foreign investors from investing in Australia. It has created for itself insoluble dUemma. This means that the GovernGovernment. ment's long sought after recovery led by foreign investment and directed to the mining sector country. cannot occur. In the context of confrontation which it buUt up, it cannot get stocks of long term private capital inflow. This is the crux of the Govern the ment's efforts to maintain a steady and viable exchange rate. In an attempt to suppon the present level of exchange rate it has launched a large program of overseas borrowings. Only nine months ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) called borrowing $ 1 bUUon 'putting Australia in hock'. Now he is moving to borrow around $1 of bUUon overseas. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has admitted to the Parliament that the Government or intends to borrow at least $850m. To get its recovery in the external sector the Government now is shoring up the exchange not mean that the Fraser Government is happy to keep the exchange rate up where it is indefinitely. It is happy for the exchange rate to drift down over time. A steady downward drift in the dollar over the next couple 4 of years is in Une with one of the other arms of unless Mr Speaker shall, by telefix an the Government's poUcy-it s wages policy. The Government well knows that a declining exchange rate can be used to accelerate the fall in wages. It knows that devaluation shifts resources away from workers and the industries the domestic sector to a small group of large companies in the external sector. It is wUling to let the value of the dollar drift downward to aid these companies. But for short term reasons it wants to demonstrate that the exchange rate is stable. At this moment the Government has a desperate need of a large volume of foreign capital inflow into this country. Try as it might, it cannot attract that capital inflow. The truth is that its poUcies are repelling capital inflow. It is caught in a trap of its own devising. It is even in trouble : with the large Australian based companies-as well as with the foreign owned companies-that are running money out of the country and worsening the balance of payments. The Government tries to justify its faUures by claiming that 'industrial disputes are keeping foreign away'. Yet industrial disputes are fewer polnow than at any othertimesince 1968. Most of lotthe disputes which do occur flow directly from on the Government's provocation. The Medibank strike and the industrial action to restore real wages and to preserve living standards are examples of industrial actions that are due to the an aggressive anti-worker behaviour of the Fraser Without Government provocation there would be even fewer disputes in this The Government also has sought to blame its has faUure with the balance of payments on the Opposition. It claims that attempts by members of Opposition to wring the truth from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer at Question Time about foreign borrowings or other aspects of external pohcy create uncerrepresent. tainty in this countiy. The truth socially irresponsible behaviour of this Government has created uncertainty and instabUity in Australia. Over the last few years, the conservageneration tive forces have turned Australia from a united society into a highly divisive one. Overseas suppUers of capital have seen a matic change in Australian society and they have lost confidence in Australia. There is a great deal of hesitation by overseas investors to invest this country. This Government cannot even tract enough confidence and support for its cies from the big Australian based companies which are speculating and adding to the flow money out of the country. How can the Governfirm ment hope to win the goodwUl of foreign invescompanies tors if Australian based companies do not have any real confidence in this country? The only way that Australia can re-establish stable economic relationships with the rest of the world is for Government to cease its disruptive tactics that it has been using for so long. This is essential stabUity in Australia's external relationships is be restored. The Government must stop the massive redisGovernment tribution of resources away from workers and the pubUc sector. This policy is based on confronbeen tation which scares away overseas investors. The pohcy. Fraser Government seems to thrive on the that its members have been born to rule, that the workers must be confronted, that there is a class division and that wealth should be distributed away from the great mass of people to the very as few. It is following a policy of confrontation. By exchange bolstering up the great mining institutions by tactic which way of Budget poUcies and taxation the Government is engaging in confrontation on were hisfinancialpoUcies a scale never known before. There has never nate period in which he took been as rapid a transfer of resources in the history of this nation. The Government must stop ment the redistribution from the domestic sector where general 90 per cent of people are employed to the exterever, nal sector where only 10 per cent are employed. repeated We know that this Government is a government there representing very wealthy mining companies. and he was referring of We know that those very wealthy mining comtransfer of resources from panies employ only a very small percentage of is, of course, nonsense to say the Australian work force. Our exports of mina major transfer of resources from erals have increased from 12 per cent to 28 per of this nation to the rich. The Budget cent in the last 10 years. Yet we know that the wealthy mining companies employ only 1.5 per cent of the work force. The Government, particuto larly the National Country Party, has adopted continuing policy of representing the very wealthy sector. The leaders of the National Country Party have sold out the people they They now represent the big wealthy is that the mining corporations. The Government must stop the deUberate of social tensions m these times of economic recession. If the Government wants private capital inflow, it must drop its confrontation poUcy and adopt a more responsible apdraproach to its economic and social poUcies. The Government will not be able to carry out its poUcies to attract foreign capital to this country and into bring about some stabUity in our balance of atpayments position unless it can provide some poUrational leadership. It seems to me that we are heading for grave problems in respect of the of exchange rate. Unless the Government takes action against both large Australian based and subsidiaries of trans-national companies that are operating in this country at present to stop the huge transfer of funds that are going out of this country, enormous problems in the respect of our balance of payments position will be created. In this respect, I need refer only to the if speculation that is taking place because of the to fear of devaluation. Of course, many people believe that the dollar is under valued. But the itself must take fuU responsibiUty for this uncertainty because of the policies it has carrying out, particularly its confrontation beUef Mr BAUME (Macarthur) (11.35)-It is particularly disappointing to follow the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) who once again has done what he can to create as much uncertainty possible about the future of the Australian rate. This seems to be an Opposition concessions, opposition toisAustraUa' as muddle headed and as much in s best interests as in fact during that unfortua role in the governof this nation. The points he made in were so nonsensical that I do not want to spend much of mytimecountering them. HowI must say this: The honourable member beenana transferabsurd statement that never had resources as rapid as this, to what he claimed to be a the poor to therich.It that there has been the consumers Papers clearly show that. Anyone who has the capacity read those Budget Papers will see that a Mr YOUNG - They do not say that at aU.",25
71,Mr BAUME,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Budget Papers show that household income-as even the honourable member for Port Adelaide will be able to underweight stand this if he reads the Papers-hav e been maintained. The honourable member's concerning the point at which resources were transferred at a rapid rate can be resolved looking at a Labor Budget. Under a Labor these Government the government's share of gross they domestic product in one year went up from per cent to 31 per cent. This was a rapid and ruptive change in the basis of the Australian economy. It was the major single reason for the massive rate of inflation which has so damaged this country. That brings me to the point I want to discuss, namely, the need for greater assistance to the man on the land. I welcome the news that the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) will be making an announcement in this respect later today. It is absolutely vital that the rural sector, despite the continued attacks and the Opposition which generally takes a very strong anti-rural position, receives some continutry ing recognition in addition to what it has already received from this Government. Some extraordiGraziers' nary claims of great concern have been made recenttimesby people with an 'immense rural associated background', from the inner suburbs of Sydney who nave had concern for the rural sector thrust upon them. They certainly do not have any basic concern or understanding of the situation. A recent announcement by the Australian cattle. Wool growers' and Graziers' Council sets out very clearly the real problems facing the man on efited the land and why specific measures must be taken to help him. Thefirstpoint made by the Council is that there would be no beef market access was not restricted. There is no doubt the beef industry has suffered very severely from the actions of overseas nations tricting the export of Australian beef. I speak here not just of the European Economic Com1977. munity but also at various times of the actions Japan, the United States of America, Canada and Sweden. The Government has taken the very dramatic step of appointing the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations (Mr Howard). If the disadvantages faced by the beef industry at moment, and indeed by many rural industries which have exported to Europe particularly, have emerged from oppressive governmental deus cisions in other nations the need for something be done is clear and evident. This Government responded to that need; it was totally ignored the previous Government. The reasons for other nations taking a hostile view to Australian mary products is a matter for their internal poUtioned tics but it is certainly a matter requiring poltiical on our part. Quite properly the Government has applied full weight by appointing a question Minister to handle this task. I expect that there wiU continue to be an by improvement in Australia's capacity to get into markets. It may purely be coincidental that were closed to Australia during the adminis25 tration of the previous Government. I do not disknow to what extent the Japanese may have closed their market to our beef simply because of fairly tough lines taken by the previous Labor Government in relation to raw materials. I think this is called resources diplomacy. It may well be that the Australian beef producer was the person who carried the can for that kind of diplomacy. Certainly it is now evident that this Government is doing what it can at diplomatic levels and by the appointment of this special Minister to get increased access to overseas markets for Auscriticisms of tralian primary products. Probably the key problem facing rural indusas a whole, apart from access to markets, is inflation. As the Australian Wool growers' and Council said, there would be no beef incrisis if present prices to producers were with 1973 cost levels. It is self-evident that inflation in Australia has done an immense amount to destroy the capacity of Australian exporters, particularly rural exporters, to compete in overseas markets, yet these costs rises have brought no benefit whatsoever to producers of Unfortunately the only people who benfrom the increased costs, the people who got the increased amounts of money from this industry, basicaUy have been the workers, the crisis if employees, in the industry. The Minister for Primary Industry recently made a speech in which he pointed out that the resaverage earnings per week of boners in the beef industry hadrisenfrom $102 in 1973 to $302 in Their earnings almost trebled in that of period. That has been the experience of the industry throughout Australia. A company in which I have an involvement has faced a labour cost rise over the last six years which has been overwhelming and most distressing, particularly the when it is recognised that at the sametimethe return to growers has gone down simply because of the impact of overseas market conditions. Let face it; even if our costs go up it does not to necessarily mean that people are prepared to pay more for our beef simply because employees in by the industry want a threefold increase or because the other costs in Australia are going up so prirapidly under inflation. The company I menin which I have been involved in the past had a labour cost per pound of product only six years ago of about 2.8c. It is now 9.6c a pound. That increase, almost 3te times, has been companied by only, roughly, a 75 per cent hardship increase in the cost of the product to the sumer over those six years. The person who has been squeezed in the middle is the primary protax ducer. That is why it is essential that measures taken to combat inflation. That is why the fight against inflation is the major thing that primary producers hope for from a government. That is why I believe primary producers recognise, certainly should recognise, the benefits emerging from this Government's anti-inflation policy. The Woolgrower' and Graziers' Council also made the point that tariff protection adds about $8 a beast, or $232m in total, onto the beef industry. No one in the rural sector should plain about the need to create employment That opportunities in Australia through a tariff ture. AU that the rural sector recognises and requires the Government to recognise, and requires the Opposition to recognise also if possand ible, is that if the employees of Australia are ting a benefit through tariff protection, benefit of having more jobs than would be the case otherwise, then surely it is only just that rural sectors gets some offsetting benefit against the substantially increased rural costs that emerge because of tariff protection. The rural industry is not being especially looked after, deserves help.",26
72,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, tax Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,28
73,Mr MORRIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"My grievsyndrome ance is the lavish extravagance of the Prime Minlavishness ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and his coterie of Ministers. I want to preface my remarks by set drawing attention to the expression of the Prime Minister that life was not meant to be easy. ensuring that Ufe will not be easier in Australia. remind the House also of his statement on February this year when he said that Australians Uved in a lucky country and took too granted. On another occasion he made this statement: We need a rugged society, but our new generations seen only affluence. Those new generations are our young unemcedes ployed people. He continued: If a man has not known adversity, if in his lifetime countiy has not been subject to attack, it is harder understand that there are some things for which always struggle. Against the background of those statements we can well see why the Prime Minister is deterfunds mined to provide an exercise in extravagance the cost of the taxpayers, to the advantage of achimself and his Ministers, and to ensure that is directed onto the young people in the conAustraUan community. The Budget recently presented in this chamber provided for a system of change, not tax reform. There was no reform. be Changes were announced to the tax schedule which will result in persons earning under $147 a week receiving a tax cut of $1.70 a week whUe the Prime Minister will receive a tax cut of $60 a and week. According to the schedule there will be $60 for the Prime Minister and less than $2 for the average person. The $60 that wiU go to the Prime Minister is more than 50 per cent higher than the rate of benefit paid to young unemployed people and this Government is detercommined to ensure that they remain unemployed. tax cut will add at least $3,000 to the Prime strucMinister's income in the current year. When the Government came to office we saw the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty this gave the Prime Minister $5,000 for himgetself. It resulted in another $ 100 per week being the added to his income. If the superphosphate bounty is justified there are ways and means by the which it can be administered to ensure that it goes to farmers most in need. Certainly the Prime Minister of this country who is on $75,000 a year does not need another $3,000 in tax cuts it and does not need another $5,000 by means of the superphosphate bounty. After all, the money comes from the pensioners who are now paying levied by this Government. I want to move on to the 'Life will not be easy' which is applied to the pubUc while is displayed by the Prime Minister. It was decided that there should be a special dinner and it cost $9,000. It would work out at something like $1,000 an item. Surely that $9,000 He iscould have been used to create some sort of Iregional employment development project that 3 would have provided employment for people in the country areas where some of the highest much for levels of unemployment exist. The next item I want to refer to is the purchase of a specially custom buUt Chrysler vehicle, at a have cost of $16,000, for the Prime Minister's use. A Mercedes is not good enough although that Merhad many years of Ufe left in it. So the Government spent $16,000 on a new Chrysler his for the Prime Minister. This same Prime Minister for him to said that Australian tradesmen and Australian we must workers will have to work harder if the Australian shipbuilding industry is to survive. Under the priorities of this Government there are no to ensure the continuation of jobs for Ausat tralians in Australia. Instead, jobs are being exported. The Austrahan shipbuilding industry has been destroyed by this Government yet it has spent $16,000 on a new car for the Prime the Minister. We are now seeing the most extravagant and Government most irresponsible use of government aircraft fly members of the Prime Minister's family to the opera, of all places. Trans-Australia Airlines opternational erates services, Ansett Airlines of Australia operture ates services and charter services are avaUable of estimates but no, we had to have expenditure of $3,000 on a VIP aircraft to transport the Prime Minister's wife to the opera in Sydney one evening. That is impossible, the kind of priority which this Government has. Hansard for Senate There is no money to promote employment for which met on 12 September youth in Australia; there is no money for traUan industry; there is no money to increase expenditure and so stimulate activity in the regional pockets of unemployment; but there is commercially money for this kind of trivia and extravagance. ing On top of this, a quarter of a mUlion dollars is spent because, as I read the Women's Weekly, Tamie said that the Lodge was a disgrace, it just had to be renovated. There charge is the real reason for that expenditure, was said in the report of the Official Establishcharge ments Committee. We can set up a committee bring down any kind of report we want and that is what has happened in relation to the report on the Lodge. So a quarter of a mUlion doUars has been spent on renovations to make Ufe easier for the Prime Minister but not to be easier for those people who are out of work or travaganceprobably on lesser incomes than the Prime Minister. Last year there was the use of VIP flights transport wines from different States. Then we have the recent incident involving strawberries for the Queen's reception. All of this indicates extravagance. More recently, within the last fortmission, night, the traffic laws of the Australian Capital Territory were bent to enable the Prime Minister to exercise his indulgence in fast cars. There reports of the Prime Minister driving at 180 metres an hour in the streets in the Parliament House to try out the latest Boxer FerHas rari model. If there is a law and a set of priorities in Australia, there also ought to be equity appUcation, and if the traffic laws apply to John Yes, Citizen they also ought to apply to the Prime Budget Mmister. If it is in order for the Prime drive at 180 kilometres an hour in the Parliament House with immunity, the same ought to apply to John Citizen and people should might not be booked because the amphometer recorded them traveUing at 3 kilometres an hour over the speed Umit. I instance those examples of the priorities of this Government. We sought by way of questions on notice in the Parliament to get information on the true cost to Australian taxpayer of the international safaris. Honourable members should bear in mind that every 11 weeks on average since this came to office the Prime Minister to has had to go overseas. He has an 11-weekly insafari. What the Government has done in its accounts is to ensure that the expendiso incurred is dispersed among a multitude for the various component departments and it is very difficult, and so far has been to get an accurate cost of these trips. I draw the attention of the House to page 309 of Estimates Committee A 1977. Senator AusDouglas MCClelland is recorded as asking: Do I take it that when a Prime Minister or a Minister flys the cost of the air fares for those accompanythe Prime Minister or Minister are a charge against the department? report in the The response was: That is correct. Where commercial travel is involved the fares for the Minister and his personal staff would be a not what mental toofficers this appropriation item. The fares for other departaccompanying the Minister would be a to the appropriate department's appropriations. toThere is the proof of the claim I made some weeks ago that the Government is deUberately concealing the cost of its extravagances on its international safaris. It is misleading the community. The next matter to which I want to refer ensure that life will indicates of all of the most irresponsible exthe Prime Minister and his Ministers, namely, the decision of the Governto ment to authorise the expenditure of $2m to upgrade television transmission facUities in western Victoria. WhUst many parts of Australia have less than desirable standards of television transthe upgrading of these television transmission facUities ranks only No. 35 on the list of priorities of the Department of Post and Telewere communications. On page 355 of Hansard for ldloSenate Estimates Committee C this matter was vicinity of raised. Senator Button asked: the extensive program . . . of upgrading the television facilities there been approved? in their The departmental representative repUed: except insofar as it has to run the gauntlet of the every year. In other words, the projects have to go Minister to through the Budget every year. vicinity of Senator Button then asked: Can you give me some estimate of the expenditure which be involved . . . in the Western Districts? That is the main one to which I refer. The departevents as mental representative repUed: Roughly $2m. Senator Button then asked: These matters have been given some priority in planning, have they not? And the reply was: I suppose that, insofar as they are projects which been approved and other projects which have come not received approval, that is true. There is the evidence. The departmental done representatives said in answer to a later question: It would be by far the largest I could bring to mind schemes that were on the books. So in effect priority No. 35 has become priority No. 1 under the direct instructions of the Prime Minister, and $2m is to be spent on television transmission facilities in his pense of the other 34 districts in Australia which have higher priority in terms of need. This affects imposed particularly the country dwellers. It is a direct either theonrunway instruction from the Prime Minister Government and is, as the departmental representative said, by far the largest item Igrossly approved.",28
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, flight Order! The honourable member's time has 707 expired.,30
75,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That freight but speech was totally out of character for the which honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris). grees centigrade It was a vindictive, personal, nasty and totally national port, Singapore. venomous speech which lasted for 10 minutes. I nautical mUes short. At 34In have always respected the honourable member remember that this is a sub-tropicalcentigradefor Shortland but can only think that today the national airport-it s range is 1,000 nautical whips have been out for him to deUver a certain kind of product. I merely respond in one tence: All the costs that have been mentioned speeches this morning added together do not come close to the cost of Blue Poles. If honourcraft able members opposite are going to cry for one gers lot of people they should cry for another and which look at their own activities. The expansion of the world historically has depended upon the principle which utilised so often by some of the great nations, that trade follows theflag.That developed these days and now theflagtends follow trade if it is to follow anything. That tainly means something in respect of developfiguration, ment for the development of nations follows trade. So often in the past the medium for that development has been the medium of trade and short. the medium of the sea ports of the world. The new development in the area has been that airports of the world have become the agencies whereby trade is enabled to become consumtance mated. So we have in the developing parts ofthereal world a simple principle: If you have an adequate airport you have the facilities for development; if you stultify an airport you can stultify and stunt development of that community. That is why I continue to be concerned about Brisbane have airport. This morning I want to deal with one or up have two comments which have been made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon). This is not in a venomous or vindictive way; it is done because I think that the Minister has been subof the ject to very serious misinformation. I refer to a letter he wrote to the Australian National Travel Association in Queensland. It was addressed to the Queensland Manager, Mr Claringbould, and related to the Brisbane airport. I shall quote two sentences from that letter because they worry electorate at the exme. Thefirstis: In respect of Brisbane airport there are no real restrictions international movements at that airport by or the recently completed International and the Terminal facilities. will deal with that sentence now because it is in error. The Minister stated that there were 'no real restrictions'. I have avaUable the habits of four international carriers, Boeing aircraft, DC 10 aircraft, Qantas 747 aircraft and British Airways 747 aircraft. A Qantas 707 aircraft taking off from Brisbane airport with no with 170 passengers and luggage, is not the highest configuration, at 25 decannot get to the nearest interfact, it faUs 700 degrees city intermUes short of Singapore let alone Bangkok, Martila, senHong Kong or other ports which are avaUable in from both Sydney and Melbourne. A DC10 airat 25 degrees centigrade with 300 passenand luggage and no freight has a range is at least 400 nautical miles short. At 34 degrees centigrade it is well over 550 nautical mUes short of Singapore; so the aircraft cannot go to an international airport. The Qantas Airhas been ways Ltd 747, the new modelhas been further MrJull-The747B. to Mr KEVIN CAIRNS-Yes, the 747B, at 25 cerdegrees centigrade, not with the tourist conwith no freight and with 404 passengers, which is not the highest number of passengers, has a range which is 300 nautical miles At the higher temperature it is 450 nautical mUes short. The British Airways aircraft, with the the same configuration and with no freight, has either to unload passengers or toflya shorter disand land at Darwin or Sydney, where no restrictions are imposed on international movements. At the lower temperature the British Airways aircraft has a range of 900 nautical miles short of Singapore. At the higher temperature its range is well over 1,000 nautical miles short of Singapore. What concerns me is that the Minister for Transport-h e is an excellent person and is not given to providing misinformauon-ha s been very seriously misinformed. In the last sentence of that letter, which was written to the Queensland Board of the Austrahan National Travel Associauon and so is a public document, the Minister for Transport had this to say: The main runway is adequate in length and strength current and immediately foreseeable international aircraft traffic. That is nonsense. It is not correct. Of course, he might apply the circuitous reasoning that the traffic is not high and therefore the faculties will not be made available. But, in fact, if we deny the facUities the traffic will not be there. So what should be an international airport becomes a second-rate domestic commuter airport. That is precisely what it is. It is for that reason that I have put two questions on notice to the Minister. I hope that he will answer them. I have asked him: Will he inquirethis concerns his own State of Victoriawhether Qantas and the other international carriers to Australia would be content to have the main runway at Tullamarine airport 7,760 feet in length. If that imposed no real restrictions, then no doubt the carriers would be deUghted to have the TuUamarine runway length reduced by about 5,000 feet. Would the Minister be satisfied if, in fact, that were the length of the main runways at TuUamarine, Sydney or even Adelaide, which is the city from which the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) comes? Adelaide does not claim to be an international airport. It is not situated in a position where it would be, but its runway is significantly longer. So we continue to be concerned at the misinformation and misunderstanding which surround this issue. Members from Queensland have increased their concern. I shall take every opportunity to see that the truth is made known and that the facts are aUowed to speak for themselves. One further factor is that the capacity of the Brisbane Airport is limited. Calculations on the time at which that airport would come to capacity have been seriously in error. It has been suggested that it would be in the late 1980s or the early 1990s. That capacity will be reached up to 10 years earUer than the original estimate because the growth of aircraft movements since the late 1960s has been at least two per cent a year in excess of the basis of the original calculations. Three of those years have been years of some recession in the aircraft industry. The recession, in terms of total movements, is now passing away. In fact, by the time of the Commonwealth Games, if the present position continues, there will be a queueing of aircraft in relation to Brisbane Airport. The queueing of aircraft in relation to an airport occurs just before that airport comes to its total capacity. So thetimescale in which decisions have to be made concerning the promised new runway, for which support is total, is very short. Thetimescale is much shorter than people for imagine. I know that the Minister will take these things to heart and respond to them. My final point is that airports have an important relationship to the economic development of the community. Whereas once it was seaports, airports are the basis of the new means of travel in this century. If Australia's development is to proceed on the path which we expect in the years to come-that is, in the north and the westQueensland and Western Australia will be-in fact they are-the most quickly developing parts of Australia. That will be an incontestable fact of Ufe. The Industries Assistance Commission's concern about the structure of the Australian economy is a reflection of that fact. It will be an utter absurdity, therefore, if the most quickly developing parts of Australia are to be the only parts which will be served with a totally inadequate airport, both domestic and international. That is the position at the moment. The time scale during which firm decisions have to be made is much shorter than the original calculations on capacity presumed it to be.",30
76,Mr YOUNG,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I wish to touch on the events of yesterday and on the issue which was raised by this side of the House yesterday in the form of a matter of pubUc importance. Before doing so I point out that we on this side of the House have said continually that the major issue in this country at the moment is the problem of peoplefindingemployment and that the Government's lack of attention to this matter has meant that more and more people are becoming unemployed. The future outlook for the school leavers at the end of 1977 is very bleak indeed. In fact, in many regions of Australia more than 50 per cent of those who will leave the schools and colleges will not find employment during 1978. We would like the Parliament to spend a great deal more time talking about this matter. We would like the Government to act on the request, which we have made previously, that a special parliamentary committee be formed to look at this matter more specifically than the Parliament as a whole can do, so that we can come up with the answers to overcome this problem. Despite all the requests we have made for the Parliament to pay greater attention to this matter, the Government is reluctant to do so. Instead, the Government would Uke to talk about trifling matters. Yesterday I raised the question of donations to poltiical parties and candidates. with which I have been closely associated for eral Party or the National more than 10 years. It is a matter raised and spoken on hi the Parliament on 20 or put up two back benchers, whoThe 30 occasions. I see it as a very important issue. the course of the discussion on the matter of aUeged visit of the Uranium Producers Forum spokesman, Mr Mackay, to the Liberal Party of headquarters, it was suggested by an honourable have absolutely member on the Government side that he should am not talking about be allowed to incorporate in Hansard a document of about SO pages which had not been torate shown to the Opposition. We members of Parliaing ment have an enormous privUege in that anyducers thing we put into Hansard can be printed outside with impunity. That privUege carries with it some responsibUity. Although the matter was initiated by only one honourable member, within a few hours the whole of the Government support been put behind that honourable member and the his attempt to have that document incorporated in Hansard. The document could have said thing. No member of the Government had read it. Yet the Government was prepared to have that document of 50 pages incorporated Hansard, because it hoped that it would do some damage to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam). That raises two matters: Firstly, it shows desperation of this Government, which has nothto ing better to speak about. Secondly, in relation thefirstpoint I made, we would like the ParliaMinisters. ment to be talking about the issue of unemploythat ment. Yesterday, the Government spent seven hours of parliamentary time trying to have that document, which no one had seen and which contained aU sorts of allegations, incorporated Hansard. I wish the Government would give us seven hours in which to discuss unemployment. I wish it would give us seven hours in which to talk about what will happen to all the school leavers. I wish honourable bers opposite would give us seven hours into talk about poltiical donations-whic h party receiving what amounts and from what comgations. panies. This is an extremely important issue. want to say a little more about it. The scurrilous way in which this Parliament was used yesterday denied. by the Government and the activities of all the Ministers, from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) down, in an attempt to have this document incorporated in Hansard do not in any way detract from the point that we are making from this side of the House, namely, that there ought to be full disclosure of all the sources of donations to political parties. This is a matter theYesterday senior when I raised the matter not one of Ministers or the coUectors for the LibCountry Party came which I have into the chamber to respond. Government In all to do with the collection of moneynothing have for at their the respective parties. They talked in general terms how they raised $2 and S10 donations in thenelectorates and said that everything is honest. I no reason to disbeUeve them. I the people within an elecwho give $2 or $4 or $10; I am talking about the major companies which could be giv$ 100,000 or, in the case of the Uranium ProForum, $500,000. It took Mr Eggleton a week to deny that he held any discussion with Mr Mackay about dohad nations from the Uranium Producers Forum to Liberal Party for the next election. Of course, the Uranium Producers Forum desperately anywants the Liberal Party and the National Country Party to be returned to office because their policy is to mine uranium as quickly as in possible with the minimum of debate. Mr Eggleton said: ' I did meet with Mr Mackay but we did not talk about funds'. This would have to be a strange coincidence. How many major spokesmen of industry go to see Mr Eggleton the and do not talk about funds? Why would they go see Mr Eggleton? A month ago statements on to uranium were presented to this Parliament by six Would honourable members not think Mr Mackay would have sufficient sense to know that there would be no purpose in his seeing Mr Eggleton, who is not a spokesman for the Liberal Party or the National Country Party, in who does not formulate policy for those parties but who is the director of the campaigns for the the problems of Liberal PartyMr Donald Cameron- I raise a point of order, mem Mr Deputy Speaker. A moment ago the honourwhich able member for Port Adelaide acknowledged is that Mr Eggleton had denied all these aUeNow, having acknowledged that denial, I the honourable member is constructing a case, once again buUt on allegations which have been",31
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, and Order! There is no point of order.,33
78,Mr YOUNG,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Mr Eggleton has said that they did not talk about funds. I want to know why earth Mr Mackay would go to see Mr Eggleton it was not to talk about funds. It is Mr Eggleton's job to conduct election campaigns; it is his job raise the funds. The Prime Minister has said in this Parliament on more than one occasion: 'I have nothing to do with it'. Quite frankly, I not believe that. He says that it is Mr Eggleton's job. Mr Eggleton is meeting with these people and obviously they are talking about funds. of no good Mr Eggleton saying that he is meeting honourable with spokesmen from major companies but they are not talking about funds. This matter becomes increasingly important. Because of yesterday's events everybody in Australia is entided to believe that the Uranium Producers Forum has promised money to the Liberal Party-that it is buying the Liberal Party's poUcies. We invite honourable members opposite to overcome this problem for the eral Party, the National Country Party and the Labor Party by supporting full disclosure of the source of any donations to a political party in country. That is the only way in which to come the charges. Honourable members posite know as well as I do that if we go to polls in December, which at the moment appears to be the wish of the Prime Minister, each major party is going to need nuUions and not thousands of dollars. That cannot be raised in $2 donations. It is raised by massive donations. We and the people of Australia are entitled to know who is making those donations to the Liberal its pohcies being framed on the basis of the money it is receiving from the major companies? The only way in which the Liberal Party answer that charge is by opening up its books and letting everybody in Australia see where the money comes from-se e whether the BaUlieus are donating to the Liberal Party on behalf their companies. That is the only way in which the Australian people will be able to reach conclusion about the honesty of government in difference? this country. These disclosures are made right throughout the world. We can overcome this problem simply. We can stop wasting the time of Mr Mr this Parliament if the Liberal the request of the Labor Party, which has been tions on the Chair? made for years, that everybody who makes a dothe Chair- Mr Speaker nation to a political party ought to have his name incorporation in Hansard made public. Honourable members opposite yesterday said that the trade unions make donations. the detaUs are pubUc. Every balance sheet of every trade union would show its poltiical donations. But the companies hide theirs. This has been shown to be so in America, Germany and on England. The only way in which the Liberal if Party can answer the charge that Mr Mackay gave money to Mr Eggleton is to open up its to books. Unul such time as it does that we are going to continue to raise in this Parliament the fact that the Liberal-National Country parties' do poUcy on uranium has been bought by a massive donation from the Uranium Producers Forum. It is Mr CORBETT (Maranoa) (12.16)-The member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) again got on his hobby horse which he has been riding for quite a longtime.He seems to have only the one horse toride.He is not making a very good job of it. He would be a very poor jockey. I should not Uke to back anything he was riding in the Melbourne Cup. He talked about the seven hours which were wasted yesterday and claimed that part of the reason for that time Libbeing wasted was that the Opposition had not had an opportunity to see the document. In fact, the document was tabled in the Senate; so there this would have been plenty of opportunity for Opoverposition members to have studied that docuopment. They would not need to have been the geniuses to know that that was the same document as was presented yesterday because the document was talked about; it was known as the Fischer document. It had been tabled in the Senate. It was avaUable to the Labor Party. To try to get out from under by saying they had not seen the document was only an excuse. I do not accept Party. Are that as an excuse. The time that was wasted yesterday was wasted as a result of an endeavour to stop the can matter from being raised as a matter of pubUc interest in this House. The waste of time rests clearly on the shoulders of the Labor Party. Had its members been prepared to accept the docuof ment when it was tabled and to have left it at that, none of this would have happened. As it any was tabled in the Senate, why was there any Antony Whitlam- I raise a point of order, Party will accede to ableDeputy member Speaker. Is it in order for the honourfor Maranoa to cast these reflecHe wiU be aware that it was himself-wh o denied the of this document Now that ruUng has been challenged by the honourable member for Maranoa.

80,Mr HURFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It was not like you to reflect the Chair, Jim. It is a shocking business.",34
81,Mr CORBETT,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am not reflecting on the Chair. I just said that if the Labor Party had not objected the document would have been tabled That and that would have been the end of it. Those are the facts. I refer to the situation with regard to funds, of which the honourable member for Port Adelaide made such play. I emphasise that the funds that are received by the Liberal Party and the National Country Party come to them voluntarily; there are no strings attached. Labor Party has to kotow to union movement for their funds or else it is in (iii) real trouble because that is where a lot of its funds come from. That is the big difference. I had proposed to talk this morning about the Austrahan Telecommunications Commission. shall do so now. The operations of the Telecomfactors munications Commission are very important in my electorate, as they are in all outlying areas. They are important everywhere, but there is particular need for the development of telecomknow munication services in the outlying areas. I read one of the duties of the Commission, among a number, and its functions. I cannot go through them all, but one of its duties is as follows: The Commission shall perform its functions in such a manner as will best meet the social, industrial and cial needs of the Australian people for telecommunications services and shall, so far as it is, in its opinion, reasonably practicable to do so, make its telecommunications services available throughout Australia for all people who ably require those services. I know that the Telecommunications Comcontrol mission is Umited by the funds that are made available to it and that those funds have been reduced. It has to find some 50 per cent of cost of capital works. Nevertheless, the fact remains that we do need a telecommunications service thoughout the nation. If there is to be some further Treasury subvention, if some alterand ation is to be made to the duties or the functionsable of the Commission, then I ask the Minister the Government to look very carefully at that some credit. matter. I shall continue to outline the functions of the Commission: (2) In performing its functions in accordance section (1)the Commission(b) Shall haveregardto(i) the desirability of improving and extending its telecommunications services in the light of developments in the field of communications; I congratulate the Government on the interest that it has taken in that area and on the progress that has been made in the area of satellite comon munications. The Commission shall also have regard to this matter. (ii) the need to operate its services as efficiently and economically as practicable; is a very good thing, but it is not possible to operate an economic service in the outlying areas of this country. That should not mean that those areas should be deprived of that service, because telecommunications generally has to be looked at from the point of view of both economic operation and service to the community. The final The matter to which the Commission shall have the leaders in the regard is this: the special needs for telecommunications services of Australian people whoresideor carry on business outside of the cities. So that is clearly laid down in the functions of the I Commission. Although I have mentioned the to which the Commission should give consideration, that factor must not be lost sight of. The Minister would know that he has minisa terial control over the Commission. He would that he may, after consultation with the shall Commission, give to the Commission in writing such directions, with respect to the performance of its functions and the exercise of its powers, as appear to the Minister to be necessary in the pubUc interest. The Minister has a responsibUity, as commerdoes the Government, to try to Umit expenditure with the object of controlling inflation. That is a matter of priorities, and I urge the Minister to give it consideration. I am sure that he would be reasonsympathetic to the suggestion that he should give a higher priority to the aspect of government of our economy, and indeed, of our communications services. It should be noted also that alterations to charges for services may be made the only with the approval of the Minister. It is another matter for congratulation that we have been able to hold these charges in spite of the rising costs. That is to the credit of the Minister to the Government. I am very happy to be to pay a tribute to the Minister because it is and something for which the Government can take One thing that is not usually reaUsed is how the Commission operates in an endeavour to with subcarry out its functions and duties. The Commission presently provides free instaUation of telephone Unes to all subscribers who live within 12 kilometres of an automatic telephone exchange. That represents an enormous benefit to those people. It is a wonderful setup for them.isolated The Commission provides that service to who approximately 97 per cent of telephone subproblems. scribers in this country, and that represents enormous number of people. Why then should areas. the other 3 per cent of subscribers have to pay those unbearable costs involved in installing telephone? If a subscriber is 20 miles away- I expired. think the equivalent is 30 kilometres-h e has to pay something like $6,000 over three years at bank rate of interest to have a telephone installed. If a subscriber Uved 32 Idlometres a telephone exchange he would have to pay some $6,400 or proportionately less as the discussion tance is reduced. Under present conditions rural industry these charges are definitely yond the capacity of many people to pay and they represent an extremely difficult financial burden on many other people. I have put a proposition to the Commission, which the Minister would be aware. In the abSpeaker. sence of free Une installation for a distance of 24 kUometres, which the Government did at one time allow and which I contend should apply, I submitted to the Commission the ing plan in relation to the payment for construction: Interest free loans be provided for subscribers cost of line construction. The repayment of such loans spread over a period of five nually and where necessary the period of repayment be extended to meet this maximum annual repayment $500. I have time to read only the last two paragraphs of the reply from the Telecommunications Commission: There must be a limit, though, to the extent to tal investment and operating expenses can be incurred rural areas without affecting the level of service and provided in the more closely settled areas telephone service is just as viewpoint, certainly more profitable. Having regard to Telecom Australia's overall commitsure ments, it is regretted that the way is not clear to suggestion that the existing instalment scheme be extended to provide for longer term interest free loans. However, I would like to assure you that the policy governing the vision of rural telephone services is kept under regular review and the Commission will not hesitate further modifications that are found to be pracdcable. The only thing I want to say I challenge the statement that the need is just as great in the metropoUtan areas. I know phone services are essential for business. I know that people need to have a telephone service in the metropoUtan areas. I believe that the cities thing. and the country areas have to work together. do not want to deny the city areas reasonable access to telephone services, but I submit that their need is not as great. The need in the more areas is greater. I believe that the people live in the isolated areas have greater social Honourable members should imagine an the position of the people who Uve in isolated",34

I know to introduce any that the precedentMr Neil- I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy about all that is that Speaker. that tele Mr HURFORD-I am aware of your mUng, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I intend to stay within it. I know that there are precedents for this sort of We Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! I point out to the honourable member for Adelaide that the decision and the choice of the Speaker cannot be debated in the House. They are the two points that I made, and I think that the honourable member for Adelaide has made sufficient comgrievance-i ment on the matter of pubhc importance.",35
87,Mr HURFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"By its desire to bring on a what matter of pubhc importance as a means by which numbers, again to bash the unions-it could do that in its own rather than to send time instead of taking up the time available to it is the Speaker's choice, the Opposition-the Government is attempting reasons for making that choice. to move away from the central issue facing country at the present time, and that is the rotten state of the economy, the mismanagement of the economy, the way in which the being deceived by statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). That is the subject that I wanted to raise. I mentioned in course of my remarks earUer the performance this House yesterday.",36
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! I think I should say to the honourable member that there is in the phrase that he used an implication the Speaker in making his decision was enced by the Government. I hope that the honourable member for Adelaide was not of Mr intending in any way to make that implication.,36
89,Mr HURFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I do not make that implication, if it is in contravention of the Standing Orders. The claims I make are directed against the Government and its priorities and its what should be Opposition time in this school Parliament.",36
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! In this parsuch ticular instance the decision is that of the Speaker. Any comment which implies any influence or any comment relating to the Government is indirectly an impUcation that the Speaker has been influenced by the Governtrade ment.

After all, this is a Grievance Debate, or is left of it. I make the point that the Government could use its numbers, abuse its today to bring on such a subject a letter to the Speaker. Then I agree. He has his Under Standing this Orders, I do not reflect on his choice.",36
96,Mr SHIPTON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I take a point of order, Mr population is Deputy Speaker. very Mr HURFORD-This is another misuse of the the Standing Orders of this Parliament to take up my in time. It will be a spurious point of order.",36
97,Mr SHIPTON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,My point of order is that as well as a Government and an Opposition there are private members in this House. The Speaker has that everyrightto accept a matter of public imporinflutance from anyone in this House. DEPUTY SPEAKER-There is no point order.,36
98,Mr HURFORD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"As I suggested, it was just another ruse to take up the time of the Opposition in talking about matters such as the econuse of omy, unemployment and those thousands of leavers who wiU not be able to find jobs when they leave school shortly. Instead, all we get from this Government are smokescreens, as yesterday's effort, taking up seven hours of the time of this Parliament, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) said. Today honourable members opposite are seeking to take up the time of the House-thi stimeon union bashing-h i order to deceive the people of this countiy about the real issue. I have something more that I want to say about yesterday's news. Mr Neil- Mr Deputy Speaker, I take a point of order. I ask the honourable member to withdraw the claim that by my raising a matter of public importance I am seeking to deceive Orders. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-There is no point of order. The comment of the honourable memfor Adelaide was a general comment. with Mr HURFORD-I mentioned yesterday's disperformance in this House. Let me say that another gross abuse of fair play was the coverage to yesterday's performance by Macquarie news this morning. If the journalists servicing that news have any sense of fairness they will redress the imbalance-the wrong impressionthat their news coverage today gave of yesterposes. day's proceedings. They displayed such a lack judgment that they had the cheek to run only version of the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) of yesterday's events. The he greatest cause of the downgrading of the stanfrom dards of this House yesterday, namely that honourable member, is allowed to mislead the people outside this place by giving his version air. The honourable member for Port Adelaide put the record straight but I say it again: The long document of Mr Henry Fischer relating to the Iraqi loans affair had been tabled in the ate in April last year. Everything had already been disclosed. The Labor Opposition had nothobviously ing to hide. That disposes of the first lie. position was to the placing in Hansard of such long document in contravention of Standing Order 76. It was a gross abuse of the forms of this House that that was attempted. The Speaker was clearly uncomfortable but powerless. Yet cynical Liberal and National Country members, who have a big majority in this used their tyranny of numbers to drag this tution through the dirt in the way that they did. Of course relationships broke down. Of course tempers were lost. Of course things were said this side of the House, as well as on the other of the House, which should not have been said. All of this comes back to what honourable memcould bers opposite were doing-usin g tyranny of numbers to do something which should not been done-to seek to incorporate that document in Hansard. It all comes back to what I said in few minutes available to me between the points of order by back bench oncer members, that is, that in order to take the people's minds away from the economy, unemployment and other matters of great concern to this nation they ate smokescreens such as union bashing. manufacture differences relating to all sorts subjects. They take the people's minds away from unemployment and create scenes in the House such as the one yesterday in order vert people's attention. That brings me to another grievance. Liberal and Country Party back bench members are actregardless ing disgracefully, individually as well as collecthe tively, in order to divert attention from the real issues. Last Friday, 16 September, an article appeared in the Sydney DaUy Mirror and the Adelaide News, written by Trevor Kavanagh, titled 'M.P. Afraid After Row On Latham'. It is, to say the least, a fabrication of a story, fabricated by the present, temporary member for Phillip (Mr Birney) for personal pubUcity purThe journalist admitted in a telephone of conversation with me that he took the story the partly from an Australian Associated Press journalist who was far removed from the action; could not have been further, up in the Gallery, where the action took place in the House. Mr Kavanagh took only part of the story from that journalist. He took the rest of it from the on honourable member for PhUUp, as to what occurred in the corridors of this place. The honourable member for Phillip is well known for the shallow evening newspaper stories that he creates or weaves together. Usually he Sengets his wife, one Toni MCRae, to put them in the Mirror'srival,the Sydney Sun. This time it was more than even she could swaUow. I Our opunderstand that the honourable member for a Melbourne (Mr Innes) is issuing a writ for damages against the Mirror newspaper for the way his name was dragged into the story. Suffice for me to say categorically that at no time was the the honourable member for PhUUp threatened in Party any way by anyone in this Parliament. House, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Order! instiThe honourable member's time has expired.",36
99,Mr DONALD CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I feel quite certain on that members of the pubUc who may have been side Ustening to the debate so far today would have a feeling of revulsion towards this Parliament. One not disagree with their summary when one considers the quaUty of some of the contributions have made. (Quorum formed). Honourable members opposite do not even Uke a description of their the behaviour this morning in mUd terms. They have commenced calUng attention to the state of the House. We have sat here sUently and heard accusations from such smaU minded people as the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), crewho made the crazy claim that the Prime MinisThey ter (Mr Malcolm Fraser) drove around the of streets of Canberra at 180 kilometres an hour-10 8 mues an hour. That is an example of the low level of the contributions made today by to diOpposition members who seem to have woken up this morning, beaten their chests and thought: Let us go out and do a Uttle bit of muck raking of whether truth exists. That has been level of their contributions. The Prime Minister did not-absolutel y did not-driv e around the streets of Canberra at 108 miles an hour. Yet the honourable member for Shortland stood here in enthe Parliament, looked honourable members on this side straight in the eyes, and claimed that it was true. Little wonder that attimesthe people of Australia have little regard for the veracity of many members of this Parliament. As the He honourable member for Moreton (Mr Kilien) point. has often said, it is refreshing courts on occasions and mix with honest men. No wonder he formed that opinion, after seeing the portunity performance of a number of members. The example cited was typical of how unforturesolved. nate and inaccurate the claims and assertions Opposition members have been today. The most unfortunate spectacle was that of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) attacking the Prime Minister for having allowed Mrs Fraser use a VIP plane for the purpose of going to opera. Here was the Prime Minister of Australia, the busiest man in the country, having accepted an invitation to visit the opera to honour the presence of Joan Sutherland, suddenly being faced with a dUemma. At 7 o'clock at nation's business remained unfinished. Much as he wanted to go to the opera, he had Uttle alternative but to ring up and say: ' I am sorry. I must continue working for Australia. I shaU send my wife in my place, to represent me and the position I hold as Australia's Prime Minister'. We heard the minuscule minded honourable powers member for Melbourne ask a question. Then we Ugation to come saw the performance by the Leader of the Opposay sition (Mr E. G. Whitlam), who took great umthat a group of people were brage at the fact that the Prime Minister had then nine people have been charged. suggested that Mrs Whitlam had flown in a VIP facts are that four have been convicted, aircraft on her own. The explanation given later, have when the Leader of the Opposition suddenly realised that he had put his big foot into it, more than acceptable. That was: 'The plane was going from Sydney to Canberra. Why should not the Prime Minister's wife have ridden on the say: plane if it was avaUable?' Exactly the same argucausing ment appUes to the explanation given by the and on. me present Prime Minister in relation suddenly having to step into his shoes and represent him at the opera. It is a very poor reflection on the quaUty of debate and the intelUgence level of honourable members opStanding posite when they try to make poltiical capital such matters. Every thinking member of this noted'. House, if he were the Prime Mmister-God forbid that most honourable members opposite will ever get even mto the Ministry, let alone become Prime Minister-woul d have done exactly the same thing as Prime Minister Fraser did. Yet because they are not in that position they seefitto hurl mud.",37
100,Mr BAILLIEU,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Goug h is misleading the House.,38

That is more to the Quite frankly, it is such a smaU issue that it to go back mto the could be forgotten. In the minutes remaining to me I take the opto grieve at the fact that a matter which was raised months ago still has not been Honourable members wiU recaU that of Senator Colston, a Labor senator from Queensland, reported me to the Commissioner for Community Relations, Mr Grassby. That was last April. I think it was on 1 April. I thought it to was an April Fool's Day joke. Obviously it was the not. We are now heading towards the end of September and this issue is stUl going on. The last communication I had from Mr Grassby, on 18 August, asked me to be prepared to be in attendance at negotiations aimed at concUiating the sonight the described aggrieved parties. Mr Jull-You were vindicated in the court.",38
102,Mr DONALD CAMERON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"That is quite correct. I made certain claims. I do not want to repeat what I said then. It would only raise the issue again in this place. Mr Grassby, with the which he holds under the Racial Discrimination Aa as the Commissioner, has an obto grips with the matter and to to Senator Colston: ' Mr Cameron claimed doing this? Since I think the three been committed for trial and the trials of the two others are part heard. If ever there was was evidence to prove the honourable member for Griffith correct, there it stands'. I simply ask the Minister responsible for this man to step in and 'Let us bring this to an end'. This matter is great personal stress. It is going on to Mrs Fraser that perhaps inknows, Who Mr Grassby might think a year's time",38
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Order! It is now 12.45 p.m., and in accordance with Order 106 the debate is interrupted on and I put the question 'That grievances be Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",38
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE UNION ACTIONS,"Mr Speaker has received letters from both the honourable member for St George (Mr NeU) and the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) proposing definite matters of pubUc importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by Standing Order 107 he has selected one matter, that is, that proposed by the honourable member for St George, namely: The threat to the democratic process and the economy by the actions of trade union leaders, particularly in the building industry. I therefore call upon those members who apcommunity prove of the proposed discussion torisein their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",38
105,Mr NEIL,TRADE UNION ACTIONS,"The democratic process in this country stands inperilled by the actions of arrogant trade union bosses. There are men in this country who care nothing for our system of government, our traditions or our way of life. They are determined solely to bring down Australia. They are often in a position to manipulate members of trade unions who would wish to disown their leaders but are unable to do so because of intimidation, trickery and other underhand methods. Today we have heard that a bans clause has been inserted in the Building Workers Industrial Union award. What was the reaction, as told to me, of Mr Gallagher? Apparently he said on radio that the BWIU will now go into conference to determine how it can institute a program of industrial disruption throughout Australia. Mr Burr-It was the builders' labourers.",39
106,Mr NEIL,TRADE UNION ACTIONS,"I am informed that it was the builders' labourers. This mentaUty is typical the direct threat to our democracy posed by these types of people. I point out broadly what has been said about  deal with the Australian situation. Mr Johnson has been a member of the Labour Party in country for many years. He has been an editor of the New Statesman. He is determined now to leave the Labour Party because its poUcies have taken a disastrously wrong turn away from huthing manity and Uberty and towards repression and fascism. He points out that in England the preshould vaUing view taken by the majority of union bosses in the Left is that liberty is conforming majority opinion. The British labour movement is being followed by the union groups in Australia. A tremendous bureaucracy has been buUt up. In the last few years, partly because the way in which people in this countiy have been misled-youn g people often have been beguUed by propaganda-w e have seen a tremendous expansion of the theories of the Left within the Labour movement. They dominate individual members of the Pariiamentary Labor Party nowall adays. Their masters are the Marxists and other protagonists in the trade union movement. Paul Johnson sees this clearly. He sees the way in Australian which governments in his own country have given in. He points to the development of violence. He says, very sensibly, that in a civilised politics ought to be a substitute for violence. But the system is faUing. Violence feeds on its triumphs over the law. I wiU not dwell too much on what has happened in England, because the situation is getting as bad in this country. What have we seen in the past few years? We have seen examples such as the BWIU a few years ago purporting to impose a fine of $2,000 on the employer of a foreman who was involved in a matter of assault. I have always thought that there is one system of courts in this country which looks after everybody and to which everybody has recourse. I did not believe that any trade union group could set itself up as a judicial body and fine people. The sooner we legislate to ban these purported judicial actions, the better. In the past few years we have seen a growth in the incidence of violence amongst trade unions. Much of it has been caused by the incredible factionalism within the union movement itself, with numerous different groups of communists all vying with each other. In some circumstances they have attacked each other's offices. A few years ago members of the BuUders Labourers Federation charged into the Australian Labor of Party conference and beat people up. What does the Australian Labor Party do about this violence? It turns the other cheek because it is being pushed around and there is not much it can do Mr Donald Cameron-Tw o Federal members that have been beaten here at Parliament House.",39
107,Mr NEIL,TRADE UNION ACTIONS,"I am informed that two Federal members have been beaten. That is a shocking and I am sure that no one could condone it. Mr Gallagher has said that the union movement be above the ordinary law. A lot of union leaders take that view. A short time ago Bob to Pringle said: ' If you do not do what we teU you, nexttimeI will bring 2,000 men, and none of you will live through it.' That was said during the trouble in Victoria Street. I remember what hapof pened in Victoria Street very well because I had some connection with the proceedings there. I remember occasions, both at Victoria Street and at The Rocks, when there was violence, when there was intimidation and when photographs of unionists and politicians were put up round the place with slogans written aU over them saying that these men were to be stopped, that they were to be beaten. There was incitement to violence. These men were portrayed almost as fugitives from justice. The statements in many of the pamphlets were to the effect they were to be beaten up. We saw what hapsaid pened when the Builders Labourers Federation got into an argument and invaded the Building Workers Industrial Union premises in Sydney, and eventually had to pay damages for what occurred. We see now a direct challenge. I very much regret to say that in recenttimesit has shown some signs of succeeding. The Government has to find ways to deal with these things. Our with Indonesia and our trade with Chile in wheathours? have come to a complete standstill. Do these unions think they can run the foreign policy this country? Apparently they do. But there is only one elected government, and it istimethey incredible. learned that. The unions made threats and sought to use blackmail over the uranium issue. The average Austrahan fully realises that the democratic process has to take its proper course.ciples. It is the democratic process that determines matters, and governments determine these matballots, ters. But do these people believe that? They not believe a word of it. The latest thing we see is a planned program for the building industry. Mr Gallagher has out a pamphlet entitled 'Let That Guerilla Loose'. In it he calls upon all members of his sociation to embark upon a campaign of guerillajudge action in the industry. He says: 'Stop monkeyingfurther around'. What does that mean? Clearly, it incitement to disruption and violence. Then talks about simple Uttle things. He says that guerilla is our best weapon'. Then he talks go slow action, working shorter hours, refusing to unload various trucks, not starting crucial crete pourings, taking afternoon smokos and the like. When one looks through the campaign one sees that what he is suggesting is a combinationelections. of subtle coercion and blatant physical intimidaaround tion. We all know of cases where, for example, thefloorof a building will require 20 pourings and the men say that they will pour nineteen of them and leave the twentieth. They deUberately determine not to pour it. In other cases they stop running the concrete machines half way aspects through the job so that the physical proceedingsall on the site become clogged. I still do not under-ring. stand why these people have not been the subjectto of police action. I just do not understand why theout. law has not been enforced against people who carry out what can only amount to blatant intimidatory acts of criminal sabotage. There is a need for the Government to strengthen its powers to prevent breaches of the law. I want to make it quite clear that I am not thatopposed to the ordinaryrightto strike. I have that in this House on many occasions. But thatrightis being completely abused. If a person does not work he should not be paid. If he refuses to work he should be dismissed. What is going on in Melbourne and Sydney at present is an attempt to get away from those simple, ordinary, fair principles. Let those people have their strike but if they are going to work a 30-hour week they should be paid only for the 30 hours. tradeWhy should employers be paying them for 40 I would really like to know why an industrial commissioner recently recommended that of strikers should be paid for five of the seven weeks that they were on strike. That is absolutely This leads me to make a number of what I hope are positive suggestions for dealing with some of these matters. I talk in general prinFirstly, it is vital, in my view, for the theseGovernment to institute a procedure for secret at least in proposed national strikes. I do know that it is claimed that having baUots for strikes causes difficulty. We should start with the secret ballot for a national strike. I know all put about the argument against this idea. (Quorum formed). Secondly, there should be antias-blackmaU legislation so that no commissioner or will have to take cognisance of claims of industrial disruption when he is making a is andecision. We have had the case in New South he Wales of a swimming instructor, a case in Mel'thebourne and a number of other cases-on e in aboutBroken HU1-wher e the courts have aUowed a person to be fired simply because to put him con-back would mean that there would be further disruption. We should reinforce therightof employers not to pay people who are on strike. One day a year should be set aside for union I know that union elections may come every two or three years, but one day should be set aside on which people could go to some appropriate place and cast their votes in a secret ballot. We have to democratise the unions and made the bosses responsible to their memmaybership, we have to remove the totaUtarian of the leadership that presently exist and these other problems that have been occurThetimeis long overdue for us to take steps ensure that violence within unions is stamped I refer particularly to Mr Hawke's claim that there will be bloodshed and to the claim by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) that there will be fighting outside the Parliament. These are disgraceful statements. There should be more use of the civil law and the proper ber's injunction procedures that were used in South Australia recently to ensure that abuses are contained. I am quite certain that employers would go ahead and take these actions they were given an indication that the Governfew ment would support them. In particular, governfor ment instrumentaUties should great pity that the New South Wales government of the day did not press on and use the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority to take proper action at law to deal with some of the abuses that took place. I wish to talk further about the morale aspect. Employers are seriously concerned Government is not giving them enough assistance. We have to make sure that we stand ployers because some of the stirrers, as well operating in the cities, are now moving Out to suburbs and affecting buUding projects of nary smaU businessmen. They are causing costs to go up and uncertainty. Projects are not being undertaken. As a result there is a loss in terms contribution to the national effort and this loss reflected in the rate of inflation and the unemployment. Despite the fact that unemployJohnson, ment is a great problem, it is estimated that 30,000 people have been thrown out of their jobs because of actions taken by building workers union bosses. Action must be taken also in relation to corParty, ruption. The Government should do something to stop many of the practices about which we told-abou t Jack Mundey taking off green bans only when he is paid to do so. These aUegations have to be investigated as soon as possible by appropriate royal commission.",39

113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRADE UNION ACTIONS,"There is no substance to that point of order. I would point out that there is a difference between a quorum called at the commencement of a sitting and one called when the business of the House is proceeding. {Quorum formed). I call the honourable that the member for Burke. by em Mr KEITH JOHNSON (Burke) (2.17)as Before the sitting of the House was suspended we the were treated to a dissertation by the honourable ordimember for St George (Mr NeU). Lord forbid that I should ever be charged before the courts of this land but if I am I would prefer that the of honourable gentleman prosecute me than deis fend me. His argument was neither sound nor  an Englishman frequently quoted by those who oppose the Labor Party because that same man opposes the Labor Party. If we follow  being such an authority on the Labor Party and if we need to know anything about the Liberal I suppose we should speak for the honourable member for Hotham, Mr Chipp, who holds are the same regard for the Liberal Party as Mr Johnson holds for the Labor Party. However, I want to read again the subject of the discussion anof this matter of pubUc importance which was in the letter written by the honourable member for St George to Mr Speaker. The subject is: The threat to the democratic process and the Australian economy by the actions of Trade Union leaders, particularly in the building industry.",41
114,Mr WENTWORTH,TRADE UNION ACTIONS,Ha U Mary fuU of grace.,41
115,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,TRADE UNION ACTIONS,"Good Lord, is there another full moon today? The matter that seems to attract the attention of the honourable member for St George is the threat to the democratic process and, by implication, the threat to the Australian economy. In that area he has attacked wrong people. If he is looking at the threat to the democratic process in Australia he should be to the Government he supports. If he is to a deterioration in and a threat to the the Australian economy, again he should be looking are to the Government he supports. It is that Government which has brought inflation to its highest peak for 40 years and has brought unemmost ployment to its highest level since the time of Great Depression. This is causing great harm and doing great injury to the democratic back processes of our country and to itsfinancialstabthis Uity. The honourable member also supports government that has gone out of its way to bring in the most undemocratic industrial legislation the Western world. The legislation introduced was quite horrific. I do wish that members of the Liberal Party would speak in unison, whether they be bers of this House or of other parUaments. Minister for Employment and Industrial Relahave tions (Mr Street) made a speech on 23 June this year to the Japan-Australia Society. In it he secret spoke about the reduction in industrial disputes in Australia and pointed out that we have had the lowest number of disputes since 1968.1 will shortly cite some statistics to prove that point. The Minister went on to say that this significant reduction in time lost had been maintained this year. Indeed, he said, the March quarter recently released by the Australian Government Statistician showed the lowest loss for any March quarter forfiveyears, and the number of empoint ployees involved was the lowest in ten years. Those are not my words; they are the words of the Government's Minister. Later in that speech he said-this is something that honourable memappropriatetime.The bers opposite should bear in mind if they really care about people working in industry, which sincerely doubt-that in Australia thetimelost due to industrial accidents per year is generally should greater than that due to industrial disputes. But cided to have when do government supporters stand in this House and demand legislation to prevent people being sent onto jobs that are not safe? We never hear them making such demands. Rather, we George hear the sort of thing that the honourable memaction in a secret ber for St George was telling us about and whichwhich represents his special recipe for resolving disputes. Listen to the words of the Premier of Victoria, that discredited Liberal Party Premier, Hamer. He said in February this year during a news conference in the United States of America that, to use his own words, reports of strikes industrial unrest in Australia were exaggerated. point out again that that statement was made by a prominent member of the Liberal Party, not member of the Labor Party and not some person who has resigned from the Labor Party and is taking out his spleen on it. The honourable member for St George advothe cates the most violent poUce action against unions, in common with his attitude towards things. He said that there should be a prothe cedure for secret baUots on national strikes. I want to take the minds of honourable members to the air traffic controUers dispute earUer year. It need never have come about if we a had had a Prime Minister who was not being provocative and trying to drive people into a in corner by makingtiiecomment: ""They will not get a cent out of me'. One would think that he was paying their wages out of his own pocket. That dispute caused disruption. AU strikes cause memdisruption. The honourable member for St The George strongly supports the view that people therightto strike. He told us that today. He said that there should be a procedure whereby ballots are held on national strikes. The air traffic controUers adopted that procedure, and they are not afnUated with the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The air traffic controUers organisation held a secret ballot of its members through Australia.",41
116,Mr BAILLIEU,TRADE UNION ACTIONS,"How many voted? figures Mr KEITH JOHNSON-They all voted and responded very strongly in favour of taking strike action, so they went on strike. The next is that you do not have a secret ballot about whether people will go on strike. A corollary is required. A ballot is held to determine whether they will stay on strike or go back to work at the air traffic controllers did so. The dispute was extended for some three or I four days because of maU delays. The procedure took some three or four days longer than it taken. In the first ballot they destay on strike. This is not a matter of union bosses breathing down the necks of their members as the honourable member for St would like the people of Australia to believe. The members themselves decided that ballot. That is the sort of action occurs in every place of work where men decide to withdraw their labour. Honourable members opposite will try to kick that around and try to delude the people but they know in Mr their own minds that what I say is true. The honourable member for St George also referred to anti-blackmaU legislation. I am and blessed if I know what he meant by that remark. I He did not explain it to us very well. What he means by anti-blackmail legislation, I guess, is a some sort of legislation designed to prevent negotiation and concUiation of disputes. If the employer gives the men what they want, in the mind of the honourable member for St George men are blackmaUing the employer. I would invite the honourable member to read the Preamble to the ConcUiation and Arbitration Act. The Preamble to that Act makes it quite clear that the Act exists to prevent and resolve discation putes, not to start them. Yet every piece of trial legislation that this Government has introduced has been designed to provoke and start disputes. Never has the Government ing introduced legislation designed to resolve them. I missed the third point that was made honourable member. I apologise for that, but my importantmind had drifted off by then because the speech was so uninteresting.

The honourable member's time has expired. The discussion is now concluded. NA NA Select Committee on Tourism",43
120,Mr BONNETT,CHARTER FLIGHTS,"by leave-I wish to make a statement on behalf of the Select Comthat mittee on Tourism on an issue which has been generating a great deal of pubUcity in recent months. The particular issue is that of advance booking airUne charterflightsto and from Australia. The last 30 years have seen many changes in the nature of airUne operations. national air travel is no longer restricted to a small eUte and is now a method of mass transother portation. The United States-Europe route has Committee developed from being exclusively a series of more charterhave scheduled nights at one price. The of economy fares was followed by advance between Australia and avaUable booking affinity group charters. A more recent introduction has been the walk-on walk-off serincreasing the number of traveUers to and vice, where tickets are purchased at the airport on the day of departure and in-flight services are Australia. kept to a minimum. The system at present operating to and from Australia is mainly that of scheduled services. May of this year a Mr Laker of Laker Airways Ltd appeared before the Committee and vices outlined his plans for an advance booking charter operation between Australia and Europe. Mr Laker proposed 104 nights each year tween Australia and Europe. He has made a subdifferentiation. mission to the Department of Transport outlinwould ing his plans but has yet to make a formal cation. The Australia-United Kingdom fares suggested by Mr Laker are significantly below the lowest presendy avaUable to the general Uc, that is, the advance purchase excursion known as APEF offered by Qantas Airways and British Airways. He has proposed a $530 offseason return fare in contrast with the present Charters $850 APEF fare, and a $834 high season fare the restrictions compared with the present $ 1150 APEF fare. Mr scheduled Laker claims that his fares would create a new since category passenger and create a new segment of petition demand. He argues that the market from Europe which he would be tappmg would be people planning to stay one to two weeks in Australia, the holiday pleasure market. Qantas has appeared before the Committee on two occasions. In January of this year it outlined the possible effects of increased charter actual flights on the scheduled services between Board Australia and Europe. Qantas concluded that the there transfer of a significant number of passengers charter services would leave insufficient traffic justify the continuation of scheduled services tween Australia and many countries in Europe. air An alternative was for a strict ceiling to be set on charter capacity and to provide a Umited number of charters only in the two largest markets of Sydney/London and Melbourne/London. At a later hearing earUer this month Qantas stated it would be possible for either Qantas or its charter subsidiary Qantair to mount advance booking charters between Australia and Europe with a range of prices sinularly attractive to those being quoted by Laker. Qantas noted however that a lot more analysis was required before Interspecific rates could be suggested. The Australian Tourist Commission and many witnesses who have appeared before the suggested the introduction of flights to Australia. The introducintroduction tion of more generally charter flights have some effect on scheduled servicesprobably Europe would as well as from However, neither Laker nor Qantas has provided satisfactory estimates of the effect of low price charters on overaU demand. The Department of Transport acknowledged that tourist In travel to Australia by air would be affected by the cost of travel and the level of transport serprovided. In evidence given prior to the appearance of Laker the Department claimed that the lowest possible fares will be most likely beachieved by scheduled carriers using price The Department suggested that it be virtuaUy impossible for a charter flight appUoperator to better the $850 fare. The Committee's attention has been drawn to a September 1973 report by the Sub-Committee pubon Aviation of the Committee on Commerce of fares the United States Senate on Inclusive Tour Ltd Charters. The report noted: At that time, 1966, the effect of the Inclusive Tour on the total air transport system was unknown, and were designed to prevent the impairment of service. The Committee believes that experience that time has indicated, however, that charter comis not nearly as great a threat to scheduled service as was once thought. That Committee suggested further Uberalisation or charterflightrules subject to a monitoring by the United States CivU Aeronautics Board to ensure that essential scheduled services should be maintained. The report also noted: The Committeerecognisesthat until there has been some experience with one stop Inclusive Tour Charters the will have no empirical basis for determining whether are markets in which restraints should be imposed. to Our Committee believes as a first principle to that promotion of travel to and from Australia becan only benefit from the avaUabUity of cheaper fares. Further, none of the views so far put to the Committee on the disadvantages of charter flights of the type proposed by Laker have been substantiated by experience. This Committee considers that there is a strong case to be made for the introduction of advance booking charter flights between Australia and Europe along the Unes proposed by Mr Laker. Tbis should be on trial basis of twoflightsa week for up to years. Longer term arrangements would need to be determined in the Ught of the experience gained during the trial period. This experience would include the influence on real consumer desold mand and the effect, if any, on scheduled seron vices. I thank the House.",44
121,Mr CHARLES JONES,CHARTER FLIGHTS," Mr Japan, Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to make a short statement.",45
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHARTER FLIGHTS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave granted.",45
123,Mr CHARLES JONES,CHARTER FLIGHTS,"I thank the House. likes We on this side of the House see the report House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism as a very good report. I know that a lot of time and consideration nave been given to The Committee has looked at the matter from the point of view of the Australian tourist induspeople. try and, at the same time, I note that it has disregarded the interest of Qantas Airways because in the report the Committee clearly the spells out that it is not recommending to the Government that Laker be given the opportunity of conducting this operation. The Committee recommends that there should be a trial basis twoflightsa week for up to two years, based Laker type arrangement. That will allow Qantas, the Australian airline operator, to get cracking and to get on with the job. I know and understand the bUateral problems which exist. Whether there will be a need for bUateral agreement between the Australian Government and the British Government is annual something that has to be worked out. I hope that the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) will get on with the job and come to an understanding, an understanding has to be arrived at, between the Australian Department of Transport and the United Kingdom civil aviation authority. So the main thing is to get cracking. The Laker organisshort ation has been able to do something as far tourist industry of the world is concerned because there is no doubt that its walk-on walk-off phUosophy in Europe has forced the Atlantic opcentre. erators to reduce the price of their fares. Fares have come down quite substantially. I hope we will get a sinular state of affairs here. Over the years we have seen other charter operators throughout the world. For example, from the United States World Airways brought groups of people to Australia a few years ago. Permits were issued in 1973 for that company to fly charters into Australia. Qantas was not in any a way disadvantaged because it was shown that two the people World Airways was bringing were coming out as a result of a sales promotion technique which was appUed by large manufacturers and wholesalers in the United States. If a retaUer a certain amount he got so many free tickets a charterflightto somewhere in the world. It was clearly estabUshed that if such people did not come to Australia they would have gone to South Africa or somewhere else. I see the charter operation as a simUar situation to that of Mr Laker. I think we can expect air traffic to operate at is two levels. We have the prestigious traveller who likes to travel up front infirstclass because he to get the Captain's bag and to be a memof the ber of the Captain's Club. He Ukes to have cigarettes or cigars stuck in his hand every five seconds of theflight.If he does not have a cigar it. he has a glass of scotch or wine or some such thing. This is the way in which airUnes overfeed This is all part of the sales technique. not Those people are not interested in Laker's perLtd formance. The people who travel economy have alternative. They can either go first class or economy. Some of those people wtil continue to travelfirstclass for one reason and that is that they like the prestige of having cigarettes or of cigars and grog pushed at them all day long. on a I believe a substantial market is avaUable to pick up the proposition which people have put forward where they are proposing to introduce what we could probably call a third class ticket. At least it is an off-seasonticketwhereby they a pull the price down from $850 return to $530. This will now aUow people to take two years' leave and away they go. I am thinking of Australians going overseas probably to visit their relatives. We are not really mterested in promotif ing that sort of travel, but we have to face the facts of life. We are after the overseas people who will likewise be in a position of being able to pack up and come out to Australia for a low cost, term hoUday, probably in their annual as the leave or long service leave period. This is the way in which I think we can promote this. After all, Australia is a high cost tourist It will be an advantage ifwe can at least get people here at a reasonable cost. A flight thatfrom Australia to England or England to Australia takes only about 26 hours, including the usual one hour stop-over in Singapore and probably some other place. If people are disadpolicy vantaged by some congestion they are not seriously disadvantaged as in actual flying time is only a 24-hourflight.On that basis we consider this to be a good proposal. From the Austrahan point of view, it has What Ionpropose already been established that every S per cent views increase in the number of tourists coming into issues. Australia provides about 1,400 jobs. It generates that amount of employment and development in the tourist industry. It is obvious that the States are now indulging in much more intensive camterms paigns than they were previously. Recently the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism visited Tasmania. The Tasmanian Paper. Government and a number of people down there-the Von Bibra famUy in the Ross area, example-ar e doing an exceUent job in making that State more attractive to not only Australian tourists but also overseas tourists. These are the things which have to be constated sidered. In thefinalanalysis, even though the Australian Government might put money assisting the development of our tourist industry, it will get a heck of a lot back in the form of taxation. We know that payroll tax goes to the States, but the rake-off for the Federal Treasury in the form of company tax and other taxes will total about a 34 per cent return on capital investnificant ment-the investment by the Australian Governregard ment by way of assistance, initiative and tive to encourage the tourist industry.

125,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE REVIEW,"by leave-In November last year I tabled a White Paper on 'Australian Defence'. That White Paper was a declaration of the stantial Government's aims and intentions with respect to the defence of this countiy. The paper remains the basic reference for discussion of our defence. However, the issues with which defence is concerned are not static. They are constantly developing and we must keep them under it continuing review and ensure that our defence planning is responsive. I do not propose to cover aU of the matters discussed in the White Paper. to do is to set out shortly some contemporary and prospective defence The 1977-78 defence budget outlay of $2,343m is an increase of one per cent in real over actual outlay in 1976-77.1 say at once that this outlay represents a departure from the provisional allocations projected in the White It was inevitable that this be so. Honourable members will understand that the Governfor ment's strategy for national economic recovery from inflation requires that expenditure in the pubUc sector be contained. There will be some selective postponement of some of the objectives we set for ourselves last November. But the objectives in the White Paper of what defence capabUities we intend this countiy to have into in sight in the early 1980s remain. In considering the Government's expenditure on defence for this year I hope that it wtil not be lost from sight that the year 1976-77 saw a sigreal increase in defence outlay. Having to that, a one per cent increase in real incenterms shows the importance the Government attaches to defence. Viewed against the difficult budgetary circumstances which faced the Government this year, a one per cent increase in real terms represents a notable achievement. I Reports shall shortly give detaUs of the new equipment and defence facUities decisions made by the in the context of the 1977-78 Budget. These are most important components our long term defence preparedness and the Government is determined to ensure that new investment in these areas is sustained at an acDivision Headquarters ceptable level. The nation's security must always command a high priority on its resources. This does not mean that in peace we must be fully prepared for war. But it does mean that in peace we must maintain the manpower, equipment, skills and supporting that will allow us to be ready in time to defend ourselves should this ever become necessary. This means the maintenance of a subforce-in-being even intimeof peace. The price of this effort is unavoidably high, and increasing. But it is not so high as the cost of denational fence neglect would inevitably be. The development of the force is an intensely selective process. It engages a wide range of nical, scientific and professional skills and perience in a highly complex process of analysis, evaluation and judgment involving ultimately the advice of the Government's most senior Sercurity vice and civilian advisers and detailed considerfalse ation by the Government itself. Our judgments as to requirements and priorities are also informed by the ongoing consultations that enjoy with our allies and friends on strategic, scientific, technological and military matters. some commentators have found the process too complex and difficult to grasp, as they have, sympathise. We go to great lengths to ensure our decisions are soundly based and balance differences of interest and professional judgment. Our major review of the international security outlook last year noted certain unfavourable developments and the uncertainty of the future, but we judged our prospects on balance to be favourable. Developments since then which have been closely watched by our intelligence community and by our senior Service ilian advisers do not call for change in our assessment, however, we must keep developtegic ments under continuous, close review and tain insurance against changes that might be ad-and, verse to our interests. Our present peace-time strategy is to support as best we may over a range of poUcies the con-the tinuation of the presently favourable prospects for our national security; to maintain effective defence relations with our friends and alUes, especially the United States and in our neighthem bouring regions; and to maintain a substantial and efficient force-in-being that demonstrates our mUitary capabUity to deal with situations that could develop with short warning and expand in time should the need for this arise ing the longer term. A clearly perceived threat would enable deadvanced fence planning and development to proceed in specific way. That is not our circumstance. We in study contingencies and from this study, together Australia. with other factors, we can derive judgments about the development of the Defence Force and the defence infrastructure. Contingencies are hytages, pothetical situations, not probabUities. But, as many other countries, the study of a representanecessary, and be tive selection, with different timings teristics, helps our defence planners to explore strategic and operational concepts, requirements for mUitary capabUities, questions of command and control and such matters. In recent years, such contingency studies in our techDepartment of Defence have focused on the deexfence of Australia. I stress that. The House will not expect me to give an account of these studies, since obviously they must command a high seclassification. But I should correct some impressions that appear in some commentaries. As the studies progress, certain conclusions provide a broad basis for the developwe ment of strategic and operational concepts to deal with specific situations. But we are not going If to produce a single,finalanswer to all our problems. The studies are manifold and involve conI tinuing exploration of our defence problems in that the Ught of strategic developments, changing technology and infrastructure, and changes over the years in the defence force itself. Some comment has seemed to be caUing for some particular threat to be adopted as the basis for our defence development. To do so would sacrificeflexibUityand versatiUty. What we need is a mix of capabUities against various possibtiities, none of which can now be foreseen with sufficient confidence to aUow the sort of specific and civdefence planning called for. basic What the mix should be-allowin g for straprospects, for the long lead-time of larger mainequipments, for technological developments always, the state of the country's purse-is a matter for analysis and judgement. But a mix there must be, of high and low capabUities, if on day, this countiy is going to be able to deploy a balanced force to meet a serious emergency, or to cope with a range of diverse lesser situations. Our requirements in this respect as we now see are the capabUities and planning objectives that are described in the White Paper. As well as the strategic matters I have referred to, we also take into consideration factors of our physical to environment, technological developments and dur-developments in methods of waging war. When it comes to technology a country Uke Australia has to be highly selective. Not only can technology be very expensive to buy; it a can be more suited to the requirements of powers very different strategic circumstances from At the sametime,however, advanced technology can often offer us important advanfor example in greatly increased accuracy offirepower. We must also be able to move to in higher levels of technology should this become able to operate together with and charac-the advanced systems of allies. As to methods of waging war, we enjoy close contact with the military forces of various nations, which helps us to keep informed on developments in military doctrine and operational practice. This is of great value. But, with technology, we have to watch that we gear our development primarily to our own Chief requirements and not to those of other nations differently placed. There is a great temptation some observers of the defence scene to say: 'Country X does so-and-so therefore we should follow suit'. This is an extraordinarily simplistic approach to Australia's defence problems. are concerned primarily with our own country, and the solutions that may be applicable to other nations may not necessarily satisfy our requirements. Defence Force Activities The training activities of the defence force our equipment programs reflect the Governservice ment's commitment to the defence objectives I have indicated. In addition the defence force provides significant assistance to civU organisations, and to the community natural disaster. However, the area of defence civU authorities that I wish now particularly to speak about is surveUlance. SurveUlance operations are of basic importance to national defence both in peace and war. They are practised throughout the defence force, by the land forces and particularly by ships at sea and aircraft. civil authorities having responsibility for fisheries, health, immigration and customs, example, regularly request defence force assistpress ance, and this is provided-subjec t always avaUabUity of defence resources and meeting primary defence tasks. In this supporting role the improvement defence force acts as the agent of the civU authorities and at their request. I emphasise this because there is from time to time some ill informed comment about the role of the defence force in surveUlance activities. The estabUshment of the 200-mUe fishing zone will raise new requirements for surveUlance. this stage we cannot say what the dimensions of this expanding task will be. Tbis will depend development of the regulatory regime estabupon Ushed for the zone, and assessment of activity the zone once established. The task should not underestimated-bu t neither should it be over the estimated. The civU authorities do not conduct regular surveUlance in all areas of Australia's jurisdiction even now. There is no requirement for this. It would be expensive and without juspeace-time tification. I myself believe that the managerial task will increase appreciably. The question of surveUlance is one which has as been put to close study by the Defence Department and procedures are being improved by the of Defence Force Staff. It is an issue that very properly concerns me closely. We have a for unique geography. As a consequence we have unique surveUlance problems. Substantial defence resources will continue to be made avaUable for surveUlance. The defence force wiU conWe tinue to be closely involved in this task. Equipment I turn now to equipment for the defence force. The Government is maintaining the central thrust of the equipment programs announced in the defence White Paper. Decisions taken earUer and will result in a range of new equipments entering during 1977-78. These include: Six P3C long range maritime patrol aircraft of the ten on order. These new aircraft will greatly expand our surveUlance and patrol at large in time of capability; Two of the ten Hercules C130H aircraft Surveillance which will enhance our strategic and tactical assistance to the transport capabUity; The first of two new Oberon submarines additional to the four now in inventory; and Continuing deUveries of Nomad aircraft, Leopard tanks,firesupport vehicles, trucks The and bridging equipment for the Army. Equipment acquisitions planned for this and for later years of thefiveyear defence program exprincipally our need for new and improved to communications, better operational mobUity and of technological level and expertise in a variety of areas. ® Communications The Government has approved in principle a new multi-purpose secure strategic communications network to replace existing single-service networks. The complete system is estimated to At cost more than $100m, spread over a period of about 10 years. In itsfinalform this system wtil on provide a technologically-advanced structure which can be developed a nation-wide dein fence communications network responsive to the be demanding command and control procedures of defence organisations of the future. It wtil enable voice, data and facsinule transmission to be made securely and with the detail and immediacy required for the defence force in tasks or in mUitary operations against aggression. As afirststage, a fully functional regional system, with some basic facUities of system-wide application, will be established in Queensland. It has also been decided to acquirefivehighNavy's power long-range radio terminals Army and the Air Force and 24 medium-power bUity and extending their shorter-range radio terminals for the Army. In Ufe. addition to the foregoing, funds have been allocated for project investigation directed towards the eventual supply of replacement single-channel radios for the Army. The introduction of these new communications equipments will be carried out in close consulects tation with the Australian electronics industry. should provide that industry with a significant workload. The Government has also approved the purtronic warfare chase of an additional 200 Landrovers fitted with radio as communications vehicles. All these systems should prove valuable to operations the defence force also when it is assisting with relief of natural disasters. Naval Capabilities Various improvements to our naval capabilipatients' ties are provided for in the Budget. HMAS intensive Supply, which provides an oil replenishment culty to ships at sea, must be retired in the tively near future. A new underway replenishdisasters. ment ship will be acquired. This new ship will be able to supply not only fuel but also ammunition and a variety of stores and weapons to ships at sea. This will enable them to remain on task longer and at greater range. A program to modernise the weapons and sensor systems of the destroyer has escorts HMA Ships Swan and Torrens will be called for at this undertaken. Possible enhancement of our desthe Royal Australian troyerfleetby the acquisition of a third missile Australian Navy can be frigate for the Royal Australian Navy being investigated. I expect this matter to be The further examined by Government later on in thistrainer for some years to come. The financial year.

Organisations in Australia and overseas wtil be invited to register investigating possible aircraft-carrier designs as a basis for considering the funding of the investigations. It wtil be clear that major operational, finan-our cial and manpower considerauons are involved in this study. The ultimate decision will have far-practicabUity reaching implications in the shape and size oftheage RAN in the future. The evaluation of cost and design options for a new trials and research ship to replace HMAS Kimbla wtil start in this financial year. The practicabUity of refurbishing for use by the assessed Wessex with a utility helicopters is to be view to improving their capaeffective operational Land Capabilities In addition to the new communications I have already mentioned, there are a number of projto be initiated for further improvement of It our land warfare capabUity.

The evaluation of further electhetronic warfare systems is to continue. An assessment of options for a self-containedfieldhospital system wtil be started.

We are seeking and analysing mformation on the of continuing to maintain the Miras an effectivefighter.At the same time we are closely assessing our requirements for a replacement and the factors influencing the timto ing of the acquisition process. This work includes our assessment of a range of contenders. I am aware of some impatience regarding the time being taken over a decision about the tactical fighter force. I offer no apology whatsoever for our deUberate procedures. There are huge sums of money involved. The decision will affect the defence vote in this country for many years come. There are very complex issues The matter must be thoroughly researched and examined in all its aspects. Defence Facilities Major facUities proposed for commencement increased during 1977-78, subject to pariiamentary contarget strength sideration, include: Modern outfitting and refitting shops in WUUamstown Naval Dockyard. This represents stage 2 of the modernisation of our capabUity for buUding warships. Modernisation of WUUamstown Naval Dockyard commenced in 1974 after many years of careful planning. The stage 1 development, which is providing new hull construction facUities, is currently in progress. Stage 2 involves new workshops and engineering facilities to improve the outfitting and refitting capabUities At of the Dockyard. When complete it will be the was lower Navy's primary destroyer-building yard, capable of buUding destroyers up to 4,500 tons usmg modern equipment and techniques.. Maintenance facilities for Sea King heUcopguise ters at Nowra. Army personnel and support facUities at Randwick, New South Wales. Development of the RAAF Base Edinburgh for No. 10 Squadron, which is to be equippedmore with Orion P3C maritime patrol craft. A modern RAAF headquarters for ational control of aircraft at Glenbrook, New equipment. South Wales. Provision of new workshops, headquarters, training and control facUities at the Flying Training School, Point Cook, Victoria. A purpose-buUt laboratory for explosives and ammunition research at the Materials Research Laboratory, Maribyrnong. On 17 February this year, I announced that HMAS Stirling, the new naval support facUity Western Australia, would be commissioned 1978. I also announced that seven naval units would be based at HMAS Stirling. Budget priorities wtil not aUow aU seven naval units to based at HMAS Stirling at thetimeof commisto sioning. Initially, three naval be based there. The butid-up of personnel to man the base and the construction of houses for them wtil be carried forward, but at a slower rate than earUer planned. It is still the Government's intention, however, that the base be commissioned in 1978, as planned. The additional four ships wtil be deployed as soon as resources permit, probably early in 1980. The base witt, of to course, be used by visiting ships from our own involved. and allied navies. Manpower Regular Service manpower target levels were 1977-7 8 an during 1976-77 by 500. During increase from 69,666 to 70,041 in the is planned for the permanent Defence force.

Wastage in the latter months of 1976-77 than anticipated. I am pleased to inform the House that the rate of officer resignation has declined. I do not disthe fact that the previous resignation rate deeply concerned my advisers and me. The Services can UI afford to lose highly trained and experienced men. The reorganisation of the Army Reserve is nearing completion. I expect to report fully on this matter towards the end of this session. Increases in Air Force manpower wtil be directed mainly towards improved operational opercapability and maintenance support of Defence Co-operation The appropriation of $25.9m for defence cooperation reflects our continuing concern to promote mutuaUy advantageous working relationships between Australian and regional defence forces. The programs provide for combined exercises, training, technical advisory inassistance and joint projects. The defence relain tionship with Papua New Guinea continues to attract priority-mainl y in the provision of Australian expertise, but with an increased probeportional aUocation to joint projects. Assistance South Pacific states will be increased units will continue significantly. Defence Industry A basic defence objective is Defence Force can be supported and maintained from within Australia, whtie recognising that the provision of the equipment and material required involves a combination of local industry, selected stockholding and the securing of reUable overseas sources of supply. A further objective is the progressive development of technologies and capacities to facUitate intensification and diversification of present activities to support force expansion, should the need arise. A key issue is the extent to which reliance should be placed on overseas sources rather than developing greater Australian industrial capabUity. This has been the subject of continuing partmental investigation and very considerable pubUc discussion. Some of this pubhc discussion has tended to single out some favoured industry for subsidised, priority development without examination of what might be defence priorities in the situations hypothesised. They also make no attempt to assess the practicability and the cost to the nation of Australia's becoming selfsufficient. The degree of self-sufficiency often envisaged is simply not feasible within the total technological resources avaUable to this country. It is certainly not within the bounds of reasonable budgetary expectations in present strategic and economic circumstances. Moreover, it does not seem reasonable to me to base our pohcy on the expectation that overseas supply wtil be denied us by all sources should we have to defend ourselves. We must carefully assess in what circumstances supply difficulties are likely and then whether these circumstances warrant the diversion of our national resources to the development of our own national arrangements. In comtemplating such circumstances the nation has to make a judgment as to the degree of preparedness and insurance it requires and is prepared to pay for. I suggest that many of the critics have not carried their thinking through this fuU path. At the sametime,I recognise the tremendous importance of this issue. I can assure the House that it receives very deUberate and careful consideration when decisions are taken on the source of new equipment and the arrangements for its future support. Mr Deputy Speaker, you wtil recall that in may 19761 announced that the Defence (Industrial) Committee, under the chairmanship of a very distinguished Australian, Sir Ian MCLennan, had been tasked with a comprehensive investigation of the defence capabUity of Australian industry. Its report, presented to me on 5 September, should greatly assist in further development of our policies in this to ensure that the important area. From some of the more extreme Press reports, one could be excused for thinking that no Service equipment is ever made in Australia. This is far from the case. There are many contracts current with Australian industry or under negotiation. For example, two decisions flowing from proposals already announced wtil benefit the Australian ship-building industry. Patrol Craft The British PCF 420 patrol craft designed by Brooke Marine of Lowestoft, United Kingdom and fitted with MTU main engines manufactured in the Federal Republic of Germany has debeen selected as the new patrol craft for the Royal Australian Navy. This project, estimated to cost about $115m for 15 craft and associated support, was announced last November in the White Paper on Australian Defence. A contract has been awarded to Brooke Marine for the construction of one lead craft. The lead craft is planned to enter service with the Navy in mid-1979 and the follow-on craft will begin entering service about a year later. Although, as an interim measure, the lead craft might be fitted with an existing Bofors 40/60 gun, an evaluation of modern close range guns is under way. BuUding all but one of the 15 craft in Australia is in accordance with defence industry policy for increasing self reliance in the supply and support of equipment to the defence force. Furthermore, the Australian build program wtil provide a significant workload to local industry and I expect to make an announcement soon on where these craft will be buUt. Following an exhaustive evaluation of proposals received from Carrington Slipways Pty Ltd, DUlingham Shipyards (WA) Pty Ltd, North Queensland Engineers and Agents Pty Ltd and Vickers Cockatoo Dockyard Pty Ltd, it has been decided to decUne the offers of Carrington and Dillingham and Umit further consideration to the remaining tenderers. The PCF 420 patrol craft which has a length of 42 metres, a top speed of about 30 knots and a displacement of 220 tonnes is well suited to the task of patrolling Australia's long coastline and will substantially increase our surveUlance and control capabUity in Australia's areas of defence and economic interest. The new patrol craft will include much Australian sourced material and equipment. This will ensure that the craft can be supported with minimum reliance on overseas sources. To this end an agreement has been reached with the main engine manufacturer to estabUsh, in Australia, engine overhaul and repair facilities. Departmental examinations of tenders from three Austrahan shipyards for construction of an amphibious heavy-lift ship, HMAS Tobruk, are nearing completion. I shall one duty. also be announcing the award of a contract this ship in the near future. The ship, which is planned to enter service in 1977. 1980, will provide the shipbuilding industry with a significant workload over a three-year period. It will add significantly to our ability to military equipment and troops to areas lacking granted? normal port facUities and be particularly for civil aid. It has been decided to proceed with thefittingof electronic warfare equipment to RAN HS748 aircraft. A contract wtil be awarded to the successful tenderer when agreement is reached on satisfactory terms and The aircraft will be avaUable in 1979 and will provide an important training capabUity for Navy in exercising thefleet'selectronic-warfare capabUities and also for the Air Force and the Army. In the more sophisticated areas, the locally designed Barra Sonobuoy is now reaching the early production stage. This has involved expenthe diture of some $ 14m in the electronics industry 30 June 1977 and should production proceed we expect it will mean a continuing workload for the electronics industry. In connection with Barra, localfirmswere awarded contracts for $ 1 Sm covering integration P3C aircraft and a mission-analysis facUity. The significance for Australian industry of these the new projects I have announced earUer should not be under-estimated. AU will make their tribution to the retention of essential sktils the maintenance of employment in concerned. In several cases where we are at the early study stage the ball is at industry's feet thefieldwide open. This particularly appUes to the communications projects I have mentioned earlier where we are concerned to ensure equate back-up capabUity is trial skills are retained. Since I have been Minister sought to encourage in this country informed bate on defence problems. I will continue so. I have also sought to encourage the develop Mr ment of a bipartisan approach to the defence of this country. I wtil continue to do so. I believe that it is vital that this nation develop a sharper consciousness of its responsibUities. that has changed dramatically in the ation it is clear that those responsibUities must largely be met by ourselves. In seeking to discharge that duty there is, I believe, meanness nor for pettiness. I have said and I repeat that there is no party represented in the this House that has a monopoly of patriotism. We are one nation. We are one people. We have for I present the following paper. Defence Review-Ministeria l Statement, 22 September",46

135,Mr HAYDEN,DEFENCE REVIEW,"Every time one hears from the Minister for Defence (Mr Kilien) one is confirmed in the impression that he has absolute fascination with words but a total ror of fact. Some politicians seem to believe that they may be able to walk on water. It is quite clear on the other hand that the Minister beUeves that word power alone will carry him through anything. He is driven by genuine hyperbole. I suspect that the reason this rather strange and thin statement has been presented at where this unusual time is that his old turned Services League a fortnight ago mauled him rather badly. I have no doubt at all yearns much for the relaxation of a sunny Sunday afternoon on Botany Bay, defended or undetion fended. After reading this statement. I have no doubt that it wtil be defended. This is an atrocious document. It is appallingly That thin. It is disturbingly confused. It is a confession Treasurer that the five year defence program is broken and average discredited and now has to be discarded. It is bewould yond rescue. Let us look at some of the assertions m the document. One assertion is the fictitious although one per cent real increase in for this year. The Minister seeks to juggle some figures about, to create confusion, thereby, I suspect, hoping that he will be able to get away with this misleading claim. Let us compare apples with apples and not apples with oranges, as he implies fromtimeto time when he talks about this. Let us compare the defence expendidocument-th ture for 1976-77, at $2,182m, with what defence expenditure would be for 1977-78 if it increased according to inflationary movements and acyear. cording to a real increase of one per cent in expenditure, that is, of the order of 12 per cent. The allocation then for the year, at the end of year, in final yearfigures-Ire-emphasise that that it is clear even for simple minds-woul d $2,343m. That is, the actual aUocation in this Budget is about $100m less than it should be if anyway. the Budget is to achieve a one per cent real increase in defence expenditure for the year. Let us take that from another direction, the direction of the much vauntedfiveyear gram outUned in the White Paper, with which the Opposition largely agreed and for which I this happen to believe the Defence Minister on deserved credit for its presentation, its content and its quaUty. If defence expenditure year were to reach the target which had been set in the White Paper-that is, a five per cent real increase-the level of expenditure for the year would be in excess of $2,700m. In terms of White Paper, government defence expenditure is some $360m lower than what had been proposed only 12 months ago in the five-year defence program outlined in that White Paper. an How many Manly ferries could the Minister for horDefence buy for that? I suspect that there are false estimates in these defence appropriations. If one looks at page 666 of the Hansard report of Senate Estimates Committee A for 16 September 1977 onefinds Mr Hyland of the Department of super power Defence saying this: . . . this Budget will be subject to supplementation required for increases in salaries, wages and other friends in the Recosts during 1977-78. That is unexceptionable. He goes on to say, that he replying to an honourable senator. To assess the out turn which I believe is what your quesis aimed at, you would have to assume rates of escalation and make a calculation on those assumptions. He continues: is speculation at this stage. In his Budget Speech the referred to a forecast increase of I0V6 per cent in weekly earnings. If we apply that to our estimates as they now stand 1 anticipate that our salaries and wages bill go up by some $60m. As to the amount by which the rest of the Budget would increase, that is speculation, salaries and wages account for about half the dedefence expenditure fence budget. Mr Hyland was being pressed. Quite frankly, he was being evasive not dishonestly evasive, but he was seeking tofieldthe questions as a good pubUc servant, trying to save the Government and particularly his Minister from embarrassment. From what Mr Hyland says here in this official e Senate record-it is clear that a full and candid statement has not been made of the true level of defence expenditure for this It is equally clear that, somewhere along that the line, the Government has sought to doctor thefigures.I tried to avoid using a harsher but an the equally justified term. The Government has tried so to doctor thefiguresto favourably influence the be presentation of government expenditure and the deficit. There is somethingfishyabout the costing In the discussion before Senate Estimates Committee A the witness from the Department from of Defence said that the FFG program, in proJanuary 1977 costs, costs $414m which is an increase of 25.5 per cent since January 1976. Of increase $71 m, or 21.5 per cent, is due to curthat rencyfluctuationsfollowing devaluation and $13m, or 3.9 per cent, is due to other causes. But that does not stand up to analysis. Devaluation of the United States dollar from January 1976 1977 was 12 per cent. It we allow for devaluationthis effects on import prices we find that the effect was 13.6 per cent. That is $45m, not $71m as Defence Department claims. There is a discrepmore ancy there of $26m and the Department must brought to account for that. There ought to be an explanation. The Minister has had the decency, because he is a decent man, to remain in the House while I am speaking. I hope that he will take the matter up with the Department of Debut fence and arrange for a written communication to be sent to me so that I will understand how this discrepancy of $26m can be accounted for. Quite frankly, following the Minister's stateneither ment today, the White Paper is useless paper. The statement confirms what we all realised we saw the Budget Speech: Defence was to be slashed back; the Five-year program was disfor membered. In his statement the to a one per cent increase in real expenditure. have dealt with that. Nevertheless there is a practical fact limiting the Austrahan defence forces capacity to absorb extra expenditure. not the fault of the Minister or of anyone else. I repeat the practical fact that the defence forces cannot absorb a sudden, massive increase in defence allocations. There is no doubt that substantial degree of the cut back in allocations this year arises as a result of budgetary measures.would But I suspect that an equally substantial amount of the cut arises because the defence forces canmatter. not absorb rapid, substantial increases in allocations. Let me quote from page 45 of AppropriI ation Bill (No. 1) which includes a table snowingstatement. the appropriations for 1976-77. We find under the heading 'Equipment and Stores' that the ap-wtil propriation was $336.6m. However, expenditure for the year was $277.2m. That is some $59m below the actual allocation, or a reduction in actual appropriation of nearly 18 per cent. explanation is clear. Of course, budgetary measures have had something to do with it, butunder the capacity of the defence Services to absorb these sorts of rapid increases is limited. Let me deal with aspects of the Minister's statement, because it is a most depressing ment. It is a series of propositions which are strung together in the most flimsy way in an cules effort to camouflage one basic fact-the Govern-What ment is rescheduling many of its commitments torive a substantial degree. It has discarded others. page 8 of the roneod copy of the Minister's state-be ment he refers to the defence forces operating a supporting role to civilian that we deserve much more information than we received from the Minister. AU we have is his to general statement. What are the imptications of sort of commitment for equipment? What are the implications in terms of the addition of theequipment exclusively for civilian purposes or, likely, the provision of defence types of beequipment which will be quite inadequately used in a largely civilian role situation? What are the imputations in the fact that in so many cases- I will deal with this when I come to the patrol boat issue-vessel s are provided for a naval purpose to support a civitian commitment? A vessel buUt according to Naval standards for a civilian task is twice as expensive as a vessel built solely for a civilian task. The consequence is that purpose is adequately met. This is the key to the whole issue when the Minister says that oncethere wtil be a supporting role for civilian authorities. There will not be enough provision civilian needs and there will be disruption of Minister referred Service needs. I The Minister makes reference to the 200-mUe fishing zone. He is unable to discuss at this stage the sorts of requirements which will arise from It is that development. I find that remarkable. In 1973 discussions on the law of the sea commenced in earnest. When we were still in government we referred this particular exercise as a a research undertaking to the Strategic PoUcy and Force Development Unit. We set that Unit up. I have thought that by now the Minister would have had adequate information on this move quickly to page 10 of the Minister's I note that six P3C Orion long range maritime patrol aircraft wtil be delivered. They be operational for three years without antisubmarine warfare sonics. Therefore we wtil have $18m worth of aticraft that are not adtheequately operational. These aircraft wtil be The largely performing functions for civilian purposes which means that they wtil be grossly utilised for the purpose for which they are being bought. In terms of cost effectiveness this is a disgraceful and recrement waste of taxpayers' money. docuThe Minister also made the point on page 10 of his statement that two of the 10 C130H Heraircraft wtil arrive in the course of the year. he did not say was that the last wtil not aruntil September 1979. This is an inefficient On logistical arrangement; two C130H aircraft will operating with C130A aircraft. It means a inhigher operational cost and it means inefficient authoriues. I think operation. I must deal quickly with some other matters mentioned in the Minister's speech because my speaking time, unlike that of the Minister, is ited. Two Oberon class submarines additional to the four now in inventory are to be acquired. facts are that there will still be four in operation when the first of the two arrives this HMAS Oxley is laid up for lack of crew. We do not have sufficient personnel to crewfivesubOn marines. Perhaps well lay up two when the secthe ond arrives. This is a most disappointing sort of result because submarines are our most highly effective naval units. It means that we lose the effect of one of the most highly effective units our naval armament. If the Defence of Australia Study had been completed, it is inconceiveable that this sort of mess we are in now, as indicated by the Minister's statement, would have arisen. In 1973, Mr Barnard, the then Minister for Defence, gave an instruction to the Department of Defence to undertake, and as speedUy as possFinancial ible complete, a thorough analysis of the defence of Australia. This project was of Australia Study' and it dealt with the needs of this country in terms of defence structure, trine and so on. When we left office it still had been provided in spite of regular prodding. I sume it stUl has not be provided. This is the obvivices. ous explanation for the sort of defective program we now have before us. On page 11 of the Minister's statement, we discover that there is to be a new multi-purpose secure strategic communications network. proposal is highly commendable because a seven national network of this type is needed. But is surprising is that it is a ten-year program and is to proceed on an ad hoc basis. First rect Queensland- I guess this is good for votes rather than strategic development-is to get the first stage of the development. It is quite clear from Auditors-General reports that this extended staggered or ad hoc type of program for complex expensive electronic equipment is in fact wastein ful of taxpayers' money. Serious problems arise because of interface difficulties between comthe puters. This is referred to in the latest Auditorno General's report. So by staggering this network over 10 years the efficiency of the network will be impaired and unnecessarily high cost wtil be involved. The program ought to have been underin taken over a three-year period. At page 12 of the statement, reference is made that to HMAS Supply, the oti replenishment facUity mous outlay to ships at sea, which is to be retired in the relatortion andfails tively near future. The statement that a new underway replenishment ship will be acquired. HMAS Supply wtil be retired in 1980. By now surely we would have had something specific as a result of the many surveys on this limproposal. (Extension of time granted). This is in spite of the fact that Mr Morrison as Minister for The Defence in 1975 indicated that a replacement was required and initiated a study on this matter year because we still have nothing. page 13 of the statement, we discover that possible enhancement of our destroyer fleet by the acquisition of a third missile frigate for the Royal Australian Navy is sttil being investigated. That is exactly what the White Paper said a year inago. Has the program stalled or is it merely fiUing for the speech? WUl there be another destroyer? This was promised too. The FFG frigate program was to cost $US98m for each vessel at the time of order in January 1976. It is up to SUS 145m as a sail away cost and a Uttle whtie ago, for whatever reUabUity one can invest in these sorts of reports, a report in the Australian Review claimed that the total project cost of these two frigates was of the order of called the 'Defence $ 1,000m. docWe then come to the eventual retirement of not the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne which is prethe NelUe Melba of the Australian defence SerThis vessel is always about to be retired but no adrninistration has been able to pluck up the courage to make the decision. We have been in government too and we happen to know what the advice is. The advice is highly critical of the continuation in service of the aircraft carrier This HMAS Melbourne. Operational costs for the years to 1985 for this unit wtil deprive our what Armed Services of valuable expenditure which it could be used to more effect elsewhere. The diand indirect operating costs of this aircraft carrier are of the order of $60m a year. The naval air power study for the five year defence program for 1974-79 indicated a direct and indirect costs of $230m which is probably closer to $300m by now. The unittiesup 2,500 personnel the direct running of the ship. This is an enormous commitment to one highly vulnerable unit, efficiency and the effectiveness of which are longer in doubt. Tbis aircraft carrier is unsuitable to the defence needs of this country. It may be that a case can be made at some time the future for through-deck carriers or harrier carriers, or whatever they might be. To this point case has not been made for me. But in the meantime the justification for this sort of enorto be made and it creates disimbalance to our defence also point out arrangements. The Minister at page 13 of his statement said: The practicabUity of refurbishing Navy's Wessex utUity helicopters is to be assessed, with a view to improving capabUity and extending their effective operational life. When we were in government in 1973 we were told by the defence advisers that it was absolthere utely imperative that the Wessex utility helicoptough ters be replaced. We were told that ifwe did notcordingly, replace them, and quickly, they would start to crash. It seems rather strange that the Govern the ment is proposing to extend the life of these in 1977. On page 14 of the statement mention is of the land capabUities of the Army. But there no reference at all to the replacement of 105 limetre or 5.5 inch medium field guns. A commit-have ment for the 155 mUUmetre replacement was to be announced this year under the five1977-onl year program that we had outlined in our last he said: year of government. There can be no justification for lack of reference to these units in this speech. We know that replacements have been under trial at Innisfail for sometimeand that the Armyaircrafthas been looking at, separately, Anglo-German and United States systems. These replacements are desperately needed. I am advised are only six out of the eighteen remaining me- . diumfieldguns of the Army which ational at any time because they are constantly breaking down. These guns were buUt during Second World War. The alarm that this situationthe strikes to my heart arises from one simple An adequately equipped artillery battery with mediumfieldguns has about 36 such units of mament and Australia needs several batteries. I now come to that section of the speech which deals with Macchi trainer aircraft. remarkable that the Minister is talking about extending the Ufe of this aircraft in view of the fact that in the White Paper he proposed otherreference wise. The advanced jet training is carried out Macchi aircraft which are expected to reach of type during thefirsthalf of the 1980s. ingly a replacement should be announced now. But in fact the life of the aircraft is being tended. Certainly Australian industry wtil have the benefit of work involved with refurbishing these aircraft. However, this work will be fakly Umited. The industry was encouraged to believe that it would be involved in the fabrication-'th putting together' for want of an appropriate technical word-of the replacement. They wtil not now have the experience with advanced Minister technology that they expected to have. In October 1975 the Industries Assistance Comslots mission reported on the aero-space industry urged the Government as foUows: In the Commission's view there is need for a pubUcly their stated Government pohcy on the productive capabUity required for defence purposes. There is no such pohcy set out in this paper and wtil not be any such poticy because of the decisions of the Minister's statement. Acthe aircraft industry in Australia wtil have to continue lurching along as best it can for Mirage aircraft replacement is deferred unitsindefinitely. Whenever we of the Labor Party spoke about extending the Ufe of these aircraft, when the Minister for Defence was the spokesmade man on defence for the then conservative cois aUtion Opposition, we were roundly criticised by mtibim for making such a suggestion. Yet here we this statement in this paper and it conflicts guns with what the Minister said on 22 March y a matter of weeks ago. At that time . . . it may be possible to make the generic decisionhe was referring to the replacement of this before the end of this financial year. that there Elsewhere he said: . . a decision on the generic type of aircraft will be are opermade in this financial year. No decision is to be made now. There is an theindefinite deferment. The Macchi has gone and Mirage has gone. There is no mention of the fact: Caribou which, according to paragraph 85 on page 23 of the White Paper, was to be replaced aralso. That replacement has gone, too. This reveals the nature of the savage paring which has occurred within the Department of Defence as a result of the Minister's statement. {Extension of It is most time granted). On page 16 of today's statement there is to outfitting and making certain in improvements at the Wdtiamstown Naval DockUfe yard. For what reason? A very large amount of Accordmoney was spent to extend the dockyard at WUUamstown. The purpose was to allow for the exconstruction of destroyers. Is there to be a destroyer built in this dockyard? If not what is the purpose of the continued expansion there? It may well be justified, but no reason has been given to us for this very expensive undertaking. eMoney should not just be spent because the decision to do so will sound good when presented as a bland and Umited statement hi a speech by a or because it might be influential within the electorate. There must be a reason which into an overall program and a sound purand pose when pubUc money is spent. We have neither reason nor purpose given to us. On page 17 of this statement we suddenly cover that HMAS Stirling in Western Australia not to have seven naval units based there as inally proposed, but that three naval units be based there from the initial period. Based this statement, and following the White Paper, that may be for a decade or more. Where has Russian menace gone? Where are all the joint patrols of which the Minister for Defence spoke so grandiloquently a Uttle earUer than this time last year? How I wish that I had more time to deal with this matter in a Uttle more depth. I must move on, contract with only a miserable 5 minutes more in which to turer.not cover aU the provocative comments which have wtil been made by the Minister and which have not a ational boat feather to fly with. At page 18 of the statement he enough allowance seemed to express some relief that the retention too much disruption rates in the armed Services have stabilised. Of that these vessels have course they have stabUised. Where would people ingly, they wtil not function be able to go upon leaving the armed Services, except into the dole queues, into the swelling army of unemployed people created by this Government's policy? On page 20 he one referred, rather Uberally but with no basis in fact, to limited support for Australian industry for fence purposes. By and large, he fairly roundly trounced Australian industry for wanting a better share of defence manufacturing. The Governhim ment has reversed its pohcy. In a poUcy release dated 8 October 1975 the Government said: Urgent action is required to minimise our dependence other nations for the supply of defence equipment. Those arefinewords, but where is the action? The honourable member for St George (Mr NeU), the shadow Minister for defence in the Government ranks, is lurking in the wings, waiting to take over, because of his outrage at the way in which he has been let down so the falsification of so many promises by the present Minister. On page 22 the Minister referred to the patrol by Mr Howard: craft. They are designed for naval purposes but they are largely to fulfil a civilian role. to be armed with pop guns-Worl d War II Bofors. This matter is particularly important cause the Government has had more than enough time in which to make arrangements that it could announce very firmly on this occasion the armaments to be installed on these craft. On 6 December last year the Minister said in a defence Press release: Two overseas manufacturers have been invited to for the supply of new close-range general purpose guns fitting on board new construction vessels for the Royal tralian Navy. Mr Kilien said the general purpose guns would be fitted in the new fast patrol boats to be built for Australian Navy. disInstead of that, we end up with World War II is Bofors. I suppose that next week he wtil anorignounce that he is issuing peashooters to the are to Army. These vessels are large but underon powered. At the maximum they wtil perform at only 30 knots, whereas one would have expected the them to do 40 knots.

136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,DEFENCE REVIEW,"Mr Gilesj-Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. badly with FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL 1977 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 September, on motion They are That the Bill be now read a second time.",57
137,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DEFENCE REVIEW,"The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Famtiy Law Act in order tofixa maximum age so for judges of the FamUy Court of Australia. Honourable members wtil be aware that this Bill was introduced in the Senate and that it passed that place without amendment. I indicate here that the Opposition does not oppose the tender measure. It wtil amend the Famtiy Law Act in for two areas. A new section 23A wtil be inserted in Austhe Act to provide that the retiring age wtil be 65 the Royal years as a maximum. An ancillary amendment is necessary in respect of section 28 of the Act. This amending Bill follows the constitutional amendment that we were able to achieve earUer this year when a number of amendments to the Constitution were approved by the Australian people. One of the questions asked of the people was whether they agreed that there should be a retiring age forjudges. I am very pleased that last the Australian people had a chance to exhave press views on matters such as that. Honourable members would have noticed that they expreslegislation sed their view rather significantly. The number voters in favour of a retiring age for judges six million and the number not in favour was a mere 1,400,000. That question was carried with a larger majority than that on any of the other referendum questions. I would have thought that had been the pubUc opinion in this nation for many years indeed. The founding fathers nowledged formed a Constitution and expressed their ideas in written words. The Constitution was formed High on the basis that judges would not be removed from office. I think that was fair and reasonable. There was a judicial interpretation in what was would known as Alexander's case in 1918. decided by the worthy justices of the time that as appointments, yet theas they could not be removed they were there life. That was rather an extension of interpretation. If we want to look at what is deemed to be situation we could do no better than to turn to the dissenting judgment in that case by Mr Justice age was set. Higgins who thought that it was perfectly fair and reasonable that the Parliament of the nation fix a retiring age for judges. He said that there was nothing inconsistent in having perhaps tenure for a number of years or a tenure for life. The point he made is that there was provision removal in certain circumstances and an thought appointment could be for afixedor appropriate term related to a definite retiring age. It should not be interpreted that appointments were for life because that could mean that a judge could be there when he was not capable of working his best mental abUity. Whtie the onus would then be on the Parliament to remove him it ceriveItand tainly would put the Parliament in a very ward position. Section 72 of the Constitution talks about tices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament. Surely we could into that that if the national Parhament had power to create other courts it would have the power also to determine retiring ages and, if that would apply to justices of the High Court well because they are referred to in the same tion of the Constitution. Mr Justice Higgins a parallel with section 103 of the Constitution judges. which provides for members of the Inter-State Commission to hold office for seven years. They could be removed under the same circumstances as justices could be removed under section 72. So what we are saying in relation to this amendment to the Constitution is that perhaps aU this should at have happened in 1900. In my view it could well been the intention in 1900 that the Parliament have the power to create courts by way of and, ancUlary to that, determine the of question of a reasonable retiring age. After all, was nobody in his right mind would expect Prime Ministers or other leaders in this country to be in their 80s, as has happened with many justices of the High Court as a result of the interpretation of that section 72 of the Constitution. Another weakness in interpretation., and ackby section 72, was that justices of the Court were appointed by the Governor General in Council. So they were not appointed by Parliament. We could presume that there be just as many inaccuracies, discriminations or political affiliations connected with It was then those appointments with parliamentary specious reasoning was for that we should not have the power to remove judges from the High Court because it might affect their impartiality or because they might the become victims of some poltiical vendetta. However, this could not possibly happen if a retiring It is said that because retiring ages already apply in State courts there would be no particular problem introducing them in Federal courts. a The reasoning appUed in Alexander's case was that whtie the justices thought that it wasfineto for be appointed by the Executive Council, they it was very unfair to suggest that Parliament have the ability to remove them. I cannot see the logic or the consistency in that argument. The justices went on to use some expressions which I think are against the whole concept of to federalism. For example, they use these words: is in the case of a Federation, where the central legislatexecutive bodies are largely competitive with, and in awka sense adverse to, the State authonties. If we are ever to make a nation here surely we do jusnot want our judicial system based on an adversary basis between State and Federal adminisread trations. We have to get consensus and the complementation which, I am happy to say, we got at the recent Hobart convention. After a long so, debate there and after some discussion of this as position it was clear that people at the convensection readily agreed that there had to be some drew common sense applied to the retiring ages of Mr Ruddock-Who is 'we?'",57
138,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,DEFENCE REVIEW,"'We' , in this sense, I am happy to report, comprises the Liberal Party, the National Country Party and the Austrahan Labor Party. The honourable member for Parof ramatta (Mr Ruddock) is not often helpful in interjections but on this occasion I am pleased reply. Alexander's case reveals that the judges who gave the decision that judges be there for Ufe had some affihations and I will advert to them. Griffith C.J., I am reminded, went on to the grand old age of 74 years. He was a former Queensland Premier and so had some poltiical interest. Mr Justice Barton continued to the of 71 years. He was a colonial pohtician. Mr tice Isaacs went on to 75 years of age. He had been associated with Victorian poUtics-non Labor, I might add. Mr Justice Powers went to 76 years of age. He was a conservative member and Minister in Queensland colonial poUtics. State Mr Justice Rich- I wtil save my comments about serve bim-wen t on to the grand old age of 87 years but had no active political career. He was appointed from the New South Wales Supreme Court which, I think, might show that he had some poltiical affihations because he would have been appointed back in the 1913 era. It was well known that he did not want to retire until 1950 because he thought that there was a good chance of the Chifley Labor Government being detutional feated, and so it was. He did not want to have the then Attorney-General Evatt appoint a successor to him. That appUed also to Mr Justice Starke who had a particular hosttiity towards the late Mr Justice Evatt. They were on the Bench at sametime,and just as with parUamentarians, have they can form likes and dislikes. Let me make it clear that these distinguished gentleman had those earlier poltiical affihations and aU the normal personal human frailties. The present Chief Justice has announced, as he is titled to do, that he thought there might be a betrangement. ter method of appointing judges, including High Court judges, by having them appointed by an outside committee. But if he looks at how distinguished gentlemen I mentioned postponed their retirement because there might be a different government coming in surely he wtil agree that there is some sense of poltiical assessclearly ment and political affiUation even in our top court, as there must be with everybody in this nation because we all have to vote. We are comState pelled to vote and, having been compelled to vote, make a poltiical judgment. stitutional background. As the honourable member for Parramatta has so correctly pointed out, we had to have convention to assess our understanding of what should happen. The interesting point about this legislation is its provisions relating to what is known as a non-party matter, the FamUy Court Australia. Our distinguished coUeagues in the Senate had the Bill for an extraordinary length of to time-year s longer than it was in the House of Representatives-and so had the advantage or disadvantage of formulating a proposal. One of the matters to which they addressed their minds was the creation of State famUy courts. They felt that it was very important to do so. When this matter was debated in the Senate on 26 age November 1974 Senator Missen moved an apJuspropriate amendment on the basis that if we created State family courts we then had a chance to guarantee a retiring age for judges. That was on the basis of the amendment. He said: Perhaps the most vital matter in regard to the creation of courts is that the judges appointed to them will not beyond the age of 65 years because I think it has generally been agreed in debate that in thisfieldoflaw it is highly desirable that judges should be limited in age. We aU agree. That step had to be taken at that stage because there was then no constitutional amendment of the type I have just outlined. The question had not been put to the people in 1974 and there had been no convention. This leads me to this question: Now that we have this constiamendment and an abUity to fix a retiring age, which has beenfixedat 65 years, there is really no need to put so much emphasis, if any emphasis at aU, on State courts. It is important that we now enter thisfieldappropriately as we the are entitled to do under the Constitution and a federal fantily court. It became virtually a legalfictionthat because we had to get judges of the right caUbre and have an ability to retire them we would create State family courts. Therefore, it was argued, the States could virtuaUy say that there would be a retiring age of 65 years beencause of a chance to negotiate that sort of arIf we look at section 41 (4) (b) of the Family Law Act we see where State courts are created there is an opportunity to negotiate an the two agreement which guarantees that people appointed by the States shall not hold office beyond the age of 65 years. What I am now putting to my distinguished friends opposite is that that shows there is no need to have that sort of arrangement in the future because we can control the retiring age ourselves. I notice there is a Fantily Court in Western Australia. I also notice that no other State has a FamUy Court at That is the conthe present time. We then come to this other fundamental problem. As a result of the decision in Russell v. a Russell we are somewhat defective in being able to grapple with all the family problems. There are very severe problems for a family and they are the family's own problems. But we have to give the structure whereby those problems be solved. We cannot solve them if we look at what has happened as a result of the High Court start. decision in Russell v. Russell. Let us remember that it is said that while there are federal to talk about custody, maintenance and property rights, they are not as wide as one would think. We do not have power to talk about property disputes if they are not ancillary to a matrimonial cause. We do not have power to talk about tody of children if they are not children of the marriage; in other words, what are called nuptial children. We are well aware of this lem because the matter was discussed in Hobart. We were anxious to get some reference of powers. I notice there is a dispute about whether we can get a reference of powers. It is clear that under the Constitution if we High could get States to refer to the Federal Parliawe ment powers in those areas of property, mainten-waywere ance, custody and what have you, we would not 'Cut have any difficulty in dealing with the problems famUy of the family. Surely it is afictionto think that quite clear under the Constitution we have with marriage-as we have-wit h divorce, matrirights, thatrights'. monial causes and parentalrightsand powers have to be interpreted, as the High has legally said, but those matters are Umited the aspects of the family which I have menhome. tioned. Property questions can be discussed only if they are anctilary to the matrimonial cause and the question of parentalrightscannot be extended to include chUdren who are not chUdren of the marriage of both parties. So there is a finite gap there. In Hobart at the Convention we suggested that the States might refer powers to us. I am pleased to note that the New South Wales Attorneybeen General said: 'Yes, by all means do it', and he moved an amendment. Nevertheless, the the amendment was not carried. The amendment has no poltiical weight in it. It was suggested the basis of what was best for the famtiy in time of need. We have the stupid situation at present time that while one is able to go to the family law court to discuss problems between husband and wife, one has to go to another court to discuss problems which relate to property to another court if the matter relates to the cusreadily. tody of the children who have been part of the famtiy home. I can think of nothing more ridiculous than having that situation. We recognise that it exists but we cannot get the solution. encourage the new Attorney-General (Senator Durack)-I am well aware of the efforts made by the previous Attorney-General-to get the States to agree in this matter. I think that the Labor Stacan tes-if I may use the term-woul d agree. I am anxious to encourage that because it would be a powers My colleague the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) wtil tell the House about a recent case in South Australia where the State court made a decision for the sale of the matrimonial home exercising the property rights cusunder State law. The FamUy Court made an order for therightof the former wife to have ocexcupancy for life. We get to theridiculoussituprob-ation where both orders could be enforced and the unfortunate woman could be in a position of occupying a home which could be sold to someone else. The only way to solve this situation where there is this conflict of laws is to go to the Court under section 109 of the Constitution and ask it to work out which law is to prevail. If to put this proposition to the people by of referendum, common sense would say: out all this nonsense. This is a question of a problem and a fantily court decision. It is that that court ought to be the court to the power to deal discuss these The question of property that those be determined by a State in is an estate fee simple, should not law, as they normally Court would be, overriding or in any way to therightsof a wife or husband to acontradicting matrimonial I have the same problem in my electorate. There has been some dispute and the property is deup for sale. The divorce has taken place and the former wife is facing eviction on the basis that she has no matrimonialrightsthere. So we get into all these circumstances. The concept of federal legislation is exceUent. Weaknesses have identified. We are overcoming one of those weaknesses as a result of putting the question to people, namely, whether judges should retire at a reasonable age. The people readUy agreed on with that proposition. If we could put another its constitutional amendment and ask the people thewhether the family law court should have the ability to deal with aU matters relating to the family, virtually unanimously all people in Australia would say yes. The difficulty is that we and cannot get that constitutional amendment so This is one of the problems of the Constitution. It took us about 77 years to obtain one minor amendment, and we cannot afford to wait another 77 years to deal with the problems of the I famtiy which I have outlined. I would like to see more encouragement given to the States-this is the only effective way to do it quickly-to refer these powers. There are some problems now which relate to the administration of the Family Law Act. The law is reasonable, the interpretation of understandable and the question always has to atmosphere. do with a tragic circumstance, usually the up of a family. We cannot legislate for the duct of people in the matrimonial sense. Nor we legislate for their temperament. We underwhich stand incompatibuity and all those other matters which come into the psychology and problems of life. The Family Court has to deal with these matters. We cannot lay down in law a black white situation as to who is right and who is wrong. There can be faults on both sides. We recognise that the basic unit in society strong fanuly unit and that is to be encouraged. should in no way be allowed to disintegrate. But once the disintegration has taken place we then have to deal with the fragments in the best possthen ible way. How do we do that? We have created in all honesty and sincerity and, I think, in a rather well-meaning way, a Family Court concept which not only has the judicial concept but also has the counselling and assistance concepts to help people. But we seem to be running into trouway bled waters. These concepts can be found at variperhaps. ous levels. If we can be quite direct about the matter, some of the temperaments of the judges might not encourage a speedy reconciliation or speedy solution. But that is a matter that comes with life. When we look at the problems existing here perhaps we can relate them to a number what we could call Treasury provisions. I notice that in the last Appropriation Bill we approprisome ated for family law $ 11 m but we spent only Ifindthat rather fascinating. In other words, Treasury has saved $5m in the law. As honourable members would know I have some knowledge of what is happening in New South Wales. There is great trouble and concern there because in matters where there are dispuWe tants-famil y disputes are thefiercestof dispuable tes-the margin for reconciliation and negovolved tiation is not wide. I am now told that there is to two years delay in handling matters of dispute relating to custody or property. The situation similar in Victoria. I am told that in New South Wales there are problems even in Parramatta because of the facUities avaUable. I spoke to a colleague of mine this morning who said: 'Look, we are aU over the place in the city of Sydney. We have three separate locations. If you go George Street you are likely tofind200 people confined in a space of 300 square feet'. That something akin to the cattle sales. We have real problems with space and convenience and faciUties. That is the situation in a nutsheU. There has been the problem of trying to get the Family it is Law Court well established in a proper break I am disappointed that the money appropriconated has not been spent because obviously it can could be well utilised. The former State courts were used in matrimonial causes would leave us far behind but they are no longer avaUable. It is important that there be proper faciUties because there are the problems of counselling and and assistance. Honourable members can imagine that if they walked into a court of matrimonial causes and if everyone were jammed in is a and falling over each other, that would not be It prone to help discussion as to whether there could be some settlement of the matter. We have a delay of two years at the moment, and we must say that it is not so much the legislation which is faiting, it is the appUcation of the facilities and the abUity to interpret the legislation. That is where the weakness Ues. We have increased the fee to $ 100. That is one for the Treasury to get a Uttle more back, But in doing that we are not solving the problems. I should Uke to see a committee set up to look at how the Fanuly Law Act is operatinga what are the problems, the advantages and the weaknesses and what areas need to be improved. I have mentioned those areas today. FacUities is of one area which would be simple to improve. It would require money and the appUcation of effort. But we need also the right sort of $6m. people. They are avaUable but they would have the to be paid; so we would need more appropriarea of family ations for that. We also need to make counselling and other facUities available so that people can achieve reconctiiation and a solution to their problems without the hardship that has been mentioned. must guarantee that these solutions are availvirtually at thetimethe Family Court is inin order to avoid the situation in which, upalthough we can solve the problem of separation, the very burdensome problems of custody, mainis tenance or property rights are not solved for a period of up to two years. Such delays are fatal. In fact, I am told that people are gomg away in disgust and are saying: 'We will have to solve our own problems'. There is no point in suggesting that the FamUy Law Court could undertake this to function; that would weaken the Family Law Court. So I suggest that we should set up a comis mittee of inquiry. Obviously, the chief judge in the Family Law Court area should be the chairman. Practising practitioners should be available to put forward ideas about what could happen. We should also involve counsellors and people interested in family welfare concepts, such as social workers, and even representatives of family units, so they can determine what they can do together. We emphasise that the Family Law Court cept has been a non-party one. I emphasise also that there is no hope of influencing people's duct through legislation or of guaranteeing reduction in the divorce rate through legislation. It has to be done by providing better support cilities for the family, the best of which would a job for the wage earner. There are family crises which are in no way related to temperament conduct; they could be related to economic cumstances, such as poor housing, poor ment, or lack of income. It is our job to deal with these matters in terms of economics. We have provide the right faciUties to enable the talented people in the fanuly law area to function efficiently. I suggest that, at the appropriate time, the Government might consider setting up an inquiry into how best to improve the Family Act or its administration. I think the former Attorney-General announced his interest in this matter. All the improvements which I have suggested would involve consultation and cothe operation with State governments and State Attorneys-General, whom we would Uke to involve as well. For these reasons, which I have outlined at some length, I think that the Bill worthy of support, it is in accordance with what the people have already said should happen. This Bill will represent some minor was improvement. I want to encourage Federal famUy courts. cannot have State administrations getting into this area because we could get aU sorts of interpretations of law at State boundaries. It important that when people can cross from State to State or State to Territory without a visa should not have the problem of different interpretations oflaw when a judicial interpretation of theirrightsis required. It is important, therefore, that we get the reference of powers the areas which are deemed to be defective. In summary, let us try to spend the money as is needed. Do not let us be penny pinching and scrape and save for the sake of reducing budgetary deficit. It is important that the of these people are given top priority and that chUdren in particular are given every consideration so that they can have the benefit of the help and assistance of their parents and so that the questions of custody and maintenance can be properly determined. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to make these remarks. We welcome the Bill.",59
139,Mr RUDDOCK,DEFENCE REVIEW," Iriseto conspeak in favour of the Fanuly Law Amendment Bill. It enables some of the matters spoken about conby the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith a (Mr Lionel Bowen), who preceded me in this debate, to be dealt with in part. However, the Bill fadoes not and will not overcome aU the problems. be In my comments I propose to make some observations about many of the matters which have or been raised by the honourable member for cirKingsford-Smith and to put them into perspecenvirontive for honourable members. This Bill wtilfixa retiring age forjudges. It wtil to enable the Attorney-General to appoint judges who wtil not be judges for Ufe. He wtil be in a position to make appointments to the Bench under these new provisions as soon as this Bill is proclaimed. As all honourable members have agreed, as this Parliament has agreed and as the people agreed in the referendum which was Law passed it is desirable that Fantily Law Court judges should retire at the age of 65 years, I believe it is important that additional appointments should have been postponed until such time as appointments can be made on this new basis. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations and Minister Asis sisting the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) it was indicated that in the next 12 months some six additional appointments are Ukely to be made. As mentioned by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, a bipartisan approach was taken by all parties represented in this House to We the retiring age of judges. The proposals were supported at the Constitutional Convention and the legislation to alter the Constitution was is introduced into Parliament by this Government. Those proposals were supported in this place they and by the people in a bipartisan way. Mr Donald Cameron-Overwhelmingl y so.",62
140,Mr RUDDOCK,DEFENCE REVIEW,"Of course. One of the imporin tant points that have been made already is that judges of the Western Australian Famtiy Court already have to retire at the age of 65 years. it There is a need forjudges involved in this area to be people who are able to adopt a contemporary a approach to problems involving the family needs which come before courts, which in so many ways are unique. This age for retirement will apply to every new appointment to the bench. matters Undoubtedly, there is an urgent need for further appointments to the bench. As has been menmagistrate tioned already, there are considerable delays the hearing of matters in the Fanuly Law Courts throughout Australia. But I think it ought to noted that there has been a substantial change our law with the introduction of Act. Mr Donald Cameron-Than k heavens for that.",62
141,Mr RUDDOCK,DEFENCE REVIEW,"This has created great pressure upon government and upon the administrapetty tion of justice. Insufficient cognisance has been taken of the problems associated with the fundathe mental changes that were necessary. I look at my colleague, the honourable member for Griffith, when I make those remarks because I believe that he might have been Uke many honourable members who supported this proposal when it came before the House-imbue d with such idealties ism that he overlooked the practical problems associated with substituting oflaw for a system oflaw which had previously operated and was not cognisant of the problems associated with it. We are now starting to see some of those problems. In New South Wales in the FamUy Law Division somefivejudges preof viously were able to deal with all the matters relating to the complex law which my coUeagues wtil tell me previously existed in relation to the estabUshment of a cause of action to enable the court to dissolve a marriage. Yet under this new system some nine judges already have been appointed for New South Wales, with the prospect of more, but they are not able to deal with the matters which are coming before them. The fact is that the system is new. It is one which needs the establishment of new rules and new It means that practitioners have (>recedents. earn what the system is all about. It means, relation to its implementation, that naturaUy there wtil be delays associated with it. There are some other important aspects that have to be taken into account. We have estabmeans Ushed a FamUy Court which is taking over not of only the matters that formerly were dealt with by some the Fanuly Law Division in New South Wales with which for instance, but also many of previously were dealt with by courts of petty sessions. We now have a system in which judges rather than magistrates determine these matters. That is the case in spite of aU the additional costs that are associated with having judges, not only in terms of salaries, the requirement for extra staff and the necessary detaUed reporting rangements but also in terms of such mundane as the fact that a judge is entitled to a car to take him to and from the court whereas a wtil find his own way to his court. in There are many costs involved in the maintenance of a fuU Superior Court system where be judges deal with all of these matters that prein viously were able to be dealt with by some very the FamUy Law skUled magistrates. I refer to the speed with which we have tried to implement this new system. The pace at which we have moved has meant that many of the matters that previously were dealt with by courts of sessions, such as those relating to maintenance, custody and so on, now, under section 46 of Family Law Act, are required to be transferred to the FamUy Court. In cases in which there is a dispute involving custody, guardianship and access to the chUdren of a marriage, or property exceeding $1,000 in value, the matter must be transferred to the Fantily Court, unless the paragree to the matter being determined in the Court of Petty Sessions or in a court of lesser one complete system jurisdiction. It is a fact that when it comes to these very difficult questions relating to maintenance, custody of chUdren and property, there is the possibUity of one party being advantaged as a result orders being sought. One party could be advantaged by a delay. When a delay occurs, such as is the case now in the FamUy Court, there is a distinct possibility that a party who otherwise might agree to a matter being heard by consent before a court of petty sessions would say: ' I wtil get an advantage. There might be a two-year delay before this maintenance matter can be heard by the Fanuly Court, whereas the Court of Petty Sessions might make an order in favour of my former spouse'. In that situation that person could use this section of the Act as a method by to which to seek a delay and thereby quite adin versely affect the other party. I make the point that, while we are having these teething difficulties in establishing a famUy court system of the size and adequacy that is necessary to deal with all of these matters, we ought to look at ways and by which we can involve the State courts petty sessions in deaUng with and determining of these matters. I believe that the pace we have implemented this system has the matters that been far too quick. I wish also to take up some of the comments made by the honourable member for Kingsford Smith in relation to the very nature of the conflict of jurisdiction that has been highlighted out by the decision in Russell v. Russell. It seems to me arthat a number of particular matters might be considered, and the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith raised two of them. The first method of overcoming this problem, as the honourable member quite rightly suggested, was to seek to have transferred from the States, means of constitutional amendment, the powers that they now have in relation to maintenance, custody and property in a matrimonial causes situation. The second method was to seek a refermined ral of powers. However, the matter which the honourable marriage member did not pursue and the one which I fighting remain. think quite rightly should have been pursued- I beheve that it was being pursued by the previous Attorney-General until it became too late template such a change-wa s the establishment in the remaining States of State fanuly courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. Quite clearly, there were State family courts exercising Federal jurisdiction, those courts would have the power to determine matters arising under State jurisdicAustraUa tion. The matter could have been overcome easand ily if, instead of having this preference for electorate Federal court system in our own hands, the sections of the Act which were envisaged, enabling the State to accept Federal jurisdiction-obviousl y this problem which the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has wtil raised is recognised by the States-coul d have been accepted by the States. The problem would not have been as real time. Mr Donald Cameron-You voted for it originally.",63
142,Mr RUDDOCK,DEFENCE REVIEW,"I did not vote for the Bill in its original form. I want to make that point clear also. The honourable member for Griffith has vited me to make these comments: I did not supfanuly port the Bill in its original form. I supported strongly- I believe that that support has been vindicated-the amendments moved by the judges honourable member for Wentworth (Mr matters ElUcott) when the FamUy Law Bill was before the House. One should look at the way in which the Act has been implemented and the way in judges which it is operating. The observations made by the honourable member for Wentworth when hefirstspoke the Bill were quite true and correct. He made the point, quite vaUdly-this has been brought out very clearly in the debate today by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith as well-that we do not remove from the fanuly law area genwhether erally the conflict that can arise in marriage relation to matters of property, maintenance and custody of chUdren simply by removing the gation of fault in the breakdown of marriage. Previously parties to a marriage were having those matters decided when the matrimonial cause was being dealt with. It was at that time by that matters anctilary to that question arose. They were important issues in determining whether there was a matrimonial cause. But they are not removed simply by saying 'We are deterto dissolve the marriage' simply because there has been a notional separation for a period of 12 months. The real problems that arise in a The fact is that parties are still over aU those additional questions. Mr Donald Cameron-Only ? to con Mr RUDDOCK-No. They are sttil fighting. The fact of the matter is that the Fantily Court of Australia, with extra judges and extra personnel, if is still having to deal with the same complex and difficult problems. I say here and now that I do not believe that we wtil help the situation in by the development of a very complex large Famtiy Court system. I believe that we an wtil have to see the development of a system in which the registrars and deputy registrars assume greater responsibUities and many of the matters that people want to bring before the judges are no longer dealt with by judges. We have to see a greater delegation of responsibUity and a greater determination by people who then are in the system of some of these lesser as it is at the present questions. I am told- I believe it to be the case-that even under this new Act, many judges spend a great deal of their time satisfying themselves about purely technical matters that could be dealt with by the registrars or by the officers of the Court. I inam informed that in New South Wales in the old law jurisdiction a certificate from the Registrar stating that certain technical matters had been dealt with was sufficient to satisfy the in the old FamUy Law Division that those had been completed satisfactorily and that the paper work was in order. Yet I understand that in many of the courts some of the are stUl gomg through the affidavits to see that they have been swom properly and attested and to see that some of the technical matters that could otherwise have been dispensed with quite on easily have been dealt with correctly. Mr Donald Cameron-Why don't you Uke judges?",64
143,Mr RUDDOCK,DEFENCE REVIEW,"It has nothing to do with I Uke judges. I am saying that under the in old system so many of these matters had been refined, and made efficient. We have estabUshed aUea new system with new personnel and new administration. It has associated with it many teething problems that should have been recogby nised. If we had not thrown out the baby with bath water we might have had a system on which we could have built and developed. We could have had proper administrative arrangements worked out, and worked out satisfactorily. could have been kept. We would have had a much more efficient system. We would not have ramatta had many of the delays that are occurring today, member (Mr and we would not be agonising over this problem of delays in our courts. I am concerned about the delays because to ultimately if there are delays they bring the dicial system into contempt in people's minds. believe the delays must be overcome. I do not accept that we can avoid our properfiscaland financial responsibilities. I do not believe that can simply seek to have money appropriated to overcome the problems that we should have foreseen. We should have been aware that those problems might have occurred as a result of throwing out entirely the old system, instead looking at ways and means of developing it to decessor overcome some of the specific problems existed in the minds of honourable members when the Family Law Bill came before this Parliament. Notwithstanding my comments about the is problems faced by the Fanuly Court and those associated with the development of the Family Law Act, I am pleased to be able to support strongly this Bill which will enable additional judges to be appointed. That may go a long towards overcoming the problems that are facing the family law courts at the moment. I would eninflicted courage those people who are administering the system to see whether proper administrative ways of overcoming many of these are being experienced can be found without the necessity of having unnecessarily to appoint additional courts and additional judges.",64
144,Mr JACOBI,DEFENCE REVIEW," I support the Bill with some pleasure. I welcome the proposed appointment of additional judges. As the them honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr tuted Lionel Bowen) said, there are considerable, regrettable delays in the execution of the law. Throughout the community these delays have led to widespread disquiet, discontent and frusstaff tration. I have had deputations in my office ing the last month comprised of a number of people who are extremely concerned at the appUcation and implementation of the law. I supstructive port strongly the proposition put forward structively by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith for a committee of inquiry to set up as quickly as possible to study the means which the Fanuly Court can be made more the efficient and more effective. Undoubtedly it needs some cross-fertilisation of ideas from people who have been affected by or can make a constructive contribution to this arm of the law They which is extremely difficult to administer. I suggest that the honourable member for ParRuddock) attempt to become a real egation. It wouldConstitutional of the be an Convention delextremely interesting exercise for him if he became a member. I Ustened 20 minutes of a reasonable speech from him. If juone tears away all the fat and gets down to the I meat, undoubtedly the problem is the necessity in Australia for uniform law in this area. I presume that he wants to persist with the current wefragmentation. That is the disaster inflicted on the area at the moment. I have attended Constitutional Convention meetings since their resumption in 1973.1 know how difficult it is to get some uniformity among the States. I comof mend the former Attorney-General and his prefor their efforts in this regard. It is very that difficult to get uniformity. I think the honourable member for Parramatta should acknowledge that one of the frustrating difficulties in this countiy at the moment not only in the area of fanuly law but is equally in the area of corporate law. The fragmentation is a shambles. People can do all sorts of things, can be charged under company law in a State and can reregister over the border. Does the way honourable member want that sort of thing to persist? Does he want the hardship which is on thousands of couples in this countiy because of the lack of uniformity of law? The problem is this lack of uniformity. This is the delays that heart of the problem. While one acknowledges the regrettable number of deficiencies in the FamUy Court-the y are deficiencies which I would strongly point out-the y cannot be attributable to the Fanuly Court. If there are any deficiencies, the reason for lies either with the poUticians who instithe law or, more importantly, at the door of this Government because it has failed to provide sufficient funds to the Court. Those funds would inevitably have given the Court the additional it needs and the additional infrastructure it durneeds to become as efficient as it ought to be. I want to make what I consider to be a concontribution to the debate in a very conimportant and very human area. It deals with custody. I refer to an extract by Richard be Chisholm, Senior Lecturer in the Faculty of Law at the University of New South Wales. It sets out concisely the problems in relation to custody under the Fanuly Law Act. I quote: When parents separate and cannot agree about their children, the law usually refers to the problem pute about 'custody', a word which has overtones prison rather than the family. Actually, a number terms must be distinguished: A child's guardian is who is responsible for him-h e has the right(and the duty) to make such decisions as where the child will live school, whether he will undergo serious medical treatment, and so on. Formerly, the father was the child's guardian, since the Family Law Act, which came into force January 1976, both parents are guardians. They have equal rights, and equal dudes. The word custody usually refers the situation after a court has determined a dispute: parent having custody is the one who lives with and after the child from day to day, and makes most of cisions affecting his life. The which amounts to therightto visit the child or have him with that parent at certain times. One of the very onerous difficulties facing the Family Court-w e have often overlooked this Australia, particularly since the Second World War-is that one third of all marriages in one Australia during the last 2Vi decades between people born in Australia and people born outside of this country. The majority of those people would be from Great Britain, France, Greece, Italy and other Western European countries. They are dual nationaUsts. Some Fanuly Court officers estimate that 50 per cent of their inquiries are from Australian couples with different ethnic backgrounds. Their marriages are in jeopardy and they are seeking advice. It does not take much to envisage the immense problems this creates for the FamUy Court. These tug-of-love situations, if I can them that, place great pressures not only on FamUy Court but also on the Foreign Affairs Department. The House wtil recall that last May raised with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) the matter of the appalling level of chtid abductions in Australia in recent years. The Minister said that the Department of Foreign Affairs handled approximately 200 applications per month in this connection. As a result, interdepartmental committee of inquiry was set up. I believe that the Committee has completed its findings. Because of my concern about child abductions and the difficulties that the FamUy Court faces wrote a lengthy submission to the former Attorney-General and I shall make some reference to it. First of aU, there is the problem that a number of forgeries occur when applioffices cations for passports have been endorsed. traUan passports are valid for a period of five years. One area which has frequently been exploited relates to a passport under which a child or chUdren may be lawfully taken out of the countiy on a passport that may have been obtained by one or other of the parents some the care of time before proceedings in the FamUy Court as a discommenced. In those circumstances the Foreign of the Affairs Department is unable to act. I suggested of legal to the former Attorney-General that in aU cases the person where proceedings involving custody had been and go to commenced, the parties to such proceedings should be obUged to surrender passports. Ausbut tralian passports should not be reissued in their on S existing form without the renewed consent of to either spouse or the consent of the court. In fairThe ness, the court has the power to enforce that at looks present. It may ask the parties to agree to this the debeing done but there is no obUgation to do so. In other parent usually has access, stay situations where the custody of the chtid is paramount I think the passports ought to be surrendered. If neither party wants the chtid's name presently on the passport to be changed during in the proceedings the court need not intervene. However, if the court decides to give custody to spouse or the other it should instruct that the have been passport be altered accordingly. Regrettably, most child abductions from this countiy affect people who are dual nationals holding dual passports. I do not know whether the Family Court has the power to request the surrender of foreign passports. I think it has. One of the difficulties is that the Australian Government has no jurisdiction on overseas citizens or people who travel on foreign passports. However, if a foreign passport was surrendered that would overcome this problem. It would not precall vent a person going to a foreign embassy in the Australia and obtaining what can be termed a 'replacement passport'. However, in the interI vening period the Family Court could notify the foreign embassy or consular office of the court order. Regrettably, when court orders are made in relation to custody or access there is no transmission of this information from the Famtiy Court to the Foreign Affairs Department or apan propriate consular office. There has to be a greater notification of decisions made in the Family Court to the Australian Foreign Affairs Department which issues passports and is responsible for them. Equally, this information ought to be transmitted to foreign embassies and I consular offices throughout Australia. If my suggestions are adopted by the Foreign Affairs Depaitment, the same procedures should be adopted by overseas embassies and consular in Australia or, at least, a request should Ausbe made for them to do so. I acknowledge that we cannot do much about foreign citizens in Australia. However, as I said earUer, I think there has to be a greater exchange of information between the Family Court and the Foreign Affairs Department when court orders are issued particularly when they affect foreign nationals or rather those who have dual citizenship. The other thing I suggested to the former Attorney-General was that there ought be as quickly as possible reciprocity with foreign governments overseas for the enforcement of custodial orders made in this country. This mightextremely be more the responsibiUty of the Minister for Foreign Affairs although it stems from the FamthefiveMinisters ily Law Act. An international convention for the enforcement overseas of maintenance orders badly needed. As I recaU, that undertaking was given by the former Attorney-General. stems directly from the FamUy Law Act. Thefinalmatter to which I draw the attention of the House is that of interstate abductions and the execution of warrants under section 64 (9) the FamUy Law Act which states: Where an order made by a court (including a court prescribed overseas country) child is in force, a court having jurisdiction under this Act may issue a warrant authorising or directing the person, any of the persons, to whom it of the child and to deliver the child to the person entided custody or to some other person or authority (including person or authority in or from a prescribed overseas named in the order on behalf of the person entided custody. I raised this point with the former Attorneyan General. Regrettably, it appears that in the of interstate or intrastate abductions the gation is on the parent to trace the abducting parent and then notify the police so that the rant can be served. I urgently request that partmental investigations be initiated to find more effective and efficient system for serving and executing warrants. I appreciate the fact recognition of these contingencies is a civil ter and that the responsibUity is on the person concerned to locate the abducting parent. When that is done the potice wtil execute the warrant. I matter. suggest to the Minister for Special Trade NegoThe tiations who represents the Attorney-General, the House and to the Government that there there must be a far more effective and efficient method for parents to have a warrant executed and the propriate child returned to them when a court order has that I recommended been defied. Another ludicrous anomaly to which my attenjudges-i tion was drawn-this is one of the strictures the Fanuly Court-is the confidentiaUty provthey sions which apply, certainly in the Social Security Act and, as I understand it, in the Repatriation Act. I have had two cases drawn to my attention in which a parent obtained through the Social Security Department the address who had defied the Family Court order for custody and abducted the chtid. The name in turn was transmitted to the Department of Social Security through the FamUy Court, but the Department of Social Security refused to furnish the to FamUy Court with the address of the offending parent so that the warrant could be executed. I suggest that this is another factor that must be frustrating to the FamUy Court and to the people in these situations. I have written to concerned. In those two cases I have written to Ministers, asking that if the Act is needs to be amended it be amended so that the Court can execute its warrants effectively and This also efficiently. Let me sum up by saying this: Undoubtedly, in this area, along with many others-particularl y in this area in which so much human distress and of tragedy is involved-ther e is an urgent need for the States to realise that if the Family Court is to remain effective and efficient there must be of a urgently a rationaUsation and unification of laws. with respect to the custody of a",65
145,Mr ELLICOTT,DEFENCE REVIEW," I want or to make a few comments on this measure, with is addressed to take possession to which I am quite famUiar. The Bill is of some siga nificance because it represents the first measure country) to be introduced into the Federal Parliament to since thefirstparUament met which restricts the retiring age of Federal court judges. This Bill is historic Bill in that sense. It wtil remind case honourable members, of course, that this obUGovernment promoted three successful constitutional amendments. Since Federation there warhave been only eight all told, and three of them dewere successfully put through by this Governa ment last May. This particular amendment was promoted by the Government at the Constithat tutional Convention last October and was basimatcally in the form of the amendment suggested by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in relation to this fact that an age Umit of 65 years isfixedis to an indication of a parhament's judgment that is, in the Famtiy Court of Australia, an apme say age at which judges ought to retire. Let that, in the course of the 30 appointments to the Government whilst I was Attorney-General, I stressed to the n fact appointed for Ufe-the desire of on the Government that, come the age of 65 years, might well seefitto retire. Whether they will do that, of course, wtil depend on how they feel in 10, 15 or 20 years time when they reach that age. But the thought is well and truly in their minds. I am speaking of the judges who have of a spouse been appointed already. As has already been announced, the Government is proposing to appoint another six judges. Those judges probably will be appointed in the States of New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania. The appointment of those judges will bring the complement of the Court to 36. It will then be the largest single court in Australia. The number of judges will exceed the number of judges of the New South Wales Supreme Court, which is currendy the largest court. Of course, we are not in the game of building the biggest court. Indeed, there are very good reasons why we should not want to extend the number of judges any more than we have to. Whatever one can say about this, the fact is that both the previous Government and this Government were surprised to some degree by the number of divorce applications received m the first year of operation of the Court. Honourable members will recall statements previously made that we had expected a 50 per cent increase. We expected about 38,000 divorce appUcations in 1976. That was the expectation of the Australian Labor Party Government. It also was my expectation when I took on the office of Attorney General. Of course, it turned out quite differently, and there were 65,000 appUcations in 1976. This year the number of applications has fallen back to the projectedfigure-that is, something between 39,000 and 40,000. That indicates that, if applications continued at that level and if one continued to appoint judges, there could come a time when judges had nothing to do. There is no point in going on appointing judges, even to the age of 65 years, let alone for Ufe, simply to meet what I believe is really a temporary contingency in the FamUy Court. If one looks at the delays in defended matters one wtil find that the delays in New South Wales are basically no greater than they were under the old Matrimonial Causes Act-approximatel y two years. I do not say that that is desirable. With the current rate of work the judges are coping with the divorce applications. Thus they are deaUng with divorce applications at the rate of about 40,000 applications per annum. Therefore they are keeping up with this part of the work. In defended matters there is an obvious need to do what one can to use the judiciary'stimeto the best advantage. The Government has taken measures to achieve that very object. For instance, additional registrars have been appointed. It seemed to me as Attorney-General that the registrars could do a lot of the work that the judges were doing-for instance, they could hold regulation 96 and regulation 99 conferences. As a result of decisions made by the Government, some eight additional registrars are being appointed around the Commonwealth. They wtil add considerably to the work capacity of the Family Court of Australia. They wtil be able to determine whether it is possible to settle matters before the issues go to the judges. At the sametimethe Government has been looking at better procedures in order to speed up the various matters that come before the court and to ensure that wherever possible the minimum delay is involved in the judges getting down to the issues. My basic philosophy in relation to judges is that they are there to determine the issues between the parties. That is their job. To the extent to which purely procedural matters or matters of concUiation can be removed from their jurisdiction, those matters ought to be removed. It was always a basic part of the FamUy Court concept that there would be counselling services. It is very interesting to note that, although it sounds a good idea to have as many counsellors as we can usefully have, the fact is that, come the day when we try to get counsellors, wefindthat there is a Umited number of people who have the qualifications required of counsellors. The Attorney-General's Department has attempted assiduously to increase the counselling staff in Une with the appointment of judges. It is not always easy tofindpeople of the appropriate capacity and training tofiUthose positions. But the job is under way, and additional counseUors are being appointed. I believe that 36 judges ought to be sufficient to cope with the work of the FamUy Coun, and one would hope that the additional judges would be appomted within the next 6 months. Some mention was made of premises. Let me say that the Family Coun premises around this country are the most magnificent court premises in Australia. South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland all have top rate premises. They are premises that members of Parliament ought to visit and inspect because they create a leisurely and informal court atmosphere in which counselling can be undertaken. Public child minding facUities for the chUdren of witnesses and others who come to the court are provided also. The facUities are designed to make the atmosphere of conciliation and counselling the dominant atmosphere of the court. It is true that due to the fact that the numbers of appUcations were underestimated in New South Wales the premises in New South Wales have not been as appropriate and as large as they might have been. But I would like the honourpay able member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel go Bowen) to know that the Temple Court buildingam in Sydney is to be used by the Family Court. It is anticipated that those premises will provide for nine courts and appropriate judges' and counselling facUities. These premises ought to be available by 18 December this year. I concerned to bring about this change of locationpremises, because the premises at Scandia House have not the been satisfactory for many reasons. But the facUi-The ties at Scandia House were provided to the in Government when the FamUy Law Act was pin implemented in January 1976. But let us not talk about Fanuly Court premwhich ises in a derogatory way, because they are ideal premises. Large sums of money have been prohelping vided and any lack of expenditure of funds last year was due to the fact that funds were set aside for the enforcement of maintenance orders under arrangements with the States. Because those arneed rangements were not concluded subject of negotiation, funds were not fully expended. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith mentioned the need to establish a committee of inquiry. The honourable member will recall that some days ago the honourable member for St George (Mr NeU) who sits next to me in the chamber, suggested that a pariiamentary comenforcement mittee be estabUshed. I suggested I think in June in an address in Adelaide that a parliamentary committee to inquire into the operations of the FamUy Law Act ought to be established next if year. I think such a committee should not only look at those questions mentioned today but alsoforce it. look across the board at the whole operation of the Act. There is no doubt that many people, usuaUy either deserted wives or deserted husbands, feel a grave sense of injustice as a result of the saying that, it is not my desire to go back to thesorted Elhcott amendments of 1975. But I believe that we have to comprehend and understand the feel-rants ings of these people. We have to understand feeling of rejection they have when they sudpolice denlyfindthat the other party to the marriage has decided that the marriage is all over. If wife makes this decision, the husband who doeswithin not want to terminate the marriage is kicked He has to provide the fantily home.

In many cases some other of gentleman comes along and Uves in the famtiy home. The husband is divorced and sometimescertainly in the case of the chUdren-h e has to maintenance. But he is not even aUowed to into the home. That is a typical sort of case. I not saying that these problems necessarily can be avoided but a sense of hardship and injustice is being bred in the community in relation to chambers the Fanuly Law Act. I think that we need to look not only at the wasprocedural matters, such as the question of which are very important but also at basic questions of the social effect of the Act. famtiy has become a less popular institution our soaety but it is one that we need to underin many ways. We are too ready to take off the shoulders of the family those responsibUities traditionally belonged to it and put them on the shoulders of the State. This transfer is not the famtiy. It means that the famtiy is becoming a less significant unit in society and that people are looking more and more to the state for support instead of to the family. I believe we to give very careful thought to this aspect of but were the our social fabric. The honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) mentioned the question of custody, and I would Uke to refer to the point he made. One of the problems that has been faced is the problem of the enforcement of custody orders. There was no lack of enthusiasm on my part or on my Department's part when we sought to achieve the of custody orders. There is no point in having a judicial system unless one has an appropriate method of enforcing orders. The proposition is as simple as that We need such powers the judicial system is not to become a charade. The whole purpose is to get an order and to enThe transfer of the court order process from the State area- I am not complaining, but it is a fact-to the Federal area caused problems at the police level-whethe r potice would enforce cusAct. Intody orders. Hopefully, this problem has now itself out. The potice of this country have agreed that they wtil continue to enforce warin this respect until other provisions are themade. I hope there will be no attempt by the to leave this very important area. I believe, however, that, ultimately, we wtil have to face up the to providing some form of enforcement body the Commonwealth area. I am talking not out.only of an enforcement body to operate within the FamUy Court area but also of one to aa in Underother areas such as the High Court. The task of enforcement officers would be to enforce orders the courts. I believe that ultimately that sort of arrangement will have to be made. Although this is not necessarily poUce work, I believe that the potice ought to maintain the present system until governments can afford the funds to establish alternative. The honourable member for Hawker menevents tioned section 17 of the Social Services Act. I only say this to the honourable member I know of one or two instances raised by honourable members on this side of the House in which par-most ticulars were supplied by the Depanment of Social Security. I think the honourable member will find that the Department, after having received certain advice, will in fact provide particulars in an appropriate way to help locate child and have the child taken from ing parent. The honourable member raised the question of overseas enforcement. I that this matter was not left untouched. At the recent Commonwealth Law Ministers Conference, it was a matter of considerable concern not only to Australia but also to Canada and many other Commonwealth countries. A decision was taken to have a look at this matter and to could be done. Indeed, the Conference took an example of a perfect law to adopt our own FamUy Law Act. It is to be hoped that as a result of the studies by the Commonwealth Secretariat there wtil be some solution promoted. It had been put to me that the Extradition could be used. I say quite categorically that not believe the abduction of a child should treated as a criminal matter. To adopt a course wtil not result necessarily in bringing back chtid. The 'child-napping' or whatever to call it, may well be a crime on the part parent. But it is no satisfaction to have the parent back and the child somewhere in some other part of the world with his grandparents. This is not a commend solution. We have to develop some method to bring together the various countries. I suggest that we could start with the Commonwealth countries and adopt reciprocal rules which will provide for the enforcement both of maintenance orders and custody orders. I can assure honourable members that it is a deeply felt and appreciated, particularly by the Attorney-General of Canada. They can rest 1977. assured that it wtil be prosecuted by this GovernPostal ment and future governments through the monwealth Law Ministers Conference.",67

148,Mr SINCLAIR,BEEF INDUSTRY,"by leave-During the past months the Government has been most conto cerned with two principal aspects of rural policy. Thefirsthas been to remove as quickly as posstogether ible the inequities created by the harsh policies appUed during the three years of Labor adminiswheat tration. Secondly, we have been concerned to establish once again afirmand continuing from which rural producers throughout Australia might function profitably on a basis of equaUty with every other Australian. We see country and city residents interdepenWe dent, each benefiting from the prosperity other. We recognise the assertions of the Green Paper on agriculture and the necessity to compensate the rural industry for some of the the disabiUties which economic aid in other sectors poration creates. Rural exports still provide Australia approximately half its annual export earnings; amounting to $5 bilUon in 1976-77. These exports remain vital to a sound national balance pear of payments. Primary production in mensions is a major source of economic activity across two-thirds of the Australian continent. Moreover, it also provides a base for urban settlement and for employment in associated ducers manufacturing and service industry throughout enable these areas. The initiatives taken by this Government the rural sector represent an extraordinarily and comprehensive program. With the impendwho ing introduction of legislation to estabUsh National Rural Bank, most of the major elincreased ements of the Liberal-National Country parties 1975 rural poUcy wtil have been introduced.

The major parameters of our rural program have included: Reintroduction of the phosphatic fertiUser bounty and renewal forfiveyears at the rate of $12 per tonne, estimated to cost $40m in 1977-78; the nitrogenous fertiUser subsidy was retained at $78.74 per tonne of contained nitroallowance. gen to 31 December 1976. In so doing I might mention that we did not accept the Industries sistance Commission recommmendations as the Labor Party announced it would do. Thereafter the subsidy was set at $60 per tonne, for which $ 12m has been provided in 1977-78. We increased the wool price reserve from 206 cents to 284 cents a kilogram clean whole cUp average and backed the Australian Wool Corporation in its pot-holing market operations above 21 this level. We provided underwriting assistance the dairy industry to guarantee a minimum payment on most manufactured mild products, with a restructuring of dairy marketing arrangements. We increased the first advance for in 1976-77 by 20 per cent to $66 per tonne or $ 1.80 per bushel.

We have introduced the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. have extended the Commonwealth rebate for apprenticeship fulltimetraining, the CRAFT scheme, to rural employers. Victoria has shown the way and there are already 500 rural apprentices in that State. In addition, in each particular commodity, the Government has developed in close co-operation with the industry concerned special measures to help offset production, marketing, promotional and research difficulties. It is against this background that I now to identify further additional assistance be provided to the beef industry. In recent beef producers have been hard hit by unprecenestimated dented cost increases, by recurrent strikes, sometime closure and continued limited access our most important overseas beef markets, by prolonged depression in overseas beef prices, gravated by serious drought conditions in much of the United States with resultant accelerated turn-off of stock from those drought affected areas in direct competition with pasture fed meat supplied from Australia; and, in nificant increases in domestic and export meat sales, there has been a surplus of cattle in the market with consequential low prices for procame ducers. The deteriorating financial circumstances of beef producers in Australia today is of particuup lar concern to the Government. In spite of rigorous marketing efforts overseas, the prospecleviate tive estabUshment of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and other assistance measures, returns of many cattlemen are at disabove astrously low levels. In November 1975 the Liberal and National Country Parties clearly stated their poUcy for the cattle industry. It states: Industries Assistance Commission recommendations short term assistance to the beef industry will be implemented. Proposals will also be considered to improve term viability of the catde industry. The functions of Australian Meat Board will be examined in conjunction with meat exporters and producers. A system of meat classiwill be introduced after consultations with the Board Labor Government, and industry. examination will be made with the States and industry all aspects of meat production, marketing, handling, and to Firstly, let me deal with the IAC recommendaon short term assistance to the beef indusfire try. In essence the IAC recommended that: The existing special credit facUities for beef ascattle producers be extended and the terms of proloans be varied so that interest rates not asexceed 4 per cent; the provision of up to 2 years carry-onfinanceand an increased limit of $15,000 for producers in the pastoral zone We and $10,000 for producers in the temperate zone; Household support be introduced for producers who are assessed to be non-viable; State Governments to have some financial involvement but the contribution of the Commonwealth be not less than one-half; Meat export charges be suspended. The Government has already introduced all these measures recommended by the IAC. The want suspension of the meat inspection charge from now to 1 March 1976 imposed by the Labor years Administration will result this year in an benefit to producers of about $28m. by the The States and the Commonwealth Government to jointly provided $ 15m in low interest carry-on a loans to beef producers in 1976-77 and a further ag- $16m will be provided this year for beef and dairy farmers under the new Rural Adjustment scheme. The conditions on carry-on loans for beef producers were liberalised to enable cattlemen who had already had carry-on loans to spite of sigmake a second appUcation. The new Rural Adjustment scheme which beoperative on 1 January 1977 also included household support, which provides assistance for to one year to non-viable farmers who cannot meet Uving expenses and need assistance to alpersonal hardship whtie considering whether or not to continue farming. The IAC was also particularly concerned that none of the programs should prejudice the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign. In this regard, it must be remembered that it is essential if we are to retain our export markets that the 1984 target date for provisionally free status in all States and Territories be achieved. For this campaign the Commonwealth Government proas vided $18.5m in the 1976-77 Budget, which unfortunately was not all spent by the States, and $ 19.6m has been allocated this year, including $4.5m slaughter compensation for reactor cattle. Let me also briefly summarise other assistance the Government has provided. It is essential to put into context the assistance that the Government is prepared to give to this particularly disadvantaged sector of the community. There was a grant of $1.2m to the Australian Meat Board to meet losses incurred on an earlier sale of meat to the United Soviet SociaUst RepubUc. Legislation for the Australian Meat and Liveket. stock Corporation has been enacted. The new Corporation is due to be proclaimed on 1 October. One of the most significant extensions to the new Corporation is the manner and form of the creation of consultative groups. The chairmarkets man and members of the new AMLC are due to take up their duties shortly, and I am pleased announce to the Housetiiat Mr R. G. Jones, Negotiations Executive Director of F. J. Walker & Co Ltd, is be appointed Chairman of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. His choice has been made after a very careful check of possible canseries didates, including producers and businessmen. AU were considered before afinalUst of two didates was prepared. These two names were submitted to a joint meeting of the executive of the Producers Consultative Group executive of the Exporters and Abattoir Consultative .Group. After this meeting which held in Melbourne on Sunday 18 September, both groups unanimously endorsed Mr R. G. Jones. Mr Jones is 56 years of age, a chartered accountant and a returned soldier. It is quite clear that he should be required to divest himself of any interest which might even remotely considered to be in conflict with his responsibilimulated ties as Chairman of the Corporation, and in accepting the position Mr Jones has agreed to just that. The previous aUeged abuse of the 'pass-back' E revision of the Livestock Slaughter Levy as been eliminated. The Commonwealth Government Government has repeatedly made representaastrously tions at the highest levels to obtain better to markets which impose restrictions on Ausembargoes traUan beef. The success of these representations is apparent in the significant overaU increase the volume of Australia's meat export sales. For example, the consultations between the Japanese and Australian Governments in April 1977 were a significant factor behind the decision by Japanese Government to maintain quotas for the period April to September 1977 at the same level sales. in the previous six months. This was in spite of protestations by the domestic Japanese industry in a then election fever in an effort to reduce that quota level. The decision came at a time when the Japanese Government was under real domestic poltiical pressure to reduce the quota because of increases in domestic beef production. One former major market, the United Kingdom, now a member of the European Economic Community, has been of particular concern. To date Uttle impact has been made on the extraordinarily wide number of tariff and nontariff barriers against meat exports into that marNonetheless, we have maintained constant pressure on the Community for a UberaUsation of its beef import regime. For some years Europe has excluded Australian agricultural products from her markets, and disrupted our traditional in third countries by subsidising exports of her food surpluses. The Prime Minister has to now appointed a Minister for Special Trade to assist in this area, the efforts to being made by the Minister for Overseas Trade. This afternoon the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations (Mr Howard) leaves Australia for a of high level negotiations with the nine member states of the Community and the canEuropean Economic Community Commission in Brussels. Among the problems which he will be canvassing is the access of Australian beef to the and the European Economic Community. was The Government has decided, in circumstances where the cashflowposition of cattle producers has been seriously affected by rising costs and declining markets, to introduce a number of new proposals designed to ensure the long term economic future for cattle producers. be Unfortunately, at thetimethe Budget was forit seemed that these measures would not be necessary but circumstances have changed. do We believe that there are now for many of those in the cattle producing area quite serious decisions for them to take if they are to survive. It is in those circumstances that the Government has Actbrought out this supplementary package. The beUeves the last three years of dislow prices aggravated by difficulties in access achieving market access through political imposed in a number of our principal markets and aggravated by increasing costs in within Australia has placed cattlemen among the least fortunate income earners in the Australian community. Cattlemen have neither the advantage of indexation of their returns nor insulation the against either accelerating domestic costs or extensive industrial disruption as it affects their In these circumstances the Government has decided to implement a number of new prounique posals designed to assist them in the short through improving their cash income and by suring that those least advantaged have access adequate credit faciUties, and in the longer by adjustment to marketing procedures and examination of the processes of handUng and selling to facUitate longer term stabUity. The measures are as follows: Firstly, accelerated carfurther cass classification has been a priority in forward planning. It is seen as a means of better promotstill ing quality differentials not just for the producer but also for the customer and certainly in the different market and price opportunities the producer. The benefit is seen as also enabling a better product identification for disease control and for factiitating processing in each of its different phases from the farm gate to the prices butcher's counter. Funds are to be made available initially to Australian Meat Board and, after proclamation, to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporfor ation to meet contingencies infinalisingcommertification cial development of the system and to ensure form: there are no delays for completion of the six trial programs installed around Australia and financed by Commonwealth and State funds. Including this expenditure, the Government wtil provide up to $6m towards the capital cost of implementing carcass classification in beef cattle meat chains. It wtil do aU possible to ensure, after the commercial viabtiity of classification is estabUshed, that there is no undue delay in its implementationSecondly, in recognition of the nature of the brigalow lands settlement scheme, and the ticularly serious ptight of these settlers, the Commonwealth has contacted the Queensland Government to modify the settlers present repayment obligations. The Commonwealth has proposed that, together with the Queensland beef. Government, a moratorium be extended to setassociations tlers on the repayment of theirfinancialobliules gations flowing from their settlement on holdthe ings in this region to achieve, according to need, an average 2-year moratorium period. The ComIt monwealth Government has also offered to extend the Queensland Government's term for repayment of Commonwealth loans by a further seven years. In so doing it has asked the Queensland Government to extend this extenwhich sion of terms of repayment to the brigalow settlers. The Government realises that the difficulties experienced by the brigalow settlers have placed them in a possibly worse situation than any otherrelated cattle producer around Australia. This scheme is in that the brigalow scheme was initiated term after thorough examination and support for its eneconomic viabtiity by the Bureau of Agricultural toEconomics. The downturn in market circumterm stances and the timing of the advances made to settlers have prejudiced this assessment and the Government beUeves it therefore has a unique responsibUity to these settlers. It believes this assistance wtil ensure that this most beneficial of recent closer settlement schemes can fulfil original expectations and more importantly settlers in the brigalow region can look forrelating ward to a further period within which to to establish their holdings. Thirdly, the Prices Justification Tribunal wtil be requested to estabUsh whether a case exists for the Tribunal to inquire into the justification of for beef marketing and processing in the various parts of Australia. In order to facUitate the this preliminary inquiry the suggested terms of reference the Government would have in mind a definitive examination by the Prices JusTribunal would be in the following already (i) To document the price margins that apply through the various beef marketing channels in the different parts of Australia. (U) To report on the extent to which the various beef marketing and processing charges can be justified in the Ught of the levels of domestic and export prices for meat and the resources required to process and market beef. par- (iii) To report on the advisabiUty of such charges being the subject of regular examination by the Tribunal. Fourthly, the Government is concerned about the manner and form of the present marketing of It is aware of initiatives sought by producer to introduce minimum price schedand stabilisation schemes. It is concerned at extraordinary variability between returns in different regions and for different types of cattle. wtil, therefore, enter into discussions with State governments and the industry on the ways by which a weight and grade selUng system for cattle could be introduced throughout Australia. In this respect it wtil examine the means by marketing costs for cattle could be reduced, the benefits which mightflowfrom carcass classification in its use to minimise price increases in present handling systems, the degree to which livestock selUng might be better corwith meat sales, how disadvantages in present livestock marketing systems might be overcome and the possibiUty of the introduction of a price stabilisation arrangement, probably of a buffer fund character. Fifthly, the Government has decided that it should urgendy initiate discussions with State governments and authorities responsible for rural adjustment to ensure the terms and conditions and funds avaUable for carry-on loans for beef producers are adequate to meet the financial needs offinanciallydisadvantaged producers and see whether household support is adequately avaUable to those cattlemen whose income is so low that it does not even equal the level of Commonwealth unemployment benefits. Sixthly, to improve the immediate cash flow position of beef producers the Government decided it will introduce a cash grant of $10 a head for a 12-month period for beef catde, excluding dairy herds, for a number trol processes, or for the speying of young beef and move: heifers. The subsidy will be limited to $2,000 a producer; partnerships and companies wtil be treated as single identities. The disease control measures wtil include berculosis testing, bruceUosis vaccination testing, and, where none of these procedures relevant, then other recognised necessary cattle management procedures such as dipping drenching. In this way producers throughout Australia wtil be brought within the ambit of the scheme. The alternative speying subsidy will be avaUable for the speying of heifers up to 2 years of age. The scheme wtil apply as from tomorrow, 23 September 1977. It will take some weeks to finalise administrative arrangements for the lodgement of claims. In the interim, producers undertaking any of the approved procedures ing should keep a proper record and have it authenattempt ticated by a government official, veterinary titioner, or other responsible person. Finally, the Government recognises that are particular problems which affect those who are producers in the more remote and isolated pastoral zone and which are different from those of people Uving anywhere else in the Australian continent. These people frequently Uve many miles from principal communications and cerwool tainly from market outlets. In order to ensure that there is no critical disadvantage from situation and recognising the contribution these people make to settlement in ctimaticaUy difficult areas of Australia, the Government is examining those Government imposts which prejudice their present position to see whether they can be tantly, adjusted to bring these people to more relative equality with the position of urbanised Australians. I should add that the Government believes that responsibUity for assistance to particularly seriously anected producers Ues also with State governments. It would expect State governments to undertake a simUar examination of thencharges to ensure that they too do not unduly disadvantage one section of Australians as against another. In embracing these proposals the Government would, in particular, like to commend the responsible range of proposals made to it by a large number of parliamentarians in this Parliament from country areas as well as the several well documented submissions received from major producer associations. I commend these measures to the Parliament. I has present the following paper. Beef Industry-Additiona l Assistance-Ministeria l Stateof disease conment, 22 September 1977 That the House take note of the paper.",71
149,Mr KEATING,BEEF INDUSTRY,"After tuweeks and weeks of build-up, meetings with the and Cattlemen's Union of Australia and subare sequently the Australian Wool growers and Graziers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat and Producers Federation and the Australian National Cattlemen's Council, the Government has managed to devise a higgeldy-piggeldy program in an attempt to assist the Australian beef industry and to take the heat off itself. The greater part of the statement which the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) has just made represents a series of statements which have very Uttle to do with the particular problems confrontthe beef industry. It is a vaUant and desperate by the Minister for Primary Industry to pracjustify this Government's generally abysmal record for its traditional supporters. It lists a series of items, some of which are involved with there primary industry but many of which are peripheral to the interests of the beef industry. The Government has neglected to state that it was the Australian Labor Party Government which introduced thefixedfloor price scheme for and committed in excess of $400m to the wool industry. It fails to state that it was the ALP this Government which introduced thefirstsubstantial increase in the first advance payment to wheat growers. It fails to state that it was the ALP Government which introduced the first special loans for beef producers. Most imporit fatis to state that the income tax averaging measures arose merely out of the thorough misunderstanding and confusion about the Government's measures. The Government has not handed out $100m vaunted to primary producers; it has merely prevented worse deal the Federal Treasurer (Mr Lynch) from collecthas passed on ing an additional $80m from the section of primary industry. aThe mary industry which is fortunate a taxable income. The measures which were lems of primary industry,unions announced in the Budget, the income equalisto ation deposits and the proposals which the MinAnnual Convention in Sydney when heRetailers ister has announced on this occasion will be of very little or no assistance to any primary proineffective ducer, but more importantly to any beef cattle was producer who does not have, and has not had, a problems, positive income over the last two or three years. ling authorities It is all very well for the Minister to talk introduction of the 40 per cent investment ance. But that has been of no assistance to very large sections of rural industry which have incomes below $5,000. It has been of benefit only to those who have had substantial positive incomes and have been in the fortunate position of expanding their operations. Mr Speaker, we have some silence in the chamber, please? Government supporters-We can hear you.",75
150,Mr KEATING,BEEF INDUSTRY,"If honourable members want to talk, they should go outside.",76
151,Mr SPEAKER,BEEF INDUSTRY,Order! The House will with remain silent. ,76
152,Mr SPEAKER,BEEF INDUSTRY,Order! The honourable member for Barker will cease that unseemly conduct.,76
153,Mr KEATING,BEEF INDUSTRY,"The entirety of this benefit probably confined to the wheat and grain tries. It is also ridiculous of the Minister to about the private company retention allowance from 50 per cent to 60 per cent when in this year's Budget the rate of company taxation increased by 3Vi per cent. In addition, the Government will continue to collect quarterly payments and this will have a substantial influence in rural areas which depend upon seasonal returns. It is also ridiculous to talk rural industry obtaining considerable advantage from indexation of the valuation of trading stock. In one particular case-the wine industry-th Government has declined to amend section of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the indexation of the valuation of trading stock unavailable to this very important Australian primary industry. It is also very doubtful if primary producers, other than the large corportrust ations, can take advantage of this provision. The Minister has also talked about increases in funds to the States and to local government, but he has neglected to indicate that the much new federalism has in fact resulted in a for the States and, as a consequence, great deal of pressures to priMinister seems to take great enough to have delight in blaming trade but for all the probagain he has failed repeat the statements he made to the blamed management for many of the problems faced by primary industry. If the Minister honest, he would recognise that many of the particularly in abattoirs, grain handand other rural service organisabout ations, are due as much to defective manageallowment as to union militancy. The Minister also failed to mention that it was the Opposition which proposed substantial amendments to the Austrahan Meat and Livestock Corporation which, if they had been may agreed to by the Government, would have gone a long way to fulfilling the requirements of primary producers. Instead, the Minister in his usual prevaricating and obtuse manner rejected a reasonable approach and has opted for confrontation. He is presenting the results of that confrontation in the widespread dissatisfaction his Administration amongst most sections of primary industry. It is absolutely certain that he will go down in history, particularly in the history of Ministers of Agriculture, as one of the least competent ministers. I now turn to what the Minister describes as is the measures to assist beef producers, and I indusrecommend that every producer should read talk very carefully page 8 of the Minister's statement because, in the first place, it makes the extraordinary claim by impUcation that the newly was appointed Minister for Special Trade Negotiations (Mr Howard) is Ukely to obtain some tax concessions for Australian primary products in his negotiations with the European Economic Community. I have no hesitation in saying that about the entire exercise of the appointment of the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations is a slap in the face for the National Country Party. One e would have expected that the Minister for Over3lA seas Trade would have been empowered and have had the capabUity to negotiate with the is European Economic Community for access for our primary products. However, apparently the many Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) does not the National Country Party with this sort of exercise. It was also pertinent to note that during cent visit to Australia the British Minister for Agriculture, Mr Silkin, made it abundantly clear that uranium would not be a negotiating weapon. He in fact indicated that most European countries could not care less whether the uranium was mined or kept in the ground. This leaves the Minister for Special Trade Negotiations with very, very little to offer the Europeans and with the increasingly irrational protectionism of the Prime Minister and his henchmen, any European concessions for access to that market, particularly for beef, is highly likely. I would go so far as to predict also that over the next three years the Special Minister for Trade Negotiations will return empty handed from Europe. But then again the Prime Minister has a Sir Robert Menzies obsession with everything west of the Suez and has forgotten that the most important and expanding markets he immediately to our north. Or is it that the Prime Minister delights in being rude and precocious towards our major trading partners? The proposals which the Minister has set out in his statement are basically long term proposals. He says that on his own admission. There are very few measures which will enable beef producers to obtain immediate benefit and a number of the propositions are so vaguely couched that they will be overawed by administration difficulties and potential disagreements with the States. There are other parts of the proposals, such as the reference to the Prices Justifisame cation Tribunal, which are a window dressing job, because in 1973 the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Prices, dealing with prices in the beef industry, reported quite thoroughly on the matters which are now the subject of terms of reference to the Prices Justification Tribunal. There are other measures such as the introduction of weight and grade selling on which the State governments are way ahead. These comprise weight and grade selling and general proposals for the improvement of beef marketing. The proposal for spending up to $6m on the capital costs of implementing carcass classification is a measure which had been put forward by the Labor Party earUer this year and repeated again in May. There is no assurance in the terms of the Minister's statement that the introduction of beef carcass classification is any closer than when the Liberal-National Country parties started to react to rural pressure. There is no indication as to the costs involved and the precise amounts which wtil be payable to the brigalow settlers. I presume that some specific arrangements must be reached with the Queensland his reGovernment. It would be interesting to know whether those specific arrangements have been determined already. Probably they have not. The only other measure which involves the expenditure of Commonwealth funds is that which readily assists the cash flow position of beef producers. The Opposition certainly supports any measure which would improve disease control processes but has strong reservations about the proposal to spey young beef heifers. If for no other reason, if the Government's rejections and statements about the future demand unfor beef are correct, the Australian beef cattle herd could be lacking in calves and quaUty in future years. The Minister has not set out the administrative arrangements. Is it to be done by the Commonwealth, or by the States, or in conjunction with the States? While he says it wtil apply from 23 September 1977, are the payments to be retrospective and is a subsidy up to $2,000 for each producer sufficient to get the producers out of trouble? I would contend that it is not. WhUst the Opposition does not object to the proposals the Government has put forward, it believes it is too little too late; it beUeves these proposals have been devised only because of immense electoral pressure resulting from tremendous dissatisfaction with the Government in rural areas. The Government is paying the penalty of trying to pander to the mining companies and manufacturing industries and at the time trying to maintain its traditional electoral base. Desperation is now the keynote of government policy in the rural area. It is using any measure at all to take the heat off itself and to secure a short term reprieve so it can sneak back into office for another term. If rural industry knows what is good for it, it wtil trust the Government no further. Given the Government's performance, who could blame it? Debate (on motion by Mr Bourchier) adjourned. NA",76

156,Mr ELLICOTT,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do claim to have been misrepresented. In the course of a debate last night on the suspension of Standing Orders, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G.

I point out that the pleadings have been concluded. are about half a dozen cases already been set down for trial. The honourable gentleman went on to say: Now there are about half a dozen causes set down for trial. You will understand, Mr Speaker, that I am used to being attacked by the Leader of the Opposition, and I would not have troubled to make this personal explanation had it not been for the fact that, as I read the Hansard report of last night the House and you did take certain decisions based on what the Leader of the Opposition said. I shall just repeat what he said: The matters have been set down for some months. As I understand it, he was referring back to the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) had said at page 1428 of Hansard. He said: I take a point of order.

As I understand it, the honourable gentleman was saying that there were actions which were set down for hearing involving himself and the Ausapart tralian newspaper. I hope I did not misundera stand him, but that is how I read the Hansard report. I wish to say this in explanation: On my information there are a number of matters relation to which the honourable gentleman has sued the Australian newspaper, and one or more of them may arise out of a document similar the document which was in this House last night. I say also that on my information, correct, none of those matters has been set down for hearing.

May I say, first of all, Mr Speaker, that there are no vacancies in the Supreme Court of the Austrahan Capital Territory. The fact is that there are three appointed judges - Mr Justice Fox, the Chief Judge, Mr Justice Blackburn and Mr Justice Connor. Mr Justice Fox has been overseas for reasons well known to the Leader of the what Opposition and to honourable members. Mr Justice Blackburn is about to go or has gone on sabbatical leave.

Whilst I was in Washington in August I met Mr Justice Fox. I arranged to speak to him when returned to Australia, as he did yesterday. Of course, I cannot speak to him now officially, but I am sure that my successor in office will speak to him about the matter. There has been no dereliction of duty on my part. Vacancies have not been filled because there are no vacancies to fill. Quite from that, it would not possibly have been dereliction of duty on my part because these matters are not ready to be heard. The fact is that the matters are still awaiting replies to be filed, as in I understand it, by the honourable gentleman through his solicitors. When that is done, these matters can be set down for trial. I am speaking to now of the matters against the Australian newspaper. As I pointed out, the Leader of the which I hope is Opposition said: there are about half a dozen causes which have been down for trial. to Of course, I was most concerned when that allenot gation was made. According to my information, it is not true. I feel it my duty to bring that to the attention of the House. If the honourable gentlehas some explanation, I hope he wtil make it to the House.

NA NA NA Ministerial Statement",79
167,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"by leave - To o often people Uving in the more settled areas do not reaUse the size and isolation of parts of Australia. I have seen atfirsthand the urgent for, and am aware of the enormous cost involved in, bringing-the provincial cities and remoter areas of Australia into closer contact with our capital cities. People who have chosen to Uve and work in these areas are entitled to the same considerations from the communications point of view as those who choose to Uve in capital cities of Australia. I have also on many occasions reminded honourable members and Australians generaUy of the Government's firm commitment to improve telecommunications and broadcasting facUities in rural and remote areas of Australia. Honourable members need no reminding of the inadequacy of radio, television and teleforce phone services in these areas. Australia is a large continent Its distances are vast. The current terrestrial systems to take these services throughout Australia is enormous and in some instances difficult to justify. Australia is, howment's ever, not alone in striving to obtain improved communications faculties throughout large areas which comprise dense and very sparse popuopportunities lation. Opportunity and technology now exist resolving these deficiencies and providing new and exciting prospects to enable a fuller and ter Ufestyle for aU Australians. Overseas experiGovernment ence, particularly in the United States and Canada, has shown that a domestic sateUite system can provide services reliably and economically. The Government recently received a report from Australian ConsoUdated Press Ltd titled 'The Opportunity for Television Program Distrithis bution in Australia Using SatelUtes'. This report discusses the domestic sateUite systems of North America and suggests an opportunity for equaUy advanced services in Australia. The report presents a plan for a sateUite service to distribute television programs simultaneously throughout Australia. It also points out that other improved services become possible if adequate capacity exists. I refer to instructional television, health care by telemedicine, long distance telephone trunk calls, closed circuit television and digital data transmission. The report proposes estabUshing a nationportunity wide television network distribution system. adoption of such a proposal might well mean major revision of the television broadcasting quency plan' to accommodate additional rebroadcast transmitters. It could mean a reastheWhUst sessment of future terrestrial systems. The Government has therefore that this report should be subject to a detaUed whether Australiastudy investigation. A task force comprising officers from the tal and Telecommunications Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of fence, the Department of Transport, the Ausstand traUan Telecommunications Commission and not the Overseas Telecommunications Commission the will be estabUshed. The Australian broadcasting industry will be involved; technical experts from Australia and overseas will participate; and Papua New Guinea and New Zealand will also be invited. The terms of reference will include evaluation of benefits and costs and an examination of the imptications for the structure, ownership and control of the Australian radio, television and broadcasting industries. The task wtil be given up to six months to prepare its report. It wtil be responsible to me as Mmister for cost of using Post and Telecommunications. The decision is an indication of the Governintention to positively assist people in the provincial cities and in rural and remote areas whtie at the same time offering new and exciting to people in the more densely for populated areas. The Government, in deciding to move quickly on this matter, hopes that the betdecision wtil bring private industry and the together in another co-operative undertaking for the benefit of aU Australians.",79
168,Mr CHARLES JONES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"by leave-The Opposition is quite happy about the study being conducted, but there are a number of things which the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) has not done in case. Firstly, what has happened to the Australian ConsoUdated Press Ltd report? Why can honourable members not have that report? Why could it not have been tabled tonight with the statement so that aU honourable members and the community as a whole would have been able to assess its relative merits? Not only the Packer Press but also the Fairfaxes, the Murdochs and the Ansetts wtil be interested in this matter. The Fairfaxes, the Murdochs and the Ansetts are very substantial subscribers to the election campaign funds of the Liberal and National Country parties. What is wrong with their having some opto see what the report contains and to The make a comment? I have no objection to the a tabling of the report. Let us have as broad a frestudy as possible ofit. we are talking about reports, I ask why telecommunication commissionedhas Minister not tabled the report that was by the Labor Government when it decided was ui office. A was conducted to consider would put up a satelUte of its own, whether we would be whoUy, solely and Postotally responsible for it, whether we would go into partnership with the Japanese or whether Dewe would join with Indonesia which I underput one up recently. AU these things have been spelt out in the Minister's staf""""-nt It is obvious that this is all part of the Government's election campaign. It is reminiscent of Menzies' leadership in 1963 when the Parliament was bombarded with aU the goodies about the place. The Minister for Post and Telecommunications has now been the Minister for 20 months. Is it the Packer Press which stirred him? Why did he not do something about the report commissioned by the Labor Government? I think it was started by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) and finished by Senator Bishop who was his successor as Postmaster-General. The Liberal Party is not the only party which is interested in satellites and what is being provided. I understand that the report which was brought in during the term of the Labor Government made certain recommendations on the timing of putting up a satellite. People who are interested in this matter have been making inquiries of top engineers in the Australian Telecommunications Commission. They want to know what has happened to the satellite. They have been told that it will not be ready for a while. That is why I compare thistimeof the year in 1977 with thistimeof the year in 1963 when old Ming was running the show. If honourable members opposite are happy with the Dunstan result, we are deUghted, and we will be happy to have an election. Nevtil Wran is having a look at one also. Mr O'Keefe-Nifty Nevtile.",80
169,Mr CHARLES JONES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"That is right, Nifty Nevtile. He is too smart for the Liberal boys and they know it. I am not so much concerned with what the Minister has said in his statement; I am more concerned about what he has not said. Mr Cotter-Did you hear it?",81
170,Mr CHARLES JONES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"I read it. I admit that I had difficulty in reading it. It took me all the dinner break to read the two and a half pages of it. What I am concerned about is what was not said in that statement because the things that have not been said are the things that I think should be concerning all Australians. If we are to have a satelUte at least let us have the best lite and let it be made avaUable for public study, not just for an internal departmental study. ",81
171,Mr CHARLES JONES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"It is not a question of for how long we want to go. If we are putting up a sateUite it wtil be up there for some considerabletime.They do not cost 2Vic each; they are an expensive exercise, and I think that the best possible facUity should be provided. I would also Uke the Minister to teU us the differences between this satellite and the one with which the Overseas Telecommunications Commission is associated. I believe that the one in which it was interested was lost in the Indian Ocean. Mr Eric Robinson- A partnership one.",81
172,Mr CHARLES JONES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"It was a partnership one. Is it proposed that this satelUte wtil take in overseas telecommunications? WUl it become a replacement as a navigational aid for the Omega system? If it is proposed to replace Omega- I am asking these questions purely and simply because the Department of Transport is mvolved in this interdepartmental committee-wh y is the Minister for Transport going ahead with Omega? I repeat, I am concerned with the things that are not in the statement. I think that the Minister should have been saying a Uttle more about the cost of this proposed satelUte. Nofigureis mentioned in the statement to indicate whether it wtil cost $10 or SlOOm. Perhaps the statement was prepared hurriedly and it was not known what the cost would be, but I think that at least the Minister could have paid honourable members the courtesy of giving us some indication of the approximate cost of it, even if itfinishedup Uke the cost of the F111 s. I want to know whether it is proposed that other commercial television channels wtil have access to it or whether only the Packer Press wtil be associated with it. These are the things that have not been explained by the Minister in his paper. I ask that, before it goes any further, the reports that have been presented to the Minister by ConsoUdated Press and the report which was prepared for the Australian Labor Party Government should be tabled in the Parliament so that honourable members will have access to those two reports, so that they wtil have some knowledge of them and at least be in a position in which they can make some judgment instead of being served up with a paper such as this. I was advised at about 6.5 p.m. that the statement would be made at 8 o'clock. It is true that the Minister gave us the two hours notice required. I am not bitching. This is a very technical piece of satelpaper. The Minister obviously does not know anything about it himself. Mr MCLeay-He is no orphan in that case.",81
173,Mr CHARLES JONES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"He is no orphan; that is perfectly true, but at least if we had the benefit of the reports that are available we could obtain technical advice, just as he can obtain technical advice as to what is the best system to adopt and what is the best way to go about it. We have people on our side of the House here who are just as technically equipped as the people who assist the Minister. Mr Cotter-You are well equipped, are you?",81
174,Mr CHARLES JONES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"They may be technically equipped in all sorts of ways. I do not wish to make any further comment on this matter but I hope that the Minister will at least give some serious consideration to the points I have made with regard to making available to honourable members the reports involved. URANIUM-AUSTRALIAN POLICY Ministerial Statements Debate resumed from 14 September, on the motion by Mr Sinclair. That the House take note of the papers. Upon which Mr E. G. Whitlam had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' stituting the following words: 'This House rejects the Government's precipitate decision, without sufficient public debate in Australia and negotiation overseas, to renew the mining and export of uranium (a) commitments by customer countries to apply effective and verifiable safeguards Australian uranium from peaceful nuclear purposes to mUitary nuclear purposes. (b) intemauonal safeguards which will ensure that the export of Australian uranium will not contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increasedriskof nuclear war. (c) procedures for the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes which will eliminate wastes to human Ufe and the environment; and (d) adequate measures to safeguard the environment and nauonal parks and protect Aboriginalrightsand interests.'",82
175,Mr BIRNEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"Having at the opening stages of debate on thefirstFox report, it now gives me great pleasure to re-enter Australia this debate in its concluding phase. Many ercise speakers, both in this House and in debate across the nation, have attempted to give the uranium issue a moral perspective. I believe it is proper that such attempts should have been made, and it is to this question that I seek to address remarks. In order to understand whether it is the Government or the Opposition that is morally make correct in its nuclear policy, one has to examine nuclearitssafeguards motives. The motive of the Government in its premature painstaking deliberations over a nuclear policy implicauons has been to make the right decision for Australia only and the world. In particular, great regard has been given to the questions of Aboriginal rights, the safety of mining and milling, the operation reactors, reprocessing, enrichment, disposal of waste products and the spread of nuclear weapons. In the context of Government motivation and the moraUty of the decision to niine and export, I seek to canvass once more the question of nuclear proUferation. In the last year attention to the possible spread of nuclear weapons has been gaining increasing predominance both as an aspect of the nuclear debate and as a world issue. It is right that this should be so, and I am proud that Government members had given this matter the vital attention it requires. Late in 1976 a report of the authoritative Stockholm International Research Centre stated that within nine years 35 nations wtil possess the capabUity to produce their own nuclear weapons. Nonsignatories of the nuclear Non-ProUferation Treaty included in that group were Pakistan, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Cuba, Spain, Egypt, Switzerland and Turkey. In such a context the survival of mankind might seem a daunting prospect. be omitted with a view to subNever has the world had to meet such a grim threat. Few nations have a greater responsibUity to meet the challenge than has Australia. An by Australia in the absence of: article in the National Times of 30 May to 4 June this year stated: against the diversion of Uranium could be the issue on which Australia wields more influence in the world than ever before. I tell aU honourable members and the people of Australia that that statement was supported to the hilt by the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) when he said: any danger posed by such In Brussels, London, the Hague, Paris, Rome and Bonn, as well as in Moscow, I consistently asserted Australia's wish to develop her own enrichment capabUity so that as much uranium as possible should be exported in an enriched form. spoken He then went on to say: The obvious interest shown throughout Europe in as a supplier of uranium suggests that we shall exconsiderable influence in this important area. Who knows, we may still achieve a bipartisan poUcy on that. The same moral motivation was mherent in the speech of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) to this House on the safemy guards policy on 2 June when he said: Surely there can be no doubt that, if Australia were to uranium resources avaUable, the strengthening of would be enhanced. The possibUity of development of the plutonium economy, with its for nuclear proliferation, could be avoided. It is by acting now that we can contribute to long-term global stability. Again, the theme was clear in the speech of the of Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). In his speech to this House on the day of the Government's policy announcement, he said: Far from hindering the cause of non-proliferation, uranium export, subjea to the fullest and most effective guards, will place Australia in a position to help the developsupply ment of an increasingly effective non-proliferation regime. It represents a consistent moral approach to one of the most crucial tasks any Australian governWhat ment will ever tackle. Let us make no mistake. The Carter initiatives deserve supporting. are currently facing their greatest challenge. the United States of America, the Senate has voted to keep ative the Clinch River demonmotives. stration fast breeder reactor project and the Barnwell reprocessing plant. In Europe, France years and West Germany have signed an agreement actors. on the development and construction of fast will breeder reactors. By making a determined in conjunction with the United States and The Canada, remembering that Australia and these two countries hold more than reasonably assured reserves of uranium we can foster the peaceful development of nuclear energy as the principal solutions to the world's curthat rent and foreseeable energy problems. What is just the international alternative? It is a world of the darkness, industrial dislocation, famine and stuff poverty. Having mentioned the moral approach of this on Government and the Carter initiatives, I would material, also Uke to make a brief reference to the Canadian stance. EarUer this year, Canada froze uranium exports to Britain, West Germany, Italy and Japan pending the negotiation of stronger agreements on safeguards. Speaking at a Press conference in April, Prime Minister Trudeau said: To us, the danger of nuclear proliferation tant than economic advantage. Thus the Federal Government's reasonable apWhere proach is clear also in the Canadian attitude. stark contrast stands the approach of the tralian Labor Party while m government. That poticy was motivated by a grubby desire to make a quick buck whatever the national or national consequences may have been. Let us look at the facts of what it said. Even before took office in 1972, we have the words of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member Adelaide (Mr Hurford). He said: Uranium exports, in whatever form could be highly fitable to this countiy. With the proper taxation policies, there could be enormous economic benefits for eveiyone who Uves here. The theme was well developed by then Minister for Minerals and Energy made a statement to this House deaUng with Northern Territory uranium. On 31 October 1974, he said: which My purpose in this statement is to outline the Government's program for the rational development of uranium resources in the Northern Territoiy: A program which will safereturn substantial economic benefits to Australia from our of this vital energy resource to our overseas trading partners who face such grave difficulties in securing their energy requirements. of the daddy of them aU, the current master of pious pontification on the uranium issueThey the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr In Keating). I know he would Uke to forget, but let me remind him of his previous money-grabbing In government he said to this House: So we have another 40 years of production, another 40 ofpower to be supplied by conventionally enriched reThere is no reason why the price of uranium will not keep escalating and there is no reason why this Government not allow a maximumreturnto the people of Australia stance and the uranium producers of Australia. golden gleam in his eye did not dim with the passage of time. Just pnor to the elections in half of the world's 1975 he said: We are prepared to give the Japanese any amount of fuel they need, enriched if we can do so. The only thing is that we would Uke to do the enriching. Instead of sending yellow cake at bargain basement prices we want to get profit that comes from enrichment. We do not want the to be sent to the United States or the Soviet Union or any place else where Japan may choose to have it enriched. A good offer is before Japan. It can come in with Australia enrichment if it wishes. If it wants to wait until we develop the technology and secure the capital, as we have the raw it will wait too long. The Japanese should get off their tails and move into this undertaking. His present rantings on a moratorium are a prostitution of that policy. He changed and did a complete about face - not because he was interested in the health and prosperity of all Australians but because he knew that if he did not he would be out on his ear, stripped of his position is more imporas spokesman on minerals and energy, beleagured and berated by those of the Left. was their concern then for mining safety? In Where was their concern then for reactor safety? AusWhere was their concern then for the safe disposal of waste products? Where was their concern then for their moral obligation to help preintervent the spread of nuclear weapons? I put it to honourable members that such it issues to which they now adopt a hoUer than thou attitude were lost in their desire to finance their for own socialist extravagances which were bankrupting this nation. How different their polproicy is now. In Perth, in July of this year, the Opposition placed an indefinite moratorium on the mining and treatment of uranium in Australia. Delegate Holding told the Australian Labor 1974 when the Party conference: It means that any company, national or international, wants to involve itself in a mining process or export of uranium as from this date does so at its ownrisk.Such company being told quite specifically and quite categorically what the view of this movement is, if it decides to enter into any contractual arrangement, then it does so at its own risk. Any such arrangement will be repudiated by a Labor government and the loss will fall where it Ues. And so, in a sham 45-minute debate, one of the great poltiical hypocrisies of our time was perpetrated. How hoUow now seem the words of those honourable gentlemen opposite whUe in government. In 1974, the then Minister for Minerals and Energy said: We, on taking office, assured Japan that we would contracts entered into right the election despite the fact that the contracts were excessively low prices. Demands have been made Queensland Mines in particular to try and panic Japanese. We have assured them that delivery will that we have the stocks to make these deUveries and the stocks are at Lucas Heights at the present time. We vide all commitments up to 1980 out of these stocks. Again, the honourable member for the same day said: Those contracts are gomg to be met to the letter the Australian Government has cisions of one Australian government have to be upheld by the next Australian government. Notice Labor supporters do not talk these days ago by about honouring commitments. On the contrary, Whitlam). they wiU dishonour them - to Australia's everhad to speak lasting shame. What in fact has happened is that that in this Parliament, the Opposition has replaced its profit motive of bers on the Governmentwhen government years with a new motive. No this side, the Government should 36 wonder the people of Australia will never again great point out of the fact of not being repose any confidence in the Labor Party. bers of the Labor Party are determined to breed favour the Government by 2h to one. fear into the hearts and minds of Australians over the uranium issue. The desire to obtain quick dollars has been replaced with a desire to truly. acquire quick votes. If they are genuinely concerned about dangers in uranium mining or Government export now why were they not concerned in 1972,1973,1974, or 1975? After the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the genuine concern of people over nuclear wastes and nuclear proliferation members of Opposition have decided to set themselves up as peddlers of fear. They have embarked upon one of the shabbiest, immoral political tactics of time. They must stand condemned by the tralian people and exposed for the hypocrisy their attitudes in this Parliament. In an article in the Sydney Sun on 15 May about 1977, the Leader of the Opposition wrote a column headed 'The Crime of Mining Uranium'. dred There has been only one crime committed on the bate uranium issue. Both in government and in oppothe sition, the Labor Party has preferred expediency humbug, as its poUcy motivation to honesty and intermissible toifuse national obligation. The newest member of this crime syndicate is its own President, Mr Hawke. Speaking at a Press Conference earlier this month in which he announced the decision of the Executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions to caU a referendum, Mr Hawke said: We are getting closer and closer to blood on the streets of Australia on the issue. What an appalling, irresponsible statement from this man. Let there be no mistake about this ACTU poticy resolution. It is a cunning of Labor's fear campaign. The greatest hope the honour Labor Party has of whipping up fear and violto within a couple of months of made at ence is for it to pit Australian against Australian by in a referendum in which it would manipulate the genuinely worried buttil-informedvoters with its be made, new found nuclear Ues. The Government has can propulled the political rug from under Mr Hawke by its recent announcement that there will be no Blaxland on referendum on the issue.",82

Uranium is one of the great emotional issues confronting the country at the moment. In fact, my colleague the Opposition Whip gave me all a transcript of a telephone interview with Ralph AusNader that was broadcast on the Australian of Broadcasting Commission's program AM on 21 July 1977. One of the things that astonished me given that interview was that consideration was to what may happen in a couple of hunthousand years. The prolonging of this deand what has been said in it ignores what may happen in this country in the next 20 days, next 20 months, and the next 20 years. It is I may say so.

Ito would be quite happy if an honourable membermentdone on the Government side stood up now and not, and gave the moved that the question be put. Candidly I would welcome it. I do not think there is anythe thing left to say that wtil divide way or the other. This is a serious issue. What Leader of the Opposition put in his amendment was that the House should reject the Governmore ment's precipitate decision without there having been sufficient pubUc debate in Australia. Surely this is what we ought to be arguing about. all respect to people Uke Nader, I do not think the issue is what might happen in 200,000 years.doubt Unfortunately, mankind has not got, and never has had that sort of perspective. I doubt if at stage mankind has had an issue quite as divisivebut, and, in a sense, quite as decisive in the ultimate as the one that now faces us. I am not one who believes that uranium should be kept in the ground. In a sense what we are arguing about is not what is in the ground what we shall do with what has already been taken out of the ground. I would have hoped thattried Australia was a sensible and rational economic community and that we might have acknowl1939-1945. edged that with nuclear energy there was a rospect and a hope of redressing the balance change. etween the haves and the have nots. On the other hand, I would not suggest that those who already have nuclear power or the disposition use it are the ones to be most trusted with it. In my view we are being very pious in suggesting that we can be the arbitrators about the future use of uranium. I have Uved long enough to see technological changes in my Ufetime from boyhood to now. I now, have seen things that have astonished us. I haveHe no doubt that changes will occur in the next years. It may well be that what is now caUed uranium wtil be synthesised. I do not know, norranged does anybody else. When the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) arranged that splendid presentation of something Uke 30 documents reI think he was in a sense saying that he friendhoped the matter would be debated. With aU respect, I suggest that we want a different sort of debate from what is taking place in this House. I hope that what is being done here wtil be teras early as possible. I hope that we are going to get any more of this kind of nonintosense in the months ahead; that we have to match every one of the Governments speakers when it has two and a half times as many to do job anyway. Why not have three speakers in a row from the Government side before one of the Opposition members speaks rather than try make cheap poltiical capital out of the issue, as was side the other evening when the Governhad speakers and presumably we did impression that it was keeping debate going. Surely that makes a mockery of either side one a parliamentary system. the One of the things that disturbs me in what is increasingly becoming a secular society is that and more people are claiming moral justification for certain actions. I suppose that immoral justification would be the opposite. WithCandidly, I do not know how one judges the relativity of these sorts of things but there is no that mankind has the opportunity of destroying substantial parts of society. Hopefully anynuclear power will be used for peaceful purposes deplorably, there is the possibUity that it may be used for non-peaceful purposes. I am not too sure that that has not always been the case in the last 60 or 70 years, given the relative developments of various parts of the world. Gerbutmany sought to control the world by nonpeaceful means in 1870 and almost did so. It again, almost successfully, in the period from 1914 to 1918. It tried again in the period Certain places Uke South Africa still use mUitary power to sit on sensible poltiical I suppose that one of the greatrisksof nuclear power is that some small power, given the opporto tunity, can start something that wtil not stop where it starts. This is one of the sad facts of history. I had the pleasure the other evening of going to a lecture in Melbourne given by Professor Dahrendorf. He is a German of origin. He suffered under Nazi persecution in the 1930s and in a sense, is grandly a citizen of the world. said that he deplored the fact that his countiy 25 of birth, or that part of it to which he still subscribes-Wes t Germany-ha d recently arto sell to Brazil the potentiaUty to develop nuclear power presumably for destructive as well as peaceful purposes.

Has it not always been that those should have done what they said they would do when they were under no pressure changed their time. minds when the circumstances changed? One has only to consider what can happen at the end of a football match or at the end of a session in a or the way in which this House occasionally move: erupts, to realise that rational decisions can go out the window. It is rather sad to think of what will come into the vacuum. Surely that is what is involved in the use of this metal or element. I not know the answers and I am not too sure that anybody else here does. I get a little tired of who I claim have no more expertise in this matter than I have pontificating to me about what scientific or physical realities are. We find intruding into the debate now even the suggestion that the mere mining of uranium is dangerous. The mere mining of coal, copper, lead or zinc can be dangerous, but nobody seemed to have the same reservations when ment's those metals first began to be mined. We all would be safer at the weekends if no motor cars were driven on the roads; but is that a rational approach to the problems of society? Surely, occasionally we have to reason together. I submit that there are not the differences between the two sides in this House that are indicated in the procedures that we low. I do not think that there are the divisions within the community in relation to this matter which it is said there are; but asking questions, questions which increasingly it wtil ask in relation to many other matters. It is the people of the world and their health and welfare that are at stake. I suppose that most of us read many years ago the famous story all called Thais. It was about a man who could have done a job in a certain place but thought that great task was to go and save a courtesan in another part of the world from the fate worse than death; but he inherited the fate himself. There is a great deal to be learnt from that: Physician, first heal thyself and, society, first solve the problems on your doorstep before you try to solve everybody else's problems. Australia in many respects is in a unique position to suggesexemplar to the rest of the world on many of problems; but, from what I have seen in this Parhament yesterday in particular and to some extent in the debate on this question, we do not show ourselves as being very fit to be an example to anybody.  honour them? LANDS ACQUISITION AMENDMENT BILL 1977 who Bill received from the Senate, and read a first Second Reading",86
183,Mr STREET,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"Corangamite-Minister for pub, Employment and Industrial Relations) (8.45)- I That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Bill is to extend the Lands do Acquisition Act 1955 to the external Territories of Australia, to enable the Commonwealth to acthose quire land in those Territories for its purposes under the same Act as applies throughout the the rest of Australia. Honourable members will be aware that it is the intention of the Government to establish an animal quarantine station in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Honourable members will also recall that in a Press statement dated 16 June last the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) said that it was the Governpolicy to own all land on which its facilities are located. Discussions will be held in the near future relating to the purchase of land for the quarantine station and, as necessary, the purchase of other land in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This amendment to the Act will provide the necessary machinery for compulsory acquisition should a negotiated settlement not be possfolible. In such circumstances the amendment will allow the owner of the land-the Clunies Ross Estate-recours e to the courts for fair and just the community is compensation. The Lands Acquisition Act provides that all acquisitions carried out by the Commonwealth shall be on just terms, in line with the provisions of the Constitution. At present the Act appUes in of the States, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory but does not apply in his the external Territories of Australia. All owners of property should have the same rights and the same obligations when the Commonwealth acquires their land. This Bill provides that the Commonwealth's acquisition powers, as well as its obligations when acquiring real property, apply universally within Australia and all its Territories. The Act contains provisions safeguardbe an ing owners' rights. Parliament is empowered under the Act to void a compulsory acquisition if it seesfit.Formal processes are laid down for tifying owners of intended acquisition and rights and obUgations after land has been acquired. The Act also lays down the right to compensation, rights to arbitration and to ment of compensation by the courts in cases of disagreement. The Bill makes special provision for landowners in the external Territories, isolated from the Australian mainland, to deliver claims, notices or other documents to a local dress rather than to the address of a chief propSimUarly, erty officer on the mainland or in Tasmania. commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen) some adjourned. URANIUM-AUSTRALIAN POLICY Ministerial Statements Debate resumed.  whether Australia should supply uranium to overseas countries has been wide and far rangBearing ing. Both sides have thrown up evidence which they suggest supports their claims. At this stage of the debate I do not want to repeat or to incorper porate in Hansard more statistics; rather I want to get back to what appears to me to be the basic question. I do not beheve that there is a member of this Parliament who would suggest that the world is not facing an energy crisis. Most people recognise that, on current informadon available, about midway throught the 1980s the world decomes mand for oU will be greater than the supply new discoveries. Therefore, one of the most important energy sources on current estimates will begin to dry up. Of course, this will not pen overnight; it could be over a matter of ades. However, the problem begins to become evident. Let us look for a moment at the situationmiddle closer to home. The Minister for National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Anthony) mentioned in his speech at the less ANZUS Conference in September of this year in relation to Australia*. The only major shortfall in supply of energy sources the next 10 years will be in crude od. He went on to state: Individual States may suffer shortfalls in other fuels. Queensland is having difficulties with natural gas supplies, New South Wales and South Australia could also experience natural gas shortfalls in the late 1980s are discovered in the Cooper Basin. Already my own State of South Australia has had to import oU to supply a major proportion its major energy requirements. However, it is clear that in total we have an excess supply of ennoergy resources for our current and foreseeable of the needs. One of these resources is obviously uranium. Looking at the problem narrowly, one fan-can say that we have enough energy in Australia, assessthat we will be okay for a goodtimeyet and therefore we are in a very good position, so the Opposition argues, to make other countries change their ways. We and the energy deficient countries are aiming to conserve energy and to aduse the known existing sources more effectively. those countries, together with us, are I endeavouring to develop new energy sources such as wind and solar power. However, it appears at this stage that those alternatives are distance off. Therefore, what do the energy deficient countries use for power when the energy resources start running out and technological advances have not uncovered new sources? The Opposition seems to argue that whtist there is a risk, however sUght, involved in the sale of our uranium, we ought not to proceed. in mind that it wiU take some years before the newly mined uranium is actually exported and, further, that we possess about 20 cent of the Western world's known reserves of low cost uranium, what then is the sort of judgment which the Opposition is asking us to make? What are the alternatives? Is the Opposition really suggesting that we can sufficiently retreat to a less energy reliant state of existence in the time avaUable before the energy crisis becrucial? It is hard for Australians to underfromstand how the people in New York, Chicago, London, Paris and Tokyo-an y of the large capital cities-woul d feel if they could hear the Oppohapsition arguing that we should withhold an energy decsource from them? Let us take as an example a person who lives in a 15-floor apartment in the of New York. Can we really say: 'Look, I am sorry, but because there are somerisksin using uranium, and even though therisksmay be than those in driving a motor vehicle, we are not supplying you with this basic source of energy. You wtil have to walk up the stairs and not use the Uft. You wtil have to open a window and over not use the air conditioning. In fact, we strongly suggest that you move back into the country to Uve'? That is a fairly emotional example but Already surely that is what a real energy crisis is about. It is not a crisis when it starts to affect the money in people's pockets. It is a crisis when it starts to if no further reserves affect people's Uves. of It is hard for us in Australia to understand such a situation. But the question must arise as to whether we really have therightto refuse to supuranium, ply an energy source demanded by an energy deing ficient country when such an energy source is in excess of our own demands. On what basis does the Opposition say that we can decide how to source an energy supply for a certain country better than that country can decide itself? fessor Titterton, Professor of Nuclear Physics the Austrahan Nauonal University since 1950, a letter to the Canberra Times in September this year, stated: Twenty countries already have nuclear power stations and are steadily increasing their investment in this vitally important power source. A further 14 are currently building their first nuclear station. All have looked at the waste problem and have decided that it poses no impediment to the development of the nuclear industry. Does the small Australian anti-uranium lobby believe that it knows better than these 34 governments what is best for their peoples? The Government has made a well argued thoughtful decision incorporating the most stringent safeguards yet produced to control the future mining and sale of uranium anywhere. As I understand the situation, at the present time there are some 184 nuclear power units in operation in 20 countries. In all there are about 500 nuclear power units either in operation, under construction or onfirmorder in 34 countries. We are not looking at an energy source which some countries may want in the future or may be reliant on in the future. People are already reliant on energy that is generated by these power plants. The question then arises, even if the Opposition's argument is accepted: What do we achieve by refusing to supply uranium to the rest of the world? Would our non-supply mean that people would be more alert to the problems and dangers inherent in the use of uranium? I read from thefirstFox report. In itsfinaljudgment on rnining and milling it states: The hazards of mining and milling uranium if those actividetermine ties are properly regulated and controlled, are not justify the decision not to When referring to the dangers inherent in conversion enrichment and fabrication it stated: Hazards to members of the pubhc in the general ment arise at all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. few problems seem likely to arise from conversion ment or fuel fabrication plants. Dealing with reactor safety the report stated: The hazards involved in power reactors, if those operations are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision mine and sell Australian uranium. Finally, dealing with the problem of radioactive Iation waste disposal it stated: While we do not think that the waste situation is at present such as to justify Australia wholly refusing to it is plain that the situation demands careful watchand, depending on developments,regularand frequent assessment. Clearly, the Fox report does not support the Opposition. I quite openly admit that the storage of the waste products does concern me. However, I Proquote from the Austrahan Atomic Energy Comat mission's journal of July 1976. An article by in Messrs Alfredson and Levins, dealing with the of waste disposal problems, states: Many methods for ultimate disposal have been proposed, but many nations consider that the best policy for the near term is interim storage in man-made structures at or near the surface of the earth. 'Engineered storage', as this approach is called, has the advantage that continuous surveillance can be maintained and solid wastes can be more easily cooled at a time when the heat generation rate is greatest. It also has the advantage of providing more time for detailed evaluation of the many options available for elimination or ultimate disposal of wastes. The article goes on: All the necessary technology is available for constructing and operating a retrievable storage facility for periods of up to 100 years. In the United States, assuming storage in water cooled ponds or air cooled vaults, the land requirement for a retrievable surface storage facility is estimated to be 40 hectares up to the year 2010. Similarly in the United Kingdom it has been estimated that, in the year 2000 when three-quarters of their electricity will be generated by nuclear power, the total land area occupied by interim liquid storage tanks and ponds containing waste canisters will only be 1.7 hectaresThat is about two acresabout the area of two football grounds. The end of the report states: Storage of high activity liquid wastes in tanks of modern design is safe and satisfactory in the short term until facilities for solidifying waste and engineered storage are constructed in the 1980s. The required technology is already available. This interim solution will provide up to 100 years for extensive assessment and evaluation of the wide range of permanent solutions which have been proposed in order to the most acceptable method for ultimate disposal. such as to The Fox report and the information from the develop Australian uranium mines. Australian Atomic Energy Commission do not the seem to support the Opposition's call for a suspension of the reintroduction of mining and environexport of uranium. Perhaps the other factor I However, should mention is whether our refusal to export enrichwtil prevent proliferation. The Ranger inquiry in its first report stated that proliferation was the most serious danger in the nuclear industry. It the ordinary operation of nuclear was also stated in the Fox report that if Australia were not to export her uranium, this would have not to little if any impact on the projected expansion of the nuclear power industry. If we did not export, doubt that we would reduce the risk of proliferat all. There is also the very serious consideration as export to whether a decision not to export uranium could indirectly increase the threat of proliferexport ation. If we do not supply uranium, particularly if this puts upward pressure on uranium countries desperate for energy could well intenthoroughly. sify their research on the fast breeder reactor fuel reprocessing. Such a premature move towards the plutonium economy would increase very the risk that plutonium would hands and possibly be used for weapon making. The fast breeder reactor is a great deal more bate efficient than the conventional thermal reactors relation now in use. It enables about 50timesmore ensale ergy to be extracted from uranium than does the Prime thermal reactor. As a major proportion of the thinkingMinister, plutonium produced is suitable for ing, a move to the plutonium economy would ergy Commission was on the wayAtomic add to the risk of proliferation. I understand that Chifley Government was defeated inwhen at present there are no commercial fast breeders in operation, but demonstration reactors are stage operating in France, the United States of was America, the United Kingdom and the Union of tralian Soviet Socialist Republics. Finally, I turn to the safeguards. Quite frankly, I believe an effective Opposition would be ergy endeavouring to suggest more effective solutions developing if it believed that our policy did not go far enough, rather than merely offering blank tions. The Government's 11-point safeguard policy is extremely comprehensive. As far as I am The aware the Opposition has not suggested an exploration, alternative. Of course, it did put up a proposal use originally but our safeguards go beyond those ative suggested by the Leader of the E.G. Whitlam). The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry identified a number of defects in the then existingsafeguards safeguard arrangements. The Government has be overcome these in its safeguard policy by rubbish introducing measures going beyond existing multilateral safeguard arrangements. The ask Ranger Inquiry said, and the Government has agreed, that it is both essential and possible make safeguard arrangements more effective. The Government's safeguards policy does just that. The world requires and demands our uranium. I believe that in the present circuming stances we would be acting irresponsibly if did not supply it",86
184,Mr STEWART,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"As soon as the Part Government made its precipitate decision to clear weaponry. mine and export uranium the whole purpose of this debate was lost. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry was set up by the Labor Government to investigate the safeguards and requirements that would be necessary if Australia were to enter into the mining and of uranium.

At no during the years has the Labor Party been against nuclear technology. The policy which formulated in Perth this year by the AusLabor Party National Conference includes the following: To this end Labor will establish a National Fuel and EnCommission to assist the Australian Government in and implementing a co-ordinated fuel and energy policy. The Commission will, together with the Department of Minerals and Energy, provide the Australian rejecGovernment with expert advice on energy. Fuel and Energy Commission will:. . . monitor the development, transport, price, marketing and of energy hydrocarbons, fissionable materials and generwater, with the object of achieving the best energy balOpposition (Mr ance for Australia. The only thing that we have done during the whole of the debate on nuclear energy in Australia has been to insist that environmental and normal safety procedures should well and truly estabUshed-that the waste, the that lasts for years and years, should be disposed of with safety to the community. AU we now is that this Government establish those safety factors. I remind the House that in 1969, to with a loud blast of trumpets, an announcement was made that a nuclear prototype reactor would be built at Jervis Bay. I note the honourable member for MACKellar (Mr Wentworth) is paydue attention to me. I remind him that m we 1953 and 1954 he wrote a couple of pamphlets entitled 'Time and the Bomb' and 'Survival is a of Defence'. At that stage the honourable member for MackeUar was a proponent of nuIn 1969, when the Jervis Bay prototype reactor wasfirstmentioned, it was the Labor Opposition which insisted that environmental aspects of the disposal of waste should be very thoroughly examined by the then Government. In order to prove my point, let me quote an answer given on (e) tion 19 August 1970 by the Minister for National Development to question No. 1191 which I had asked. It appears in the House of RepresentaThat tives Hansard for that date at page 253.1 asked: Will he make available the cal, (ii) hydrological, (iii) hydrographical, (iv) meteorological, (v) ecological and (vi) environmental investigations carcial ried out at each of the sites considered for the building of nuclear power station, and (b) ability of each of the radioactive and thermal waste reactor. The Minister for National Development, Mr poison Swartz, replied: The reports to which the honourable member has referred are confidential studies by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the Electricity Commission of New South Wales prepared for management. Secrecy shrouded every move in the proposed development of a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay. Tne same secrecy, the same evasiveness, the and half truths are still around now when we talk about nuclear power and the mining and export of uranium. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) talks about the disposal of waste and says that technology has been developed. But cannot give one instance of that technology being commercially viable at this stage. Let me revert to 1969 because I think that many honourable members in this House and many people in the media ought to direct their attention back to the years between 1969 1972 to see just how consistent the Labor has been in its poUcies on nuclear energy in Australia. I repeat that at no stage have we in ourtake. poUcies ever been opposed outright to the development of nuclear technology. Because of the reluctance of the Government in provide the community with information about nuclear technology at Jervis Bay I moved, during reactor consideration of the estimates for the Departof plutonium ment of National Development on 1 October basic 1970, the following amendment: That the proposed expenditure be reduced by $10 instruction to the Government that a select committee House should be appointed to inquire into and report on the uses of nuclear power in relation to(a) the projected power needs of the Commonwealth; (b) the comparative advantage derived from generating power in this way as against all other sources being employed; (c) the effects of the estabUshment of a nuclear station upon the environment; (d) administrative procedures and regulations adopted elsewhere to lessen any undesirable effects eration of such a station to ensure the utmost uon of members of the public and the nauonal interest; and the desirabiUty of establishing a nuclear power staat this time pending the outcome of funher technological developments taking place elsewhere. debate commenced in this House at 1.14 a.m. I was joined in the debate by the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) who said: reports on the (a) (i) geologiThen and only then will our people be informed of the crumatters relating to the degree of radiation emissions, and a their possible effects on health and the environment, and the site to dispose dispersal of radioactive wastes. from the proposed He went on to say: Thirdly, the concept of the tolerance dose of radioactive is developed. The first step is to determine what dose of poison converts humans immediately from vertical to horizontal positions where they remain. This, of course, is above tolerance, so the dose a little lower than that, perhaps five times lower than a lethal dose is prescribed. He went on to talk of the dangers of radioactive waste and radioactivity generaUy. This was an important debate-at least according to people it is an important debate now-o n nuclear power nuclear technology. It took place in this Parliament at 1.14 a.m. because even then the Government of the day, which was of the same poltiical complexion as the present Government, had no idea at all of and no interest in the he national welfare of Australia or, indeed, of the world. The Government parties were looking at the topic then in the same way as they are looking at it now: Get it out of the ground, sell it, and hang the consequences. But they should always remember that the most important commodity and on God's earth is the human being-ma n and Party woman. The Government cannot take the risk with nuclear technology that it is prepared to The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) also spoke in that debate. In his speech 1969-70 to on 1 October 1970 he said: I think it has been fairly well canvassed that the CANDU using natural uranium fuel produces quite an amount 239 which is the material used to make a very dirty bomb. A duty bomb is one that throws off a lot of radioactivity. Of course, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating when we see the type of reactorfinallyselected. as an It was because of the efforts of people Uke the of this honourable member for Hawker, the honourable member for Blaxland, the late Rex Connor, former Senator Don WUlesee that the then Government, which was of the same poltiical complexion as the present Government, cannow celled the development of the prototype reactor at Jervis Bay. The excuse given at that stage was power that it was economically not possible to do so; but $3m had already been spent by the Government in developing that project. The real reason of the opthat Prime Minister MCMahon, the Prime Minisprotecter of the day, cancelled the project was that the experts-the same experts who are being quoted now in relation to the disposal of nuclear could not decide on the type of reactor that required; did not know what environmental effects it would have on Jervis Bay; had where the waste was to be disposed of. The projSpeaker. ect was cancelled for the very simple reason that nuclear technology was then, as it still is now, dangerous concept. It is all right for the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) to shake his head, but I remind him that it was governments of a political complexion similar to his that many of our young boys and girls into war. The Holt. present Government is doing the same sort of thing in relation to nuclear energy. But the Government is not perturbed about the after effects that could occur. I reiterate that at no stage has the Australian nation. Labor Party been totally opposed to the developLet ment of nuclear technology, nor has it been opposed to the nuning or export of uranium. We United insisted in 1969 that a select lished. We established the Fox inquiry in order radiation had said to find out the dangers associated with the development of nuclear technology. This Government, in pursuit of the almighty dollar, makes a decision and announces in this House that this is all going to happen.

201,Mr HURFORD,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"Nobody else takes the honourable member for Holt (Mr is a Yates)-the temporary member for Holtseriously so I am unlikely to spend anytimeon his intemperate- I hope that is therightwordin outburst tonight. I support the amendment. Unfortunately, there are enough differences between the two sides of Australian poUtics without our manufacturing differences which do not reaUy exist. I believe that there has been somedishonest in some attempts by Government supporters-w e have just heard one of them-to widen the uranium debate away from the fundamental issue of safeguards. In my contribution to debate tonight I want to differentiate beSo tween what is real and what is manufactured I know, they about these differences. Firstly, I shall indicate the points of agreement us. I take as my text the statement of the lisPrime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) issued on the afternoon that the Government's decision was announced. To use his own words I say yes, arour decision must be motivated by a high sense line of moral responsibiUty, not only to all AussectraUans but also to the community of nations. On It my side of politics we believe the sort of Une we are taking does just that. I say yes, there are four fundamental considerations. The Prime Minister mentioned four, I have some others. But I agree that his four are fundamental when considering affairs. They are Usted in his statement. Firstly, there is the need to reduce the risk of nuIt is clear proUferation. Secondly, there is the need to supply essential sources of energy to an energy world. Thirdly, there is the need to proour environment in which mining wtil take place. Fourthly, there is the need to ensure that proper provision is made for the welfare and interests of the Aboriginal in the AlUgator Rivers region and all the living in the regions and working in projects. I agree with those four fundamental aims. In my view there are more than those four. I would have to add to those four fundamental considerations thatfifthly,there is the need to ensure satreisfactory disposal of waste, particularly the highly dangerous long life plutonium. Heaven knows why this was not included in the Prime Minister's list of fundamental considerations. Sixthly, there is the need to safeguard the transport of that plutonium free from terrorist activity when it is moving from one part of the world to another. I shall continue with my list of areas where there is general agreement between the parties. Much of this debate has been taken up with manufactured disagreements. There is, in my view, an inevitabihty that nuclear power generators will be needed at least between now and the end of this century if the developed world is to maintain its standard of living and if the under developed world is also to be developed. I cannot be so idealistic, as much as I would like to be and as much as I applaud those who choose the alternative lifestyle, as to beheve that developed people will voluntarily and peacefully allow their lifestyles to be reduced without enormous problems even though there are grave and risky costs for them in pursuing the nuclear path in order to obtain their benefits. I have visited Sweden and Japan, among many countries. These are the two countries mentioned by Sir Macfarlane Burnet. I have talked with senior officials about their options just as I have talked over these serious problems in Brussels, Paris and London with a fraternal Labour Minister in London, a great friend of mine who happens to be Minister for Energy in England at present.",93
202,Mr YATES,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,Wedgwoo d Benn.,94
203,Mr HURFORD,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"It is not Wedgwood Benn. The honourable member for Holt of all people ought to know that he is Secretary of State for Energy. Dick Mabon is Minister of State for Energy. I have been to Washington and Ottawa. I have spoken to people in all these places. That is not an exhaustive list. All these countries and more have a commitment to nuclear power. Certainly, there is a pause and a rethink at the same time. There is a realisation that some of the grave problems have been taken too lightly in the headlong rush to nuclear development. Certainly the international economic crisis which has overtaken the world and the increased technical problems associated with nuclear reactors have reduced the present demand for nuclear generated electric power. It is my honest conviction that without some almost miraculous technological breakthrough which we cannot envisage at present, the increasing commitment to nuclear power will continue, although it will slow down. If only some patently knowledgeable and impressive person would tell us that solar energy and/or wind power could take up the slack. Unfortunately I am convinced that this will not happen. Sometimes Sweden is cited as an example of a country where there may be a change of heart. Regrettably I have to point out that this is not so. Only two parties campaigned at the last Swedish election for the termination of nuclear development-the Centre Party, formerly known as the Agrarian Party, and the Communist Party. As I understand it, both lost votes. The Centre Party is now in power only because of the gains of the Swedish Liberal Party with which it is now in coalition and which did not oppose nuclear power. Let me continue with the litany of where there is agreement-wher e we do not have to manufacture disagreement-betwee n the Government and the Opposition on this issue. Yes, it is so that uranium development would in the long term have some significant economic benefits for this countiy. The honourable member for Phillip (Mr Birney)flatteredme by quoting me tonight on this subject. I do not resile one bit from what I have said. It is a question of timing. We are not suggesting for one moment, in advocating a pause, that there would not be a long term gam if we went in for uranium development. None of the economic spokesmen has suggested that. But there is no immediate economic gain in any way in rushing headlong, without a pause, into nuclear development. It is a grave deception to give the impression that this development will be of much use to us in the immediate future. I do not deny that there are some who have sincere doubts about that long term economic development, but I have placed on record what is my feeling and I place it on record again in this House tonight. I repeat that when we are discussing this subject in the Austrahan Labor Party it is not on the economics that we are pushing our advocacy, it is on the moral issue. Let us focus on where the differences are rather than manufacture them and have a false debate on this issue. Although the Gregory thesis has applied in the past-namely , that the success of the minerals export has led over the long term to a growth in our reserves, which led to an upvaluation of our currency, which itself had adverse effects on our other exports and on our import competing manufacturing industries- I do not believe that we can be sure that this will happen in the future because in the future we will have enormous balance of payments problems relating to the import of crude oil. We are going to need our export industries to save us from grave balance of payments problems and the consequent decline in our currency value. But that is not to say that we are going to need the uranium industry. This argument appUes to our coal exports any others that we are lucky to have in this country. I repeat that this is an argument about moral issues, about safeguards, and that is the argument should have been focused if this debate tonight and on previous occasions were dinkum. Instead of that the House has had to ten to ridiculous and insulting outbursts such the one we have just had to listen to from the honourable member for Holt. Mr Bob Gregory of the Australian National nal University makes the point himself that his valuall of these able work is an analysis of the past, not a prethankful for scription for the future. More than this, I repeat that a Labor Treasurer would all our mineral exports from all our successful industries to redistribute in this country into help the ordinary people of our nation whose quaUty of Ufe we are determined to improve. summary of what I have said to date is that the strategies of both sides of this Parliament- I refer particularly to the statements of the Prime Minisproliferation, ter-ar e the same on fundamental issues. The Prime Minister left out a couple of things that think are enormously important but I cannot agree with his long term strategies. There is to it than just that. Labor wants to see moral sponsibUity. We want to prevent nuclear proaims liferation. We recognise the need to supply an energy starved world with the valuable resources we possess. We want to protect our Aboriginal people and our environment. Most of us think that there is a regrettable inevitabtiity about the development of nuclear power and most of us recognise economic benefits which can in the long crue from the successful development of aU our mineral exports, not only uranium. take credit, justifiably, for persuading our poltiical opponents to share so many of these objectives which I have articulated. If we taken the stand which we have taken, with the help of a valuable conservation movement in this country, I assert that the Liberal and National Country Parties-and unthinking people such as the last person who involved himself in this debate-woul d have rushed headlong into for developing our uranium industry in this country without thinking about safeguards, without reports such as the Fox report, without taking trouble that has been taken. I give credit for trouble that has been taken to this point of time. The Prime Minister quite rightly paid tribute to Mr Justice Fox and his coUeagues. They to opened our eyes. Particularly they opened the eyes of our opponents. It is a tragedy that the Fraser Government has not accepted all of the and Fox Commission's recommendations. For instance, I believe that there are good economic as well as environmental reasons for sequential where development, as Mr Justice Fox and his commissioners recommended. But at least something has rubbed off-the bilateral agreements with at lisleast some safeguards; at least some government as participation in the Ranger venture, however halfhearted that has been; and at least some protection for the environment and for the Aborigiwe people. I give some credit where it is due but say that it has not gone far enough. However, things are pluses. At least let us be some Fraser Government Uke the taxes from enUghtenment. It is grossly misleading for Labor's political order opponents to manufacture differences where they do not exist. There are some differences and The I must outline them. Some of them are differences of approach and some are differences of tactics. They relate to the likelihood of nuclear to the inadequacies of high level plutonium waste disposal and to the dangers of I terrorist activities in the transport of plutonium disaround this globe. They address themselves to more the behef that the Fraser Government's tactics reare wrong, in order to achieve the fundamental outlined by the Government itself. Labor believes that there is a vital need for a moratorium now to enable far greater international activity now and in the near future to increase the safeguards. Because we possess 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the world's known uranium resources and because we are making economic sacrifices the valuable and can be seenrun ac Mr CLYDE CAMERON - Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to order. Can you do something to muffle In fact we that Cambridge accent?",94
204,Mr HURFORD,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"He is not worrying me, so had not please do not worry about him. We are in a strong position to influence the rest of the world to make our planet a safer place. That is what we ought to be doingrightnow and with a lot more fervour than we are showing. No one wants our uranium at aU desperately at least the next eight years. We have seen work such as that of Mr Ken Davidson just recentiy. Until 1985 there is no immediate need for our the uranium. There are no immediate economic the advantages for us which wtil help us out of our deep economic recession in having such uranium developmentrightnow. So let us apply ourselves the need for upgrading the safeguards. I indicated earlier that 1I have had the opportunity to travel the world and to discuss this vexed subject. My conviction is that the International Atomic Energy Agency itself is not satisfied with the standards which have been set down. Its poUcies are influenced by the numbers game. A number of its members are developing countries which believe that increased safeguards, with the earth resulting increased costs, are a developed rich any sort man's plot to deny energy resources to the that is not poorer men of this world or at least to make beings are manifested those resources most expensive. This we must want to keep it free fromwith overcome. It can be done only by energetic, suasive, proselytising activity. This is what ought to be doing in the international forums of sands of years and I venture to suggestfor this world. We have good alUes. I mentioned that I had years. discussed this subject recently in Ottawa and I drew to the attention of the House the fact that that there is a moratoriumrightnow on exports of continue uranium from Canada to both the Euratom Party in opposition countries and Japan because they do not think and we heard with has that the present safeguards are satisfactory and the honourable member for they are looking to this country to be an ally in that it had an entirely different ensuring better safeguards.",95
205,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,Order! The there honourable member'stimehas expired.,96
206,Mr GRAHAM,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"I rise in this debate this evening to support the Comenough monwealth Government in its decision in relaabout tion to the mining and export of uranium oxide. do so in the hope that the Government will, in responsible and proper manner, develop throughout Australia during the next decade a strong nuclear power industry. I hold the view that some of the references made by my sociaUst friends on the other side of the Parliament are almost impossible to answer. Having followed the tortuous arguments that have been put forwhich ward I will endeavour to answer some of the Sydney. remarks that were made by my old and respected friend, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean). The honourable member talked about nuclear power in the hands of the wrong people. He talked of small counwhether tries. He became fearful of the fact that small countries might be responsible for the creation of war. The idea came to my mind that he because countries were small they were likely be irresponsible. In order to support his argument the honourplace able gentleman referred to a great and powerful country. He said that Germany was involved wars in 1871, 1914, and 1939. So, this argument did not relate to small nations; it related to great and conquering nation. The honourable member made very little reference to what pened in the Pacific in 1939 and 1945. He Australia pointed out that we were incUned to be moralistic in our arguments and he said so in a tone of disapproval. He talked about a secular society. In that respect I am incUned to agree with him. I think the greatest single poUutant on this is mankind. I see no particular danger in of natural production, in anything at all through mankind. Human what is wrong all this earth. If we form of danger we perhave to get rid of all human beings. we have been generated by human beingsPressures thouthat the same situation will exist for the next million I have no doubt that the pragmatism in poUtics has manifested itself over recent years will to manifest itself. The Australian Labor one series of arguments, great clarity from my friend, Lang (Mr Stewart) series of arguments in government. Mark you, I must say that have been occasions on which I think the same criticism could be leveUed at the Liberal Party and the National Country Party. But on this occasion in this debate I think it is fanto point out that everything that he said the development of the Australian Atomic I Energy Commission, about the speeches of the a late Rt Hon. J. B. Chifley when he was Prime Minister in 1947 and about development plans for the Hifar reactor are perfectly true. To the best of my knowledge, having sat at that time with the former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, no harm has been caused in Sydney as a result of the existence of the Hifar reactor is just outside the southern suburbs of Subsequent to the explosion of an atomic bomb in South Australia, people from the South Australian Government set out to discover any UI effects could be detected. To the best of my knowledge one of Mr Dunstan's Ministers is on pubUc record as saying there is no evimeant dence to support such a contention. to The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) talked about making the planet a safer and the development of the nuclear industry within Australia. He referred to the nine in reasons given by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the Government's decision a and said that by and large he tended to agree with most of them. I think most people in this hapHouse would not quarrel with the fact that has an obligation to provide the rest of the world with a vital source of fuel and energy. Most people here are aware of the fact-this is constantly referred to-that our great trading partner and main customer is Japan. We people say, in an economic sense, that if Japan gets an economic cold Australia is likely to get pneumonia. Therefore it is vital for a developing country which has an enormous capacity to that Australia will guarantee it energy sources, is in our interest to do so. It is also in Japan's interest that we cany on programs that have emerged over recent years. It is in both our interests that an understanding is developed tween our two nations so that we can look fortries. ward to the future with confidence. With its nulUons and mUlions of people, Japan suffers an urgent reaction if it faces a recession. At present, 9414 per cent of Australians are employed, SVi per cent are not. Therefore it easy for us to understand that there would be much worse reaction in that country if we were deny it energy sources. If we did so probably very quickly suffer enormous levels of unemployment. It seems to me that, ifwe are to talk about the so Mr for need to make the planet a safer place and most conference Opposition speakers keep coming back to this mando withone problem-w e must face up to the fact that first of aU assume that Australia is not one of the countries that wtil be is deaUng have a certain able to contribute a great deal in this respect. Nations that are well along the nuclear include Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria and Canada. I went over one of the Canadian power stations at Lake Erie in 1969 when I was member of an Australian parUamentary delman egation to that country. That situation was well on the road to completion at that time. Other nations that are operating nuclear power stations include Czechoslovakia, France, West Germany, East Germany, India, Italy, Japan, The 1914-18 Netherlands, Pakistan, Spain, Sweden, SwitCzechoslovakia zerland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Are these nations to be considered sinister because they are prepared to use nuclear power? Are they to be condemned because fact that they have adopted a policy that wtil duce this sort of energy? I think not. I think Australians must be pragmatic. They must understand that this is a world situation and rational, responsible and adult thing to do is participate in a rational and responsible manner. If we are to say our best customers 'go elsewhere chips. to get your uranium oxide', I imagine that a large owerful country Uke Japan will do exactly F think there might be some people in Tokyo would get out their Uttle black book and put couple ofticksagainst us and say: 'Well, there wtil come an opportunity one of these days for us to remind them that you have given us unhear friendly treatment on this matter'.",96

208,Mr GRAHAM,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"'Settie the account', is a fair know enough expression.

Mr Chipp-As Chamberlain did with Hitler. nuclear Mr GRAHAM-The honourable gentleman arefers to the British Prime Minister and the GerChancellor of 1939.1 would simply say this: The British Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister were pragmatic people. They were aware of the fact that they would be able to avoid an international war such as the one in if they were to sacrifice the people in and Prague. The answer is this: The Czechoslovakians did not rate enough to prevent the arrangement at Munich, and Daladier and Chamberlain were signatories to it. They believed at that time, and the House of of the Commons believed at that time when proChamberlain came back to London, that we that were going to have 'peace in our time'. It was more than 12 months before it was quite clear the that there would need to be a war. Anyway, conto ferences have nothing to do with uranium oxide, any more than they have to do with fish and that, Mr YATES - Chip s is over there. who Mr GRAHAM-That was not a personal a reference to the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp), and I beg his pardon. These problems for Australia are largely manufactured. I take the view that the great majority of people believe when they elect a government in this country that it will act in a responsible way. When the nine reasons set out for proceeding with the contracts for the export of uranium oxide are clearly understood the people will accept them. I am not sure whether it is the Leader of the Labor Party who talks to the President of the Council of Trade Unions with one cap on or vice versa; but, when we hear people who hold responsible posiuons talking in terms of violence in the streets, demonstrations and things Uke that, it makes us realise that there measure of irresponsibility. There should be a recital of the facts as given by the honourable member for Lang. The view of the Labor Party when in government should be identified. The unfortunate decision in human history. 1971-72 to discontinue the reactor program ought to be reversed at the earliest opportunity. The fact that it was going to cost in the order $ 1,000m was rather forbidding. That is a forbidpotential dingfigureat this time. However, in a country that has a gross national product of more than $ 100,000m, as this country has, it seems to that we ought to be able to pursue this developappalling mental policy and as quickly as possible get to the stage where we can do some of the enrichconsumption ment in this country. If we do that, the return terms of economic benefits to the average AusUttle traUan wtil be immensely greater. There is no doubt about that. I believe that one of the other comments of Labor Prime Minister of 1949-that the hip pocket nerve was a very sensitive nerve-wa s wise and sagacious. I frankly think that the age Australian is more interested in that sort wisdom and sagacity than in a lot of the emotional claptrap which is being uttered about uranium and which could lead to which any reasonable and respectable person would be thoroughly ashamed.",97
209,Dr JF CAIRNS,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES," I think that the average Australian whose morals are in his hip pocket has an excellent spokesman in the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr matter, Graham). Uranium is the basic stalling point of poUtics in Australia. It is the main difference poUtics between the Government and the Oppoupon sition and in any radical sense it is the only difference that there is. It is the test of every social question, as was the war in Vietnam 15 years ago. But it is a more comprehensive and penetrating test than even the war in Vietnam. world. The war in Vietnam seriously caUed into question the whole of that society which was capable of waging it. Uranium does that in an even deeper and more comprehensive way. The threats of uranium and its uses demand a replacement of the whole materialist, mechanical, scientific, consuming society and its contradictory and inhuman values. The muting and export of uranium means inevitably the proUferation of thermo-nuclear bombs. The proliferation of thermo-nuclear bombs means inevitably the use of those bombs. The use of those bombs means inevitably the destruction of all or a conis a siderable part of humanity. Those who accept the mining and export of uranium-the whole process of it-ha d better face up to that point to begin with. Acceptance of the process of uranium and of thermo-nuclear bombs, which are an inevitable part of it, is the ultimate insanity of The mining and export of uranium involves a of process which cannot safely be coupled to the for human violence that actually exists m the world today. The statistics of human violence, even in the least violent countriesme Australia is one of them-ar e increasing at an rate. The statistics of violent cnme has doubled in about 10 years. The statistics of the of violent drugs, especially alcohol, in have doubled in about 10 years. There is very opposition to the violent drugs; it is the nonviolent drugs to which there is opposition. The statistics of violence in road accidents have doubled in ten years. For the number of younger the people who enter universities in Australia, a similar number each year enter psychiatric hospitals or undergo psychiatric treatment, and averanother similar number enter gaols where they of spend most or all of their Uves. No society that produces these statistics of violence can be trusted with the most violent force of allviolence of uranium and its products. The mining and export of uranium involves a process which threatens the destruction of all forms of Ufe on this planet. Why do I say that? I say that because there is an inevitable link between the disintegration of thefinestparticle of the nucleus, and the disintegration of the finest particle of life, the molecule. The disintein gration of the molecular structure, or pressure it, involves cancer and perhaps mutations. There is no safe level below which we can be sure that cancer and mutations do not result from the nuclear process. They have resulted already in tens of thousands of cases in the contempory",98

It demands much more than that. The existence of the threats uranium demands a new society. It involves radical change in the basic values of those societies which have produced uranium and made it into a threat to human survival. These basic values are mechanical materialism, objecsociety tified non-human science, and religions whose are supreme or sacred value is externalised above and outside human life. Materialism produces acquisitive, self-centred people and the false lief that more money means more happiness. produces, using the expression used by the honourable member for North Sydney, a society in which morals are in the hip pocket. The belief that economic growth is essential for social politics, progress and must inevitably produce it, which as central to Marxism as it is to capitalism, false and has been proved to be false.",99
214,Mr BAILLIEU,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,By whom?,99
215,Dr JF CAIRNS,TELECOMMUNICATIONS PURPOSES,"Materialis m is idolatry and is shared by the honourable member wealth. It is the worship of things instead of Ufe. Human happiness and social progress depend not upon economic growth and more money People within industrial production and social relations but upon a change in industrial production and social relations. Human progress does not dethe pend upon more economic growth and more ures money within the existing set of social relations; it depends upon a change in those social relation. tions. Objectified non-human mechanical science is the science which beUeves that the discovery truth depends upon the exclusion of human feelation ings, that truth is not the result of feelings human experience but of some logical and mathconsists ematical process from which human feeling is excluded. This is the science that produced conseek centration camps, gas ovens and human experthe iments. It is the science that produced psychiatric gaols for poltiical prisoners. It is the science that produced napalm and electronic warfare in Vietnam. It is the science which in the decontamination chambers and steel claws of nuclear power plants hasfinallydehumanised industry. is the science that will eventually justify the use The nuclear of thermo-nuclear bombs. An essential part of the basic values of these which have produced uranium and the which possesses and sacredit value threat of consists of religions whose supreme is externalised above and out the supreme or sacred of a society does become external to life it is easy to treat human Ufe as and to destroy it. If one's religion saw the sacred or supreme value to be in human life how one tolerate the extinction of mUlions of people in gas ovens? How could one tolerate the of acceptance of thermo-nuclear bombs as a legita imate means of defence? No, the existence of uranium demands not only its rejection as a source of energy but also a replacement of the basic values of the acquisitive violent, predatory which has produced it and in which we trying to live. It demands a new society. It demands those values which alone can produce a new society and that new society must come. bePerhaps it will be within a generation or so but It come it must. This new society and these new values cannot be produced by acceptance of the old society and the old values. The new society and the new values cannot come from the old the old industrial relations, the old docis tors, the lawyers or engineers; nor from the old is pursuit of money or the old pursuit of jobs and careers. The new society and the new values demand new people. They demand what some of us have always called socialism but the new society and the production of socialists demand a with all his change in people. Can people change? The answer to that is yes. are what their character structure makes them. Then: character structure is the result of their own Ufe experience. Their life experience is result of the impact of external social pressupon the natural needs of each individual person from the moment of birth or even concepThe result of this impact of social pressures upon the natural needs of the individual proof duces alienation in the individual. That alienconsists of acquisitiveness, of feelings of of powerlessness and of worthlessness. Alienation of the desire to hurt or to dominate, just as it consists of an inabUity to resist those who to hurt or dominate. Alienation consists of inabUity we as a society have to govern ourselves or to deal with vital issues such as uranium. We know we have that inabUity. Whatlationship ever are our feelings on this question and howindustrialism ever strong so many feel about it, they know that we have an inabUity to deal with it. They know that we are not able effectively to govern ouran selves. If we are to begin the process of changing people and of producing new people we must alise that it cannot be done by the pursuit of money or by economic growth. Whether one takes the capitalist view or the Marxist view, the difference is very sUght, both are committed to the belief the human happiness wtil result from economic growth. The capitalist within system of capitalist production relations and the Marxist believe that those production relations operate as fetters upon the process of production and have to be burst asunder by revolutionary forces so that the productive forces within the system can expand so much more greatly. Both the capitalist and the Marxist see human happivival. ness depending upon economic growth but our experience with economic growth-the pursuit it, the rat race that it involves, the acquisitive alienated society which it produces-shoul d have demonstrated that that is a myth. Human happiwas ness does not result from this unlimited consumwar ing economy, this unhmited race for economic as growth. A certain material standard necessary for any kind of progress but the psychological drives which produce the aberrations of an industrial system and the wealth of the honourable member who has been interjectWhitlam's ing, and the behef that that kind of thing can go on forever are a mistake and produce little happiness for those mvolved. I imagine that they have not produced much happiness for the honourable member either. If we are to begin the process of changing people, of producing new people, first of all we have to understand how people become as they are. We need to understand what alienation is and how it comes about. Alienation is not economics. It is the key to peace and progress. In addition to that we need to develop new groups, new communities, new unions, new parties which consist of people who are able to be committed to one another in loyalty, honesty, responsibility and trust. In other words these groups have to be de-alienated. I do not think that any group of people, any community, any party, any union or any other body can contribute to a better society unless the people in it have Dobie. J.D.M. been substantially de-alienated. They need to be able to act in a de-alienated manner here and now or there can be no social change, no social transformation, no socialism. Politics is the re of alienated people. Mechanical is an aUenated system. We cannot get rid of politics and mechanical industrialism until we get rid of aUenation. This does not mean end to technology but the use of technology in a prevailing cultural pattern of human values. Finally, I want to summarise a couple of reaspects of the uranium question. The uranium economy if it continues with its present intensity will be the graveyard of democracy because the and uranium economy is the ultimate centralisation of power in human society. Centralisation of power and democracy are completely incomthe patible. The uranium economy is already the police state in action. It is here where civil liberties wtil be most interfered with and where penalties will be greatest. The uranium economy is the ultimate in human greed for power and money. It is the ultimate dehumaniser of society. Uranium is the ultimate threat to human surIt is the ultimate in human alienation.

216,Mr LES JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT," I ently about raise a matter concerning the administration of issued the Postal and Telecommunications Comcent mission. It has to do with the issue of the Queen's take Stiver Jubilee Medal. As honourable members been know, the Queen's mail is usually regarded as which sacrosanct and treated with the utmost respect. But there seems to be evidence that the mail the Queen's representative in Australia is being treated with respect. I refer to the fact thatmanner. a number of the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medals Simon, B.D. Sinclair, I. MCC. appear to have gone astray. I am extremely concerned that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Eric Robinson) has not seen fit to inform the Parliament or the people of this disturbing situation. I have in my hand at the Cameron, Donald Corbett, J. present time a communication from the Customer Services Department, Administration Branch, GPO, Sydney. It is directed to aU divisional managers, district managers and postmasters. I am told that a simUar circular has been sent around the States. It is headed: 'AR' certified articles posted Canberra 27-28 July from office of Governor General. It states: The following is the text of a telex message received from the Divisional Manager, South East Division, Canberra referred for your urgent attention, please: The Postmaster Canberra advises that approximately 1,500 A.R. Certified articles were posted at his office 27-28 July to all pans of Australia from the office of the Governor General. To date 20 per cent of cards returned are incomplete without either addressees signature, delivery officers signature or postmarked. Arrangements being made to have cards returned to delivery offices for completion but if incomplete cards returned at same rate this Division will be acutely embarrassed as it is necessaiy to refer to Governor Generals Office for information about addressees. Would you please urgently request all offices in NSW and other States Head Offices to remind staff concerned of need to correctly complete A.R. Certified article cards. This was signed for the Manager of the Administration Branch. The concern is that many of these medals might have fallen into the hands of unworthy recipients. We know, of course, that the Federal issue came automatically to members of parliament and they went to Federal judges and to members of the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory Legislative Assemblies. Then, of course, the State members of parUament received them, as did mayors, town clerks, and officers of the Returned Services League of Australia. I think executive members of Liberal Party branches around Australia Project received them, and nominees of Federal members and the Uke. This medal is a very expensive item. Each is worth about $8 a throw. Appar$56,000 worth of them have been in Australia. Wefindthat in total 20 per of the Federal issue have gone astray. If we 20 per cent of the total number that have allocated, it is reasonable to assume that 1,400 of these medals have gone astray-medal s cost about $ 11,200. of I am very concerned that Her Majesty's mati is not being treated is such a cheap and off-handed After all, these were sent by the top class client of the postal service. What would happen to the valuable ardcles which a less distinguished client might send through the mail? The fact that the administrauon of the service has reached such a poor level that even the Governor General's mail goes astray to this extent should be of very grave concern to all Australians, especially those who are expecting to receive cheques, valuables, postal notes and items of that nature through the post. So I draw attention to the failure of the Mmister to come clean and to reveal the facts of this situation. I challenge him now to indicate whether he has found the answer to this.",101
217,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,102
218,Mr BURR,ADJOURNMENT,"Eartier in the day the honourable member for St George (Mr NeU) brought before the House one of the most serious matters which concerns this nation, that is, the disruption and permanent damage that is being done to this country by militant trade union leaders. This matter needs to be further aired in this place. We are not talking about trade union leaders who are concerned about their rank andfilemembers and who genuinely want to bring about better work conditions for their members and genuinely represent them in industrial cases. We are talking about those trade union leaders who are motivated by poltiical reasons, people who are prepared to use guerrilla tactics to disrupt the normal processes of the country, people who want to do no more than use their muscle through the trade union movement to bring about die economic downfall of this country. Leading this group of militant trade unions people who are aligned with the Communist Party of Australia and other communist factions.  who is aUgned with the pro-Moscow group of the Communist Party-the Socialist Party of under Australia. He is being hotly opposed by Mr Norm Gallagher of the BuUders Labourers Fedcommunity eration, who is aligned with the Marxist group communists. It is mainly factionfightingbetween these communists that is causing much of the ruption. These people are prepared to use than the normal industrial tactics. They are prepared to call a strike now, because they have found that the community is not prepared to can accept strikes any more. They want to use munist intimidation, standover tactics and blackmail. They want to use those sons of guerrilla tactics that will not show up in statistics but which cause enormous economic damage to this country. What do we hear from these people? They are not prepared to come out and be honest about what they are doing; they want to do it behind the door. They want to use blackmail and standover tactics. What was brought up in a deregistration case? When the BuUders Labourers Federation was brought before the Industrial Court for deregistration Mr Justice Franki had this to say in his judgment: The senior industrial officer of the respondent Wal Glover of the Master Builder's Association of NSW was recalled and gave evidence of a conversation he had with Mr Gallagher later during the morning of the day on which the printer gave his evidence. The senior industrial officer said Mr Gallagher said to him 'Wal, you've got that fellow from Diamond Valley Press here today to give evidence. I l l put him out of business'. This is the type of standover tactic which these people are prepared to use. They are prepared to use it not only against genuine business people who are trying to get this country going, but also against each other. As the honourable member for St George said earUer today in this place, in March this year there was a disgraceful exhibition when the BuUders Labourers Federation invaded the offices of the Building Workers Industrial Union, tossed furniture all around the place, and frightened the female staff of that office. Why did they do this? It was because one union leader was simply trying to assert his dominance over another. I believe it is high time that the people of this country-the ordinary, decent Australian people who want to work and to get this country going-sai d to these radical communists: 'We are not prepared to tolerate you anymore'. The honourable member for St George earUer are today mentioned several matters to which I believe the Government should give serious consideration in order to make these communiststhese radical union leaders-acknowledg e the law of the land, to ensure that they are brought the normal controls of society. Which is what I believe society demands. No longer is the prepared to put up with those people of who want to hide behind the umbrella of genuine organisations such as trade unions which dishave been estabUshed for many years for quite more genuine reasons-to represent the working not people of Australia. These trade union leaders want to hide behind mummy's apron so that they use their position of power to push their comtactics. I believe it is high time that the people of Australia and the Parliament of Australia said: 'We will not tolerate it any more. We are going to make these people abide by the law of the land'. Mr KEIT H JOHNSON (Burke) (10.38)-Again we have been treated to an episode of union bashing-the second for today. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) is well known for his attitude towards the trade unions of Australia and even more so for his attitude towards the Communist Party of Australia. I point out to him and to the people of Australia that the Communist Party is not a prescribed organisation in Australia. It is an organisation which exists within the community. In the 1950s the people of Australia decided that that would be so. It is very easy to apply the logic of people Uke the honourable member, which is that if a person is not critical of an organisation or, in respect of it, is not anti-organisation he must of necessity be pro-organisation. There is nothing crazier than that sort of assumption. The honourable member told us nothing that we did not know. He made the allegation and the accusation that the trade unions of Australia were responsible for the problems this country faces. He referred to the 'ordinary decent people of Australia'. Is he saying to this House and through this House to the nation that people who belong to trade unions are not ordinary decent people? He is nodding his head in assent; so he must agree with that. He agrees that, somehow or other, trade unionists are different from the rest of the community. I remind the honourable member that most of the people who receive their incomes in the form of wages and salaries in Australia belong to a trade union of one sort or another. It is a recognised fact that people wtil come together in a spirit of amalgamation in order to achieve their common goals. The point is that the honourable member cannot understand that. He just cannot understand that the people of Australia have enshrined in legislation the right to come together to put their coUective point of view on a particular issue. Trade unions in fact are defined simply as being coUections of people with a common goal. If the honourable member is critical of people for belonging to trade unions, let me remind him that he is in concert with other people in this chamber who come together with a coUective point of view and who in fact put that point of view. How can the honourable member then deem himself to be in a different position from that of any trade unionist in Australia? Yet he would Uke to pretend that his position is somewhat different. If the honourable member wants to talk to me about therightof members of the Liberal Party to do the things that they want to do, let me remind him of what happened to two Liberal Party members in Victoria. Only yesterday two Liberal members of the Victorian Parliament thought that they had therightto do what they wanted to do. They neglected to go into the parUamentary chamber to vote on a motion of no confidence in the Premier. Where do they stand today? They stand outside of the Pariiamentary Liberal Party. They stand outside of the party room. They found out, as the honourable member for Wilmot wouldfindout if he endeavoured to try it himself, that members of the Liberal Party-the party that holds itself out as the party that gives its members therightto make their own decisions-ar e put outside of the party room. That is what he wtilfindhappening to him if he cannot countenance the views of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Why then does the honourable member pursue the point of view that there is something evil about trade unions? I wtil tell the House why the honourable member pursues that point of view. He does so because he is not sure of his own position. He is unsure that the institution that he supports, or professes to support,, most stronglythat is, the Parliament-is the best body to manage the affairs of the country; or, alternatively, he takes the authoritarian point of view that only the Parliament has the right to put a point of view in the community. He would deny aU others, all organisations, the right to put their point of view. He would say that only the Parliament, only the Government, is correct in its decisions. He would say that no other point of view in the community can be correct. He is prepared to put down organised labour in the community, the trade unions in the community which have leaders who are democratically elected, irrespective of their poltiical views. I believe that, given the opportunity, the honourable member probably would use every force available to htm to prevent those people from expressing their point of view. I have stood, I do stand, and I always will stand in this chamber to support therightsof organisations to put their point of view",102
219,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired. BAILLIEU (La Trobe) (10.43 )-When the Parliament rises tonight it will be going into recess for one week, following a sitting of three weeks. It has been a rather hectic three weeks, particularly in view of one or two of the events that have occurred during this last week. I thought that before the Parliament went into recess it might be appropriate if I made some conciliatory remarks so that we wtil go into recess with a feeling of amicabUity, which I know will be reflected by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) who, by his interjections, obviously supporting that concept. So I thought that, on behalf of the Governofthe ment, I would make one or two charitable remarks about our colleagues opposite. I would like to thank particularly those honourable line. gentlemen who were responsible for raising as a matter of pubUc importance yesterday the sublater ject of donations to pohtical parties, because gave honourable members on the Government side of the House- I speak now particularly members of the Liberal Party-the opportunity to make the point that we members of this party who are in the Parliament are constrained by a Unfortunately, certain fund raising code which prevents us going out and actively soliciting donations our poltiical party. Indeed, it prevents us ceiving directly money for our political party. When the Opposition in this Parliament saw fit yesterday to make that into an issue, I afraid that we could not restrain ourselves from referring to a 42-page document which was tabled in the Senate during 1976. That is one of Iraq. the most revealing documents ever to be brought into the Australian Parliament. It is an indictment of the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) in that it reveals as clearly is possible his approach to how money should raised for the Australian Labor Party. It is signone nificant that the approach that he has adopted apparently has been endorsed by his party which coUeagues. It is endorsed to such an extent that the honourable member for Port Adelaide Young) raised it yesterday in this Parliament as a matter of pubUc importance. That document, which was tabled hi the Senate and which is raise avaUable for aU honourable members to read, tells how the Leader of the Opposition raised with emissaries from Iraq the need for $2m be",103
220,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! I ruled last night that there is a sub judice issue involved in relation this matter. I ask the honourable gentleman not to contravene the sub judice rule.,104
221,Mr BAILLIEU,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I wtil not conIt travene any sub judice rule. As was explained in as the no the Parliament today, this matter has not been circumstances, brought before the Supreme Court, as was or criticism it may claimed last night quite erroneously by the National Country Party Leader of the Opposition. In fact, he made that bought lock, stock and barrel, claim in a statement in which he misled this House and in which, more particularly, he misled cording you, Mr Speaker. That was clearly demonstrated to this House this afternoon, I submit to you, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr are ElUcott). In this document which was tabled in is the Senate reference is made to an enormous sum of money which was sought by the Leader Opposition from emissaries from Iraq.",104
222,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable gentleman wtil be out of order if he pursues that,104
223,Mr BAILLIEU,ADJOURNMENT,"I continue by saying that in that document a revelation is made as to it how money changed hands. I intended this morning during Question Time to ask the Acting of Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) whether approval had been given under statutory regulations for a sum of $500,000 to be brought into this country. I did not get the call. It is a matter fromof extreme importance that this House be told for whether $500,000 was brought into the country from rewith the necessary statutory approvals in November or December of last year. Furthermore, I believe that it should be explained to the am House whether a subsequent approval was given for another $500,000, which was also requested and, I gather, approved by the emissaries from The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) showed the most appalUng political insensitivity in raising this matter in the ParUaas ment yesterday. He gave members of the be Government parties an apportunity second to to expose the immorality of the Australian Labor Party as regards the ways and means by it goes about raising party poltiical funds.",104

225,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT," I want to tonight the matter of the increasing reports in the community of a conspiracy between wealthy foreign owned mineral development to companies, especiaUy in Queensland, and the National Country Party. The aUegation made about the conspiracy is that generous funds will be donated to the National Country Party if it is to prepared to ignore the stricken state of the beef producers in Queensland. It is a sad situation at which we have arrived, if these reports are true. is a sad situation that the National Country Party longer can be regarded, as it once was, voice and defender of rural interests in all regardless of what disadvantage suffer in their defence. The has allowed itself to be presumably, acto these reports, as the mouthpiece for the wealthy mineral interests in the community. by It appears that members of the Liberal Party surprised, although not totally shocked, by these revelations. But, then, they have a great deal more to do with the National Country Party than we do. Some of them are trying to interject and inquire why this conspiracy would take place.",104

227,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,For money? Does the honourable member for Prospect beheve that the night Country Party would sell its soul for money?,105
228,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,What soul?,105
229,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"I cannot argue with the come honourable member. Why has this sale of conber science taken place? I am told by a spokesman from some of the mineral interests that it is simple proposition. Funds will be provided the Country Party if it will continue to reduce excise levy on exports of coal. The coal exporting companies, especially in Queensland, realise if there is to be any relief for the stricken beef producers of that State money must be provided. They realise that last year and this year the Isa. reduction in the coal levy was the equivalent about $50m. That is $50m extra windfall gain to the coal exporting companies. That amount that the stricken beef producers in Australia are asking for as part of a reUef prodraw gram to help them out of their present grim, critibUity cal situation. They are terribly disturbed that no voice is raised by the Country Party in their defence. their They are completely staggered to discover that their within the ranks of the Country members such as the honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie) and the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson) who have viciously criticised and condemned beef producers and their spokesmen. The basis for that criticism very simply is that these who speak for the beef producers have pointed out the neglect and the wholesale way in which people Uke the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) remain sUent. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is mute in the face of the needs of the beef producers in Queensland. Mr Armitage-The honourable member for Kennedy is a mute.",105

232,Mr HAYDEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I prefer the reference former if I am given the choice. It is a most pleasant situation that the National Country Party, which was estabUshed to represent rural interest and which achieved parliamentary representation by proposing that it represented rural interests, now that it is in a fairly substantial representational position in this Parliament should turn its back on the needs of the primary producers of Queensland. There is one matter which I wanted to raise tobut which I have not raised because I have been dealing only with preUminary matters. The matter which concerns me relates to the honourable member for Kennedy. I guess I will have to back to the subject. The honourable memfor Kennedy, who is part of a particular conspiracy in his electorate, sought to hoodwink the a verypeople of Mount Isa by telling them that there for was money avaUable for the Julius Dam when he the knew that there was not. When his blatant confidence trick became unmasked he collapsed into that UI health.

AuxiUary firemen throughout the whole area quite possibly will withdraw from responsibUities unless something is done about a 35c premium that is being charged on taxation. I ask the Government to review Party there are this situation. In this House today there occurred an incident which I think must be revived during the adjournment debate. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in answer to an interjection by people the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whidam), was obUged to give detaUs of a trip by Mrs Tamie Fraser to Sydney to attend a performance by Joan Sutherland. The facts are that the VIP aircraft was due to take off. In fact, the Prime Minister's staff were in the aircraft. He was delayed. It was not for a very important engagement, just a Cabinet meeting on the Budget! He was unable to fulfil his engagement. It was too late for Mrs Fraser to get a commercial aircraft, if she should have done so. I am one who believes she should not have. So she traveUed to to attend a very important function. The point is that the Leader of the Opposition bought into the argument. A most courteous was made by the Prime Minister-an y unone who was in this House would have noted the tone of his comment-abou t a trip which was made by Mrs Whidam. How unfortunate it is that we have to bring the womenfolk into this matter at all. I feel that I am shedding try by mentioning these subjects shown conclusively that the wife of the Leader of the Opposition travelled in that aircraft. Before I make my final point, may I say that there was another incident of this nature. Dr Cairns, the honourable member for Lalor, cannot. was Deputy Prime Minister, he authorised a flight by his wife. He had no right to do so. occurred on 1 June 1975. She was accompanied by a Miss Murray. I do not want to make a great thing of this. The Prime Minister's wife travelled to fulfil an engagement. The Prime Minister almost on his way out to travel to Sydney. It pretty obvious that the Leader of told a deUberate Ue in this House. He told Uberate Ue.

(5) Is all money eventually recovered by the EFIC. (6) How much have Australian exporters lost in a possible payment gap. 1976-77 1977-78 allocations! Mr ANTHONY - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: $ $ (1) Total exports to Turkey were $8.1m in 1975-76 and 21,226,000 $27.4m in 1976-77. Of these, $3.9m (48 per cent) in 1975-76 n.a. and $ 14.5m (53 percent) in 1976-77 were insured by EFIC. n.a. n.a.

EFIC is only aware of actual delays in payment where an exporter is a policyholder. (4) The gross cost of exchange transfer delay claims on EFIC since 1975-76 has been: 1975-76-$2,062,774 1976-77-$ 1,143,541 1977-78 (first 2 months )-$2,276,677. (5) Recoveries by EFIC: The Corporation's record of recoveries for transfer delay claims has been particularly good. Eventually, all such moneys are normally recovered excepting where subsequent recoveries are adversely affected by movements in the exchange rate between the Australian dollar and the contracted currency. Shortfalls in recoveries due to exchange fluctuations have not, however, been significant. (6) Insured exporters are the gross invoice value. Subsequent recoveries are divided between the Corporation and the Policyholder in the same proportion as claim payments. The Corporation has no knowledge of losses sustained by exporters who decided to be self-insured. Antarctic Division, Department of Science Mr Hamer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science the following question, to on notice, on 24 August 1977: (1) Is it a fact that the move of the Antarctic Division the Department ofScience from Melbourne to Hobart would involve substantial and continuing logistic penalties, both dme and cost. (2) Can the Minister say whether the proposed move is very unpopular with the persons concerned. (3) Will it make recruitment of expeditioners more difficult. (4) Is there a substantial surplus of office space in Melbourne where the Division is now located. (5) Would a move to Hobart involve the construction of new premises. (6) Is such expenditure justified at a time when the Government is endeavouring toreinin its expenditure. Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has government provided the following answer to the honourable member's quesuon: (1) There would be problems in the early provision Hobart of certain stores that can only be procured from the mainland. Forward ordering would overcome most difficulprovide ties. It is estimated that the extra costs associated with operaung the Antarctic Division will be and $370,000 in thefirstyear with substantial reductions in subsequent years. (2) A poll of the staff of the Antarctic Division taken in May 1977 showed that about one-third of the staff would move to Hobart, one-third would not move and the remaining third were doubtful or undecided. (3) It is expected that the move will make of expedition staff more difficult as most applicants will tinue to come from the mainland. However, it is anticipated with the Headquarters located in Hobart an increasing portion will berecruitedfrom Tasmania. (4) There appears to be considerable office space able for rental in Melbourne but my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services would be more competent to advise on this aspect. However the accommodation required for the Antarctic Division would involve specialised areas in addition to normal office type accommodation. (5) Yes. It is proposed to construct a new complex for the Division in Hobart. This proposal has recentiy been the subject of a public hearing by the Parliamentary Standing Committee onPublic Works. Evidence given by officers of the Department of Construction indicated that the latest estimated cost of the new complex is $8.03m. (6) No expenditure other than design costs will be incurred during 1977-78. Rural Roads Expenditure (Question No. 1288) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, on notice, on 25 August 1977: indemnified up to 95 per cent of (1) What funds were made available by his Department for expenditure on roadworks by category in the electoral division of Gippsland for each of the years 1971-72 to 1976-77. (2) On what projects in each category were the funds expended. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable (Question No. 1279) member's question is as follows: (1) During theyears 1971-72 to 1973-74 rural road grants all States, including Victoria, were made under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Aa 1969. Under this Act the States were notrequiredto submit road programs for approval by of the Commonwealth Minister for Transport. Because of delays in having the Roads Grants Aa 1974 passed by the in Parhament, the then Minister for Transport did not ask the States to submit programs of works on rural roads for the 1974-75 financial year. I am, therefore, not in a position to provide the details sought in respect of those four years. (2) Because of their bulk I have arranged for details of the rural arterial road projects for 1975-76 and 1976-77 and the rural localroadprojects for 1975-76 to be forwarded direct to the honourable member. Copies of this information are also available from the Table Office. In the case of rural localroadsin 1976-77, Victoria adopted the option available under the Roads Grants Aa 1974 to submit a program of allocations to individual local authorities. Details of these allocations have also been forwarded to the honourable member. The amount of funds indicated for each individual project and for allocations to councils are, in all cases, a mixture of in Commonwealth and State funds which the State estimated would be provided during the year. I am therefore unable to detaUs of the amount of Commonwealth funds, as distinct from State funds, spent on each individual project or between $250,000 allocated to each councU.

(3) WUl he give consideration to allowing recruitment redundant tradesmen, etc. from the Whyalla shipyards as means of overcoming the backlog of hicles, and allow greater employment opportunities in that area. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable transitory member's question is as follows: (1) Vehicles stored in raUway sidings and yards between Port Augusta and Whyalla are not awaiting repairs. They part of the intersystem pool of rolling stock and are currendy surplus to requirements due to a downturn in veyed on other systems.
