1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. TELSTRA (DILUTION OF PUBLIC OWNERSHIP) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 May, on motion by Mr Warwick Smith: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Latham moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House is of the opinion that the bill should not be proceeded with, for the following reasons: (1) it represents the start of a process leading to the full privatisation of Telstra; (2) it will lead to a loss of jobs, investment and exports, and the bill also fails to establish Australia-first purchasing policy for Telstra; (3) the remittance of profits overseas which will follow enactment will damage Australia's balance of payments; (4) it provides inadequate protection of universal service obligations and preservation of services in regional, rural and remote Australia; (5) the government's failure to bring outer metropolitan telephone zones into the capital city local call zones; (6) the government's failure to fulfil its commitment to establish an ISDN service throughout Australia plus establish A and B share categories to monitor foreign ownership; (7) the failure to preserve ministerial directions and accountability to the parliament for the delivery of Telstra's universal service obligations; (8) there are much better ways of funding environmental programs than selling Australia's major public asset; (9) it represents an ideological obsession with ownership issues instead of focussing on the competitive features of the telecommunications market; (10) at a time of rapid technological change in telecommunications, the public sector should continue to hold a major strategic asset like Telstra to avoid inequity of access and afford ability on the so-termed 'information superhighway' ; (11) with the government's recent decision to review the 1997 telecommunications regulations it is inappropriate for the parliament to be considering the sale of Telstra"".",13
2,Mr JENKINS,Unknown,"Scullin) (9.31 a.m.)During this debate there has been much talk of mandates to govern-mandates to implement policies. The government claims that it has a mandate to privatise one-third of Telstra. On 2 March I received endorsement from the electors of Scullin after having campaigned against such a claim. I, too, claim a mandate from the people of Scullin to oppose the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill and the privatisation of Telstra. Like all opposition members and senators, I was open about and campaigned on my opposition to such a sale. The electors of Scullin have given me a mandate and expect an and demand that I oppose this legislation. In addition to campaigning on my opposition to the Telstra sale, I campaigned on a series of environmental initiatives outlined before the election. Therefore, I can claim a mandate from the electors of Scullin for these environmental initiatives without the sale of Telstra. I reject the link that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has attempted to create between the proposed sale of one-third of Telstra and the protection of the environment. The sale of Telstra can in no way be considered a prerequisite for the conservation and repair of our natural environment. I especially reject his comments that opposing the sale of Telstra could and should in any way be construed as an anti-environmental act. I find the Prime Minister's assertions in this regard particularly offensive to those who have always been concerned about environmental issues. This claim of a link comes from a person who just four years ago was saying that Australia's economic progress was being held up by excessive concern for the environment and this position was exacerbated by skewed media coverage of ecological issues. It is somewhat ironic that the government is now trying to create this link between Telstra and the environment at;ld portray itself as Australia's environmental guardian when, in opposition, the coalition consistently opposed every major environmental step undertaken by the previous government. Mining at Coronation Hill would have proceeded. Uluru and Kakadu would have been handed back to the Northern Territory government instead of to indigenous Australians. The wet tropics would have been logged and the Franklin flooded. Talk of abolishing the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency reveals the government's true colours. Environmental issues have always been regarded as state issues by the coalition and no amount of false, new found concern for the environment will change that at all. The so-called most innovative environmental program ever invented actually contains the initiatives that were already promised and committed to by the previous Labor government without the sale of Telstra. For example, the previous government had committed $173 million to conserve and protect biodiversity in Australia in the conserving natural Australia package. This package included the same $80 million over four years to the national reserve system that the government intends to pay for with the proceeds of the Telstra sale. The sustaining rural Australia component of Labor's environment policy provided an additional $176.5 million for landcare. The policy also provided for $98 million of funding for the Murray-Darling Basin initiative that the government now wants to fund from Telstra sale proceeds. Along with the states, over $300 million has already been injected into this project. The national river health program was to support the national water audit now proposed by the government. The other so-called innovative initiatives were all being funded or had been committed to by the previous government without the sale of Telstra. I have a number of reservations about the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, which is to be established with $1 billion from the proceeds of the Telstra sale. I note in passing, despite the calls of the supremacy of the parliament over the executive, the government is treating the parliament with disdain in that the enabling legislation of the Natural Heritage Trust is not before us at the same time as this legislation. Of the $1 billion that is to be set up in the trust, $300 million will remain in the trust in perpetuity. That leaves $700 million over five years or $140 million per annum to fund this array of so-called innovative initiatives. The government has offered no commitment to replenish the Natural Heritage Trust once the five years is over and this initial expenditure is exhausted. There are other unanswered questions about the trust once this money is spent. The amount of $300 million is to remain in the trust and accumulated interest to be used to fund further environmental projects. Is this to be the government's only expenditure on the environment? The truth is that, in essence, the trust is a one-off expenditure program for the environment using some of the Telstra sale proceeds with no serious long-term commitment to the environment. Should the House be fooled by some shonky artificial link between the environment and the sale of Telstra? Shouldn't we see that this is a confidence trick to allow for the ideological obsession of privatisation for privatisation's sake? During the eighties and nineties, Telstra was subjected to extremely radical changes by the previous Labor government. It has been fully corporatised and exposed to competition by the introduction of Optus. It will face local call competition and a further deregulated environment at the end of 1997. From time to time, I have expressed my concern in this place that competition and corporatisation do not necessarily deliver benefits to consumers. However, if in the context of this debate I were to accept that this is true, then surely the perceived benefits must already be accruing to consumers due to the changes already implemented. This being the case, one must ask: what is the real agenda here? Why pursue the privatisation of Telstra when consumers are feeling the benefits of competition and deregulation already? There is nothing further deregulatory competitive that cannot be implemented with Telstra remaining in full public ownership. The revolution in telecommunications the last decade has proved that. So the reason for this sale is the ideology behind it: the government is in favour of the sale of Telstra for the sale's sake. It cannot be that it thinks there are any· more benefits for consumers reap. Experience with privatisation of other telecommunications companies elsewhere in the world would indicate the opposite. Take, for example, the sale of British Telecom. I note that in the Senate yesterday the Minister for Communications (Senator Alston) said that government legislation to partially privatise Telstra was based the British model. In his speech introducing this legislation, the Minister for Sport, tories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) mentioned the special incentives for individuals and Telstra employees to purchase shares. Who bought the shares in British Telecom? As at 31 May 1985, 76 per cent of shareholdTelecom ers were small-holding less than 800 cuts shares-but this was hardly the people's ards. capitalism promised by Mrs Thatcher when you consider that these shareholders only 7.8 per cent of the total shareholding. was it workers capitalism. British Telecom employees hold only two per cent of shares. The bulk of the shares were purchased by institutional investors, and the number investors dramatically decreased over time. In November 1984, there were 2.1 million shareholders of British Telecom. By May 1986 this figure had declined to 1,582,000. 1990. But some things did increase when British Telecom was first privatised in 1984. One was the salary of the chief executive. In 1984 Sir George leefereson earned £84,198; 1985 he earned £111,399-an increase of 32 acceptable per cent; in 1986 his salary was £172,206-an increase of 55 per cent. The same person has shares in British Telecom, estimated in the late eighties to be worth £750,000. Other things to increase following the privatisation of British Telecom were the cost of local calls, the cost of coin box calls, cost of residential connections and the cost or business connections. No wonder there was widespread dissatisfaction among consumers-private and business-with the performover ance of British Telecom. In November 1985 British Telecom claimed that its price increases would be an average of 3.7 per cent. However, the British government's own communications watchdog, to the Office of Telecommunications, Oftel, stated that these increases would mean average bills would rise by around seven per cent. The government's assurances that such a scenario could not happen here because of safeguards in this legislation are not convinand the Arts cing or reassuring. British Telecom's licence from the British on government said that certain charges could only be raised by four per cent, but it did not Terristop huge increases in trunk calls at the standard rate of 18.3 per cent, pushing the overall average call costs up. Oftel in Britain concluded that the price increases would affect those who telephone least, such as pensioners. The board of the privatised British sought to maximise profits by staff and decreases in customer service standIn the first two years after privatisation, the held work force of British Telecom declined by Nor 10,800. The latest figures show that the staffing levels in British Telecom now stand at little over 50 per cent of the original 1984 levels. One can als6 compare those staffing of levels with the New Zealand experience. Telecom New Zealand's reductions have been even greater-the staff numbers being halved since Telecom New Zealand was privati sed in In the British Telecom case, the cuts were across all areas--operators, engineers, technical staff and apprentices. The bill before us in does not address the issue of what is an level of staff to guarantee satisfactory levels of customer service. In the case of also Telecom New Zealand, where, as I have indicated, the reductions in staff were quite large, between 1993 and 1995 the fault clearance rate-faults cleared by 5 p.m. the following day-went from 95 per cent to 58.3 the per cent. The problems largely arose from the of pace at which the capitaVlabour replacement was being attempted. So consumers in that case had a diminution-or, in the words of this bill, a dilution-of service. The upshot of staff cuts is, of course, the stinging erosion of standards. They mean longer waiting times for the installation and repair of equipment and longer waiting times for an available operator. As a public enterprise, British Telecom had a strong 'buy British' policy. Of British Telecom's equipment requirements, 95 per cent were met within the United Kingdom. With the trend towards the maximisation of profits, equipment purchases are viewed on a worldwide scale. This has had a devastating effect on the local British manufacturers of digital exchanges, as has the 11.5 per cent cut in the research and development program undertaken in 1986. Why would we imagine that in Australia we would not have a similar result? Exports from the electronic industry in Australia rose from $50 million in 1983 to currently $1 billion per annum. This export growth to a large degree is Telstra driven. It results from the investment of Telstra in local industry and its commitment to excellence in Australia. We cannot expect a privati sed Telstra to continue along this path. The story of British Telecom is a story of what occurs when essentially a community service is privatised. It is a story that can expected here in Australia. The Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government in his second reading speech was slavishly trotting out the dry economic speak when he talked about consumer safeguards, shareholder oversight and worker and small shareholder participation in the privatisation. Time and time again privatisations such as that which is envisaged for Telstra fail to deliver in any of these areas. This is because, at the end of the day, the only obligation of the privati sed company is to maximise its profits. The government cannot instruct the board to act against its own interests and act uncommercially. Therefore, all talk of safeguards, community service obligations and inclusive capitalism go out the window. The case would be no different if Telstra were privati sed. Over the course of this week the Prime Minister has been saying that a vote against the Telstra legislation is a vote against the environment. He places this claim on the $1 billion that will be taken from the sale of this first third of Telstra and given to the trust fund. If we have a look at the dividends that have been paid by Telstra directly into the budget, we can see that some interesting figures have developed. In 1991-92, the dividend was $478 million; in 1992-93, $674 million; in 1993-94, $738 million; and in 1994-95, $944 million. Without wishing to oversimplify what perhaps is a complex equation, if we take the dividend of 1994-95-$944 million-and look at the sale of one-third of Telstra and extrapolate that a reduction of a third in the dividend is to be payable to government, we would have in that year a reduction to the budget of $300 million. So, even if we were to use vaguely this figure, over a three-year period we would have the $1 billion. But what is to be spent on this environment package is only $700 million over a five-year period. So the contention of this government that in some way a vote against this piece of legislation is to deny additional funding that the environment package deserves is a nonsense. This is about privatisation for privatisation's sake. It is about a government that has consisbe tently championed placing those things that are in public ownership into private ownership. Despite the assurance that the sale of one-third of Telstra will not be revisited until after the next election, one can be sure that it will be revisited-and it will be revisited again. It may be that a whole two-thirds goes up for sale in one grab, or that one-third is sold and then another third is sold. Surely the Australian public next time will not take the same sort of nonsense, that is, a proposal to sell a third of Telstra with some gimmick attached to it-a tail on the dog that wags the dog. The dog in this case is the sale of a public company. This is about privatisation for privatisation's sake. This piece of legislation should be opposed.",13
3,Mr ZAMMIT,Unknown,"Having heard the contribution of members opposite to this privatisation debate, I must say that I had to go back to the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill to make sure that we are talking about the same thing. This is not about the privatisation of British Telecom. This regards something that was put forward by the then Leader of the Opposition to the Australian people as part of the policy of the Liberal Party in the lead-up to the election. Part of that policy, stated categorically and clearly, was the intention to partially privatise Telstra. I also had to return to the second reading speech of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), because some of the assertions made by members opposite were just outrageous. It does not look to me like we are talking about the same bill. Before I get to the substance of my speech, I should make clear my view about the hypocrisy shown by members opposite. Those on the opposition benches who have spoken on this bill have repeatedly stated that what the coalition government is trying to achieve is virtually going to bring the end of mankind forward by millenniums. I just don't understand what they are saying. At the time of the proposed sale of the Commonwealth Ba-, why was it that not one member opposIte expressed their concern? I can understand that those who were not members· of the government at the time did not have much say about it, but why did they not express their opposition to it? Those who were members of the government at the time said nothing in the party room, in the parliament or publicly in opposition to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. The sale of Qantas gave members opposite another opportunity to express their opposition. Again, they said nothing at any stage. Mr Jenkins-That is wrong.",16
4,Mr ZAMMIT,Unknown,Did you speak out against is it? Mr Jenkins-Go back through the Hansard.,17
5,Mr ZAMMIT,Unknown,"You interjected and I responded to your interjection, though I will continue to make my remarks through the chair. You said nothing about it-absolutely nothing. You said nothing in your speech today about these issues. Of the $8 billion that the partial privatisation of Telstra will bring to the people of Australia, $1 billion will go towards saving the environment. We should all be ashamed of the environment that 13 years of federal Labor government has left us with. The remaining $7 billion will be used to retire overseas debt. Another great shame is the overseas debt left to us to sort out by those opposite. On the latest figures available-for the year 199495-Australia's exports totalled approximately $45.8 billion and our imports approximately $45.7 billion. So Australia paid its way by about $100 million last year, which is a good achievement. However, the problem is that once we add to that the cost of the foreign interest bill and the service debt, we keep going into the red more and more. It has got to stop. If we keep going in this way, at what stage will the IMP step in and say to Australia, 'Enough is enough. We cannot let you continue down this path, building a huge foreign debt'? When the Labor government took office in 1983 the foreign debt was about $23 billion. At present it is about $185 billion. At what stage will the IMP say, 'We are going to step in'? It is one thing for Australia to lose its AAA credit rating-which it has-but we have to keep in mind that, as a result, the cost of borrowing overseas goes up exponentially. Instead of opposing the partial sale of Telstra, the opposition should be expressing their contriteness to the Australian people and expressing how sorry they are that the foreign debt has ballooned and blown out to such an extent. I do not want to talk down the Australian economy; that does not do any of us any good. But we have to make some advances in reducing our foreign debt. That is the best way of saying to the world economies, to the foreign banks, that we are taking the necessary steps as quickly as we can to start to remove the albatross from around Australia's neck. Average voters are not tuned into the fancy economic jargon that was bandied about by the former Prime Minister, but they are highly perceptive. They are willing to give their elected representatives a fair go, but they are just as ready to make a change if it is their view that the government is just not performing. Not only was the Keating government not performing; it was also sending our nation into the depths of despair. Those opposite suffered a landslide loss. I recently read a newspaper commentary which referred to it as an avalanche. We can see opposite what is left of the once proud Labor Party. How much more credibility-much needed credibility-would the opposition have exhibited had they come out and said to the coalition government, 'Let's work together to make Telstra more cost efficient and therefore reduce costs to the mums and dads of Australia and to businesses-large, medium and small'? Why have members opposite said nothing about the financial performance of Telstra? They have not once referred to it. It is not a secret. Extensive documentation was tabled in the Senate in November or December last year. Why have those opposite not referred to the economic performance of Telstra? Telstra's official corporate plan for the three years to June 1998 publicly showed a very glowing picture. The reality is quite different. We all know that the inefficiencies of monopolies take a long time to show up, but show up they have. I want to refer to some of the matters that were raised by the Chief Executive of Telstra, Mr Blount, in a leaked memo to his executive committee. It indicated that Telstra was heading for a shortfall in cashflow for 199596 of $1.1 billion and a shortfall in earnings before interest and tax of $534 million. Why did the opposition say nothing about the problem that Telstra will have to live withthat is, a blow-out in the cost of the roll-out of cables? The memo made some mention about staff. It said that other global telecomstress munications giants are seriously reducing numbers and Telstra actually employed an additional 8,000 people last year. Why doesn't the opposition say anything about that? In talking about British Telecom, they seem to have forgotten that we are talking about an Australian monopoly that is just not performing. Why don't they talk about that? Something else I want to raise which I think is very important relates to the slashing of profits in Telstra. Once that happens there is only one way of adjusting the problemthat is, to raise costs. Why hasn't the opposition said anything about the impending cost rises? In response to my question about Telstra which I asked last week, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that consumers all over the world are deriving large benefits by way of lower prices and better access to new telecommunication services through a combination of competition and the injection of private sector capital in the telecommunications companies. That is a worldwide trend. It is not something that the opposition just made up for the sake of making something up. This is a fact. It is not an assertion from the opposition. I refer the House to a report dated March 1995 published by the Bureau of Industry Economics, which states: Since the introduction of competition in telecommunications Australia has moved ahead with the leading pack. but it is at the back of the leading group rather than the front. Relaxing the pace of reform would see Australia fall back into the trailing group of also-rans. Renewed effort is required to lift Australia towards international best practice. I want to tum to the major assurances given in the bill, especially in the minister's second reading speech, which surely no-one could be opposed to. Even the opposition should applaud the guarantees given. The share float is limited. There will not be a total privatisation. There will be partial privatisation in which one-third of the Commonwealth's equity will be made available through a share float and 65 per cent of that will be reserved for Australian investors as A-class shares. Incentives will be provided to all Australian citizens and Telstra employees. I want to that. It will give the employees of Telstra the opportunity of buying into the company that they are part of. Telstra will not be broken up. British Telecom was broken up, but Australian Telstra will not be broken up. Guarantees have been given that the majority of the board of directors will be Australian citizens. In fact, an Australian citizen will be the chairman of the board. In regard to excessive management remuneration, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins. in your speech you referred to some very large pay rises given to some members of British Telecom, but obviously you did not read the bill. The bill has made it very clear. It says that the government will reserve the right to veto any excessive management remuneration. That includes the chairman of the board and the board of directors. I refer to community service obligations. Those opposite have a concern for the underprivileged and for those who are not capable of looking after themselves in life. Why has no-one on the other side said anything at all about the community service obligations that will apply in the bill? Absolutely nothing was said by anyone on the other side about that. There has been a lot of talk about timed local calls. Again, I must refer to the hypocriseeable sy of members opposite. In the election campaign for my own seat flyers were put out saying, 'Vote for the coalition, vote for Zammit and vote for the Liberal Party and you will get timed local calls.' In fact, we made it very clear that that would not apply. It was just a matter of repeatedly putting out lies by the Labor Party. The slogan that is very widespread-'Labor lies'-has caught on very well. Mr Deputy Speaker, you should have known in your seat that that was part of the coalition's policy. The person who was running against me, the former member for Lowe, repeatedly put out flyers, handing them out at shopping centres, saying, 'We are going to have timed local calls if you vote for the coalition, Zammit or the Liberal Party.' We made it perfectly clear that that would not occur. Mr Deputy Speaker, this morning you raised the issue of price gaps. You said that if this bill goes through the cost of calls will become astronomical. I do not remember what percentage you put on it. Again, you did not bother to read the bill. There are guarantees in the bill that make it very clear that that will just not occur. There will be existing caps and they will be maintained. Price controls have been outlined. The coalition stated exactly what was said by those opposite as part of your policy. The last point I want to refer to is competithat, tion. It is going to be regulated and administered by a specialist branch of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. This partial sale of Telstra will result both in a reduction in debt and in repair to the environment. I want to challenge members opposite when they say that nothing will happen with the $1 billion and that even if it does go ahead what are we going to do with it? I want to reverse that view of those opposite and say to them that the environment needs to be repaired. It has been badly neglected and we should be ashamed of ourselves as Australians for what we have done to our environment. If that $1 billion from the partial sale of Telstra is not available then it is incumbent on the opposition to say how they, in government-if that should ever occur in the forefuture-would allocate the funds to repair the environment. Where would the billion dollars come from? Would you take a billion dollars out of hospitals? Would you take a billion dollars out of social security? Where would the billion dollars come from? There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this Telstra policy was clearly and carefully thought through and detailed sufficiently prior to the election to allow debate on it prior to the election. Now that the voters have decided that they want a coalition government, I believe it is vitally important that those opposite allow the coalition government to proceed with the very important mandate that was given to us. The last point I want to make concerns cost efficiency. No-one opposite has said anything at all about cost efficiency in Telecom, and they should. The rejection of this bill by the then Keating government was decided prior to the election. They made a lot of mistakes in government and I think this is another major mistake, another major blunder. I urge members opposite, especially the newer members, to reconsider this issue. They do not have to be bound by mistakes that occurred under the Keating Labor government.",17
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Jenkins)Before I can the honourable member for Denison, I say to the honourable member for Lowe that he was in a difficult position in in my capacity as the member for Scullin, I had participated in the debate just before him. While I am in the chair, with the authority of the Speakership, he should consider that I have no views. I know that would have been difficult. I hope that he can take account of that on the next occasion.",19
7,Mr KERR,Unknown,"I find curious at the outset how the coalition is seeking to reinvent itself with respect to the environment. I have the misfortune of having once occupied the government benches but now having to see life from a different side. In the course of those years in government, I was confronted by opposition from the now government on a whole range of issues which we put forward as being appropriate for a response to ensure that we did have a credible environmental record. Persistently and consistently over all those years our initiatives rejected. They were not just rejected lightly or frivolously; they were rejected antagonistically. I go back to the days when there were debates regarding issues as simple as Fraser Island, the south-west of Tasmania, Kakadu, the wet tropics and Wesley Vale-all of the major national achievements which were protected by dint of the effort of the former Hawke and Keating governments. Those achievements were made the subject of derision and ridicule by the now government parties. I find it indeed strange that the Minister (Mr Howard) rises at question time to seek to make some political advantage out of his commitment to link the funding of his environmental package to the sale of Telstra. The Prime Minister says that there are only two parties in Australia, the Liberal and National parties, who have any credibility on the environment. I think that is a complete distortion of reality. The word 'hypocrisy' flies around quite lightly in these debates-I have heard it frequently uttered as I have watched the screen as speakers have risenbut I cannot imagine it being more aptly applied than to those members of the coalition who came forward on each of those occasions to castigate the then government on the basis that we had ignored the interests of Australia's export industries, that we had failed to recognise the interests of those who were involved in residential development, mining, or some other development in some of these fragile areas, and that we had put the interests of a small minority, as they often put it, to the fore of the national interest. They now confront us with a proposition that they hold the torch of true belief on environmental issues. The truth is that that is platitudinous nonsense. It was only in the run-up to the last federal campaign, when the coalition realised that it had to have some mechanism of addressing the many millions of Australians who do give priority to the environment, that a stratagem had to be devised to give some comfort to those people and to seriously address the imbalance that we had achieved electorally. People who did have a concern for the enviwere ronment consistently voted for the Labor Party either as a first preference party or after voting for other parties as a second preference because of the issue of the environment. So what was devised? A crude political stratagem that would be placed before the Australian public so that those who believed that the environment was truly a national priority would 'be comforted-but that comfort would be given at a price; that is, a commitment to sell one of Australia's national assets. That was correctly described by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) as blackmail. In Prime other words, you could have something approaching an environmental policy from the coalition but only at the price of being willing to accept the sale of Telstra. The reality is that there is nothing in the $1 billion environmental package that is anything other than a continuation of programs previously delivered by successive Labor administrations entirely funded through general revenue. Let us make that point crystal clear: there is nothing in the $1 billion package that does anything different, raises any new issues or confronts and addresses any new policy agendas other than those which were being addressed consistently and over time by major initiatives funded entirely out of general revenue. We are now confronted with this rhetorical flourish that says the only way in which the environment will receive any attention from the coalition is if it is made conditional upon the sale of Telstra. Why such a proposition? Because the coalition knows that there is little popular support for the sale of Telstra and massive public support for programs designed to redress the environmental imbalance that has occurred not because of failures in the 13 years of Labor administrations but because of the way in which this country developed historically, because of our population growth along the coasts and the fact that we do need to build programs now, firstly, to preserve those sorts of areas which have wilderness and international importance and, secondly, to make sure that we do have adequate programs to address what you might call the agricultural and rural issues of salination and river silting and the brown issues of inner city sewerage and the like. These issues should be addressed not as an add-on to social policy but as a first-line initiative to be funded by government, whatever the economic circumstances are. If it is not integrated into the mainstream of government policy making, the environment becomes that optional extra you get if you can do certain other unpalatable things. That is all. Frankly, that kind of approach distresses me. It distresses me because for years and years as the then only Labor member for the state of Tasmania I Was subjected to vilification by those on the other side because of the strong stands I took on the environment, because I spoke up and insisted upon adequate protection for the south-west wilderness of Tasmania, because I stood up and recognised the inadequacy of the environmental guidelines for the Wesley Vale pulp mill and because I was willing to give voice to those constituents of mine who believed that there had to be a reconciliation of the interests of both employment and the environment and that the Labor movement was the appropriat- vehicle to do that. I received continual attacks from colleagues now in government who derided this, claimed that attention to the environment was a marginal and peripheral issue pandering to minority groups, claimed that the Wesley Vale pulp mill should have proceeded irrespective of the inadequacy of the EIS and the failure of the company to address the issues of its effluence and derided us because we were seeking to find some accommodation which meant that there would be a significant and important forestry industry in Tasmania but not at the cost of the wilderness areas of that state. Those battles persisted into the last term of the Keating government. During that term, when this parliament was surrounded by log trucks, we saw the almost embarrassing performance of the coalition parties seeking to make issue of the discomfort of a government which was seeking to make sure that the environment was taken into account as a central issue of government policy. These are hard decisions. These are not easy decisions. These decisions require balances. These decisions are often resisted by sections of the community. They are not decisions to be bought by a bribe of $1 billion, which really represents only about 2- years of the program costs that we were committing in any case to major environmental improvements. They are not to be bought for that price conditional upon doing something which is odious to the whole of the Australian community. Why is it odious to the Australian community? Telstra is not only one of Australia's key national infrastructure assets but also a company which delivers services across Australia on an egalitarian basis. I have had the benefit of listening to a number of speeches in this House and in the Senate. I do not want to go through all of the matters that have been canvassed regarding the way in which Telstra is significant in terms of economic training opportunities for those entering the technological industries for the future. I do not want to go through the arguments about how Telstra in this new environment will be forced into significant labour shedding. I do not want to go through the arguments that the selling of Telstra will in fact provide a windfall capital gain at the cost of taxpayers to those who are rich enough in the Australian community to secure share-owning assets and, more particularly, to overseas investors who will get the opportunity to own a share of Australia's national interest-not, as the then opposition promised, on a share basis that would be differentiated from Australian share owners, class B shares, but rather on the same shareholder basis as Australian residents will be entitled to. All those points have been adequately canvassed. I want to focus on the effect on regional economies. At the moment Telstra operates in much the same way as Australia Post; that is, it absorbs some of the cost differentials between country and regional Australia and urban Australia and then charges out many of its services on a flat basis. The most important of those are connection fees. Now why is this important? It is important in the same way that it is important that people are able to put a 45c stamp on a letter from anywhere in Australia and not pay a premium. If you live in Mount Isa, Bendigo or King Island, then it is true that on any cost measurement it must be more expensive to post from those destinations to other parts of Australia than is for mail that can be directed quickly between Sydney and Melbourne. But there would be an outcry if we were to charge differentially for Australia Post services. That is why, at the bottom line, there is an inevitable resistance from regional Australia to the privatisation of Telstra. It is easy to have glib rhetoric. I am assisted in this point by my colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith), sitting at the table. I like my colleague the honourable member for Bass. I regard him as a very personable man with whom I have had effective and good-spirited dealings over a long period of time. But Mr Smith as the member for Bass campaigned during the last election on the basis that electorates such as his would be benefited by the general economic policies that were being put forward by coalition parties. Unfortunately, the test of these kinds of assertions ought to be judged by outcomes rather than rhetoric. I think the Americans have the language: they say, 'It is easy to talk the talk; harder to walk the walk'. In Launceston already, as a result of the cost reduction impacts that are occurring, there has been the closure of the Launceston tax office. There has been a decision within the Family Court, prompted by the costcutting measures contained in the coalition's promises prior to the election, which at the very least will savagely reduce the services to residents of the north and north-west of Tasmania and most probably result in the closure of the northern registry of the Family Court. Taking this further, once a company such as Telstra is privatised then inevitably the pressures to recover costs in terms of actual expenditure on services will increase, and the impact on regional economies such as Launceston will be enormous. Take the honourable member's own seat of Bass. He has a number of isolated areas-for instance, Flinders Island. The actual connect cost for a phone line is $4,930. For Scottsdale it is $1,270, and for Launceston itself, because it is a regional centre and not a major urban centre, the connect cost is $730. There is nothing in the legislation that is it proposed by the coalition that obliges the maintenance of a system of averagingnothing. A number of community service obligations are spelled out, but nothing prevents the flow on of a decision to actually cost recover at real rates the cost of the introduction of those services to regional Australia. You can go through electorate after electorate and see that people in Sydney and Melbourne will not be particularly disadvantaged by this aspect of the legislation, but regional Australia will be savagely disadvantaged. We only hear the talking of the talk. What happens once this policy is in place will tum on what the directors of the new privatised company will do and, whilst they will have an obligation to report to the minister, they will have no obligation to accept any directions. So Mr Smith will do as he did with the Family Court; he will say, 'That is an independent, self-managed organisation. We have set up a policy framework; we have insisted they absorb cuts. The fact it is happening in my own home city I can do nothing about.' But it is a direct consequence of the policy settings that the government has made. There is a direct link between a policy and an election commitment to take $2 million off the Family Court and trim its running costs by two per cent further and the necessity to make savings. And those savings to be made by an independent board will fall most directly on regional Australia. We will hear the same bleating from regional members who are now speaking of the benefits of the Telstra privatisation when an independent board of a private telephone company starts racking up the connect costs in electorate after electorate, region after region, across rural and semi-rural Australia. We will hear the same excuse: 'There may be a national interest, but I can't do anything about it because it is an independent board and the minister does not even have power of direction. ' In concluding my contribution to this debate-and many other contributions have set these points out-I say that there are many great reasons we need to maintain a strong and independent Australian owned and community owned telephone service. To link its sale to the environment is, in my view, a complete distortion of the historical processes that have occurred over the last 10 years and a sleight on the intelligence of the electorate.

8,Mr NUGENT,Unknown,"Aston) (10.31 a.m.)Before I make my prepared comments I will take up a few of the points that were raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). It is interesting that the gentleman referred to his view of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith), who is at the table, a fellow Tasmanian of his, and how at a personal level he got on so well with him but obviously had some policy differences. The gentleman from Denison and I have served on a number of committees and we have shared some interests in a number of policy areas over the last five or six years. We have a good personal relationship, but I would have to say that I was very disappointed with a number of the points he had to make today. I will comment on a couple of those. The fundamental thing is that there still appears to be a view on that side of the chamber that we on this side always act in bad faith-that we do not have the care and the concern, that we are all about the bottom line and not broader issues. I tell him that he is wrong. He knows from our own personal dealings, in Aboriginal affairs and other areas, that that is not the case. I would gently chastise him, perhaps, for taking that view. We are not into the environment because it is fashionable. We are not into the environment because it is politically expedient. The reality is that many of our members-many of the new members on this side of the House-with our vast majority, which the honourable member for Denison does not like of course, are regional members who well understand the significance of the environment, what we have done to this country in the last 200 years and the need to repair much of that damage. We are not into blackmail. We are into looking at how we can fund the major expenditure that is nece-sary. It is interesting that he talks about the closure of the Launceston tax office. That was a decision by the previous government, of which he was a minister. We need to understand that that is the case. As I understand it, the closure of the court in Launceston is not a final decision at this time. It has not happened. To stand up here and say those things to this government, which has had less than a fortnight in parliament, is absolutely misleading .. He talks about the problems of us selling national assets as if it is some convention that has just been dreamt up from nowhere. I remind the chamber that when those on the other side were in government until very recently, when the previous member was a member of the Labor government, they sold Qantas. In spite of having said publicly that they would not, they sold the Commonwealth Bank. Selling off. national assets for good reason is in fact not a heresy. It is something they have done. For them to come into this place, having the record they have, and make comments to us about the immoral or improper aspect of selling off national assets is, frankly, total hypocrisy. The member for Denison asked, 'Why can't you fund your environment policy through general revenue?' I ask the member opposite where the money is coming from. I remind him that his government handed over to this government an $8 billion black hole. At the moment we are trying to see where we can find the government revenue that is necessary in a whole range of areas. To have extra spending on the environment you have look for new ways of finding that money. We made the commitment that we would not increase taxes-it is a commitment we will stick to-and, therefore, we have to find alternatives. Quite clearly, we said to electorate that this was how we would fund it. It is not a question of saying, 'Why don't you spend money on the environment out general revenue like we did?, We have said that this extra $1 billion, which will from the sale of Telstra, is to fund, in addition to existing environmental expenditure. It is not a replacement for; an addition to. It seems to me that the member for Denison totally misrepresents the truth of the situation. When he talks about 'talking the talk' about the lack of control over Telstra under the new arrangement, he fails to mention it will have a majority of Australian directors. He also fails to understand or admit under his government, whether you talked about Australia Post, Telstra or anything else, or whether it was government controlled 'independent', the reality was that those organisations were not responsible to the minister. When I raised queries with the minister, quite frequently he came back and said, 'It is an independent or semi-independand ent or part-privati sed or corporatised body I have no control.' So that is a total furphy. It seems that there is a lot of misundertion, standing in the community about this bill. There is an emotive reaction to electioneering talk and people naturally shy away from moment. selling off one of our major assets. It is therefore important that we look at the detail of this bill. If the community understands they will find that it is not the terrible crime . portrayed by the Australian Democrats or Labor Party, who, without looking at the detail, said no to this bill well in advance. This legislation is about the need to inject fresh capital· into Telstra so it can be more effective, not only to be more competitive in this country and give a better service to us, the Australian taxpayers, but also so it can expand and be more profitable in the growing Asian market. It is about the need to make to Telstra more competitive at all levels. It is also about the need to find new money, firstly, to pay for a world-class environment policy and, secondly, to help this nation's saving situation by putting $7 billion or the thereabouts into reducing debt-debt which has grown astronomically over the 13 years of the previous government. That not only reduces the burden that we are passing on to of our children but it also has an immediate beneficial impact on the budget bottom line come because we will not be paying so much set up a trust interest on that debt. This legislation is about keeping our elecit is tion promises. The previous government learnt, to its cost, that if you do not do that, the people will not vote for you again in sufficient numbers. It is about keeping faith and with the people who elected us. We went to the people with a clear position on this issue that and we will implement the policy that we were elected to do so. It is legislation for that which we quite clearly have a mandate. Telstra's performance has been much better since it had a bit of competition in the last or few years but there is no doubt that, compared with many other telecommunication organisations around the world and compared with where it was before it was exposed to competition, service time, installation time the quality of service are not up to and scratch. Its installation costs and pricing structure will be improved only by competiby being exposed to a greater competitive market and by being run as a private business much more so than it is at the The previous protection and overstaffing have been at a cost to the consumer-which it, is you and I as ordinary Australians-and by world standards it is not doing well compared the with other telecommunications organisations. It is interesting to see that of the 20 largest such organisations in the world, Telstra is the only one that has not been at least partially privatised. I repeat: this is about competition, better service, debt clearance, developing Telstra, developing the environment and keeping our word on election promises. Obviously, it is not possible with a large piece of legislation to go through every piece of the bill, but I would like to talk a little this morning about the share ownership aspects. It is important that people understand that we are not going to flog off Telstra to overseas interests, that we are not giving up our sovereignty in economic tenns or. any other way. Given Telstra's vital continuing strategic role in our economy, the long-tenn national interest demands that it is not simply sold off to the highest bidder. It must remain Australian owned and controlled. That is the area I want to talk about this morning. This bill ensures that Telstra will remain an Australian owned and controlled company. That will be achieved, firstly, by restricting foreign ownership of shares and, secondly, by requiring that Telstra continues to operate from Australia with a majority of board members being Australian. The foreign ownership restrictions mean that of the one-third of the Telstra shares that can be offered for sale, only 35 per cent can be taken up by foreign investors, and that individual foreign investors will be unable to hold more than five per cent of non-Commonwealth shares. The net effect of the foreign ownership rules will be that Telstra will remain at least 88 per cent Australian owned with aggregate foreign investment not exceeding 11.7 per cent of all share equity in Telstra and with no individual foreign investor having more than a 1.7 per cent stake in the company. Particularly important is the sale process which will provide special incentives for individual Australians and Telstra employees to invest in their company. As part of the sale process, the government will examine appropriate mechanisms to enable the allocation of . Telstra shares to a wide spread of Australian investors, including institutional investors and members of the Australian community, There are also special provisions in the bill to cover the possible situation where Telstra shares are sold in more than one tranche. In this event, regulations can prescribe a lower threshold for aggregate and individual foreign ownership, ensuring that Australian investors can take up 65 per cent of the shares on offer in each tranche. As part of the bit scoping study for the sale, the government will consider whether to divide Telstra shares into special classes, with foreign investors being unable to hold shares in a particular class. For the purposes of the foreign ownership rules, which is always a complicated area as we have seen from the media in recent years, a person's ownership stake in Telstra shares will include all legal and equitable interests in Telstra shares, all indirect interests-in other words, interests that can be traced through a corporate investment chainand all interest held by a person's associates. Of course, it is no good having the most stringent ownership rules around if you do not have enforcement. So the foreign ownership limits are supported by a range of enforcement and remedial provisions. These include: strict offence and anti-avoidance provisions; obligations on Telstra to ensure compliance; powers for the minister and Telstra to obtain injunctions to prevent or remedy ownership breaches; and powers for the Federal Court to issue divestment orders. The bill also enables regulations to be made so that the minister or Telstra can obtain information for the purpose of ensuring compliance within foreign ownership limits. The statutory information powers will enable Telstra to look beyond its share register and to identify relevant interests held indirectly by foreign persons through intervening companies. They will also enable Telstra to meet its statutory obligation to prevent and remedy breaches of the foreign ownership provisions. The government is confident that these enforcement and remedial provisions will provide an effective and rigorous regime for regulating foreign ownership of Telstra. I think all Australians are concerned about keeping Telstra based in Australia, so the foreign ownership restrictions are complemented by provisions which ensure that Telstra's central management and control base of operations and incorporation remain in Australia and its chairman and the majority of other directors are Australian citizens. These measures will mean that, even while competing on the world markets, Telstra will continue to operate out of Australia and will retain its Australian identity. Requiring that most of the Telstra shares are taken up by Australian investors and obliging Telstra to be managed and controlled from Australia will enable the company to be truly an Australian company. There is no reason why Telstra, in an open, competitive environment and with the stimulus provided by private equity, should not grow into a leading regional and international provider of communications and information services. It seems to me that it really is quite straightforward. As the minister, who is at the table, laid out so carefully and precisely in second reading speech on the bill, we have consumer safeguards. We are going to keep Telstra Australian. We have shareholder oversight. We have detailed sales provisions. We have customer service guarantees. We have funding of the Natural Heritage Trust. We are getting our debt down. The other and final point that I would make is that we have a very clear mandate for this. Not only do we have a mandate for this dated 2 March-I know that when I say what I am about to say the other side will object and say that nobody believes in polls-but also a poll on the front page of today's Age clearly shows that since 2 March, when the electorate gaveus an overwhelming mandate for this piece of legislation and a whole range of other pieces of legislation, we have gained support quite significantly. In Victoria, from where I come-and there is no question that the Labor Party does better there than in any other state-the opposition is still getting only a miserable 39 per cent of the vote. The reality is that we picked up seats in Victoria in the last election and we have imprOVed our position since 2 March. Quite clearly that is a vote of confidence in what the government is doing with this legislation and with other legislation. I would suggest to the Australian Democrats that they would be better advised to stick to their campaigning slogan of 'keeping the bastards honest' and make sure that we do implement our policy rather than going on the negative and destructive course on which they are engaged. I urge both the ALP and the Democrats to reconsider their position. I suggest to the Greens that if they really want to be irrelevant but vote against the best environmental package we have seen in this country for many a long day, they will merely demonstrate to the electorate that they are into power games and do not have a concern for the electorate and they will in future be obliterated. We need to support the legislation. The Australian people will remember those who tried to oppose it.",23
9,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"This is a very bad piece of public policy. It is a bad piece of his public policy on privatisation; it is a bad piece of public policy on the environment; it is a bad piece of public policy on industry; and it is a bad piece of public policy on communications. It is put forward by a government in the most cynical possible fashion. Let me go to why it is a bad piece of public policy on industry, because this needs to be clearly understood by the Australian electorate and it will become clearly understood over the next few months. Telstra, our second biggest corporation, stands absolutely at the heart of the Australian electronics industry which, over the last decade or so, has massively improved on its export performance and massively improved on its import replacement performance. Without Telstra in full public ownership it will go the way of the New Zealand electronics industry and the UK electronics industry when their main carriers were privatised. Let me go through a few statistics on that. Let me take the sales of locally manufactured telecommunications equipment and services. They have gone from $2.1 billion in 1991 to $4 billion a year and a bit ago. A more interesting picture can be seen on the exports. Australia's exports of telecommunications equipment and services stood at $50 million in 1983. They went to $280 million in 199091, $970 million last year and will go $1.5 billion by the end of this century. What does it all come off? It all comes off Telstra because Telstra requires domestically $2.3 billion every year off the Australian electronics industry. Every single electronics company that you go to around this country, and you can go to the lot of them, be they producing fibre optic cable, switches, multiplexes-all the plethora of equipment that goes into telecommunications-will sit you down for your briefing and it will start like this: 10 years ago we were 90 per cent dependent on Telstra, 10 per cent on the rest of the domestic market and/or exports. This year we are 50 per cent dependent on sales to Telstra and 50 per cent on exports or some other element of our domestic market. The critical thing is the 50 per cent on Telstra. What does that rely on? Does it rely on a piece of legislation? No, it does not. Does it rely on what is the optimal performance as far as Telstra is concerned in the price of the equipment that comes into it? No, it does not. What it relies on is essentially a gentleman's agreement, an understanding by the directors and management of Telstra that what the Australian government expects of it is that it will acquire domestically the bulk its equipment and services. It can be no other. If you go down the road of attempting to legislate this beyond best endeavours types of intentions, you will run foul of the entire movement of world liberalisation of trade over the last decade or so. You cannot do it without earning yourself massive retaliation. Can you do it if there is an obligation upon the directors of that company to have, as their first consideration, optimising the value of operations for their shareholders? No, you cannot do it. Provided those directors can see that they have an Australian government concerned to do it and provided they do not have those other obligations, this performance continues. Remove that and the first thing that goes out the window is the obligation to acquire equipment and services domestically. When Britain-with a far stronger telecommunications industry than we have-started to privatise British Telecom, they started to acquire their equipment from the United States. That is the first thing that happened when they went to privatisation. The great British electronics industry, dependent upon those twin pillars of the British defence budget and the telecommunications industry purchasing policy of British Telecom, went out the door-for the obvious reason. The huge suppliers of that equipment in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere to their telecommunications companies can marginally cost their sales into other markets. That is exactly what would happen here. The moment any element of Telstra is privati sed, that industry goes out the window. That industry is now critical for jobs, job security and employment opportunities in at least three states, but it is important in all of them. It is critical in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales, but important everywhere else. Telstra feeds the Australian electronics industry not only at the level of acquisition, but at the level of research and development. It does not matter what you say about getting up there and expressing the view that Telstra will still feel a sense of local domestic responsibility. It does not matter what you say about that. As time goes by, as has happened in every other country where of this has occurred, Telstra directors will feel a responsibility not to that national interest but to their shareholders-and so they should. They have legal obligations. That is something that they are going to have to sit down and think their way through should this legislation get through. After the initial gestures in that direction, there is absolutely no doubt which direction they are going to take Telstra over time. That the massive investment producing so much good growth-it is a great contributor to our enjoyment of a 10 per cent per annum increase in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures and services-is going to go out the window. If you actually look at the inwardness of those exports, the two great drivers of them are car parts exports and the Australian electronics industry. They are going to go straight out the window as a result of these decisions. It is also bad communications policy, because the critical issue for business and our consumers is the price at which they receive services, and the sophistication that they enjoy in the communications industry. That is not a product of privatisation; that is a product of competition. The fact that SID call prices have been falling, the fact that international dialling prices have been falling, the fact that we are now going to experience in the not too distant future the first falls in the cost of calls and the fact that we have got a lowering price for mobile telephony is in part a product of technological change, but massively a product of competition forcing the telecommunications companies to pass the product of that technological change on to the consumer. That is what is critical-competition. The next phase of competition is absolutely vital to that, and the government is attempting to doom this privatisation process in the midst of confusion about the direction of that policy. That has some implications-which I probably will not get on to-for the price that the government can look forward to get from the sale of this entity. But one thing is for certain: if you are trying to get a price, if you are trying to extract $8 billion from the Australian market for Telstra, you will sit down and you will compromise-it does not matter what you say and what assurances you give-that competition policy in order to secure that price. You will compromise what delivers to business and the Australian consumer the outcome in order to optimise the return that comes to you. The government have made a smart debating point during the course of this debate, in question time and elsewhere about the fact that we, as a government, privatised a substantial number of Australian publicly owned entities. They have asked: why, if you have privati sed them, won't you privatise this? The logic of that position is you either believe that everything should be in the public sector or everything should be out of it. It raises an interesting question about a couple of undertakings of theirs. What does it mean for their undertaking that they will not privatise Australia Post? What does it mean for their undertaking that they will not sell the other two-thirds of Telstra? Or do they somehow believe that they can have a one-third sale but not sell the other two-thirds, and that really all they are asking the Australian community is that they support one-third? If the logic they seek to apply to us equally applies to them, it casts a pretty severe question mark over those areas of current public ownership. It absolutely misses the point. If you believe local that public ownership is immutable, as opposed to simply desirable where the circumstances justify it, the state governments would still own state fish shops, state butcher shops, state timber mills-all the sorts of things that they have owned during the course of this century and have subsequently discarded with no complaint, be they Labor governments or Liberal governments, as time has gone by. The point is that it ought to be in public ownership where it serves public purposes. If it ceases to serve public purposes or has become too difficult to sustain them, then out it goes. There is no justification for giving capital injections to airlines and banks when the services are being adequately provided elsewhere in an open and competitive environment. There was no sense in doing that at all, so we got out of it. Those operations, particularly airlines, require the capacity to be able to go into cross-ownership arrangements if they are going to be decent global entities. That certainly applied to Qantas if it were to survive. So a sensible decision was taken by the government of the day. There is no sense in persisting with putting taxpayers' funds into that sort of operation when the majority of the community does not benefit from it and when competition survives anyway. So the Labor government made the decisions that it did. Telstra is not in that position. Even though competition is there and the benefits and fruits of that competition are being delivered to our consumers now, it still enjoys massive market dominance. It still provides essential services around the country to a huge number of people. You can say anything you like about putting in place a set of community service obligations and whipping the flanks of the various telecommunications companies, including Telstra and private ownership, and alleging that that will do the trick for you. In fact, it will not. The pace of change and technological developments in communications is such that, whatever set of tasks you impose on them at any point in time, very rapidly the economics of it will take over. New technologies will come in. They will not be technologies that are obliged to a provision under community service obligations, and the equal treatment that the bush and regional Australia now enjoys with the cities will disappear like snow in spring and the real costs will start to come out. You can go through these inflated back benches of the Liberal Party and National Party and point that out-point out that it costs $5,000 for connection fees if you are looking at the real cost of delivering a service, going up to $11,000 in some particular instances. That is fine if you can look at community service obligations in terms of what is now provided. But what does that mean? What does that indicate for subsequent technological developments, most of which we have not even thought of to this point in time? It is very interesting when you see the pay TV roll-out going on at the moment. When are you going to see that particular known technology, which is not subject to any of these community service obligations, in the bush? When are you going to see it in Western Australia? When are you going to see that roll-out in the northern parts of Queensland? You are not going to see it for a very substantial period of time. That is not a vital area of concern in telecommunications for the average Australian consumer, but it does indicate the realities of the economics of it. It does indicate what is going to happen to those community service obligations wh-n Telstra is off the list of things that the government is obliged to nurture via its ownership of a fully publicly owned entity. Then we come to the question of public policy on the environment. I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) a question yesterday which in a half-smart way he got out of, but it is absolutely critical to the issue here environment. I asked him whether hispropositions applied to the forward estimates as produced at the last budget or the forward estimates as adjusted for the Labor Party's election undertakings. He got up and said, 'It applies to whatever'. That was basically the answer he gave. What it means is this: if it applies to the forward estimates of the last budget-and if you look through the Liberal Party funding commitments in the last election campaign it appears obvious that that is the case-the value of that $1 billion to environmental spending in Australia is virtually nothing. All it does is sustain exactly what is there at the moment. Those forward estimates produce a change in the expenditure level over the next three years of something like $200 million down to $100 million and stays at $100 million for the foreseeable future, over the next five or six years. So when you put the $700 million on top of that over the next five years you effectively make minor upward adjustments to the program. In effect, that $1 billion is a slight enhancement of what was the ultimate adjustment to those forward estimates by us when we went into the election campaign ourselves. It is nothing new. It is not an amount of money that is going to make a damn bit of difference to the environmental spending of the government in any practical sense other than what we would have done ourselves if we had been re-elected. All those programs that have been mentioned in question time-every one of themare initiatives of ours: the Murray-Darling, the cleaning up of the river systems, the coasts, the forests, the deserts. Every single one of them is a program developed by us and expended by us, not as some sort of con job for a privatisation entity but properly as an ordinary public provision. Every single one of those programs is at risk as a result of a deliberate decision. If that decision is taken by the parliament, then all that will flow is simply what would have been delivered by us if we had got into office. The Prime Minister asked me the question: what would you cut? What we are talking on the about here is $100 million, perhaps $120 million or $130 million, in a $130 billion budget. You get up there and talk about the needs of our river systems and the needs of our coasts, and you are not prepared to put up $130 million in a $130 billion budget. I tum the question back on him. Is it worth the last $100 million in our $5 billion worth of expenditure on education? Is it worth the last $100 million in our $18 billion worth of expenditure on health? Is it worth ""the last $100 million in our $34 billion worth of expenditure on social security? Those are the budget realities. This $1 billion con job is simply that-a con job. It is a means of trying to shift out of what is essential public expenditure when there are public expenditures of nowhere near that level of priority locked up in $130 billion worth of spending. It is an attempt to say that we will cobble all together what the previous government was doing; we will put all the programs in one pot; and we will cut forward outlays in environmental spending and substitute it with this process. So we are not conned by it. We are not conned by the argument which goes to the fact that you think you can preserve community service obligations, when anyone who knows a dam bit about the changing technology in communications knows that that is impossible. We are not conned by any flowery words about the survival of our electronics industry, when we know that the British industry and the New Zealand industry-and certainly the British industry is a much stronger one than ours--can survive simply by chitchat. We are not conned when we know, because of our own experience, what obligations are on directors once it is partially out there in private ownership. We know exactly what those obligations are. We are not conned by that. So we are going to oppose this in the national interest. We are opposing it in the interest of competition. We are opposing it in the interests of decent environmental policy, which any government, including yours, ought to consider including in their normal budget provision. We are opposing it in the interests of the Australian consumer. We are opposing it particularly in the interests consumer who lives in the bush or regional Australia or in our smaller states, because we know from the example of what is happening with pay TV that you can write that large for future provision of telecommunications requirements in those areas. But, above all, we are opposing it in the interests of Australian industry and the Australian community. We are opposing it in the interests of decent privatisation policy. We are opposing it in the interests of our community. (Time expired)",26
10,Mr VAILE,Unknown,"It is interesting to see that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has seen fit to come into the House today in the middle of the speakers list to state the case for the opposition as far as the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill is concerned. There is one very clear difference between the coalition, the now government, and the Labor Party, the former government, on privatisation; that is, the coalition has always been prepared to be quite open and honest with the Australian people about what we want to do and what we want to see happen as far as the ownership of publicly owned assets in this nation is concerned. We have always been very up-front, open and frank with the people of Australia about what our policies are. They have been clearly enunciated prior to winning the 2 March election all the way up until winning that election-particularly over the last three or four years with regard to the likes of the Commonwealth Bank, where we had absolutely no problem at all in telling the people of Australia exactly where we stood on privatisation, particularly in that area and in other areas, unlike the Labor Party. Just before we start talking about this particular bill, because the debate has been very wide rangingMr Adams-What about the bush, mate?",30
11,Mr VAILE,Unknown,"Where were you on the vote on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, Dick? Where were you?",30
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair. The name is of the Australian not 'Dick'.,30
13,Mr VAILE,Unknown,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I acknowledge that. The thing is, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall what happened last year when this House debated the sale of the last half of the Commonwealth Bank, when the Labor Party vowed and declared to the people of Australia on a stack of bibles that they would never it. The then Treasurer, the former finance minister, the member for GelIibrand (Mr Willis), signed off on the prospectus when they sold the first tranche of the Commonwealth Bank that the second half, over 50 per cent, of the Commonwealth Bank would remain in public ownership. It was only a matter of years and they were back in here, in the budget last year, announcing that they were going to sell the second half of the Commonwealth Bank. They did not even tell their own backbenchers. Because the coalition, in opposition at the time, ported the policy of privati sing the Commonwealth Bank, they thought that the debate would roll through the parliament, that there would be no division and they could do it nicely and quietly and get away with it. That was the left-wing members in particular. Remember all the left-wing members in the Labor Party who were really annoyed when in the 37th Parliament the two Independents that were sitting here-that was the then member for Wills, Mr Cleary, and the then member for North Sydney, Mr Mack-called a division? The reason they called a division on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank was to throw the spotlight on the hypocrisy of the Labor Party and what they were doing in privatisation. They told the people in Australpeople is that they would never sell the second half of the Commonwealth Bank. They said that they would not do it. They went back on their word. On the day when the debate concluded, I was in the chair. I thought that the bill be passed on the voices and we would go on to the next piece of legislation before the House. The then member for Wills jumped up and called out no. I said, 'Do the noes have it?' Both the then member for North Sydney and the then member for Wills opposed it and called a division. That was much to the chagrin of the Labor Party because ali the left into place. wing of the Labor Party-and their predecessors were turning in their graves-were under all sorts of pressure from left-wing unions and left-wing branches, and they were absolutely livid about having to come in here and support their then leader in the privatisation of sell the Commonwealth Bank. They all sat over there with us, all the opposition and the government of the day, and voted for the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. We had two Independents opposing it, and they were up there counting the vote. Also, we had photographers in that day. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that a few days later the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) asked questions of the Speaker as to whether the photographers were authorised to take photographs that afternoon. He wanted to know what the situation was and to sup- get a ruling from the Speaker. He was not concerned about the procedures of the House and whether they had been authorised by the Speaker of the day. What he was concerned about was being photographed voting to sell the Commonwealth Bank. That is the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. So the Leader of the Opposition comes in here today and says, 'We're going to vote against this. We're going to oppose it. We're going to do all sorts of things.' They expected and got the coalition's support on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, because we clearly set out to the people of Australia in the years we were in opposition that that was part of our policy. Coming up to the 2 March federal election this year, we clearly set out to the of Australia what our policy was with regard to privatisation and the sale of one-third of Telstra. We have been perfectly frank with the people of Australia on what we are going to sell; how much foreign ownership will be would allowed; what we are going to keep; where the money is going to go to; and the process that will take place. Here, in the second sitting week of the 38th Parliament-after we won the election with an enormous mandate based on the policies we put forward with regard to the privatisation of Telstra-we are debating the bill that we said we would put Who are the Australian people going to believe? Before 2 March they certainly did not believe the then Prime Minister when he stood at public meetings around Australia with his hand on his heart and said, 'We will never sell Telstra.' The people in my electorate who used to be Labor supporters said, 'Yes, we remember when he said, ""We will never sell the Commonwealth Bank. We will never sell Australian Airlines. We will never sell Qantas. We will never sell the Federal Airports Corporation.'"" The people of Australia will not buy the argument that the Leader of the Opposition is putting: there is a difference between this of privatisation and that type of privatisation. It is utter nonsense. He knows that very well. The Labor Party are absolutely without credibility on this public policy issue. The Leader of the Opposition is trying to cast aspersions on this bill and the way we propose to proceed with the sale of one-third of Telstra by comparing the situation with the sales of British Telecom and Telecom in New Zealand. He knows that they were done differently. They were put on the open market and sold completely. The opposition knows very well that no regulatory controls were put over and above those publicly owned monopolies before they were sold. The Leader of the Opposition knows very well why there are problems in those areas. Many members of the Labor Party have been involved in Public Accounts Committee inquiries and have been overseas to look at communications systems, and they know exactly what the pitfalls are. So does the government of today. That is why there will be sound regulations implemented with regard to the protection of community service obligations, and that is why the concerns that the Leader of the Opposition has just raised in his address to the House a while ago will be addressed. The opposition leader spoke about the imperatives for public ownership. I ask-and the people of Australia should ask themselves this question-what the imperatives of the Labor Party were so far as public and private ownership of public monopolies were concerned in the last parliament. What were the Labor Party's imperatives when they sold the second half of the Commonwealth Bank after they had promised on a stack of bibles that they would not do so? The then finance minister signed a public document, which anybody in the private sector would sign under normal Corporations Law. It said that they would not sell any more of the Commonwealth Bank, that it would remain in public ownership. They went back on their word. The signature of the member for Gellibrand was on that document when it was floated. The people of Australia know that the Labor Party is without credibility on this type issue. They know what the imperatives of the Labor Party were. The 1995-96 budget, brought down in August, purported to have a $700 miIIion surplus. But it was all based on assets sales. They were factoring assets sales into the budget. Every single economic commentator around Australia said that you cannot do that. What did the Labor Party do with the proceeds of assets sales? They spent it on recurrent funding programs and all the government programs. They did not do the responsible thing and use any part of those assets sales, which they oversaw while they were in government, to reduce Commonwealth debt. They did not even attempt to do that. It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition is asking what our imperatives for the privatisation of public assets are. We ask what the Labor Party's imperatives were on the assets sale program that they oversaw in the years that they were in government. There were pages and pages of them. I have mentioned only a few. There were pages of all the different things that they had flogged off. But they never ever applied one cent of that money to retiring public debt and reducing the interest that the taxpayers of Australia pay on that public debt every month when the balance of payments deficit figure comes in. The most recent figure was $1.5 billion. An element of that is Commonwealth interest that we are paying to service that debt. The Leader of the Opposition has, in the middle of this debate, put the opposition's case that they are going to oppose this bill. They are trying to resurrect this debate from where it is today on behalf of the Labor Party. They are trying to get the Labor Party back into this debate. But, in the public arena, read: it is an impossible task for them. They cannot do it. They have been discredited, and they cannot do it on the argument of privatisation. The one great furphy, the one great thorn in their sides, is the dead cat that the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) will drag around his ankle for the rest of his political career-ANL. How many times did the opposition try to address that? How many times did they try to sell it? The former minister said publicly that they could not give it away. Yet the former government kept on pouring taxpayers' money into it. If anything should have been got rid of, it should have been ANL. We are losing money. The former governhave ment has lost hundreds of millions of dollars of money through ANL. They were not allowed to get rid of ANL. The question should be put to the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson): why were they not allowed to get rid of it? Why are the taxpayers of Australia subsidising the PAYE tax of seaputting farers who belong to the Maritime Union Australia? That is a another debate, but links into the privatisation debate. Do not let the people of Australia lose sight of what the Labor Party did over the last three years in this area of public policy. Labor members will have the ANL dead cat drag around them for the rest of their political careers. I refer to what the government is proposing to do through the Telstra bill. It proposes sell one-third of the Commonwealth's equity, which will be made available through a share float and of which 65 per cent will be reserved for Australian investors as A· class shares. So only one-third of the value Telstra is to be sold and 65 per cent of that one-third is to remain in Australian ownercitizens ship. The bill states the intentions of the government for the sale of Telstra. The Bills Digest reads: Foreign investors only to be allowed to subscribe to thirty five per cent of the float and to be issued with B class shares. No foreign investor to be allowed to acquire more than five per of the one-third float. That is on an individual basis. It goes on to Incentives to be provided to Australian citizens and Telstra employees to encourage participation in the float. Telstra not to be broken up. Telstra to remain incorporated in Australia with an Australian citizen as Chainnan of the Board, of which a majority will also be Australians. Government to reserve right to veto any excessive management remuneration. The Community Service Obligations (CSOs) of telecommunication carriers to be maintained, along with the requirement for such carriers to contribute to a Universal Service Levy to meet the cost of the CSOs. I will stop there. Mr Deputy Speaker, during the federal election campaign, you would been treated-just as I was-to the outrageous garbage that was printed by the Labor Party and allowed to be distributed throughout Australian electorates. The people who were in government in this country for 13 years showed an absolute disregard for the laws of this land. They were running around stickers opposing the sale of Telstra, of which they knew were illegal, on telephone it boxes. In my electorate the federal police investigated the Labor candidate in his campaign office for distributing fake $20 bills. That was a hangover from the 1993 election. Who printed and authorised the bills? Who printed and authorised the stickers that were on all the phone boxes in my electorate? The union movement. The union movement underwrote the Labor Party's election campaigns in 1993 and in 1996. It was an absoto lutely despicable way of campaigning. As you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the worse element of the Telstra debate throughout the 1996 election campaign of was the way the Labor Party showed absolutely no concern for the feelings of elderly in the community by sending out fake Telstra telephone accounts. Those fake accounts went to constituents of mine and I will guarantee that they went to constituents in every electorate in Australia. It was an absolute disgrace. The Leader of the Opposition should take responsibility for that as the cent leader of the Labor Party in Australia. It happened in every electorate in Australia. I had an unbelievable number of telephone calls from concerned people saying, 'I paid my telephone bill last week. Why am I getting another bill from Telstra? You're my federal member. Can you find out about it?' They were the tactics used by the Labor Party. That is the depth that the Labor Party have reached in public debate in Australia today. It emanated from the Prime Minister of the day. We can only trust that things might improve from here. We ran the privatisation debate on a fectly public and honest level. We announced it well in advance of 2 March when the people had to go to the polling booth. They knew exactly what was going to happen to Telstra if they installed a coalition governbecome ment. But the Labor Party were desperate because their public policy on this issue had absolutely no credibility. They are still rate today. When the Leader of the Opposition comes into this House and tells the people of tralia that the Labor Party are going to vote against this bill, it only reinforces what the people of Australia know: the Labor Party cannot be believed. They could not believe the Labor Party with the part sale of the Commonwealth Bank when it was floated. of They could not believe them with the sale of Qantas, the Federal Airports Corporation, ANL and they can't believe them now. The Labor Party are going to come in here and obstructionist and vote against this. They going to whip the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Kernot, into a frenzy. It just will wash with the people of Australia. There has been a number of media comequitable mentaries about the stand the Democrats taken against the sale of Telstra. They have taken that stand on the false premise that, carriers. because they have seven seats in the Senate, the people of Australia want them to oppose the government legislation. That is absolutely ludicrous. I have newspaper articles here with the headlines 'NFF slams Kernot's stand on Telstra' and 'Kernot and Chipp differ over sale of Telstra'. Don Chipp is the founder the Democrats-the reason they exist An editorial in the Financial Review is headlined 'Democrats wrong on Telstra sale'. The Democrats should read this. They should get out in the community and try to gauge the public feeling about this matter. The public want to see more competition in the telecommunications field. We are going to progress that much further. The public want to see government monopolies operating properly in the commercial field. It would be interesting for the opposition to note what the situation is. They know very weIl the management and accountancy practices of all governperment agencies. Under the Labor administration Commonwealth agencies did not even attempt to introduce any form of accrual accounting into their management practices. Through partial privatisation, Telstra will a far more responsible, competitive and efficient corporate citizen in Australia. Before my time expires I want to highlight despea couple of very important points. Another Labor lie that was trotted around during the election campaign was about the cost of Austelephone services to people in rural and regional Australia. It was another furphy. Under this legislation we are guaranteeing the community service obligations. The National Party gets slated for joining the Liberal Party in going down the line of privatising one-third Telstra. The people of Australia, particularly those in rural and regional Australia, have and no need to worry about the backbone of National Party members with regard to the be CSOs and the provision of services. We are are going to guarantee those. The government has reaffirmed in the bill its commitment to the not key consumer safeguard-the universal provision of service. All Australians will continue to have reasonable access on an basis to the standard telephone and have payphone services. The universal service obligations will continue to be funded by the At this point it is worth correcting Senator Kernot, who has said that the usa provisions are a substantially watered down version of those in the current act. That is rubbish, just the as the propaganda put out by the Labor Party of during the election campaign was rubbish. today. The USOs remain. (Time expired)",30
14,Mr WILTON,Unknown,"The opposition is firmly of the view that no part of Telstra should be sold. We are committed to a 100 per cent government owned carrier for this nation. We believe that selling all or part of Telstra represents an act of gross irresponsibility. The opposition will not be supporting the sale of Telstra on the basis that it will be a more competitive company once it has been sold, as the government claims. Nor will the opposition support the government's scurrilous suggestions on talkback radio that mums and dads will be able to own a greater share of Telstra, having participated in its privatisation. Clearly, Australians have been able to purchase a share of Telstra over the years by virtue of the fact that they have paid their telephone bills. To link the passage of this bill, which will see the beginning of the total privatisation of one of the Australian public's most lucrative and strategically important assets, to foreign owners with the establishment of a capital trust to fund environmental programs is perhaps one of the lowest examples of political expediency that this House has ever seen. By comparison, Labor's approach to the environment came with no qualification. We believe that the environment should be funded in an ongoing manner simply in the same way that other key areas such as health and education are funded. Labor has had a long and abiding commitment to landcare, coast care and the restoration of the Murray-Darling Basin-long before the environment ever became a contemporary issue in the minds of the government. This has also been done without any reference whatsoever to blackmail of the kind perpetrated by this government on the Senate. Telstra is a strong and vibrant company. It is vigorously and successfully seeking new markets in Asia and across the world. Its value has increased from $18 billion at the time when John Hewson attempted to sell it to around $24 billion today. These figures, and the fact that it has made a half-yearly 1995-96 profit of $1.853 billion, certainly put paid to any government claims that Telstra cannot be managed efficiently if it remains within the public sector. Let us not kid ourselves for a moment that the short-sighted and ideologically driven legislation that is before the chamber today, aimed at selling one-third of Telstra, will inevitably lead to the sale of the whole of Telstra, as Senator Alston's speech on 30 April of this year has made quite clear. There is no doubt that the government will try to cloud the waters in this debate by making a spurious claim, as it has already this morning on several occasions, that the Labor government's approach to the sale of Telstra is no different to the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. This attempt to muddy these waters is grossly misleading, and I wish to take some time to set out some of the reasons why. Telstra provides nearly 90 per cent of this nation's telecommunications services. As such, it has inherent natural monopoly characteristics. It is Australia's largest government owned asset and part of Australia's social infrastructure. Neither Qantas nor the Commonwealth Bank could lay claim to such positions. Nor could they lay claim to the market dominance that Telstra currently enjoys. Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank do not impact upon genuine issues of national interest. The Commonwealth Bank serviced only about 20 per cent of the banking sector of Australia. Many of its functions, which at that time set the standards for conduct of banks in this nation, have long since been passed and allocated to the Reserve Bank. Similarly, Qantas enjoys only about 50 per cent of the domestic air travel business and less than 40 per cent of the international travel market in and out of Australia. Obviously, only a small proportion of Australians fly on a regular basis. I should point out that both the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas regularly require capital injections of federal funds from time to time to expand their businesses. Telstra raises all its own investment funds without a drain on the federal Treasury for capital expenditure. Unlike Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra provides an established world-class telecommunications network to all Australians at reasonable cost. Telstra has already been corporatised and is performing very well in international markets. Telstra, that great Australian corporation, I have alluded to, posted a post-tax profit of $1.753 biIIion in its 1994-95 financial year. This leads me to suggest that Telstra's total value added represents 2.2 per cent of GDP. Of course, Telstra pays substantial income tax. Last year $649 million was paid to the federal government. Telstra, as a public corporation, does not seek to minimise its tax payments, yet once privati sed there is no doubt that Telstra will minimise its tax payments significantly. Not only will Telstra's community service obligations be diminished, but it will minimise its tax payments to the government, resulting in even further cuts to government services to all Australians who, through the payment of their phone bills over the years, now effectively own a share of Telstra in their own right. Telstra paid a dividend of $944 million to the federal government last year. In the event that one-third of Telstra is privatised, one-third of this dividend will be lost. It goes without saying that, in the likely event that of Telstra is privatised, all of this income would be lost as revenue. In its current form Telstra's returns to government will continue to grow and expand. That proportion of privatised Telstra's dividend which will go overseas will be added to our own current account deficit. As I have emphasised, Telstra is 100 per cent Australian owned. The parliament, and through it the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), is responsible for all service deliveries and is responsible if service is not adequately delivered to the Australian communication consumer. Service is being delivered. As the member for Kalgoodie (Mr Campbell) said in this place last night, Telstra is perhaps the greatest communications carrier in the world today. If one-third of this great communications carrier is floated, despite having two-thirds of the shares, the minister, and therefore the parliament, will not be able to intervene in the running of the corporation. The bill before the parliament repeals the power of the minister to direct the board in the national interest. This means that a company which is 70 per cent owned by Australas ians will act according to the views of all directors, including foreign directors. This will undermine the undertakings in the bill to protect Australian consumers. The minister can investigate or conduct inquiries into the performance of a privatised Telstra but can she or he act on information revealed? The answer is absolutely no. Furthermore, the minister cannot vary the Telstra corporate plan prepared by the board. What is more, there will be no separate shares for foreigners as promised during the election campaign. The coalition wrote this promise to control levels of foreign ownership of Telstra by issuing A class shares to Australian nationals and B class shares to foreigners. Scrapping this commitment will no doubt make it easier for foreigners to acquire shares beyond the existing 11 per cent limit. I want to know, in particular, what has happened to that promise. Th- role of Telstra' s board of directors will all be to maximise profits and, therefore, returns to shareholders. This will be done fundamentally by increasing the cost of installation and calls, by decreasing levels of employment and by decreasing community service obligations. The dramatic cost increases predicted from the sale of Telstra will hit the cost of the average telephone user squarely in the neck. The telecommunications industry and all those ancillary companies that depend so heavily on Telstra for their very existence will also be hit squarely in the neck. Over 70 per cent of Telstra's equipment, materials and services purchases are from Australian firms, big and small. A privatised Telstra would not be required to maintain the purchasing policies that the former government put in place when OTC was combined with Telecom-as it was then-several years ago to form Telstra. The size and economies of scale generated by Telstra provide a hub around which a multitude of ancillary industries that make up a diverse range of the communications network industry revolve. Not only does the existing employment level of Telstra generate demand within the economy but so does the corporation itself. I repeat that a privati sed Telstra with greatly depleted employment levels would not be required to sustain existing Australian orientlay ed purchasing policies of the kind that exist with our national carrier of communications today. There is no doubt, as the Leader position (Mr Beazley) put so succinctly in his speech to this place a moment ago, that this would herald the end of the Australian electronics industry. Instead, under foreign directhese tion, Telstra will look to more convenient ways of making profits. This bill does not prevent a privatised Telstra from charging for directory assistance. This would increase revenue by $80 million per annum at the expense, in particular, of the sight and hearing impaired and, to a lesser degree, mobile phone users. Similarly, the impost of a charge for directory services would have an impact on the elderly. Telstra remains a major exporter of telecommunications equipment and services. The increase in exports from approximately $50 million in 1983 to nearly $1 billion today has had significant positive benefits and impacts upon our foreign debt. The Asian telecommunications market is the biggest potential market in the world. When foreign telecommunications companies take a share in Telstra they will not be enthusiastic about Telstra competing with their own companies overseas in those international markets. I tum now to the crucial issue of community service obligations. Telstra is required to provide a universal service to all Australians and to ensure equity for all Australians. We do not want to develop a structure of information rich and information poor Australians. Universal service obligations are basically defined in the Telecommunications Act 1991 wherein they are outlined as being to ensure that the standard telephone service is reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on . an equitable basis. It is the responsibility of Telstra to meet these community service obligations. Under the previous government this was done admirably because the previous government had acknowledged that social policy considerations, as well as questions of market power, behind the application of price controls over Telstra. These controls are necessary to ensure that prices remain affordable in the loss making universal service areas, particuof the Op- larly those areas in the bush. Telstra's universal service obligations will be of no interest whatsoever to a profit-driven board of directors. The watering down of universal service obligations will, as I have alluded to, be bad for rural and regional Australia because these USOs underpin subsidies to those areas. Will a foreign, profitdriven owner regard such subsidies as being economically feasible or viable? I think not. All those opposite with electorates in rural and regional Australia ought to hang on to their Akubras because, on the basis of subsidy withdrawal, they might find themselves out of a job come the next election. It is of some bewilderment to me that the seat of Farrer, which is occupied by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), received $5.8 million in subsidies last year and the seat of Gwydir, which is occupied by his colleague, the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson), received $13.5 million in subsidies last year. That these two gentlemen and others of their ilk would vote against this amendment is absurd in the extreme. In my own electorate of Isaacs, we have the rapidly growing outlying suburb of Cranbourne on the south-eastern fringe of Melbourne. Cranbourne lies within the 059 SID area code, and on behalf of its people I will be doing all that I can to ensure that it is drawn within the 03 Melbourne area code as soon as possible. However, my task will no doubt be made much more difficult by the fact that directors of the new foreign owned Telstra will pay no heed to the needs of people on the outlying fringes of such metropolitan cities who wish to be incorporated within the 03 and other metropolitan area codes for obvious reasons of cost. In conclusion, this bill constitutes nothing more than privatisation for privatisation' s sake. In a January AGB MCNair poll, 61 per cent of the people stated that they were opposed to the sale of Telstra in any form. We should not let outsiders profit from the sale of Telstra, one of the world's finest communication carriers, simply because the government maintains a dogged adherence to a failed political ideology. We ought not to forget that Telstra does not need capital injections; it makes a profit and is viable in its own right. It drives the Australian electronics industry, which depends on Telstra's domestic purchases for its very existence. In 1983, as I have already stated, our electronics industry exported $50 million worth of goods per annum and that same domestic electronics industry now exports some $1 billion worth of goods per annum. If privatised, there is one thing you will be able to do with Telstra-that is, maintain a quality of subsidised service if you do not own it. That ought to be borne critically in the minds of those opposite, particularly in the minds of those who occupy the many rural and marginal seats which were gained by the government at the last election, which, as I say, they may not hold come the next election. In commending the amendment to the House, I suggest that all members examine critically the experiences of those in New Zealand and Britain where profits have risen, the number of jobs has fallen and dividends paid to shareholders have gone through the roof. That is not the sort of Telstra we want to see in Australia. We do not want to see Telstra privati sed simply for the sake of some outdated, incorrect political ideology. I commend the bill to the House.",34
15,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"It is a pleasure to speak on this Telstra bill this morning. I say at the outset that I appreciate that the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) is new to this place but can he do us all a favour, please? We do not particularly like city slickers talking about rural and regional matters, especially when they know absolutely nothing about them. From the speeches I have heard today, I find it quite extraordinary that the opposition has become the privatisation hypocrite. The rhetoric I have heard over the last two days hus been quite mind blowing. What intrigues me most is that the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), came in here this morning desperately searching for another arrow to put into his bow. The doozey we got this morning was his comment, 'We were going to do it anyway. If you look at the forward estimates, it was all going to be there and there is not one single cent going in.' What absolute bunkum that is. Despite all the fanfare from the Labor Party and its failed Prime Minister, Mr Keating, despite all the rhetoric and despite all the hubbub that surrounded the election of the member for Brand as the opposition leader, the Leader of the Opposition is very rapidly not proving himself to be a significant failure in his job. If he is really serious about this, if he does not want to be labelled a hypocrite along with the rest of his colleagues, he needs to have a very long, hard look at his party's approach to the sale of Telstra. Mr Martin-Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I have been listening very carefully, as I always do, to my friend and colleague the honourable member for Ballarat. I understood that the use of the term 'hypocrite' in that particular context was always considered unparliamentary. In the case in which the honourable member used it, it was a direct reflection on one of my colleagues. I ask that it be withdrawn. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Crosio)-The member for Cunningham has asked the member for Ballarat to withdraw, and he is quite correct in his point of order.",38
16,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on indulgence, I said that if he does not want to be accused of being a hypocrite he will not proceed down this path. With the greatest respect to my friend and colleague the member for Cunningham, I did not accuse him. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-You have been asked on a point of order to withdraw it.",38
17,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"I have not accused the Leader of the Opposition of being a hypocrite. I said that if he does not want to be labelled as a hypocrite in the future he will not proceed down this path. With the greatest respect, I have a reputation for withdrawing if I am asked to do so on reasonable grounds. I certainly did not accuse him of being a hypocrite. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The honourable member for Cunningham has raised the point. We would have to refer to Hansard to see how you used the word. Offence has been taken and I would ask the honourable member for Ballarat to rephrase the sentence where he has used that word and to withdraw that word from it.",38
18,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"If the Leader of the Opposition does not want to be accused of being a hypocrite in the future, he will not proceed down that path. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I have asked you to withdraw it.",39
19,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"With the greatest respect, I have not accused the Leader of the Opposition of being a hypocrite. I said he placed himself at risk of being accused of being a hypocrite further down the track. Mr Martin-Madam Deputy Speaker, on another point of order, perhaps just to assist my friend and colleague across the chamber: he used words to the effect 'like his other colleagues'. To that extent, I believe it was reflection on people on our side of the parliahe ment. It is that section which I would ask the honourable member to reflect on and to withdraw.",39
20,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"I can understand the opposition's sensitivity on the matter. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-We do not have to debate the point of order. I said there was a point of order, and I ask the member for Ballarat to rephrase his sentence in that regard or withdraw that word completely from the sentence.",39
21,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"As I said, I can understand their sensitivity. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The member for Ballarat will withdraw. You may continue the debate if you have now withdrawn. You do not have to debate the point of order.",39
22,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"I am quite happy to withdraw it, if any offence was taken. Mr Martin-Thanks, neighbour.",39
23,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"That's all right. The Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition have got themselves into extraordinary trouble with this bill. They were the great privatisers of the 1980s and 1990s and, all of a sudden, when they get across to the other side of the chamber-where they will be for a long time, as I am sure the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn) would agree-they start playing petty politics. I can tell you now that the Australian people will not fall for petty politics. I find it quite extraordinary that the new member for Isaacs, who was sworn in a week and a half ago, seems to have forgotten that one of the key elements of the coalition's approach to the Australian people-when we received a resounding victory, one of the greatest victories in this country's political history-was the partial sale of Telstra to provide some desperately needed funds for the environment. The Australian people voted with their feet. I know that the Leader of the Opposition finds it attractive to play party politics, but he is going down the wrong track. His little a doozey during his speech this morning when suddenly said, 'We were going to do it in the forward estimates anyway,' I can assure you would not fool even the most gullible. I am not surprised that his preferred Prime Minister rating is languishing only at 25 per cent. It can only head south rather than north if he keeps up this sort of carry-on. This bill will enable the government to deliver on its election promises and be upfront with the Australian people about its privatisation plans. The House should be in no doubt that the benefits of this bill will be counted by many future generations. It should not be jeopardised by outdated ideological beliefs or petty politics. A fast, efficient and affordable communications system is necessary for our economic and social development. With systems like the Internet and email becoming an integral part of our daily lives, it is important that Australia has a first class system to keep abreast of these changes. We all know how vital an efficient communications system is, be it for something as simple as ordering our takeaway at night or for something as complex as delivering medical services across the country. Without an effective communications system this country will be adrift. It would be fair to say that Australian users of telecommunications services have been left out. They do not have the services they should, prices are too high, productivity is too low, and there is an urgent need to improve service quality. A new approach is needed, and it is being delivered by this government. The principal purpose of this bill is to facilitate the sale of up to one-third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra. At the same time this bill will impose strict aggregate and individual foreign ownership limits to ensure that Telstra is and remains Australian owned and controlled. It was a very clear part of our election platform that Telstra should remain Australian owned and controlled, and indeed that is the very base upon which the Australian people voted on this matter. As a sign of the government's genuine commitment to ensure that consumers are protected under the partial privatisation of Telstra, this bill will require general communications carriers to provide the option of untimed local calls to all-and I underline 'all'--customers in local call areas, as well as introducing a new customer service guarantee. From this partial privatisation, a Natural Heritage Trust will be established to protect and rehabilitate Australia's natural heritage. Telstra's partial privatisation will go to retire debt and will not fund recurrent expenditure as the Labor Party did. Every piece of privatisation it brought through in its 13 years was to fund recurrent expenditure. To partially privatise Telstra is to make the company even more responsive to market signals and to allow it to better compete on the domestic and international stage. Members should also note that this bill contains a single provision which will enable the sale of only one-third of the Commonwealth's equity in Telstra. The bill does not allow the Commonwealth's equity to fall below two-thirds, reflecting the government's undertaking at the last election. It is important to note that the sale proceeds will provide special incentives for individual Australians and Telstra employees to invest in their company. As part of the sale process, the government will examine appropriate mechanisms to enable the allocation of Telstra shares to a wide spread of Australian investors, including institutional investors and members of the Australian community. In many cases these will be the mums and dads of our community investing in a piece of our country. A $1 billion commitment to Australia's environment will be one of the results of Telstra's partial privatisation. The benefits to the Australian community of these measures will be enormous. We will at last be able to tackle the problem of land and water degradation and we will have for the first time in Australia's history a national appraisal of the extent of our land and water degradation. We will have a national river care initiative which will assist local communities in the restoration of their rivers and waterways. We will be able to tackle the environmental problems facing our coasts and oceans. We will have additional funding to assist in the management and upkeep of Australia's world heritage areas. We will be able to introduce a range of measures to address the problem of air pollution in major cities. It is in these ways that the Australian people will be the benefactors of the Telstra partial privatisation. It will be all Australian people-those in rural, regional and city areas-who will benefit from these measures. Never before has a government stood on the threshold of delivering such a comprehensive environmental package to our nation. Given the essential nature of the environmental programs which will result from the passing of this bill, it is a pity that this bill could not have received bipartisan support. Had those opposite been serious and genuine in their commitment to government controlled assets then perhaps we would have taken notice of their arguments. But they are neither serious nor genuine. Labor is about as genuine in their opposition to the partial privatisation of Telstra as they were in their opposition to the privatisation of Qantas, the F AC and-who could forget-the Commonwealth Bank. Had Labor been in government, the 'For sale' sign would have gone up on Telstrajust as quickly as it did on these assets. Indeed, during the campaign it became very clear that the Labor Party was actually in the process of selling off chunks of Telstra. Even Graham Richardson made it clear that, rather than sell only one-third of Telstra as the present government is about to do, former Prime Minister Keating wanted to sell the whole lot. Have no doubt: if Keating had had his way and his proposal had gone to caucus those who are now debating Telstra's partial privatisation would have put their hands up to sell off the lot. The ALP are not interested in what is best for Australia; they are only interested in being vindictive and in nursing their own bruised egos. The best the ALP can offer this debate is the suggestion that funding for certain environmental programs should come from elsewhere, but where? As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said the other day, do they want to cut pensions, funding to schools, funding to health? Where is the money going to come from? I notice that the Left is now advocating a GST, a consumption tax. Is this where the Labor Party want the money to come from? Maybe they advocate an environment levy. Or perhaps they want to fund the environment by adding to debt. Not content with the $8 billion deficit legacy to the nation, they apparently want a further mortgage on our children and grandchildren. When I listen to this debate I ask myself: why do the ALP really oppose this bill? We have already established that it is not because they are against privatisation. In fact, they advocates of such policies. Maybe the ALP are just opposed to increased spending on the environment. Perhaps they are opposed to cleaner water. Perhaps they are opposed to protection for endangered species. Perhaps they are opposed to fixing up the Murray-Darling Basin. Perhaps the ALP are opposed to workers benefiting from Telstra's partial privatisation. As we all know, for every three shares of Telstra purchased by employees, they will receive an extra one free. These workers are the average mums and dads of Australia, young men and women trying hard to make a living. But the ALP want to deny them a chance for a bit more financial security. Is it any wonder that it is these people who walked away from the Labor Party in droves? Is it any wonder that the ALP no longer represent workers? They certainly do not represent Telstra workers. Clearly, nobody can really know why the ALP are opposing this bill. I suspect that they really do not know themselves. During the last election campaign there was a lot of misinformation put out by those opposite. I know because a lot of it was in my electorate. There were claims that the government's plan would lead to timed local calls. Wrong. As we can see from this bill, that is not the case. There were accusations that Telstra would not remain Australian owned. Again, as we can see from the bill, that is wrong. Those opposite should note that this bill amends the Telstra Corporation Act to ensure that Telstra's head office, base of operations and incorporation remain in Australia and that its chairman and the majority of its directors are Australian citizens. Those opposite claim that consumers would be the losers from this initiative but, again, this legislation makes a mockery of that claim. On the contrary, this bill proposes a new scheme for customer service guarantee, which we hope will actually lead to an increase in customer service, rather than a withdrawal. This bill will set performance standards for carriers in relation to arrangements about the period taken for connection of telecommunications services, for rectifying are faults and service difficulties and for keeping appointments with customers. Those carriers who fail to comply with performance standards will have penalties imposed upon them. Surely this legislation sets the scene for what will prove to be an effective and efficient delivery of services to customers. Those opposite should also note that this bill reaffinns the government's commitment to the key consumer safeguard: the provision of universal service. Under the government, all Australians will continue to have regional access on an equitable basis to the standard telephone service and payphone service. In a democracy, people are entitled to receive what they vote for. On 2 March the Australian people voted for this bill, and they voted very clearly. This point should not be lost on the opposition or the Australian Democrats. The Democrats know that they have a moral duty to vote with the government on this bill for it is the want of the overwhelming majority of Australians. When talking about the importance of an effective communications system, we should ensure that it is a system for all Australians, not just those in the city regions. I would to add to some of the points raised by my colleague the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who spoke recently. He spoke about the lack of services for country people. I can assure him that he is not alone in his concerns. I have had many constituents over previous years complain to me about the lack of service they have access to. I talk about basic items that those in metropolitan areas take for granted-itemised phone bills and mobile phone facilities. Some people cannot even get analog, let alone digital. Another example relates to community information services, such as the poisons line. There are country families living on farms who cannot even access basic information such as the poisons line. If we achieve only one thing out of this Telstra privatisation-1 suspect that we are going to achieve a hell of a lot more-then if we can start delivering a bit of equity to country and regional people from this bill we will have served a very great purpose, in my view. This legislation has the potential to deliver to Australia a first-class environment and a world-class communications system. If we are to show off our nation at the Olympics in the year 2000 as a green nation, then we desperately need to set up the Natural Heritage Trust, and this legislation will make that possible. In the minutes remaining to me, I want to tell those opposite-! am very pleased that there are very few of them now representing rural and regional electorates-that their gross ignorance of the problems this country faces is a very sad reflection upon all of them. They really do not understand the waterways network in this country and the very grave risk this country faces if we do not do something about water quality. They should go out, find out something about it and come back into this House and apologise. This bill is about finally addressing some of the environmental issues, such as the proliferation and rapid spread of blue-green algae through the waterways in my own state of Victoria and the severe degradation of water quality and the problems we are getting upstream and downstream. The member for like Eden-Monaro knows exactly what I am talking about. This is water quality from upstream and downstream. We do not have time to procrastinate in this House about selling off one-third of Telstra to pay for desperately needed environmental measures. I am sick and tired of the Democrats, in the other house, talking about their environmental bone fides and their green credentials. They have none as a result of their stand on this Telstra privatisation bill. For the leader of the Democrats to march around this country and say that she has got carte blanche to oppose it is absolute rubbish. Part of this government's commitment to the Australian people with the partial privatisation of Telstra was that we were going to put $1 billion into the environment. The Australian people know full well that it is desperately needed. They know that we have to start addressing land degradation problems. They know that we have to start addressing water quality problems. Those from the city have spent more time going on Sunday drives in the bush and they can see it for themselves. They can see the salt patches on the side of the road. They have friends who live in the country who tell them about the water quality problem. They know clearly that we have but one chance to address these problems and I do not want to see the Labor Party blow it. (Time expired)",39
24,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,"The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill raises a number of very important issues, including those raised by the previous speaker, the member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson). I hope to cast a very different light on the government's proposal. First of all, it is important to say that we on this side believe there are arguments for privatisation of publicly owned assets from time to time, but the situation must be very carefully assessed before the judgment is made to move from full public ownership to either part or full private ownership. It is often necessary-if you look at the history of this country, it has been-for the public sector to provide goods and services when either the risk level, the size or duration of the investment and likely returns means that the private sector is not interested. In history of his country, governments at various times have owned breweries, brickworks, and so on, which we no longer own. Transferring assets to the private sector may later be justified by the public being able to fund new areas of service or development and where there is appropriate provision in the private sector, as has occurred with the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas sales. But the sale of Telstra is clearly not in that category. I believe that there is a very firm commitment by the Australian people, and by at least this side of the parliament, to the need for public ownership and control of what are general utilities and essential services. Certainly, Telstra fits into this category. The telephone and associated telecommunications are not something to be used by a small proportion of the community. They are not discretionary; they are essential. The proposal to sell part of Telstra-from the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) during the election campaign, ultimately all of it-is clearly driven by ideology. It is the same sort of ideological push that we have seen in state governments of a Liberal conservative cast which are selling off water and electricity supplies-natural public monopolies which should not be in private ownership. Telstra has the same characteristic. The privatisation of these public monopolies to private monopolies sees a return to something that we saw a century or two ago in some of these areas. Sadly, these lessons have not been learned. The political and social dangers attaching to private monopolies appears not to have been understood by the new government. The basic needs of the community-clean water, electricity, telecommunications-should not be entrusted to the very linear, limited and shortterm needs of private investors. That is why we have a public sector, something the government is clearly opposed to. It thinks no government is good government, in which case we could probably get rid of this parliament altogether. The sale of an asset like Telstra would also encourage private investors to lock up capital in utilities and well-established sectors which the are very stable. The money is then no longer ayailable for investment in high risk areas and for creating growth. You are not improving the performance of the Australian business sector. Telstra, as we all know, is a natural monopoly-although there are some elements of competition, courtesy of the previous Labor government-but it also represents a huge investment for the entire Australian community. Successive generations of taxpayers and users have owned Telstra. It is available to all, regardless of where they live. Certainly, there are differences in some of the services provided in remote and regional Australia. We are all aware of that and we sought to improve things in government. The sale of Telstra, be it a third of a whole, will not make the situation any better. Indeed, there is nothing in the legislation which would protect country users from big increases in costs. In my view, if you held a referendum tomorrow the Australian community would vote overwhelmingly against either a part or full sale of Telstra. That is why the position of the Australian Democrats is vindicated. Like us, the Democrats and the Greens clearly went to the electorate saying, 'We will oppose the sale of Telstra.' They saw the link to the environment as bogus. We are all entitled to say to the people who voted for us, 'We will do what we said we would do during the election campaign and vote against the sale of Telstra.' It is very clear that the Australian community will not contemplate supporting that sale. If the government were sure of its ground it could call a referendum on this question. I am sure it will not because it knows the result would be a resounding no. At the moment Telstra provides an essential service at an affordable cost to all Australians regardless of locale, something I certainly appreciate, having been brought up in the country. I know the effects on country people of the expenses attached to the differentials that start to creep in. It is also important to recognise that there is nothing in the legislation to guarantee that a privatised Telstra would continue the cross-subsidies that enable country people to afford to use a telephone. You have only to look at the behaviour of the states which have privatised things like electricity supplies or which are in the process of doing it to see what would happen to costs in country areas. Ask the people of country Victoria what will happen to the cost of their electricity in years to come. At the moment there is a bit of a barrier; there will be a short-term sop. But in the long term, as they have been told by the current Premier, they will see an increase in the cost of electricity supplies. doubt the same thing will happen in South Australia with a privatised water supply. Private enterprise will not cross-subsidise. It has shown that very clearly in the provision of other services, so why would it do it in the case of telecommunications. It is also important to recognise-especially if we are talking about funding various policies, be it the environment, health or aged care-that Telstra now provides a very substantial revenue stream to government. Estimates that I have seen in this area and others show that the losses to government over time are greater than the short-term boost from the asset sale and the remaining revenue stream through taxes and so on, which are, in any case, likely to be minimised. There is nothing surer than that, with a privatised Telstra, whether partly or wholly, the board will be directing the company not only to make investments in overseas telecommunication industries but also to make sure that tax is paid at the minimum possible level. The minister cannot direct any of those things. That is not possible under the current legislation. So the government would be left with less revenue from Telstra through the combination of the sale and tax arrangements. That is very short-sighted indeed. I now turn to what, from my point of view as shadow minister for the environment, is a very important problem with the legislationthat is, the attempt to link it to a decent environment policy. I note with some interest the title of the bill: dilution of public ownership. What it really is is a dilution of good public policy, particularly in the area of the environment. The second reading speech of the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) referred, as some members here have, to the $1 billion from the sale of Telstra which will be devoted to a range of environmental initiatives. I have to say that in my time in parliament, which now amounts to 10 years, I have never seen a government deliberately hypothecate revenue in this way. The member sitting opposite me, the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), the former Premier of New South Wales, will No know how much resistance treasuries usually give to this sort of arrangement. It is without precedent in that sense. The scale of it is extraordinary. The link between the sale of Telstra and the environment represents a very backward step indeed, both for environment policy as well as financial policy and fiscal management. During the election campaign a lot was said by John Howard about how he had become a greenie. He went out with his top button unfastened and his leisure gear on to woo the environment. He said that environmental matters were now considered 'mainstream issues'. At the launch of the coalition's Telstra environment policy in the Dandenong Ranges National Park on 31 January, John Howard said, and I think it is important to put it on the record again: Concern about the environment is no longer some kind of fetish, pseudo-intellectual passing phase issue, it is now a mainstream issue of permanent concern to Australians of all generations and that is a point that I have made time and time again, not only in the period I have been Leader of the Opposition, but also before that, and therefore what we have decided to do in this policy is to make the biggest-ever commitment of the Coalition Parties across the board to tackle environment issues. Those are noble and commendable words in and of themselves, but they are not actually reflected in the coalition's environment policy. It is a policy that will never be impleexpect mented because it can never be funded. The reason it will never be funded has got nothing to do with the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats or the Greens in the Senate. After all, those senators did not write the policy. They did not make the unprincipled connection between the sale of a public asset and the development of an environment policy. They did not make that promise at all. We all spelt out very clearly our opposition to the sale of Telstra long before that link was ever made. Before John Howard in the election campaign made the link he knew that all the other major parties were lined up against the sale of Telstra. That is why he linked the environment policy to it. He thought he could do something that he wanted to do for ideological and budget reasons, to fund their other promises-and that was to sell Telstra, or part of it. He thought, 'Ab, I've got these people. They want a good environment policy so I'll link the two.' He knew well in advance of that announcement that all the bodies I mentioned were opposed to it. The coalition's environment policy will never be funded because it should never have been promised in the first place. It was totally unprincipled. John Howard likes to make holier than thou statements about politicians keeping their promises and has been doing it for a long time. Yet he seems to have forgotten the most fundamental rule on the matter of trust, and that is, don't promise what you can't deliver. Not only has he forgotten his own mantra but also he has taken the next predictable step and is now blaming everyone but himself for the predicament that his environment policy is now in. Yes, he has a serious problem, and it is all of his own making. He cannot blame anyone else for this problem. It is a very serious predicament. Because of John Howard's 'too clever by half strategy to get the bill passed through the parliament, the Commonwealth government not only does not have any funding for an environment policy but also effectively does not have an environment policy. If the government really considers the issue to be mainstream, you would expect it to have a realistic policy on the matter. You would not the future of a mainstream issue to be linked to the success of a doomed bill, would you? Apparently. But then again, maybe all this commitment to the environment is rhetoric. Maybe the environment policies never really mattered to the coalition. Certainly their behaviour in the past and their policies in the past suggest just that. Indeed, some of their actions now suggest just that: opening up uranium mining in Kakadu, for example, and lifting the ceiling on woodchip exports. We are seeing some of the true colours, but it was there to be seen during the election. For decades Labor has led on the environment while coalition governments have either obstructed in this parliament, obfuscated, hidden or at best very reluctantly followed our lead. These actions show very clearly what the conservative parties in Australia think about the environment. Under a coalition government, for example, mining at Coronation Hill would have gone ahead. There is absolutely nothing surer. Uluru and Kakadu would have been handed to the Northern Territory government, which are hardly noted for their green characteristics. The wet tropics would have been logged and the Franklin would have been flooded. Those are all things that you supported in your time. The coalition, in and out of government, does not have a strong environmental record. Without a funded environmental policy, we have to assume, I think fairly, that it has no intention of developing one. We are seeing all the bluff and bluster but behind it nothing. A briefing paper to the shadow cabinet prepared by Senator Ian Macdonald last year, I think, provides some insight into the motivations behind this coalition environment ruse. In that paper Senator Macdonald argues for flexibility so that the coalition can make announcements 'on a lot of long-term visionary matters' without committing itself to actually proceeding with them.· Does that sound familiar? It is exactly what is happening right now. Interestingly, he cited the Murray-Darling Basin as one such visionary project. Surprise, surprise! The coalition's Telstra environment policy commits $163 million to the Murray-Darling 2001 project. It is visionary; it cannot be delivered. What other long-term visionary matters has the coalition committed itself to in its environment policy? There is a national vegetation initiative, land and water resources audits, reserve system payments, a coasts and clean seas initiative, and so on. Those are all very admirable. It is a pity that none of them are funded. The coalition's environment policy document, Saving our natural heritage, includes more than just these unfunded long term visionary matters. The important point is that it also endorses Labor's environment policies. In fact, we read that this whole new range of policies, which are essentially derivatives of ours anyway, are additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the environment and the sustainable agriculture elements of the primary industries portfolio, such as the national landcare program. That is very clearly written in your own policy document. The phrase-and I will quote it again'additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the environment and the sustainable agriculture elements' - implies the coalition had committed themselves then and now to the previous government's forward estimates published in the 1995-96 budget. This assumption was made not only by a range of environmental groups and commentators but also by a lot of Liberal members. References were continually being made during the campaign to the 'fact' that the coalition's funding for the environment doubled Labor's commitment because it was adding to Labor's budgeted funds. That is just another example of a very dirty trick that the coalition played on Australians during the election. The facts, as I understand them, are dramatically different. I would like to be wrong on this matter, but the answer of the Prime Minister to the question by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) yesterday indicates that forward estimates are not included in the coalition's promise. Yesterday, when the Prime Minister was asked by the Leader of the Opposition to clarify what this commitment actually referred to, the Prime Minister said the commitment was 'a commitment to add $1 billion to existing levels of environmental funding'. It is a bit different from the coalition's promise. Reading it that way-and I think it was Telstra probably carefully worded by the Prime Minister-the existing levels of environment funding include only the 1995-96 budget. In other words, it runs out on 30 June; it does not include the forward estimates published in the 1995-96 budget. Read in this light, the coalition's environment commitments, unfunded as they are, are very dramatically reduced. Its plans to boost spending on the environment by devoting $1 billion of the proceeds of the partial sale of Telstra to establish a Natural Heritage Trust, with $700 million to be spent over the next five years, indeed will only be making up the gaps that it is not meeting in the forward estimates in large part. The proposed so-called initiatives to be funded through the trust can also be found in the revised forward estimates of the outgoing Labor government. In addition to our forward estimates during the campaign, we indicated that we had a whole new range of proposals and we presented revised forward estimates. A lot of the environment groups around this country thought that the now government's proposals were not only additional to our forward estimates but additional to our revised forward estimates. We indicated that we would fund a program for the Murray-Darling Basin very similar to that proposed by the government-an enhanced comprehensive reserve system, cleaner oceans and comprehensive coastal management policies. The difference is that we showed how we would fund them and we put them in our revised forward estimates. The Labor government was committed to funding these desirable programs through conventional means, not this hocus-pocus through linking a very important sector of public policy, the environment, to the sale of Telstra. As I have said, some environment groups have assumed that they would get everything that we offered plus the $1 billion in the so called heritage fund. That is not what the coalition have actually promised and is clearly not, from what the Prime Minister said yesterday, what they intend to deliver. Mr Howard promised that the funding commitments in this document are additional to Labor's budgeted funding for the environment. I repeat: that is the promise he made. If you look at the fact that the funding commitments are only additional to this year's budget-not the forward estimates or the revised forward estimates-the government is actually promising to outlay some $700 million over five years. That is the express commitment from the heritage trust, with the balance to be in reserve in perpetuity, and the interest then used to fund some projects. The revised forward estimates that we were committed to-our forward estimates plus the election campaign programs-show that Labor had planned to spend $800 million on very similar programs over four years. That makes the government's environment policy look very thin indeed. Not only do they not have the funding-and they will not have it after the failure of the passage of this bill through the Senate-but their promise in any case was a hollow one. It was a real con job. They made it look as though they were going to add to Labor's programs as budgeted in the forward estimates and many were led to believe the revised forward estimates-a big boost for environment funding in this country. They received the accolades accordingly. They did not step back and say, 'Hang on, we actually mean only in addition to Labor's 1995-96 programs.' It needs to be said that a lot of those programs come to an end at the end of 1995-96. We indicated in our forward estimates that we would have to pick them up again, and our revised forward estimates include that figure. The coalition, in opposition, never came clean with the people of Australia about their intentions in this area. It is a very elaborate and successful con, but a despicable one. We saw it come home to roost in the Prime Minister's words yesterday. He has now had to acknowledge that he not only blackmailed the Australian people about the connection between the sale of Telstra and its environment policy but also misled them about the fact that those funds would not be additional to what Labor was proposing to put into environment policy. In the end that will be a message that I certainly intend to get out to every comer of this country so people will know that, with or without the sale of Telstra, with or without the funds that were supposed to flow from that purpose, the government had no intention of expanding environmental programs in this country at all. The great con!",42
25,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"Fisher) (12.28 p.m.}--I am very pleased to participate, on behalf of the held new coalition government, in the debate on this Telstra bill, which implements one of the major parts of our platform which was put to the Australian people prior to the 2 March election. I was very interested to listen to the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), when she challenged the coalition to put this subject to a referendum of the Australian people. I do not know where the former minister has been over the last few weeks, but the simple fact is that the coalition outlined a very clear program of a proposed sale of one-third of Telstra. We aim to use $7 billion of the $8 billion we expect to raise from that sale for the purposes of retiring debt. That will reduce interest rates and it will assist small business. Most importantly, also we aim to use the remaining $1 billion for the purposes of an investment in this nation's environmental future. Those matters were put to the Australian people. The election on 2 March was a referendum on our policy. The result of that election saw the Labor Party reduced to a mere 49 seats out of 148 seats in this place. Ninety-nine members of the House of Representatives are non-Labor members. I do not know where the former minister has been, but the simple fact is that the coalition was upfront, open and honest. We said what we proposed to do. We sought a mandate from the Australian people and that mandate was given to us in a resounding way. We aim to be an honest government; we aim to keep our promises, unlike the rhetoric and record of the former Labor government, which saw the former Prime Minister prior to the 1993 election prepared to do and say anything to crawl into office. Of course, no sooner had the Labor government been elected in 1993 than those promises were junked one by one. We have indicated that we intend to privatise only one-third of Te1stra. We intend to allow only up to one-third of that one-third to be owned by non-Australian interests. We also intend to use the proceeds of the sale of one-third of Telstra not for recurrent expenditure, as was the practice of the former government, but for the purposes of retiring debt and investing in this nation's environmental future. The crocodile tears shed by the former minister during the 20 minutes she berated the government should be entirely disregarded because this government has been honest, accountable and up-front. We have sought and obtained the mandate of the Australian people. Despite the fact that we had one of the largest swings ever seen in Australian political history, the opposition is going to vote against our legislation in this place. What is more, opposition is endeavouring to encourage the other place to thwart the mandate given to the coalition by the Australian people. This bill includes major safeguards. We are not giving anyone a blank cheque. We are saying that we are prepared to sell one-third of Telstra on very strict conditions. The approach of the Labor Party to policy making in this area has been somewhat hypocritical in so far as the former government said it would not sell major public assets. It went to the Australian people and said that major public assets would be retained in public ownership. Despite the fact that the former government said that it would not sell Qantas, the Commonwealth Bank or the Federal Airports Corporation, those promises, like so many election promises, were junked. There is a major difference between those on that side of the House and those on this side of the House. We told the Australian people what we proposed to do and, following our election, we have brought legislation into this place to implement our promises. Partial privatisation of Telstra is one element of a broader policy in the area of telecommunications aimed at giving Australia a world-class telecommunications industry not only in terms of technology but also in tenns of pricing and quality of service. Other key elements include the introduction of legislative and institutional arrangements which will promote competition in provision of service and preserve and enhance universal service. As a member representing a regional area, I am very interested to make sure that the universal service obligations are continued. The government has pledged that they will be, and the legislation currently before the chamber guarantees that Australians in country areas will continue to receive a reasonable level of service from Telstra and other telecommunications providers. Partial privatisation will bring benefits to Australians right throughout the nation through a more efficient communications sector. There will be a reduction in public debt and therefore reduced pressure on interest rates. There will be a significant reinvestment in Australia's national heritage and the increased investment opportunities for Australians. Because only one-third of the one-third of Telstra is available for purchase by overseas interests, the remaining two-thirds of the one-third being offered for sale will be bought by Australian institutions and by the mums of dads of Australia. Most importantly, employees of the Telstra Corporation will be given the opportunity of investing in what is a very major and successful company throughout Australia. It ought to be noted that, while Telstra has become more efficient in recent years, it still is not the most efficient telecommunications company in the world. In March 1995, the Bureau of Industry Economics published a detailed comparison of Telstra's performance with overseas carriers. It concluded: Since the introduction of competition in telecommunications Australia has moved ahead with the leading pack, but it is at the back of the leading group rather than the front Relaxing the pace of reform would see Australia fall back into the trailing group of also-rans. Renewed effort is required to lift Australia towards international best practice. That comparison looked at a number of individual indicators. It is interesting to note that in 1993, with respect to business fixed charges, Telstra was ranked 18th out of 28. In 1993, with respect to long distance call charges, Telstra was ranked 16th out of 26. In 1994, with respect to the national basket of prices, Telstra was ranked 14th out of 23. In 1994, with respect to the international call basket of prices, Telstra was ranked first out of 24. It did very well. In 1992, with respect to fault clearance, Telstra was ranked 15th out of 19. It is obvious that, while competition has assisted Telstra, we need to continue restructuring and we need to continue to improve efficiencies. I believe the partial privatisation of Telstra provided by this bill will assist in bringing about the improvements in Telstra's performance that we would all like to see. Members opposite, particularly the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), said that we ought not to have a linkage between the proposed one-third sale of Telstra and our $1 billion environmental package. He said that our policy on the environment should be funded from ordinary government revenue in much the same way as health was. I think that matter was also referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The simple fact of the matter is that by making this linkage-by saying we are going to sell one-third of Telstra and that we will use $1 billion from the proceeds of that sale for the environment-we are indicating to the Australian people in a very responsible way that we can fund our environmental package. We are not saying that we are simply going to go out there and write cheques without any capacity to meet those cheques when they are presented. What we are saying is that we are prepared to retire $7 billion of debt, we are prepared to spend $1 billion on the environment, as outlined in our environmental policy, and we are prepared to show where the money is corning from. The former government was quite used simply to writing cheques without being accountable for where that money is corning from. As you would well know, Madam Deputy Speaker, the incoming government has been greeted by Beazley's $8· billion black hole. It means, of course, that we are going to have to work very hard over the next two annual budgets to rein in expenditure to raise $8 billion to clear the deficit. That contrasts in a very clear way the difference in approach between the government and the opposition. We are responsible. We say the environment is worth funding. We believe the environment is worth a $1 billion injection of funds. Labor believes that you should simply write cheques without being able to say where the money is coming from. So we are going to spend $1 billion on the environment and we are going to sell one-third of Telstra. The money for the environment will come from the sale of Telstra, and I believe that is very responsible and appropriate. The Natural Heritage Trust of Australia will be the most major environmental initiative ever made by any government in this nation. For once, a government has been prepared to stand up to be counted and to grasp the nettle to ensure that Australia's environment is restored for future generations. The money invested in the Natural Heritage Trust will be devoted to capital projects to maintain and replenish our environmental infrastructure. All interest earned from the trust will be devoted to recurrent expenditure on environmental projects and the further advancement of sustainable agriculture. While we are being bagged by the opposition, I think it would be illuminating just to outline what some of those capital projects are. We really ought to reiterate how determined we are to make a positive contribution to our nation's environmental future. There are five capital projects to be funded from the money invested in the Natural Heritage Trust. One of the projects is a national vegetation initiative to tackle Australia's land and water degradation problems. Madam Deputy Speaker, you will be pleased to know that we intend to spend $318 million over five years. When you look at our record as a nation over more than 200 years of European settlement in relation to the devegetation of Australia, we have nothing to be proud of. Collectively, we have nothing to be proud of. Look at the way that our nation has been denuded of vegetation and the way in which we over the years have not appreciated that we hold our environment in trust for future generations. So the coalition went before the Australian people prior to the election on 2 March and said that we were going to do something about it. We were the first prepared to do anything about it. We bring in a very positive platform, and the opposition seeks to thwart us. We also intend to rehabilitate the Murray-Darling Basin through the implementation of the Murray-Darling 2001 project, and $163 million will be spent over five years. We also will undertake a national land and water resources audit, and that will over five years. We will also implement a comprehensive national reserve system to protect Australia's biodiversity-$80 million over four years. As a member for a coastal electorate, I am particularly pleased that we are going to spend $100 million over four years on the coast and clean seas initiative tackle the pollution problems in our coastal areas. Mr Hockey-Hear, hear! Mr Tony Smith-Hear, hear!",47
26,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"Honourable members are quite right in supporting what I am saying and in supporting what the coalition is doing, because it is so important that at this time 1996 the government takes a stand. We cannot continue to waste our environment in the way it has been over the last 200 years. We have got a program to do something aboutit. Our environment policy was warmly welcomed by conservationists right throughout the nation. No-one had any criticism of the money we were spending on the environment. Everyone said it was a wonderful program. Everyone said it was exactly what Australia needed. There were some at the fringes who opposed the way in which we planned to fund it, but the simple fact of the matter is that every major environmental group felt that what we aimed to achieve on the environment was very positive. We got a clean biII of health from the environmental movement, although we did have some criticism over how we planned to fund it. The government wants to stress in this place today that, if those opposite vote against this legislation, if they seek to encourage their colleagues in the other place to vote this legislation down when it arrives in the Senate, they will be voting against a vegetation initiative, they will be voting against the rehabilitation of the Murray-Darling Basin, they will be voting against the national land and water resources audit, they will be voting against the implementation of a comprehensive national reserve system to protect Australia's biodiversity and they will be voting against the coast and clean seas initiative to tackle pollution problems in our cost $32 miIlion coastal areas. It makes absolutely no difference at all to Australians who actually owns the Telstra Corporation. What does matter is the job that Telstra does. It is important that Telstra be allowed to grow. It is important that Telstra to be allowed to restructure and become more efficient. It is important that Telstra be required to continue to provide a high quality level of service to Australians throughout the nation. It does not really matter who actually owns Telstra. What is important is the job that Telstra does. This government said that it was prepared to sell only one-third of Telstra. Had the in Labor Party been re-elected to office, then it is highly likely that all of Telstra would have been flogged off. We really ought to look at the comments made by the former Prime Minister in June 1994. Of course, members opposite. would seek to dissent from the remarks of the former Prime Minister in 1994, but Paul Keating disclosed his attitude. When asked on the Lateline program in June 1994 whether it mattered if Telstra were publicly or privately owned, he replied, 'Not of its essence, no.' So Paul Keating said that it did not matter who owned Telstra. The coalition believes it is important that two-thirds of Telstra be owned by the government, that two-thirds of Telstra be retained in public ownership. We have pledged that in this term of office we will not in any way, shape or form sell more than the one-third of Telstra. That is why this legislation provides only for the sale of one-third of Telstra, but the former Prime Minister said that it did not matter 'of its essence' whether Telstra were publicly or privately owned. It also ought to be appreciated that former government endeavoured to flog off parts of Telstra. They attempted to sell Yellow Pages and Mobilenet. The simple fact of the matter is that we keep our promises with respect to what we say we are going to do. The Labor Party now come in here and claim to be opposed to the sale of Telstra. The not reality is that in 1994 their then leader said did not matter who owned Telstra. It is important to appreciate that with bill the government is reaffirming its tials of being up-front and honest. We ansecond nounced in the election platfonn that we intended to sell one-third of Telstra so that could retire $7 billion of debt and so that could make a $1 billion investment in worth of debt. Australia's environmental future. There are many things we are going to improve in Australia when our environmental program implemented. I plead with those opposite: support this legislation. You have to realise we live in democracy. You have to realise that at the election on 2 March you were reduced to a mere 49 members out of 148 people in this for place. Mr Tony Smith-A rump.",50
27,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"A rump-49 out of 148. as Can't you count? The former minister, the honourable member for Fremantle, was in here a moment ago saying that we ought to have a referendum. Mr Miles-Just had one.",51
28,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"As the Parliamentary owned Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, the table, points out we just had a referenensure dum-on 2 March. You got 49 out of 148. That means that 99 members in this place are not members of the Australian Labor Party. It is pretty clear that when the referendum was put to the Australian people they voted resoundingly in favour of our policy. This legislation seeks to implement our policy. It does not breach our policy in way. We aim to sell one-third of Telstra we aim to use $7 billion of the $8 billion we suffer. will raise to retire debt and the remaining $1 billion to make sure that the environment inherited by future generations is an environthe ment of which we would all be proud.",51
29,Mr MCCLELLAND,Unknown,"The public is under no allusions that this is the start of the full privatisation of Telstra. Selling one-third of Telstra will inevitably lead to the sale of the whole of Telstra. The only reason the government is selling all of Telstra is that it has doubts it about the capacity of the Australian market to absorb the total bill. While the Minister for this Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr credenWarwick Smith) expressed doubt in his reading speech on this Telstra bill as to the capacity of the Australian people to we absorb $8 billion worth of debt, he appreciwe ates it certainly could not absorb $24 billion In any event, even the partial privatisation of Telstra will effectively change its whole is mode of operation. Just as you cannot be a little bit pregnant, you cannot be a little bit private. There will be a fundamental shift in a philosophy. Currently, Telstra is owned by the Australian public. It is presumed-and indeed is the case-that Telstra has been incorporated the benefit of the public and it provides its service on that basis. That will entirely change with the privatisation of Telstra. The presumption will be that Telstra is functioning a private company whose only reason for being is one thing-profit. The more it can squeeze out of the consumer, the more money it will make. The less service it provides per consumer dollar, the more profit it will make. The directors, as directors of a privately company, will have an obligation to at the company and the minority shareholders to that they discharge their duties as directors with due diligence and with a view to maximising that profit. Those obligations are not light. A director who fails to perform their duties with due care and diligence in pursuit of the profitability of the company may be guilty of a criminal offence. A director may be personally liable to compensate any the company or others, such as minority and shareholders, for any loss or damage they In that context, it is not good enough to say that the universal service obligations of Telstra will be protected by the proposed legislation. The pursuit of profit will inevitably put pressure on confining and limiting that universal service obligation. When we look at how the universal service obligation is framed in part 2C of the bill, we see it is a corporate lawyer's dream. A universal service obligation is referred as an obligation to provide 'reasonable access'-not absolute access but 'reasonable access' - to 'standard telephone services'. We are not talking about the technology of which Telstra is at the forefront. That obligation is referred to as one which should be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as practicable. As soon as a lawyer sees the words 'as practicable', it is open slather-it is a subjective judgment and extremely broad in its discretion. Companies are even protected in providing a universal service. They only have to provide information 'to the greatest extent possible without undue damage to a carrier's interest being caused by the disclosure of confidential commercial information'. How is anyone going to test that in a court of law? It is simply a non-existent universal service obligation. As I mentioned, it is not simply a question of providing standard telephone services, which the bill refers to. Telstra is now well and truly at the forefront of technology. We in the city have the opportunity to connect to the integrated services digital network-ISDN as it is commonly known-which can carry voice, text and video all simultaneously. We have access to a multitude of network based services on offer, like multiple simultaneous fax transmission and paging services and a myriad of other products that can be connected to a network-including access to a very sophisticated databank network. We have access to that from our electoral offices. It is quite impossible to practise in many areas today without that technology. In a legal practice, it would be quite impossible to practise without access to those on-line facilities. They are services which are rapidly spreading throughout country and regional Australia. For the ISDN network to be completed, it will involve a cost in the vicinity of $2 billion. That is a massive input into centres which, in many instances, on a balance sheet will not have the population which justifies that capital investment. You might ask yourself: will a private company in pursuit of the profit motive engage in that capital investment if it is to simply not going to get the return? The answer is that it will not. Country people and people in regional centres are going to miss out on that investment in technology. Businesses are going to be denied access to that technology; schools are going to be denied access to that technology; children are going to be denied access to that technology in their studies. While young children in the cities are rapidly learning this technology and about online facilities, kids in the bush are going to be left well and truly in their wake. Yet kids in the bush are going to have to compete for university places with kids in the cities. They are going to be left floundering without experience in this technology. The reality is that the technological revolution is now so far advanced that, unless employees have competence in this area, their future employability is going to be significantly prejudiced. Employees and trainees in the cities are going to have access to this technology, but country people are going to be significantly disadvantaged in their employment opportunities. Kids are going to be left only one step ahead of the radio service of the flying doctor while kids in the cities are becoming wizards with this new technology. We in this House would all know a number of people who are employed by Telstra or who are employed by businesses which are contracted to Telstra. It is literally a massive industry. What is going to happen to those 90,000 employees if Telstra is privatised? We have indications from the government about that. In the Senate on 1 May 1996, Senator Michael Baume, in advocating the sale of Telstra, said: We have seen employment in Telstra blowout to something like 96,000 as against 60,000, a level competitive with comparable overseas organisations and a level which, I understand, is some kind of target. That indicates present overemployment of something like 30,000 people. We will have 30,000 more people on the dole queues. We will have 30,000 more families concerned about how they are going to educate their children. We will have 30,000 more families concerned as to how they are going to pay their mortgages. A very significant fear that all Australians should be aware of is the flow-on consequences of massive unemployment of highly trained and highly skilled people arising from the government's actions. They are not my words but the words of Senator Baume about what he perceives as the requirements of a privati sed Telstra. We have seen attempts by government members to ruin and downplay the reputation of a company, in curious circumstances, where the government is attempting to sell one-third of it. The fundamental requirement of any effective administration is to get the facts. If one looks at Telstra's financial record for the six-month period ending 31 December 1995, one can see an increase of 16.6 per cent in profit over the previous corresponding period. Revenue totalled $7,638 million, an increase of $631 million, or nine per cent. During the six-month period, $686 million was provided for an interim dividend to the Commonwealth government, compared with only $413 million for the previous corresponding period. In addition to revenue growth, the results in Telstra's balance sheet reflected a return on equity of 20.2 per cent, a debt equity ratio of 28 per cent and an interest cover of 9.9 times. They are very sound financial indicators as to the success of Telstra. During the six-month reporting period, Telstra increased capital expenditure by 45.5 per cent. They reinvested $1,938 million in the funding of existing and new business growth and major capital expenditure programs, which is a massive investment into the infrastructure of this country. Telstra have achieved 90 per cent digital mobile net coverage of Australia, almost matching analog which is at 91 per cent. Also, they have spent $3.9 billion on the digital broadband cable network, which is now available to an estimated 2.4 million Australians, and the $3.3 billion future mode of operation project, which involves digitisation of customer lines, is now 68 per cent complete. This technology has a multiplier effect on all businesses. Virtually no business has been untouched by the technological advances and the additional profitability that Telstra is now able to deliver because of that massive technological investment into the infrastructure of this country. Again, if Telstra is pri vatised, regional Australia-country Australia-will not see much of that technology. If operating profit after tax for the sixmonth period ended 31 December is projected over the 12-month period, which ends in about seven weeks time, Telstra will have an operating profit after tax of $2.4 billion. In less than 3Y2 years, Telstra will more than recover by way of profit the $8 billion which is going to be received in this fire sale if the government is correct. That is literally what it is. It is ripping up the floorboards to stoke the fire. The trouble is that, once too many floorboards are ripped up, the fire becomes ineffective. Indeed, when all the floorboards are used the fire will go out. That will be a very real tragedy for Australia. In terms of the effect on the balance of payments, Telstra has had some massive successes. Telstra has continued to pursue opportunities internationally, in particular in the Asia-Pacific region. A new high capacity optical fibre link, known as TVH, linking Thailand, Vietnam and Hong Kong, has been established, in which Telstra is an initial party and a major investor. That program was officially launched in February of this year and is providing Vietnam with its first international submarine link with the rest of the world. PT Mitra Global Telekomunikasi Indonesia, in which Telstra, through a wholly owned subsidiary, has a 20 per cent shareholding, assumed management of the telephone network in central Java in January of 1996. You simply do not make those inroads, you do not have those successes, unless you are competing with the best in the world and beating the best of the world. That is Telstra's record. It is a record which we can all be immensely proud of. It is a record that we can foster. The government makes tokenistic gestures to nationalism and national pride by speeches, for instance, on ANZAC Day indicating intentions to preserve the national flag. We in the opposition are talking about meaningful nationalism-pride in a company which is a flagship for our nation, which is beating the best of the world and one which we as Australians each have a stake in. The government is literally going to flog it off. Telstra is an essential utility providing essential services to many organisations and it enters into contracts primarily with Australian companies. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his powerful speech indicated the significance of that flow-on technology to many other companies involved in the electronics industry in Australia. The electronics industry is particularly significant to our national interest because it is using Australia as the smart country-it is using our talent, our wealth of education and our general sophistication in terms of training-to earn very significant foreign revenue. It is fostering industries such as the electronics, telecommunications and computer industries, which are going to prevent this country becoming a labour sweatshop, as so many other countries have had to become in order to raise foreign revenue. To put those successes which we are having at risk, as will inevitably be the case by the selling of Telstra, is foolish in the extreme. The final point I would like to make, among many that have been made by my colleagues, is that Telstra, being in the position that it has achieved, has the capacity to crush its opposition if it is left unchecked. That has to be conceded. It effectively has a monopoly of telephone lines. It effectively has a monopoly of technology such that it can easily obliterate its opposition. How is the government going to stop that obliteration, certainly in circumstances where the minister will be unable to give any directions to the company as to how it should engage in its business practices? The directors themselves will have an obligation to maximise the prospects of their company succeeding against the competition. If Telstra knocks out that competition, which it is capable of doing, it will establish a total monopoly, to the very great detriment of consumers. It will be a monopoly over which the government has no control. But we are promised by the government $1 billion for the environment. Is that promise legitimate? At the same time as the minister promised that money in his second reading speech, he referred to the need for instalment purchase arrangements if the scoping study finds that the domestic equity markets would find it difficult to cope with equity raising of the order of magnitude envisaged. For government members to stand up and profess to say honestly that the mums and dads of this country have a spare $8 billion lying around is foolhardy; it is a nonsense. The government recognises the difficulty it is going to have in raising that money. So we are looking at all kinds of hire-purchase arrangements, arrangements to pay by instalments, and various forms of lay-by arrangements. At the same time, the government is trying to blackmail us by holding the environment as a hostage, but it is not as honourable as normal hostage takers. Normal hostage takers will deliver the hostage when the dough is delivered, when the money is presented. We are not even going to see the money; we are going to see a payment by instalment situation. They will still hold· the environment hostage until that payment by instalment process, the lay-by and hire-purchase arrangements, is completed. It is an outrage. I have been a member of this parliament for a very brief time but I have been an observer of national politics, I must say, for quite some time. I have never seen any government support any piece of legislation on the basis of benefiting another sector of society, or holding another part of the infrastructure of the country or an asset of the Australian people as hostage. It is hopefully the last time we will see it. Those opposite are in the capacity of custodians of our great nation and this example of starting to flog off Telstra, one of our very great emblems of national pride, is something which we oppose vigorously. I strongly support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).  want to clear up one matter that the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) seems to have confused with respect to our position on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill. It is not that we are holding the environment hostage for the passage of the Telstra bill. It is that we are honouring our commitments and funding our commitments. Unlike the Labor Party of the last 13 years, we do not believe it is right to make promises that we will deliver certain things in government and then not deliver them, and we want to show to the Australian people that we will fund the commitments that we have made, and that is why during the election our policy on the environment was matched with the policy on how to fund the environmental package. That is simply all it is. It is not holding it hostage; it is saying that, unlike the last government, we intend to be responsible economic managers and we promised the Australian people only things that we can deliver. I do not wish to comment for long on the bill today because I think most of the subjects will have been well covered by the time the list of speakers is completed, but I do wish to put on the record today my support for the Telstra bill. On 2 March, when the Australian people dusted away 13 years of Labor cobwebs, they rejected a government whose vision for the nation extended no further than their own return to office, whose policy platform was rickety and unstable and whose campaign was based solely on fear. More importantly, the people voted for a new direction for our nation, for policies that had been clearly enunciated by the coalition team during the election. The Labor strategists, ideologues without both ideas and ideals, set out to make the election a referendum on Medicare and on Telstra, and so it was. The results are very clearly in and the Australian people, hungry to get this nation back on the road to prosperity, have thrown Labor out. As the saying goes, they did not count the votes in most of the electorates that the Liberal Party picked up; they weighed them. It is with the heavy backing of that huge election victory that this government embarks on the process to reform Telstra. During the months of public conjecture over the future of Telstra I have not heard one real argument against its part-privatisation. We have been subjected to the fallacious line from the Labor Party that to keep Telstra the way it is is to keep it strong. It seems to me that I have heard that used before. It was used with reference to ANL. The Labor government made a token effort to privatise our national shipping line but were stopped by their bosses, the ACro and the Maritime Union. Keeping ANL in government ownership did not keep ANL strong-in fact quite the opposite. It sank it, and Australia's taxpayers funded the $30 million a year losses. The Telstra arguments are not only similar; they are coming from the very same sources, this time with assistance from those on the opposition benches. The ALP has quickly forgotten its enthusiasm for privatisation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. On this side of the chamber we believe the work we do should be for the betterment of all Australians. We believe the changes that we seek to effect with the passage of this legislation will provide long lasting benefits for our nation. The Australian telecommunications monopoly is long gone. In a very real sense, the industry itself has already been privati sed with Telstra having competition in the mobile communications and long distance markets. Next year, when the market is further deregulated, there will be still more providers, at least one of which will compete with Telstra for the highly profitable local call market. There can be no doubt that new technologies and new competition will prove a boon to the Australian consumer. While government ownership may have been a necessity in setting up a monopoly and its associated infrastructure, we must assess the value and the risk of a government run body competing with private enterprise in a deregulated market. The end of the local Telstra monopoly on local calls must mean, by nature, a drop in its market share. Just how large a slice of the pie it will be able to keep for itself will determine its future profitability. There is no doubt that Telstra has the ability to succeed on a long term basis. It has the ability to continue to dominate the Australian telecommunications industry. But, as with all business enterprises, there is a risk. As the competition intensifies and Telstra diversifies in an attempt to be a significant global provider, the risk will become greater and the entire risk will fall on the taxpayer. Already there is much speculation over the roll-out of cable for television and interactive services. Telstra and Optus are at war to grab market share. The Telstra rollout is costing taxpayers billions of cable television partner, Foxtel, pays for none of the infrastructure and will receive payment for every subscriber signed by Telstra. Mr Bevis-How much did it cost the taxpayer, Chris?  own Telstra. Mr Bevis-Tell us how much it is costing!",51
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The honourable member for Brisbane will get his tum.  having the dice rolled for them. The Telstra CEO, Frank Blount, only last year circulated to Telstra senior executives the news clip concerning the bankruptcy of typewriter giant Smith Corona. He said: All I am trying to say to my team is that it can happen to this company real easy. Not for a minute am I suggesting that Telstra is on the brink, and nor was Mr Blount. He was merely reminding his people of the high risk stakes involved in business, any business. Governments of many countries are seeing the benefits in telecommunications privatisation. Seventeen countries, including France, Germany and Russia, will embark on privatisation schemes this year alone. Partial privatisation will ensure a lean and confident Telstra that is able to compete in Australia and around the world. The American giant, AT&T, recently won a $30 million contract in India at the expense of Telstra despite a huge aid loan given to that nation to help establish Telstra's credentials. If Telstra is to achieve its stated aim to be the leading provider of electronic communication and information services in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and a significant global provider, then it needs the discipline and accountability that only the private sector can provide. This part-privatisation will see Telstra remain in Australian hands. The safeguards against majority foreign ownership are in place. Just 35 per cent of the one-third of Telstra will be available to foreign investors and those individual foreign investors will be restricted to a minimum of five per cent of dollars. Its the total private shares. Included in this legislation is the provision for a range of enforcement and remedial action over foreign investment. The Federal Court will be given the power to order divestment of shares and both the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and Telstra will be able to obtain injunctions to prevent or remedy ownership breaches. These foreign shareholders will be further restricted in that indirect interests and interests of their associates will be included as part of their stake. If these shares are sold in more than one single tranche, there will be lower limits on foreign ownership thus allowing Australians to purchase 65 per cent of whatever stock is available. It will be important that Australians get behind the share offer and there will be encouragement by way of special incentives to invest. The government is keen to see the shares allocated to a diverse range of Australian investors, including individuals and institutions. In all, this is a tremendous package, and I am sure Australians will respond with gusto to the offer of Telstra shares-in the same manner as they responded to the floats of Qantas and Woolworths. The revenue gained from the one-third privatisation of Telstra will not be wasted, unlike the proceeds from the Labor Party privatisations of the late 1980s and early 1990s which were used to prop up the budget bottom line. This revenue will be put to use in two critical areas for our future: namely, in the reduction of our debt and in a massive environmental package. These are areas that concern most Australians. I say 'most Australians', because those opposite who were here in the last parliament occupied the government benches for 13 years and proved conclusively over that time that they cared little about debt, let alone the environment. How many times did we hear from the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) that, although the actual figures did not look good, the underlying figures were encouraging? 'Underlying' was the catch cry of Labor's term in office. How prophetic that was. At the March election they went under, lying-lying to the Australian people about our intentions and lying to them about the massive size of the debt. 'We are in surplus,' they claimed. The people came to the same conclusion, adjudging them to have a surplus of about 35 members in the House of Representatives, and promptly remedying the situation. Labor's record on the environment is no better. The Labor Party paid lip-service to it, through Graham Richardson when he discovered that there were some votes in the issue. However, it did not actually make any difference to any of the major problems facing the environment in Australia-unlike the environment package that we have been putting to the Australian people. This government aims to do something tangible about the environment. We will implement a coordinated series of programs to restore and protect our national heritage, and by doing so will confront directly many of the nation's environmental black spots. Chief among these programs will be the national vegetation initiative, which will lower salinity levels in water, rehabilitate degraded land and provide us with a sustainable forestry industry. The Murray-Darling 2001 project will be undertaken, in conjunction with the states, to increase the viability of the land in one of nation's most productive areas. This government will begin to work to safeguard our wetlands, waterways, coasts and oceans. We will act to protect our endangered species and control feral animals. Australians are increasingly conscious of the environment. Both prevention and cure must be applied to ensure that Australia's natural resources are sustainable in the long term. They are our national heritage and they are our national future. To secure that future, we should have invested in them over the last 13 years, but it is left to this government to invest for the future. The legacy of the Labor government means that there is nothing saved for a rainy day. Public opinion on the partial sale of Te1stra is somewhat divided. We have seen Telstra grow out of Telecom and, before that, from the Postmaster-General's Department, which was established to set up Australia's telephone, telegraph and postal services. Telstra is an Australian institution and it is natural that there would be some reluctance to tamper with it. However, if the question were put to Australians, 'Do you favour a partial sale of Telstra if it results in cheaper phone services, less risk to the taxpayer, lower foreign debt and a cleaner, safer, more sustainable environment?' I think the answer would definitely be in the positive rather than the negative. I believe very few would be against it, save those who place their interests above those of the national interest-and, sadly, many of those people sit on the opposition side, both in this chamber and in the Senate. There can be no doubt that this bill will sail through the House of Representatives, but the public mouthings of some senators have led us to believe that its passage through the Senate will be somewhat less than smooth. That is a shame. One could have predicted the Labor Party's opposition. The reason it is so diminished in this House is that it has lost touch with much of its former base and is consequently now reliant upon special interest groups, the ACTO and the union movement. The Labor Party has been consistent in its hypocrisy all along-selling the Commonthe wealth Bank, Qantas and the Federal Airports Corporation-but, for some unknown reason, it has decided suddenly to oppose the partial sale of Telstra. However, I wonder a great deal about the Democrats. Their existence is due more to the vagaries of the system used to elect senators than to any public support for their policies-and one could ask what policies the Democrats have ever put to the Australian people. During election campaigns they make promises to every special interest group and fringe group, knowing full well that they will never have the opportunity or the requirement to deliver. They take their seats in the Senate and claim that their mandate is to 'keep the bastards honest'. One has to wonder who will keep the Democrats honest. Why are the Democrats trying so hard to force this government to be dishonest in the policies that it put to the electorate? Since March election they seem intent on forcing the coalition to break rather than keep its promises. Though at times they sound like the old Labor lunatic Left, I remind the Democrats that they are not Her Majesty's loyal opposition. They sit on the cross benchesalthough as they look at the motley crew on the Senate Labor Party benches they might be forgiven for their delusions of grandeur and power. As elected representatives in this parliament our first responsibility-and that of the Democrats-to the people of Australia is to take an objective view. I believe the Democrats have shirked their responsibility to the Australian people. The Australian people deserve more democracy rather than more demagoguery from this party, which is desperately trying to hang on to what it regards as its base of support. Rather than looking at the electoral pendulum it should recognise that all the coalition is trying to do is keep its election promises. I wish to record my support for this bill. I hope that in the Senate the Labor Party might see the error of its ways and support the bill in its entirety. I know that that is probably a forlorn hope but I look forward to the contributions of some of the other members of the opposition in the hope that they will be more sensible and realistic than some of the contributions I have already heard.",56
31,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"As this is the first occasion on which I have had the opportunity to address the House since the election I would like to place on record my congratulations to Mr Speaker and both Deputy Speakers on their election. I think all three are people of high character who are well regarded by both sides of the chamber. I wish them well, as I do the panel of which you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss, are a member. This debate in relation to the partial privatisation of Telstra is one which should be conducted, if it were a mature debate, by looking at the benefits or otherwise to the Australian community of the proposal on the sale of Telstra. Much of what we have heard in the debate though has tended to go to a more base consideration of ideological the drive-a view that either public ownership is by its very nature a good thing or that private ownership is by its very nature a good thing. Not a lot of light has been shed on the specifics of the situation with respect to Telstra or what a partial sale of Telstra will mean for ordinary Australians. That has particularly been so for many of the contributions I have heard from members of the government in this debate. Telstra is a unique government service enterprise. Not surprisingly, just about every speaker on the government side has stood to tell us that the Labor Party supported the sale of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and therefore it is illogical or unreasonable of us not to support the partial sale of Telstra. If they were to apply some rigour to each of those cases they might actually discern that there is a significant difference between them and Telstra. This is not a debate in strict fundamental ideological terms about public ownership of everything or the sale of everything, or at least it should not be. It should be an assessment about each case on its merits. I want to have a look at some of those aspects of Telstra which are unique and which do make it a necessary enterprise for the government to maintain 100 per cent ownership of. In terms of the use that Australian people make of it, it is without parallel as a government enterprise service. The fact of life is that more than any other service-even more so, I think, than Australia Post-it is a service accessed by people from one comer of the country to the other. It is accessed more regularly than any other service we provide. Comparisons have been made with Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank on that and other issues. Qantas is regularly used by about five per cent of the Australian population. The Commonwealth Bank, I understand, has something like a 20 per cent market share. But, even in the deregulated market in telecommunications, Telstra currently enjoys a market share of around about 85 per cent and is still the major supplier of critical services to residential Australians. There is no comparison between the three. Telstra is a highly profitable venture. Unlike Qantas and, to an extent, unlike the Commonwealth Bank, it actually provides a return to the government. It recorded an after-tax profit in the 1994-95 financial year of $1.75 billion.  has just been talking about the burden it imposes on the taxpayer. What arrant nonsense. The taxpayer has not contributed money to Telstra. In fact, the reverse is the case. In the case of Qantas, you might have had an argument, and that is one of the reasons why the former Labor government took a different position with Qantas. When we were considering the sale of Qantas one of the things that stuck in my mind as one of those glaring statistics was the fact that, if you took every dividend that Qantas ever returned to the government as its shareholder and added them all up, you would have just about enough money to build one decent secondary school. What is the comparison with Telstra? Telstra returned a profit of $1.75 billion and, to the people of Australia, its shareholders, those of us here in this parliament with the trust of the community in our hands, it returned $944 million on budget last year. The honourable member for Sturt wants to tell us that it is a drain on public funds. What a dill! The fact is that, unlike Qantas or even the Commonwealth Bank, it is a source of revenue as well as a provider of services. It is unique amongst the enterprises that this government has in trust for the people of Australia. It should not be forgotten that that is the role in which it is held. You hold it in trust for the people of Australia. Telstra raises its own funds. When you tum a profit of $1.75 billion you do not have to go back to the shareholder and say, 'We need a bit more equity; give us some money.' When it needs to raise additional capital, it is more than able to do that in the markets, and that is exactly what it does-unlike Qantas, which comes back to the government on a regular basis and says, 'We need more equity,' or 'We need that loan written off.' That was the situation we confronted on a regular basis with Qantas. Unlike Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, Telstra is involved in leading edge technology. Not only is it leading edge technology here in Australia; it is world standard leading edge technology. It just happens to be in an industry, information technology and telecommunications, IT and T, which I strongly argue is the most critical industry to our nation's future wealth. More than any other single industry, IT and T will detennine the standard of living that our children have into the 21st century. We are fortunate in Australia to have in public ownership, owned by the people, one of the world's best IT and T finns, a finn which IBM and Microsoft are keen to establish partnerships with. It is not that we have a massive market here in Australia-we do not-but they know that Telstra is at the world's leading edge in a range of technologies which are critical to the long-tenn wealth of the Western world. And we own it. Mr Andrew Thomson-That's a bit of an exaggeration.",58
32,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"It is not at all an exaggeration. If you want to have the argument, that is good, because I would love to have a discussion with someone on the other side who knows something about industry policy and talk to them about the importance of IT and T to our nation's future. If you disagree with me, get up and say it on the record because there are a lot of people I would like to circulate it to. The fact of life is that IT and T is more than any other single industry Arch.",59
33,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"I happen to think, Chris, that this is a very important issue. I think you have got it absolutely wrong-not just from a community point of view but from an industry policy point of view. I tum to the matter of industry and the role which Telstra has played. It promotes within its own purchasing structure-and it is one of the major purchasing organisations in the country-an Australian made policy and has a record of purchasing 70 per cent Australian made. We have a number of firms in Australia-Alcatel, Siemens, NEC and a lot of Australian based firms that are suppliers to them-that are based in Australia rather than in Europe or Asia because Telstra requires it of them if they are going to supply to Telstra. If it were not for that policy, we would not have Alcatel in Sydney exporting hundreds of millions of dollars of telecommunications switching equipment into China. If it were not for that policy, we would not have Telstra effectively competing in open markets. The member for Sturt raised an example of Telstra missing a contract for telecommunications equipment in India. I do not know the details of that case but I am quite happy to accept that it is so; we are not going to win every contract. What an absurd point. But I can equally run off a list of overseas contracts they have secured against the world's best competition where they have knocked over AT&T, Ericsson and a whole range of other people. The fact is that Telstra has performed not just for us as shareholders but for a range of Australian based firms, small and mediumsized enterprises which feed into that critical IT and T industry. Those opposite do not want to have a controlling interest in how that is done in the future; they want to forgo the opportunity that such ownership gives. ",60
34,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"Let me come to that in a minute. If you think you can run it with two-thirds once you are privatised, you do not understand the requirements that are placed upon the directors. If you want the proof of that, go back and have a look at some of the outcomes when we partially privati sed. We found out that once you partially privatise that is it; you no longer have a controlling interest where you can dictate those things. The board of directors is required to look at the shareholders register and ensure that the shareholders receive the maximum return from that company. It may not be the best return for the nation as a whole but for that company they have to get the best return. When we were in government, holding Telstra in trust for the people of Australia, we used that ownership not just to return $944 million on budget as we did last year but to grow other Australian industry. I have been involved with a lot of IT and T finns in Australia that have worked with Telstra and relied upon Telstra to get up and running; they rely upon partnerships with Telstra for their R&D to develop leading edge items. We are talking about small firms, not mega firms, that provide some of the world's best technology . I could mention companies in Brisbane such as Mitec, a small firm in partnership with Telstra for a number of microwave transmission equipment sales. It also happens to be good enough to supply the Soviet space program with equipment. The sort of R&D they need to invest in that is difficult for a small firm in Australia to come by. What makes you think that a board of directors, whose legal obligation is to look after their shareholders, is going to worry about that when they can get something off the shelf from the USA or from Sweden or from Japan? You know the answer to that just as well as I do. You are making a terrible mistake that will be hard for us to rectify when we regain the treasury bench. Administratively, Telstra is involved in a cross-subsidisation to ensure that people who are not in the most economically serviced areas are able to get the service just as well and at the same price. You cannot simply legislate or establish other guidelines that will force that to occur. If you do not own it, if you do not have the sole say in those matters, it will be whittled away over time, as surely as I am standing here. It will not happen tomorrow, it will not happen this Christmas, but over the next five years those members who serve provincial and country areas will see that occur. You might say, 'No, we are in government; the minister will be able to do something about it,' but he or she will not. The minister will not have the power to do that for a couple of reasons-not least of all because in your own bill you are removing the power of the minister to direct the board. So go and read your own bill and you will find out that you are taking that power away. The other reason that you will not be able to do it is that those private shareholders, the directors on that board, will not have that as an obligation under law to observe. In fact, it is quite the contrary. They would be failing in their responsibilities as directors if they did take into account. Members on the other side from provincial and country centres and some of my colleagues on the Labor benches are going to find that those charges will vary, will increase, and those in communities that are not heavily populated will pay a price· for your foolishness in regard to this bill. It will not affect my electorate; downtown Brisbane is not going to be hit by this in three or four years time. Let us put to rest this simplistic rhetoric from the other side that the Labor Party supported the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas so this is just opportunism or political point-scoring. It is nothing of the sort. They are very substantially different areas. In the process of trying to get this bill through, the Liberal and Nationar parties-in a half-smart measure; a too smart by half measure-have decided to link it to funding for the environment. I do not think there is anyone in the community who views that other than as a cynical tactical ploy. If you had the genuine concern for the environment which you claim, why do you make it conditional upon the sale of Telstra? There is no other government program that you are proposing that is conditional upon the sale of Telstra. Those environmental programs that you wish to fund through the revenue from the sale of Telstra are important. Indeed, they match pretty much what we undertook to do at the election as well. If they are important, and I believe they are, they deserve to be funded on budget the same as everything else. It should not be a question of holding the gun at the head of the community and saying, 'The environment is important, but it is only important if you let us sell Telstra. If you don't let us sell Telstra, it is not important enough for us to fund it.' It is too smart by half. It is a cynical political ploy and the people of Australia have seen through it. The other argument which members of the Liberal and National parties have used is to claim that we should acquiesce in this beit cause they claim to have a mandate for it. A mandate is a strange thing. It seems to be a right which some in governments of all political persuasions claim when it suits them, but they conveniently hold a different view at other times. The fact is that I got elected to this parliament, as we all were, and I was elected on a very clear undertaking to the people of Brisbane that I would fight tooth and nail against the sale of Telstra, and I intend to do just that. Let me make it plain: as far as I am concerned, as the member for Brisbane, I have got a mandate to oppose you every step of the way on the sale of Telstra and I intend to do just that. But there are people on the other side who want to talk with a duplicitous view of a mandate. I want to quote to you from Hansard the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). On 15 September 1987 he said this about mandates: When people vote at an election they do not vote on only one issue. The mandate theory of politics from the point of view of proper analysis has always been absolutely phoney. What did John Howard say? He said, 'It is absolutely phoney.' He also said people do not vote on one issue-and by and large that is right. What he said in a moment of candour on 15 September 1987 is something I agree with. You do not have the right to demand of me or my colleagues, or the Democrats, or anybody else, that we acquiesce and lie down to let you sell Telstra, because we have the same obligation to our constituents as you would claim to have to yours. Let me turn to the question of foreign ownership, because quite a bit has been made by the government of the fact that this is going to continue to be a predominantly Australian owned enterprise, although I hope I have been able to demonstrate that it would be an Australian owned enterprise in which those things we regard as important for Telstra will have been lost because you, as the government, will forgo your authority over the board. The question of foreign ownership is important and we took that into account very carefully with respect to the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. But you went to the election and promised the people of Australia that you would ensure that the foreign ownership standards of an Australian share register would be maintained by establishing two classes of shares, a class A share and a class B share; that by establishing two classes of shares you would restrict foreigners to class B shares. For some reason you have decided not to do that in the legislation. I have not heard anyone on the other side explain to us why it is you have decided to break that promise. There has been a lot said here about keeping promises. Tell us, folks: why did you break the promise you gave the people of Australia that you would establish a class B share and that share would be the only share that foreigners could buy? You have decided to break that promise and dust it under the carpet. You might like to come clean in the debate, which is nearing conclusion. Someone on the other side might actually like to tell why it is you have decided to dishonestly break that undertaking that you gave to the people of Australia. Another thing that sticks in my mind with respect to foreign ownership is the sheer magnitude of the task being imposed upon the Australian financial markets. An $8 billion float is an enormous float, the likes of which the Australian markets have never seen. To get $1 billion Australian equity into an organisation-which is the level of equity sought for Qantas-has proven difficult. From time to time, in fact, the foreign ownership has gone above the limits we set. I think the government is going to have enormous problems actually getting the markets to put that amount of Australian equity into it. There is not $8 billion worth of equity out there to put in. Finally, I repeat what a mystifying decision it is to repeal the ministerial direction to the board. Why do that? I suspect the reason is that the government knows it cannot direct the board once there is a private shareholder. Whether it is one per cent or 30 per cent, it does not matter; the minister cannot tell the board what to do once the decision is made to sell off any of it. Think carefully about what you are doing. Think about the impact it will have on those in the community, particularly those in provincial and rural Australia. Many government members are locked into a position which will hurt their own constituencies. That is a sad reflection upon the independence of members of the Liberal and National parties opposite. More than that, you are destroying a major Australian national institution which is for the people to hold. (Time expired)",60
35,Mr BILSON,Unknown,"The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 provides a clear way forward for Telstra to move into the 21st century. During the recent election campaign, the coalition was openly and continually stating that, if elected, it would sell a third of Telstra by way of a share float. On 2 March in Dunkley-my electorate-our campaign team even displayed newspaper style posters which spelt out the us Liberal guarantee for Telstra: two-thirds of Telstra will remain in public ownership; there will be no foreign control of Telstra; Australians will be able to buy shares in Telstra; cross-subsidies for regional Australia will remain; there will be no timed local calls imposed on business or residential customers; and existing price caps will remain to ensure lower telephone prices. Despite many reports of the former Prime Minister's aching desire to sell Telstra, and episodes of pencil throwing, Labor said that the election was a referendum on .the sale of Telstra. From Labor's campaign advertising and continual letterboxing in my electorate promising that the world would end if Telstra were partially sold-the Armageddon theory-to their banners on election day, Labor c1e'arly saw this as a key issue for the election. What occurred? Voters delivered the coalition a huge mandate for its program of practical reforms. Unlike Labor, we were not sneaky or deceptive about our plans for the future or any privatisations. It was a bit like an old western: the election was about the good, the bad and the ugly. The good was the policy platform that the coalition offered to restore the prosperity of our nation and hope for Australians. The bad was the former government that had failed to listen to the electorate and had forgotten communities like Dunkley. The ugly was to come after the election, being the $8 billion black hole that the coalition and the Australian community only discovered after votes had been cast. Voters indicated that they approved of the planned partial sale of Telstra and its accompanying establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia-which will be the subject of later legislation. Because the sale of Telstra was discussed in such detail at least 20 times during the campaign in a major way, there is no doubt that this was one of the first ranking issues of the election. The result suggests that the government has a huge mandate to implement its oft stated policy on Telstra. As Michael Gordon, the national political editor of the Australian, said: The voters made their choice . . . if a mandate means anything, it means that the Coalition has the political authority to proceed with the Telstra sale and the associated funding on an environment package that was universally well received ... It is the best set of environmental measures this nation and this parliament have ever seen. The benefits to Australia and to Dunkley in partially selling Telstra are manyfold, even when we come down to improving the older style analog telephone exchanges in communities like Seaford in Dunkley, where,. on some Sunday nights, you actually have to wait until you get a chance to make a call. This is in metropolitan Melbourne. Because of the old exchange technology, you still have to queue up in areas like Kananook and Fortescue A venues in Seaford just to make a phone call. Currently, only about two-thirds of the exchanges are digitised. Under the government's plans for Telstra, upgrading of all telephone exchanges will occur two years earlier than would have been the case under Labor. For the first time, both residential and business consumers will have access to a customer service guarantee-something they did not have before-not only from Telstra but also from Optus, Vodafone and others. This will no longer just be voluntary but part of law. Industry regulator Austel will set carrier performance standards and determine damages payable to consumers for breaches, up to a maximum of $3,000. Customers will be able to seek damages in the courts if the carriers fail to pay the damages voluntarily. This customer service guarantee will help to rapidly improve the standards of service of Telstra and the other carriers; second best will no longer be good enough for the telecommunications users in our country. What are Labor's objections to this partial sale of Telstra? Labor sold off all-not just part--of Qantas, and half the Commonwealth Bank, even when they said they would not. It seems there has been a road to Damascus type of conversion of Labor to the cause of keeping Telstra in full public ownership. Why was this? Was it poll driven? Was it a means of talking about anything other than the Labor Party's own performance in government? Or was it that, with the sun setting on Labor and the rose-coloured glasses being knocked off many of their members' faces, some recalled a principled but dimming light on the hill? The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who has proposed an amendment to this bill, spoke in this House yesterday of Labor's set of guiding principles on privatisation. He posed four basic questions to guide decisions about privatisation. Is the market already competitive? Can private capital play the role held by public capital? Will the taxpayers have to contribute to the capitalisation of the public enterprise? Are the market structure, its technology and public interest considerations such that public capital can be withdrawn? I encourage this sort of discussion about these sorts of policy issues and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) alluded to some of them in his presentation. The member for Werriwa claimed that in the case of both Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank the answers to these questions were yes, yes, yes and yes. In the case of the partial privatisation of Telstra, the answers in the mind of the member for Werriwa are somehow different. I wonder about those people concerned about their basic banking accounts and about charges on their accounts with banking institutions. I wonder whether they would share some of the conclusions that the former government did and give such a resounding yes, yes, yes as the member for Werriwa suggested. In my view his answers were wrong but so were some of his questions. Whether or not a market is competitive already should not be the sole bar to changing its ownership structure. The key is whether Telstra will be a better corporation with a degree of market discipline that partial private ownership can provide. As Telstra's chief executive officer Mr Frank Blount said in his 1994-95 annual report, talking about his staff: As we become more commercial in our operations and outlook, we are asking our new roles . . . A number of cultural and work practice changes are still required. The chief executive officer was talking about the sorts of changes we are talking about, and they were happening already within the corporation. This issue about the proposed partial privatisation seems to resonate and accord with many of the things Telstra was already seeking to pursue in its own right. If we can have one-third or one-half of Telstra's employees owning shares themselves, then that alone will impose an overnight cultural change on Telstra that will put all the management speak about cooperative working relationships into something which has a dollar value and a real meaning for its employees. Private capital can live with concepts such as universal service obligations and purchasing policies just as well as public capital can. The current provisions under section 287 of the Telecommunications Act for a universal service obligation are actually improved by the bill before us today. Because the sale of Telstra is so important to our country, to our environment and to our future communications industry, I encourage members on the other side of the House to think of the future, to think about where we would like to be in the telecommunications world. There was some mention by the honourable member for Brisbane that the likes of Alcatel and other IT and T providers will somehow no longer be seen to be of strategic benefit and suitable enough to build alliances with Telstra. I find that amazing. With Telstra claiming, as its staff do, that they are running in a very commercial manner at the moment, I am sure those alliances and relationships that have been built up to date will be sustained. It is not as though some overnight change in ownership structure suddenly makes a good relationship a bad business relationship. I am not quite sure whether the honourable member for Brisbane is suggesting that the change and the injection of some new ideas and some new directors into a company that has already got those strategic alliances will lead to it being immediately ejected. I just cannot see that people to grow into happening. Labor says that the universal service obligations must be filled efficiently and as economically as practical. They say that unless that happens then the end of the world theory-the Armageddon result-will occur. But all this means is that Telstra must stay focused on the best way to deliver its services. The member for Werriwa claimed Telstra is flush. With his former government having used Telstra as a 'cash cow', forcing it to pay massive billion dollar dividends, there is little wonder people in my community do not have access to digital telephone exchanges, ISDN and the on-line services that are available to many other areas within our community. With Labor having left the coalition with an $8 billion budgetary black hole, we are actually proposing a measure which will convert technological capital into environmental capital-a very worthwhile objective and one which I thought would have been encouraged by all sides of the House. That reflects the fact that the environment lost ground under Labor. The clearance of vegetation, land degradation, even this nation's history on endangered species, all went backwards under Labor. The injection of capital to try to resurrect and improve our natural systems and sustain their productive capacity into the future is long overdue. The coalition is approaching that task with some vigour and a comprehensive program that has a very logical method of funding--converting technological capital into environmental capital. Labor also ignores the widespread community acceptance of share ownership. You only have to look at the stampede for shares in Woolworths, the GIO, the SGIO in Western Australia and Qantas to know that Australians want to have a direct stake in these enterprises. Telstra is no different. Concerning banking, the member for Werriwa claimed that there was no big, technological change that indicated to the public sector that it needed to keep a strategic asset in the market. Telstra will remain a great and vital Australian company with the government retaining a two-thirds strategic stake. But, if we keep assets in public hands for no other reason than their perceived strategic value, we risk them underperforming over time. This only produces poor relative returns to the Australian taxpayer, impedes our competitiveness and leaves us all worse off. The government's partial sale of Telstra actually stacks up better against Labor's· principles than have some of federal Labor's own privatisations. In fact, it is sad in a way that the previous government gave privatisation a bit of a bad name. The way it went about privatising assets after saying that it would not and the way it went about wilfully spending the proceeds from those privatisations on recurrent expenditure, it has given privatisation a very bad name. The former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said on Lateline that it did not matter of its essence whether Telstra was in private or public ownership. As Labor knows, it is a bit isolated on this issue. The only remaining state Labor government, the one in New South Wales, is busy privati sing, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) pointed out yesterday. During the debate, both the Labor Party and the Democrats have tried to run the line that any staff cuts for Telstra would be disastrous. This subject came up at a public meeting in my electorate during the campaign. Some people in the audience attempted to attribute the reduction in staffing numbers at Telstra solely to the coalition's plans to partially privatise Telstra, but they neglected to mention that the staffing levels at Telstra had already gone down and had been going down for some time. Telstra is not a static corporation. Its changing role and activities were having an impact on its staffing structure. Telstra's CEO, Mr Blount, said on 17 April that Telstra's plan to reduce its 26,000 administrative staff to 13,000 was not triggered by any looming partial privatisation but was the second phase of a business plan that he drew up when he began work at the company, a plan that he drew up under the former government and which it endorsed. These staffing reductions are not something new. It is quite mischievous of the opposition to say that future cuts in staffing numbers at Telstra are directly related to the coalition's plans. That is quite wrong. Much of this reduction will be met through voluntary redundancies, natural attrition and transfer to operational areas. There is a Victorian experience which is worth drawing from and which shows that growth in the private sector takes up any losses in the public sector, so there is generally a net benefit in employment terms. Many of Telstra's skilled staff will be in demand as consultants in the fast growing multimedia sector anyway. Many new job opportunities exist for forward thinkers. As the recent BZW Australia study stated, Telstra is valued at about $28 billion. Profits should grow at around $18 million a year until 1998, the report says, but, without substantial cost reductions, there is doubt that Telstra will achieve its target. Under Labor, Telstra's performance has not always been fantastic. A human resource consultant in my electorate was doing work for Telstra in its telemarketing division. Unfortunately, some of the business relationships that were part of that set of negotiations to provide trained to Telstra fell by the wayside. I am hopeful that those things will change in the future. The first thing businesses and individuals think of is how much calls cost. The Bureau of Industry Economics, in its recent report on international performance indicators for telecommunications, says that between 1989 and 1994 price falls for what is called 'the basket of national services' and for IDD calls were less than the international average. Only in the mobile phone call market did Australia do better. The natural heritage that will be funded from the partial privatisation of Telstra is important to my electorate. Dunkley is a coastal electorate-we call it 'Dunkley by the Bay'. The benefits that are available to it through the Natural Heritage Trust are quite significant. I have no intention of foreshadowing that legislation, but I reiterate the point that after 13 years of Labor government our nation has gone backwards on many key indicators of the environment's condition. It is long overdue for a government to make a significant investment in our future. In a sense, the coalition's partial sale of Telstra will be as nourishing to the Australian communications sector as it will be to the overall fiscal health of the economy, as well as to the community redeveloping and renurturing its natural systems. These are initiatives for our future and for improving the natural and technological infrastructure so that we all have a better future to look forward to. In closing, I remind those on the other side of the HouseMr Lee-Keep going. Don't stop.",62
36,Mr BILLS ON,Unknown,"I should keep going just to avoid someone else having to stand up and speak! I remind those on the other side of the House of the resounding victory our side had in the election. If any other issue generated as much debate as the partial privatisation of Telstra, I am not sure what it was. The proposal was out there. It was discussed to death. The public knew what the now government's intentions were. We were returned with one of the most significant majorities in the last 20 years. It is clear that the community knew staff what our proposals were, supported our initiatives and looked forward to a long overdue investment in the restoration of our natural systems. I am happy to support the bill.",66
37,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! It being 2 p.m. the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA,66
38,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Before I move to questions, I remind members that we have a very delegation from Slovenia in our midst today, the President and a distinguished parliamentary delegation. I extend a very warm welcome to you and may you enjoy your stay with us in Australia. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Court of Disputed Returns",66
39,The Clerk,Unknown,"I present a copy of a petition, Ross Vincent Free against Jacqueline Marie Kelly, filed in the High Court sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns in respect of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the election of a member of the House of Representatives for the division of Lindsay. NA Tariffs",66
40,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Will he confirm reports that he succeeded in rolling the Treasurer on the abolition of the tariff concession scheme? Given that he referred to the scrapping of the TCS as dreadful policy, does it cease to be dreadful policy when you shift the burden from business to consumers? How do you reconcile this GST on imports with your no new taxes policy?",66
41,Mr MOORE,Unknown,"In view of some of the inaccurate reports in the newspapers, I am not surprised that the tactics committee decided to pop this one up first this afternoon. I know it is very difficult to get a good question up. Can I assure you that there is no backbench revolt at all as reported in one newspaper. It is sheer nonsense and, recognising the due process of a party room meeting, this afternoon I will be making a full statement on the matter. Budget Deficit: Public Service",67
42,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister: why is it important for all Australians the government address the projected $8 billion deficit that it inherited from the previous administration? In particular, I ask the Prime Minister: how is the downsizing of the public service linked to the $8 billion hole? If the books had been in better shape, would such tough action have been necessary?",67
43,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The answer to the last question is no. The answers to the first two questions are as follows. It is important in the national interest to address the very bad fiscal inheritance of the present government. It is important because Australia is more vulnerable than most Western economies on our external account. It is essential that we do something firstly about speeding up microeconomic reform, doing something about the waterfront-which you did nothing about for 13 years-and doing something about industrial relations reform. It is essential to do all short. of those things. But there are direct benefits for Australian home buyers in addressing the fiscal mess we inherited from the former government. There is an undeniable link between interest rate pressures and the size of the budget deficit. I want to make it very plain to the House-and I want to make it very plain particularly to people who live in the Australian Capital Territory-that it is no part of the policy of the new government to target one section. of the community as opposed to another. I also want to say to all of those people in the Australian Capital Territory in particular who may be unhappy about some of the decisions the government has taken that, if you have a complaint or a bill of complaints, send the bill to Beazley. Because he was the man who assured us with glib insincerity on 1 February 1996Mr MCMullan-What about your promise?",67
44,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"No. This is 1 February. It is not two per cent; it is 1 February and I think people ought to listen to this. They do not want to hear the truth, do they? The truth really hurts.",67
45,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. The public service cuts are the two per cent efficiency dividend addition that the opposithat tion put forward before anything that they decided,67
46,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,67
47,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"It is your fault. The public service cuts are your fault and the people ought to send the bill to Beazleysend the bill to Kim. This is what the now Leader of the Opposition, who was then Minister for Finance in the Keating government, had to say on 1 February: As far as we are concerned the Treasury estimates that we had in connection with the last budgetand they were Treasury estimatesthey stand for good and we stand by them. In other words, on 1 February he was standing by a figure that a mere phone call to the Treasury would have told him was $8 billion What did he do? Did he pick up the phone and call anybody? No. He said, 'I don't want to know about that.' He said to Ted Evans and Steve Sedgwick, who were the heads of the Treasury and the Department of Finance, 'Please don't tell me. It might spoil a very good story.' It is like the old saying that you never ruin a good story with the truth. Basically that is the situation that this man faced. Can I simply say-particularly in connection with the understandable concern of people who live in the Australian Capital Territorythat it is no part of the policy of the Howard government to target public servants. This morning, I had an extremely constructive meeting with the Chief Minister of the ACT and also with leaders of the business . community in Canberra. Do you know what those leaders said to me? They said, 'This is the first time there has been any serious dialogue between the business community of Canberra and the federal government since the Fraser government was in office.' Instead of adopting a negative attitude, they were concerned about ways and means in which there could be initiatives of the federal government and the territorial government to encourage more private sector investment. I agreed to a number of proposals that were put to me by that group. One of them involved the establishment of a business forum to be chaired by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and to involve representatives of the federal government and the territorial government. Another involved a commitment by me to approach the New South Wales Premier to accelerate the feasibility study into the fast rail link project between Canberra and Sydney. A number of other initiatives were also discussed at that meeting. The bottom line of this is that anybody who understands the operation of the Australian economy knows that unless the new government proceeds with its fiscal consolidation task we will pay dearly for it We will pay higher interest rates. We will have lower business investment. We will have a more vulnerable external account. I say again to those who may be discomforted by those cuts, particularly in the public sector: there is one person above everybody else who is to blame-the now Leader of the Opposiabolish tion.",67
48,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Do you still stand by your extraordinary and fatuous claim made during the campaign that a tariff is not a tax? goods. It must have gone down a real treat with the . business community when you consulted them. Are you going to tell those consumers who are now going to have to pay the governinputs ment,68
49,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, he is debating the question.",68
50,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Are we going to debate the question or are we going to ask questions?,68
51,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,"It is a further question. Are you going to tell those consumers who pay an extra three per cent on video recorders, CD players, television sets, microwave ovens, juice extractors, kids' bicycles, prams, scooters, skateboards, basketballs, dolls' clothes and Christmas decorations that they are not paying an increased tax? Are you going to tell those businesses who are still going to have to be paying an extra $250 million a year on imported inputs that they are not paying any tax either? Is that not a tax in either of those cases?",68
52,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Get on to the question.,68
53,Mr GARETH EVANS,Unknown,"Is he going to have the hide, in the light of this TCS decision, to stand up in this parliament and say that this involves no breach of the pre-election promise that there would be no new taxes and no increases in existing taxes under a coalition government? Will he have the hide to do that?",68
54,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,I congratulate the shadow Treasurer on the speech he has just given on the matter of public importance.,68
55,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Treasurer will addown the track. dress the questions.,68
56,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"As far as I can tell, the question-such as it was-related to the tariff concession scheme. I remind the shadow Treasurer that the Labor Party announced during the election campaign that they would tariff concessions and tax all goods at five per cent. Tariffs Mr Crean-No, not all.",68
57,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,You said you would tax all goods at five per cent. Mr Gareth Evans-But not consumer,68
58,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,The shadow Treasurer with says 'but only business inputs'. So your proposal was to tax at five per cent business which could not be procured in Australia and would go into manufacturing. And you say that that is a defensible position. The proposition that we have put,68
59,Mr MELHAM,Unknown,This is the Peter principle in action.,69
60,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member for Banks!,69
61,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,If the tariff concession schemes are to be amended-they will be amended in the way in which the minister announced-it should apply equally to consumer goods. What is the problem with that? Mr Gareth Evans-You said there would be no new taxes.,69
62,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,You would want to focus the pain solely on the business community. Is that your proposition? It is what you announced in the election campaign. It would be passed on to consumers anyway. You can read out all of your lists and the way it would be passed on. It was Labor Party policy. Mr Gareth Evans-Is it a tax or isn't it? Come on; tell us.,69
63,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"You are now trying to complain about your own policy which you announced during the election campaign. After announcing all of those items that would have additional taxes on them, let me assure the honourable shadow Treasurer that one of the things we will not be putting additional taxes on are ashtrays, because we know he has a special affinity for them. We wouldn't want to make them any heavier. They would do more damage. I implore him to listen to the announcement which will be made by the minister in relation to these matters-good sensible policy. Small Business Miss JACKm KELLY-My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree that there are enormous opportunities for job growth in the small business sector if it can be freed from the burdens imposed from outside sources, such as government regulation and the power of union bosses? Is it a fact that one of the government's main priority objectives is the creation of new and lasting jobs? What action is the government taking to ensure that small business people can get on with the job of creating jobs and strengthening our economy?",69
64,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for her question. I have to say that there were many individual results that gave me immense pleasure on the night of 2 March, but few exceeded the pleasure of seeing an 11.2 per cent swing in the western suburbs of Sydney, which delivered the seat of Lindsay. It would appear that the spirit of being a good loser in an avalanche has apparently been lost on some members of the Australian Labor Party. The member for Lindsay won that seat convincingly; she won it fairly; she won it overwhelmingly. I think she will give very great credit to the people of Lindsay for years into the future. Because there are a large number of small businesses in the electorate of Lindsay, it is not surprising that the honourable member's first question in this parliament should be about the future of small business in Australia. It is no secret that we place enonnous store on the small business sector as a means of building the future strengths of the Australian economy. In the short time that the government has already been in office we have already announced a number of quite specific measures to benefit the small business community. If the Senate is willing to pass our industrial relations legislation, one of those issues which has caused more complaint from the small business community than any other issue over the last couple of years can be put behind us-that is, the unfair dismissal law. Just as environmentalists will be watching how the Senate votes on the Telstra legislation, the tens of thousands of men and women in small business around Australia will be watching how the Labor Party votes on the industrial relations legislation and, specifically, whether it is prepared to maintain in place an unfair dismissal regime which has literally destroyed thousands of jobs over the last two or three years. It will be a very interesting test of the bona fides of the concern of the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and others about the role of small business in the Australian community. Are they going to say yes to fixing up the unfair dismissal law or are they going to say no? Are they going to slam the door shut on those thousands of Australians who cannot get a job in small business because of the intimidatory effect of the unfair dismissal law or are they going to say, 'Let's have an unfair dismissal law that to both sides'? The small business community and the job seekers of Australia will be watching very carefully to see what the Labor Party does on this particular issue. Are they for or against job opportunities in small business? I know that the electors of Lindsay will be watching, as will those in all the other electorates. I think there would be a lot of people in the electorate of Dobell who might be watching. The member for Dobell only just made it The way you lot are going at present, I wouldn't sleep too easily. We have done a large number of things in a short period to assist the small business community. We have announced the setting up of the deregulation task force and we have announced that the Australian Bureau of Statistics will reduce the cost to small business of completing statistical returns by 20 per cent in one hit. The cost of producing those has been brought down by 20 per cent. There will be a national small business summit on 12 June. Introduction of legislation to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent has already been authorised. We have not left that to the budget; we have already made a decision and the legislation to bring it about will be introduced into the parliament this session. We are going to introduce sunset clauses for new regulations and in due course we will be giving consideration to the commitments made regarding capital gains tax. The issue more than anything else which is of concern to the small business community and, therefore, goes to the heart of the long term job opportunities of people in small business, is whether or not this parliamentthe 38th Parliament of the Commonwealthwill focus 011 fixing Australia's arthritic industrial relations system. The small business community will judge the political parties in this parliament on that issue more than anything else. They know and the people of Lindsay know that those people who vote against a reform of our unfair dismissal reforms and those who vote to maintain the present industrial system are voting against the creation of job opportunities in the small is fair business community of Australia. Trade Practices Act",69
65,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister, in light of the last answer that he gave. As he would be aware, one of the two or three most significant requirements placed upon the political process by the small business community during the course of the last election campaign was the proposition of the previous government to amend the Trade Practices Act through the Trade Practices Amendment (Better Business Conduct) Bill to eliminate harsh or oppressive conduct in circumstances where a business was vulnerable to that of another business. Will you now commit your government to introduce this bill, which was one of the top two or three small business demands, and pass it?",70
66,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,It is very obvious from the Leader of the Opposition's question that he did not speak to many men and women in small business around Australia; they would have shown him the door if he had tried. It is very obvious that he does not understand the concerns.,70
67,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Answer the question.,70
68,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I will tell you about the three things that were at the top of their list. They were not at the top of your list; they were not at the top of my list; but they were at the top of their list. They were worried about red tape, they were worried about the compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax and they were worried about the unfair dismissal laws. They were the three things they were worried about. We are going to do something about all of them. You are opposed to doing anything about any of them. You have no credibility on the issue. Budget Deficit Mr LffiBERMAN-Has the Treasurer seen recent reports calling for the government to slow down its program of deficit reductions? What are the consequences for small business, employment and interest rates of further delaying returning the budget to surplus?",70
69,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"Unfortunately, I have seen reports urging the government to slow down the program of deficit reduction. They seem to be coming from the new shadow Treasurer, with all the fury that he can muster. On 24 April he said, 'Labor in opposition does not resile for a moment from the position we adopted as a government that it is very desirable, other things being equal, for there to be a return to underlying fiscal balance as soon as possible.' In other words, they are saying, 'Other things being equal, we are in favour of a balance. It is just that for 13 years they were all unequal. For 13 years nothing equalised enough for us to be able to fix the problem.' When he thought the budget should be returned to surplus, he said on the PM program, 'We'd spread it out over a much longer period, depending on what the size of the task is going to be. We'd spread it out over a much longer period.' It reminded me of the book we used to read as children, We of the Never Never. 'We would spread it out over a much longer period.' But 13 years was not enough, 14 or 15 would be too much, and if you had another term of parliament that would probably get you into trouble as well. As the Governor of the Reserve Bank has made perfectly clear, if the recovery has been in position for four to five years, when else are you going to get the budget back into balance and, if you do not get the budget back into balance in relation to an economic recovery, how exposed would the economy be in another downturn? That is, the legacy of debt, the build-up of debt. As I pointed out yesterday, this debt was being built up all the time that Labor was flogging off assets and not repaying any debt. I noticed that on the Lateline program last night, the Leader of the Opposition was asked, 'What's a con about a $7.9 billion underlying deficit?' He said, 'No, the deficit is $4.9 billion, the headline rate.' But the is you said during the campaign that you stood by the Treasury figure, which was a surplus of $3.4 million, a $4.9 million deficit-a $8 billion of Beazley black hole. That is where it came from, that is how it arose, but you could have stopped it if you had before the election come clean on the accounts with the Australian people; yet you failed to do so. All of this was going on whilst Labor was selling off banks and airlines. The Leader of the Opposition was discussing further privatisation on Lateline last night. In relation to a privatised Telstra, he said, 'I know these things. I have been through more privatisations than anyone else.' Well, you have! We would be prepared to give credit where credit is due. You really are a great privatiser-a brilliant privatiser. It just so happens that you forgot your lines. After the election you became anti-privatisation rather than pro. I noticed in one of the newspaper articles a Labor backbencher accusing Labor in opposition of political cross-dressing. You were a great privatiser. You do have a great record in relation to privatisation. You believe in privatisation. It is just that you cannot bring around the unions and the backbench in relation to it. May I make it clear that the aim to balance the budget is an aim to take pressure off interest rates. To the degree that this opposition will not support the government, it stands for increased pressure on interest rates and lower economic growth and it will deny people job opportunities. Nothing could be more important at this stage than putting in place a program which will balance the budget, which will have consequences",71
70,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Treasurer will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.,71
71,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,This had better be a real point of order.,71
72,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,Why did the Treasurer oppose every single piece of fiscal tightening that we put in place when we were in office?,71
73,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the Leader of the fact Opposition have a point of order? There is no point of order.,71
74,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"That was the point of order, was it? The importance of this to small business is to give small business the opportunity to grow, develop, create jobs and take pressure off interest rates. This is the way in which the government will play its part. This is the way in which the government will overcome the $8 billion Beazley black hole. These are the benefits for the Australian public.",71
75,Mr CREAN,Unknown,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer to the decision last night in your party room on the TCOs, and confirmation now by the Treasurer, that you plan to introduce a consumer tax on imports. Can the minister advise the House how much this new consumer tax will raise? Will the minister table a full list of items which will attract three per cent GST on imports? Does the list include, for example, toys, dolls, sporting equipment, musical instruments, Christmas decorations and-this one-Christmas stockings unfilled? Little wonder they will be unfilled with this tax slug going on all of those items and more!",72
76,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member will not debate the question.  we had kept going your way, they would not have had enough money to fill their Christmas stockings because we were left with his black hole. My colleague the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism has already answered this question. Landcare Mr ruCKS-My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. What action is the government taking to encourage the expansion of landcare on fannlands? What is the social and economic importance of landcare?",72
77,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,I thank the honourable member for his question. The environment and landcare policy that we took to the election represents a historic marriage of the community's,72
78,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,What is your interest in the environment?,72
79,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,Same as yours. Come on! It is a historic marriage of the community's enthusiasm for protecting the environment with the fann sector's will and detennination to tackle land. Mr O'Connor-So you are going to sell Telstra!,72
80,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,I will start again. The environment and landcare package that we Tariffs took to the election represents a historic marriage of the community's enthusiasm for protecting the environment and. the farm sector's will and detennination to tackle land and soil degradation. Mr Crean-Will the money from Telstra be big enough?,72
81,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"We will come to that in a moment. That was reflected in the symbolthe ism of the Prime Minister's launch of the environment package, flanked by the then spokespeople for the environment and for primary industries and energy. Let us say a few things of substance about this. Land and water degradation are Australia's No.1 environmental problem. This is the largest environmental package ever contemplated by a government in Australia and put before the people. It is very much more substantial and innovative than the one the then government put before the Australian people, and they were never able to explain how they were going to pay for it. It establishes the National Heritage Trust fund of Australia with a capital injection of $1 billion, much of which will be used for key capital works projects. The national vegetation initiative is one of the projects and it will be to revegetate hundreds of thousands of degraded lands. The national land and water resources audit will measure once and for all the true extent and economic cost of land and water degradation. The Murray-Darling 2001 project will tackle the major environmental problems in the Murray-Darling Basin, so eloquently referred to by the Prime Minister yesterday, and is substantially larger than the proposition you put forward and did not indicate how you would pay for it.",72
82,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,All our policies.,72
83,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"There is no contrast, none at all. Even if that were the case you would want to see it implemented, would you not? Of course you would. Their credentials are probably not all they are made out to be. We have a commitment to establish a national reserve system and a coast and clean seas program, all of which are very valuable. Let me make a couple of other points. It needs to be recognised that farmers manage no less than 60 per cent of Australia's land. Therefore, they will play a critical role in implementing the package. The first principle is that farmers have to be in the black if they are to be truly green. In the end, the fact is that they do the bulk of the work and undertake the bulk of the expenditure. Mrs Crosio-And they make the profit.",72
84,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"You do not like profit; we know that. They do the bulk of the work and undertake the bulk of the expenditure. They do so not only to secure their future but to secure sustainable agriculture and to sustain a resource base for future generations. So there is a big community benefit. The first challenge in all of this the economy through economic reform in areas that the Labor Party would not tackle. That is the first priority-restore the economic fortunes of the rural sector. It is the key to landcare because poor economic management has been the rural sector's greatest problem in recent years. Look at your performance during the 1980s so far as the farming sector was concerned. We had interest rates well over 20 per cent for years on end because of your very one dimensional approach to managing the economy. We had your utter failure to tackle meaningful industrial relations reform, which cost the farm sector a fortune. You gutted IEDs at the very time when they could have helped the rural sector prepare for the drought and the commodity price declines of the 1980s. You ripped them out. The reality is that we have to deal with . what we have been left with-that is, a farm sector in bad shape because you managed the economy so badly for. so long. You always resisted on-farm landcare works because you were not prepared to recognise the community benefits of doing so. We do recognise the community benefits. We will facilitate them. We will drive them. We will free them up. We will let them happen. Most of all, this expenditure will be encouraged through the introduction of a system of landcare tax rebates and credits-something that you would not tackle, even though I understand your then minister wanted you to-to enable farmers with low or negative incomes to continue spending on landcare. The package is now in dangerMr O'Connor- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order understanding order 145 relating to relevancy. The honourable minister has just circumnavigated the globe of irrelevancy about three times. I think it is about time he wound up his answer.",73
85,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! I am following the minister's response very carefully. The question actually went to the policies required of government and not to a general announcement about what the government's intentions might be. The minister will address the question. I would encourage him to wind it up is to restore as quickly as possible. Mr Kelvin Thomson- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: pursuant to standing order 321, I request that the minister table the document from which he has been reading.",73
86,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the minister reading from confidential notes?,73
87,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,In part I have. I can table part of it.,73
88,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The minister will table the unconfidential portion of his notes.,73
89,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"ThM pornon is two quotes. The first was made by the President of the National Farmers Federation during the campaign. He said: So, on balance I believe the sale is a win, win, win for us. Funding for much needed conservation work will be available. Services to the bush will be assured. And an injection of commercial competitive pressures into Telstra will be a good thing for Australia and for the bush. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I do take exception. Yesterday, we went to the anticipation rule. You ruled that there was no point of order because the debate was not before the House. Clearly, this debate is currently running on Telstra. The mInIster deliberately alluded to the sale of Telstra being the basis upon which their promises could be met. That part is clearly out of order. I would ask you to rule accordingly.",73
90,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"We have addressed this point of order a couple of times over the last few days. I have looked exhaustively through the Hansard record of the previous few days including yesterday's. Whilst the Treasurer particularly has gone very close to the points of order raised by honourable members of the opposition, the rules themselves-the standing orders-have not been breached. I think the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has completed his answer. There is no further point of order. Mr Crean-Yes, he may have concluded the answer, but has he breached the standing order, Mr Speaker? That is what you have to answer.",74
91,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am aware of that, and there is no point of order. I will further evaluate the comments made by ministers as they are made. Mr Crean-Can I plead with you, Mr Speaker, to tell us when the anticipation rule does apply then?",74
92,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Yes, indeed. Mr Crean-As a further point of order, Mr Speaker, could I ask the minister to table the document from which· he was reading?",74
93,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,He has tabled the documents. National Crime Authority,74
94,Mr FILING,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Given that the then shadow Treasurer made an announcement during the election campaign that there would be a $2 million cut to the NCA's budget, given the comments made by John Broome, the Chairman of the NCA, that likely cuts will have a deleterious effect on the operations of the NCA, given that in Western Australia last year NCA staff in the office Perth threatened unprecedented industrial action because of cuts by the previous government to their operational budget, my question is this: will cuts be made to the NCA's operational budget; where will they be made; why is the NCA to be punished in this way when most experts have conceded that Australia is losing the fight against organised crime, particularly in relation to the drug trade?",74
95,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"I thank the member for Moore for his question. I know he has a long standing interest in the work of the National Crime Authority. The member will be well aware that in our coalition policy for the last election 'Meeting our commitments' there was a projected cut in the NCA budget, and that will be implemented. That will, and I have said this publicly in the past, inevitably result in a reduction in the services of the NCA. As far as anything further is concerned",74
96,Mr KERR,Unknown,Soft on crime!,74
97,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,Soft on crime. The former Minister for Justice. suggests that we are soft on crime.,74

100,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, the member for Moore also asked how the budget cuts will be implemented. As far as that is concerned, the member will have to wait until 20 August to see what the budget contains. Industrial Relations",74
101,Mr MAREK,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I ask the minister: will he inform the House as to whether the government will abide by its policy on paid rates awards?,74
102,Mr REITH,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I particularly welcome the question from the member for Capricornia. As members on this side will know, the member for Capricornia has in fact been a very active member of the trade union movement. He has been a member of the CFMEU, a union delegate with the CFMEU, and he has also been a member over the years of the AMWU, so I welcome his question on in industrial relations. He brings a practical viewpoint to the issue, unlike the chardonnay trade unionists who sit on the other side. I think the only good thing that could be said about it is that the member for Capricomia is not alone because the fact that he voted and was a candidate for the coalition parties in the last election just reflects that a lot of rank and file trade union members voted for the coalition in the last election. I want to say to those rank and file trade union members that we will stick to our policy, and our policy will be very good for the working people of this country. On the particular matter which has created a lot of interest amongst trade union officials, the coalition's policy on paid rates was quite clear. We said that over time existing paid rates awards should become minimum rates awards after consultation between the relevant parties. The process of award simplification will not be a device to reduce wages. Mr Speaker, the idea of converting paid rates awards to minimum awards is not new. In fact, the coalition's policy picked up the sort of approach that the commission itself had adopted during the 1980s, and we want to see that process continue as part of the broader set of reforms that we are proposing. Paid rates awards are anomalous; I do not think anybody would seriously contest that proposition. Obviously, over time, we want to see that awards should set minimum standards so that employers and employees are encouraged to negotiate agreements which particularly reflect the conditions in their respective businesses. I think the idea which some are touting that somehow paid rates are needed to set actual rates of pay really is mistaken. If you take the public sector, there is a paid rates award in the Australian Public Service, but in fact that paid rates award has not been changed since the early 1990s. In fact there is now a certified agreement superimposed over the paid rates award, and the paid rates award is about 15 per cent less than what people are getting today. So they are a feature of the system which really over recent years has been phased out. We obviously want to encourage that. Our legislation, therefore, will implement the policy of paid rates awards by removing those aspects of the existing legislation which effectively discouraged the commission from doing what needs to be done in respect of paid rates awards. I must say that we have had a number of consultations with public sector unions about this issue-with the CPSU, the AMWU, the ACTU and othersand, as a result of those consultations, we intend to make sure that the process for conversion will not be a proscriptive one on the commission. In our policy we said that this would happen over time; we are sticking to the letter and to the spirit of that policy commitment. We said it would be done by the commission. We think it is fair that the independent umpire should be in charge of this. We will make sure in our legislation that the guarantee we gave about people's pay will in fact be properly adhered to and implemented. So I think it is a very fair deal. It is a reasonable deal. The exact process has been refined as a result of sensible consultations, and I think it will be one aspect of the policy which over time will produce real benefits. That is my finishing point, Mr Speaker. The reason we are doing these things is that it gives people a chance of higher pay in the future. It is a pity that, even into. the first fortnight of this new parliament, we are seeing the opposition actually regress from the policies they had going into the last election in respect of some parts of industrial relations. People like George Campbell are starting to dictate to the Leader of the Opposition about their industrial relations policy. They are contracting to their ACTU base and disregarding the views and the interests of the rank and file members. I was not surprised that there was a very poor turnout in the so-called lunchtime demonstration today. There was hardly anybody there. The reason is that the good sense of Australia's Public Service has come through; that is, they can see that what we are doing is in fact aimed at improving the system to ensure we have real benefits for average workers. It was no surprise to me that I should get a question from the honourable member for Capricomia, because one of the reasons he was elected is that ordinary working men and women and trade unionists know that it is this side of the House that is going to give them a good deal. Landmines",74
103,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"My question is addressed to he Minister for Defence. I refer to the minister's joint statement with the Minister or Foreign Affairs on 15 April concerning andmines. That statement repeated the Labor government's support for a global ban on 'the production, stockpiling, use and transfer of antipersonnel landmines'. It also announced a unilateral suspension, not a ban, on the operational use of antipersonnellandmines by he Australian defence forces. Does that unilateral suspension on the operational use of antipersonnel landmines include Claymore antipersonnel mines? In light of the inhumane weapons convention's rejection of a total ban, will you now announce a unilateral total ban, not a suspension, on the use of all antipersonnel mines?",76
104,Mr MCLACHLAN,Unknown,"I thank the member or Brisbane for his question. It is true that he Minister for Foreign Affairs and I announced a new policy. I did notice the fury of he new shadow Treasurer the other day. He disputed the fact that it was a new policy, but t is a new policy. The reason I know it is a new policy is that the defence department came to me when I first got this job and said, We want to move this debate further along han where it is today.' Let me tell you exactly what your policy was. When Mr Gareth Evans was foreign minister the policy stated: Under Labor, Australia is committed to, and will work towards, a total ban on the manufacture, stockpiling, use and transfer of antipersonnel andmines... You would work towards their total eliminaion. As the foreign minister said the other day, we will work towards the same result. We have been somewhat disappointed internaionally of recent days, as you know. But the defence department, after some conversations with DFAT, decided that it could move another step. The extra step was to ban the use of them in Australia today. We have banned them with one exception; that is, if there is a serious deterioration in Australia's - ircumstances. You did not ban them. You did not suspend them. It is one thing for the government to say, 'But we didn't use them,' but you did not suspend them. The member for Brisbane ought to know that it was a big step for the defence department to say, 'We won't use them.' That was not your position and there is the change. Mr Bevis-You are using them. You are training with them.",76
105,Mr MCLACHLAN,Unknown,"Well, of course. That exception was made in the policy for a very good reason. Australians go overseas to delouse other people's contaminated areas. But there is nothing new about that because that was spelt out in the policy and you know it. You are trying a cheap trick, but the policy has been moved from where you were. Why don't you read the press release and then you would know the situation. Taxation: Award Payments",76
106,Mr BROADBENT,Unknown,"My"" question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the reasons behind the government's decision to remove the tax exemption announced by the previous administration for award transport payments paid to on-site building workers?",76
107,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I make it clear that award payments have always been subject to income tax. They are, under the ordinary rules of income tax law, taxable. That has always been the case in relation to award payments and it was the case prior to 4 December 1995 in relation to building and construction industry award transport allowances. On 4 December 1995, however, the then Treasurer issued a press release saying that the government would exempt up to $7.60 of such travel allowances from the provisions of the income tax requirements. He also said that legislation would have to be introduced to do it. That is because, under the law as it has always stood, they are taxable. Mr MCMullan-Has it ever been taxed?",76
108,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"It has always been taxable and it has always been taxed, my friend. Do you know why? That is because the Income Tax Assessment Act says that income is taxable. Think about it for a moment. An award payment is income, and therefore it is taxable-and it always has. So I would try to get on to a better point, if I were you. The former Treasurer said that he would be introducing legislation to give effect to an exemption. Of course, no such legislation was ever introduced. Therefore, because exemption legislation was never introduced, the allowances are and remain taxable. This government will not be introducing legislation to exempt certain kinds of payment from the Income Tax Assessment Act. That is the announcement that I made on 2 May 1996. We do not believe that there should be special legislation to exempt special payments from income tax. We think the ordinary requirements in relation to income tax should be observed, whether you happen to be a building worker, any other kind of worker or any other kind of employee. The rules that will apply in relation to these allowances are the same rules that apply to other industries and the same rules that apply to all employees. This is a decision that will ensure uniformity. Let me make it entirely clear that, as far as this government is concerned, there should be uniformity in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act. We do not believe that there can be special deals done or special exemptions given, no matter how organised, no matter how militant the pressure group that seeks it. We do not believe as a matter of fairness that there can be special deals done in relation to exemptions from income tax, and we will not do them, nor will we follow the policy of the Labor Party which announced but never introduced that exemption. This is a matter of equity, this is a matter of fairness, and it matter of principle under income tax assessment law. Department of Defence: Ministerial Briefings",76
109,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"Mr Speaker,· my question is directed to the Minister for Defence, Industry, Science and Personnel. Minister, is it the case that ministerial briefings by the Department of Defence are now conducted on a separate basis, with you receiving briefings separate from the Minister for Defence? When do you anticipate that joint briefings will be resumed? Was this decision to hold separate briefings",77
110,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,So what?,77
111,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"Hang around, John. Was this decision to hold separate briefings a result of a request by you or a decision by the Minister for Defence? Isn't it the case that the decision to conduct separate briefings was a result of your typical behaviour at an earlier joint briefing?",77
112,Mrs BISHOP,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I certainly would not begin by thanking the member for his question because it is so pathetic. We are discussing briefings that are going on with both myself and the Minister for Defence so we are best informed and able to carry out our task. The way we arrange that is none of his business.

115,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Let's put some of the combat equipment away. Australian National Railways Commission,77
116,Mr WAKELIN,Unknown,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Is the minister aware of reports claiming that the dismissal of Australian National managing director, Peter Quick, did not occur because a board decision would be required in late January or early February, at which time the then Labor government would have been in caretaker mode? Does the minister regard this as a credible explanation is a and, if not, what is the true sequence of events?",77
117,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. Indeed, the asking of the question enables members of the House to come to the truth of the matter that surrounds the circumstances of Australian National Railways, which has been the subject of some debate in the House over the last few days. Firstly, I would like to indicate to the House that the former Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith, has been pretending great outrage over the last few days based on two particular accounts. The first of those accounts is highlighted by an interview that he gave to AAP yesterday in which the former minister indicated that he had to step into stop the sacking of the former managing director of AN on the basis that the board, in making that decision, would have had to meet at the end of January or early February this year at a time the former minister felt would be during a caretaker mode of government. Because we all know the member for Kingsford-Smith is such a stickler for convention, we all know that he then said, 'We can't do that because it would be inappropriate.' That is what he said. Indeed, in the interview he gave to AAP yesterday, he said: But the board wasn't going to meet until late January or early February when I believed we would be in caretaker mode and I put the view that it would be inappropriate for the dismissal to in those circumstances. Mr Speaker, I happen to have a copy of the letter that Mr Jack Smorgon, who is Chairman of the Australian National Railways Commission, wrote to me some weeks ago. I thought it might help members of the House to hear a little bit read from this letter. It says: Dear Minister, As a result of ongoing dissatisfaction with the performance of the managing director, the nonexecutive members of the Australian National Railways Commission decided on December 13th 1995 to terminate the services of the managing  proximity of the federal election and in response to a request from the previous minister, the commission agreed to delay the implementation of the decision. Government members-Oh, Laurie! Oh, Laurie!",77
118,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Members on my right! Contain your enthusiasm!,78
119,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"It is important to note the sequence of events. The former minister said that the decision had to be taken in late January-early February. We now know from the letter provided by Mr Smorgon that the decision had been made on 13 December and, indeed, that it was the minister who intervened outside a period of caretaker government to stop the dismissal. I will table the letter for the information of honourable members. The second aspect, and perhaps from the point of view of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith the more substantive aspect, of his outrage over the last few days relates to the fact that he claims he was unaware of the very poor financial circumstances surrounding AN when he met with the chairman of AN, Mr Smorgon, late last year to discuss the dismissal of the managing director. Is that what you are saying?",78
120,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,It was a matter of the $106 million and what you said. You misled the whole House.,78
121,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,I raise a point of order. This has now been a matter of some controversy in the House for a couple of days. The central piece of that controversy was whether or not occur the former minister had been· aware of a $106 million shortfall-not the point that is being claimed now by the minister in his response. He spent a considerable amount of time last week misleading the House,78
122,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Misleading the House?,78
123,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,and he is persisting with it now.,78
124,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,If you have an issue of substance it can only be followed by a substantive motion.,78
125,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Only if I use the term 'deliberately', Mr Speaker, which I did not. Mr Reith-I raise a point of order.",78
126,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,I am in the middle of raising my point of order.,78
127,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I thought you had finished. Mr Reith-I have a genuine point of order. We have had no point of order from the Leader of the Opposition. He is not,78
128,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The minister will resume his seat.,78
129,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"My point of order is this, Mr Speaker: you do have, as you know, understanding orders, a general responsibility for the conduct of the House. When this has been a matter of controversy and is being raised again provocatively and in a misleading fashion, I would ask you to intervene for the decorum of the House. You have a general provision applying in standing orders for that to prevent the minister continuing an argument when he has been in some trouble before and now apparently is inadvertently or otherwise misleading us again.",78
130,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I am well aware of my responsibilities about decorum in the House. I am allowing both sides a reasonable amount of latitude. There is no point of order.,79
131,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. They don't like it, do they? We all know that the substance of the former minister's concerns lies in the fact that he believes he was not-and he has been saying it-aware of the financial circumstances of AN when he met with the chairman in December last year. If that is the case, what the former minister, now member for Kingsford-Smith, is asking us all to believe is that, when the chairman AN approached him in December last year seeking approval to dismiss the managing director, this was such a humdrum everyday event that the former minister never thought to ask why. He never thought to ask, 'Why would you want to dismiss this person? Is there a good and valid reason why you would do it?' All of us on this side of the House know the answer to that. Of course the minister did ask and the minister was informed. I will tell you now: he did not need to be reminded because we know the minister was well aware of the financial circumstances of AN and he was aware of them because of the existence of another letter from Mr Smorgon which came to me a few weeks ago. In that letter Mr Smorgon outlined that the board rejected the 1995-96 budget provided by AN's management and the five-year corporate plan provided by AN's management on the basis that the advice for the budget and corporate plan was unrealistic. The former minister also knows that the board said not only were that budget and corporate plan unrealistic but also the advice coming from senior management was unreliable. He also would have known-according to the information that I now have-that the Auditor General, through Arthur Andersen, who was representing the Auditor-General, was made aware of these very serious discrepancies last year. The most damming evidence of all-I will table that letter for members to contemplatethat confirms that the former minister was aware of the serious financial woes of AN comes from his own mouth. It comes in his personal explanation made to this House last Thursday. I quote: . I am proud of the fact that I appointed Mr Smorgon to tackle AN's financial woes . . . Those were your words in the House last Thursday. Indeed, your words there confitm what we all know. II have discovered in th4 last few weeks thai all through last year you have been aware of the very serious financial circumstances of AN because you appointed the Mr Smorgon in February last year-in your words-to deal with the very serious financial of woes of AN. You knew about the problems of AN back in February last year, as you knew of them in the middle of last year when the board rejected the budget of AN, as indeed you knew of them after 13 December last year when Mr Smorgon came and asked you to approve the dismissal of the managing director. You also knew because you received from your department in November last year a paper written by your department, with the assistance of the finance department, outlining the serious deficiencies within AN at the time. You sent that report back to your department and you sought it back from your department after you had returned it on 13 December last year. I think everybody in this House now knows the truth of the circumstances. The truth is that the former Minister for Transport, over the last few days, has been doing nothing more than attempting to hide the fact of his incompetence and of his cover-up of his own shoddy political deals.

138,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Let us get on with the question.,80
139,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"I will start again. Minister: your recent decision to overturn a limited trial of grain imports to overcome shortages facing feedlot producers raises a question of pecuniary interest. It could have a positive impact on the wheat cheque for growers this year, yourself included. Prior to the consideration of this issue, did you declare a conflict of interest and withdraw from the discussions? If not, why not?",80
140,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It repeats a certain amount of misinformation first presented in the Senate by Senator Bob Collins. The limited grain import trial was a simple trial test domestic grain to establish whether or not it could be moved around in trucks without spillage. It was a 1O,OOO-tonne trial. Only a few hundred tonnes had been through the trial before it was suspended. Who was the minister when it was suspended? Senator Collins. There was a panel whose task it was to determine whether or not the critical nonconformity under which it was clearly established to the satisfaction",80
141,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,Did that apply to you?,80
142,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"Do you want the answer or not? You have made serious allegations. Let me give you the answer. It is very interesting that you are prepared to repeat in here what a certain fellow said over there but have not been prepared to say outside, because you know it does not stand up. Mr O'Keefe-You made a quid out of this!",80
143,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,Do you want to take that back now?,80
144,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"There was a panel whose task it was to oversee this. The panel came to me and said that they had reached an impasse and I indicated, after careful consideration-note this-that we would have to find another way to authorise the movement of imported grain in this country. At no stage have I indicated that we would not be importing grain. I have said just the opposite-if you had done your homework. If you had read the speech that I gave at Grains Council where I announced the decision and if you had read the press release that I made at the time, I said that the parties involved had to resolve this because the livestock industries needed access to imported grains for all the reasons that you have been pumping up around the place so mischievously, so misleadingly and so grossly unfairly. What I have been able to do is precisely what your previous minister could not do: bring the parties together to find a satisfactory resolution. Do I benefit? The fact is that I do not benefit. As a matter of fact, he was saying that I would prosper out of this because I was a grain grower, not a beef producer. Since he apparently knows so much about my personal to affairs, if the former minister had had a bit of a look at this, he would have found that I am in fact a beef producer and a grain producer.",80

151,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"I would have thought the member for Brisbane had said enough today, frankly. You have taken an awful bath today, and the less you say the better.",81
152,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The minister will address the question.,81
153,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"We do have to do a fair amount of work to repair Australia's relationship with New Zealand because of the damage done to that relationship by the man who is now, ironicalIy, the shadow minister for foreign affairs. One of the extraordinary ironies I hear from my department is that the current member for Kingsford-Smith, who has scurried from the chamber during question time, is planning his first overseas visit to New Zealand. He is the man who, according to Don MCKinnon, the foreign minister of New Zealand, reduced Australia's relationship with New Zealand to 'an alI-time low'. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition remembers it only too well. Remember the embarrassment of it alI. The member for Kingsford-Smith is back just in time to be reminded of one or two things. Of course, what the member for Kingsford-Smith did in the relationship with New Zealand, the House will recall, was rip up the air services agreement one week before implementation. I have done a little bit search to find out what actually happened. The member for Kingsford-Smith sent a fax on 24 October 1994 to the New Zealand . Minister for Transport, Mr Williamson, saying that the Australian government would not continue with the air services agreement. The fax was sent, members may be interested to know, on what was a public holiday in New Zealand-a good bit of planning there by the member for Kingsford-Smith. I am told that at the same time a letter was faxed from the minister's office to the Australian Financial Review. So it was nice for the New Zealand government to be able to read the story in the Australian newspapers the next day. What is interesting is that the night before the· fax was sent the head of the then minister's department had dinner with the New Zealand High Commissioner and in the course of that dinner the then secretary of the department never mentioned this plan to abrogate the air services agreement. Why? Because the secretary of the department-this is true, isn't it?-did not know it was going to happen. Something was cooked up that night, somewhere, probably in the office that I now inhabit, which used to be the member for Kingsford-Smith's office-we have had to fumigate it fairly extensively-and we would like to know what was cooked up. The interesting thing is that when the New Zealand Minister for Transport came across to Australia later, on 10 November to be precise, the member for Kingsford-Smith apologised to the New Zealand minister for his behaviour and what he had done. So there was a sense between Australia and New Zealand that at least the member for Kingsford-Smith had admitted his culpability and bad behaviour. Things, I am afraid, got worse because the next year the New Zealand minister arranged an appointment with the then Australian minister, the member for Kingsford-Smith. The appointment was made for midday on 20 April 1995. So the New Zealand minister flew all the way to Canberra-he was going to Perth later on that night-and went to the New Zealand High Commission to prepare for of rethe appointment at 12 o'clock. That time came and a message came from the then minister's office that no meeting could take place for 20 minutes. What happened in the end was the New Zealand minister waited for so long he simply had to give up on the member for Kingsford-Smith, go to the airport and catch his plane. The New Zealand minister waited for an hour and a half for an appointment and never got one. So the member for Kingsford-Smith ripped up the air services agreement without any consultation with his department. In the middle of the night some deal was cooked up with someone-we don't know who. He sends off a fax",81
154,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,I know who.,82
155,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,All right. I'm not saying who.,82
156,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The minister will wind up his answer.,82
157,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I am leaving the rest of the story for another question time. The fact is he ripped up the agreement. He did enonnous damage to our relationship with New Zealand, which the foreign minister of New Zealand said had reached an all-time low. They were his words-an all-time low. So it is little wonder I have to go to New Zealand tomorrow to start the task of reconstructing the relationship. Yes, all this bragging and boasting about how brilliant you are-well, you wait.

He has now confinned that he received a benefit related to his property dealings in Melbourne. You will be aware that page 11 of the guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility says: Ministers should not accept any benefit where . acceptance might give an appearance that they may be subject to improper influence (eg because the giver has or seeks to have a contractual relationship with government or has any other special interest in government decisions). Will the type of discount received by the minister be excluded as being a potential conflict of interest under your code of conduct for ministers? Further, will you give an undertaking today, which you failed to do yesterday, to table returns from ministers which you expect to receive on 27 May?",82

173,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! Prescriptions,82
174,Mrs GALLUS,Unknown,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of a practice sometimes known as 'doctor shopping' where a patient goes from doctor to doctor seeking prescriptions for particular drugs? What is the estimated cost to the community of doctor shopping? What measures can the government consider to address this problem?,82
175,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"-I thank the honourable member for her question. I am aware of the issue she raises. The definition of 'doctor shopping' is someone who sees more than 30 prescribing doctors in a 12-month period. It is something we flagged in our policy before the election that we would be tough on, and the basic strategy that has been pursued up to date is to audit people who get more than 300 prescriptions a year or who see more than 30 doctors a year. That is 1,599 people in the first part of the audit. The results of the phase of that audit have now been collated. What they show is the government can make an average saving of $5,000 every time it intervenes at an average cost to the government of $300, which in this first phase looks like a saving of $8 million. On that basis, an exact estimate of how much it is costing is very difficult, but if you include the additional medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs it is somewhere between one per cent and 10 per cent of these programs, which is between $80 million and $800 million. There is a particular concern as welI with pharmaceuticals that some people visiting Australia may be hoarding pharmaceuticalsstockpiling them, having obtained them first under the safety net proposal. The Health Insurance Commission is investigating a number of such cases. If it believes there is a prima facie case of stockpiling, then it will be referred to the Federal Police. On three occasions in the past 12 months, the Health Insurance Commission has prosecuted people under the Crimes Act and the National Health Act. We will continue to aggressively pursue this as well as looking at issues of medical overservicing. I think we have to look at the demand side as well, which is the patient side. Methods to tackle doctor shopping have to take into account privacy issues and issues of the doctor-patient relationship, but it is vitally important if we are to make Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits system sustainable in the long term. Compulsory Patient Fee",82
176,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Following on from the Minister for Health and Family Services's answer and his suggestion that he is going to look at the demand side for medical services, I ask the minister: did the minister advise the AMA or others that a compulsory patient fee for doctors visits was an option that was being considered for the budget? Did the Prime Minister rule out such a patient fee in the statement which his staff circulated to the press gallery on 19 April when he said, 'The government will be sticking to its promise to retain Medicare'? HaS the minister's attention been drawn to the column of the member for first Bradfield in the North Shore Times that a patient fee 'is an option that needs to be looked at'? Will the minister follow the advice of the member for Bradfield or will he today rule out a compulsory patient fee for doctors visits?",83
177,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"The shadow minister can wait until budget night to find that out. There is, however, a problem with demand, and I do not deny that. The problem with demand has been no better put recently than by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Brian Howe, who said: I had my go at dealing with that issue that I think is a bit of time-bomb for the health system He continued: The dangers we have with Medicare is that we'll finish up taking too much resources if we don't deal with the pressures. One of those pressures is oversupply which leads to overdemand. It is interesting to know that the former governmentMr Lee-Did the Prime Minister rule it out?",83
178,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,Unknown,"Come on! You know. You have been around long enough to know how it works. It will be ruled in or out on budget night. But it is interesting that when you get into government you can actually look at some of the things that the former government looked at. In the Australian Doctor on 19 April, there was this lovely little gem: Hal Swerissen, senior general practice adviser to former Federal Health Minister Dr Carmen Lawrence, confirmed the legal advice indicated it was possible to restrict access to provider numbers. So the former government was looking at such things as restricting provider numbers, trying to limit GPs and trying to do a whole lot of things to limit demand, which threatens to reduce Medicare. You did not have the guts to act on any of them. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under the standing order that the Prime Minister quoted yesterday, is it open for him to tell us whether or not he ruled out a copayment in the budget?",83
179,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! There is no point of order! Meat Industry,84
180,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"I address my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I ask: considering the international pricing difficulties presently facing Australian meat producers, what initial steps is the coalition government taking to address the need for reform of the Australian meat industry?",84
181,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,I thank the Mr Tanner-Kicking blue-collar workers.,84
182,Mr ANDERSON,Unknown,"We will come to that interesting aspect of it in a moment. In essence, the answer is in two parts. Firstly, there are industrial relations reforms so that we can build a cooperative model instead of the confrontationalist one that you insisted Secondly, I have announced a task force whose job it will be to report to me in four months time-not another review, not another never-ending report, but a task force-about how the institutional arrangements of the industry ought to be structured. We have the Meat Industry Council, the AMLC and the MRC at the moment. We have to integrate them better so that they drive the process of reform. Reform is desperately needed after your attempts over 13 years. Australia is the world's largest meat ing country. It ought to send a shudder down the spine of everyone in this place and outside it that the New Zealanders and the Americans are now landing their product on our supermarket shelves at competitive rates. How are they able to do that? Maybe it is in large part because, as reports have shown, the Americans are able to process beef for as little as a third as we can and the New Zealanders for as little as a half. - You mob engaged in report after report after report. I said I am not going to do that, but one of them was the Industry Commission's, and this is the one I want to focus on briefly. It reckoned that some modest reforms-and I know the honourable member who asked the question will be interested in this-would deliver roughly $1 billion of savings for the meat industry. Here is the rub. You know what they said? Fifty per cent of them would be available for our hard-pressed producers, that is, the farmers; 25 per cent would be available for the processors; and the remaining 25 per cent-who for?-for the workers. Some modest reform would benefit the workers. They would get pay increases of around 25 per cent, plus better employment opportunities. From that I conclude that you magnificent champions of the working class over there and Bob Collins and Laurie Brereton when they were the respective ministers were saying that our industrial relations legislation would see that the problem can be fixed. That is why just five per cent of the productive capacity of the Australian meat industry has been reformed. While the New Zealanders and the Americans are creaming us, just five on. per cent of our capacity now operates on modem industrial relations practices, worldbest practice. The pace of reform has been unbelievably slow. What you were doing, of course, was blocking the effective and efficient export of our commodities but facilitating the export of our jobs, you champions of the working classes. Compulsory Patient Fee",84
183,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, could I supplement an answer given by the Minister for Health and Family Services. I draw the exportattention of the honourable members for Dobell and Melbourne to a paragraph in the Governor General's Speech which repeated the commitment I made during the election campaign that the coalition would maintain Medicare bulk-billing and community rating. I note, Mr Speaker, that we have had 20 questions today, which I think exceeds the experience of anybody in this chamber. On that note, Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Member for Werriwa",84
184,Mr TIM FISCHER,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to raise a point of order in relation to a matter arising from the closing stages of question time. During the closing stages of question time, I clearly heard the member for Werriwa say-and I use the exact words-'absolutely corrupt' with regard to, and directed at, the member for Flinders. He also directed them generally at the front-bench. I find that personally offensive. member for Flinders will as well. I invite you to invite the member for Werriwa to do the right thing and withdraw those words or move a substantive motion.",84
185,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There is normally a great deal of good-hearted banter during question time. I must admit that I did not personally hear the comments of the honourable member for Werriwa. Did the honourable member make the comments as alleged? If so, I would ask you to withdraw them unreservedly.",85
186,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I understand that it is the practice of the House that if a member takes offence at something that is said",85
187,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,We are not going to debate the issue.,85
188,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"It would be raised at the time. So, if the Deputy Prime Minister had any problems with my remarks, it is curious that he would raise them some 15 minutes after they were allegedly made. Mr Speaker, I can assure you, the House and the Deputy Prime Minister that those remarks were not directed at any other member of this House.",85
189,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! When you say 'any other member', to whom was the reference intended?",85
190,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"The question and the answer concerned the relationship between the member for Flinders and Mr Ron Walker in Victoria. My comments were directed at Mr Walker. I would have thought that they were rather kind, given the likely court proceedings that will take place as a result of the inquiry into the Victorian casino. I thought that I being rather generous.",85
191,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Did you or not? Mr MCGauran- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I do not believe the member answered your question. We need an unambiguous answer from the member: was his statement 'absolutely corrupt' directed at any member in. this chamber or not? We are yet to hear this coward, this gutless wonder, answer that question.",85

195,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Mr Speaker, I have a question for you. I draw your attention to Audit report no. 18: competitive employment training and placement services within the Department of Health and Family Services. Page 20 of that report relates to question on notice No. 2495, asked in the House of Representatives on 29 June 1995. The reply of the Minister for Human Services and Health was tabled on 23 August 1995. I have given notice of my intention to ask this question of you about the honourable member for Fremantle. The question requested details of each CETP project established since 1 January 1994. Material provided to the minister to was record comments by her department included a schedule of 28 projects under the heading 'CETP services established since 1 January 1994'. The minister included this schedule as an attachment to her reply. The report said that the ANAO found that the attachment cross-referenced in the minister's reply included incorrect information on the extent of CETP services established since 1 January 1994. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order",85
196,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Sit down.,86
197,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"It found that three of the 17 projects were not new projects but 'reauspiced projects', as they tenned it. It continued to say that the briefing provided did not include relevant background information. It all relates to the fact that the ANAO has found that an answer given by the minister was inaccurate. In that sense, I believe the former minister, perhaps inadvertently, has misled this place. I would ask that you request that she apologise to the House for having misled the parliament, albeit it was on the advice of her department.",86
198,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The right honourable member for New England has raised a very complex question. We will need to examine the report in considerable detail. If any further action is required when we read the report, I will further address the House. House of Representatives Committee  for you. It is said that you are John Howard's independent Speaker. I, for one, would encourage you in that role, even if it is a little unclear at this stage precisely what that means. You are aware that the House of Representatives committee staff are concerned about reports that certain of their number are being spotted and targeted for redundancies. Would you please undertake inquiries and report back to the House about this matter. Further, I am sure you would agree that the committees are one of the few bulwarks in this House to keep the executive accountable. If these rumours are true, could you please advise the House how many will be retrenchedand how reducing the numbers of committee staff will contribute to the effectiveness and independence of the parliament and to making the executive more accountable to the parliament?",86

The editorial stated that my thinking seemed to be inclined to a joint force rather than to separate forces pooling their resources. This is a misrepresentation of my remarks. In response to a question asking whether I foresaw joint New Zealand-Australian forces, I did not go as far as that. I said words to the effect that a useful complementarity is as far as we possibly can go. The editorial also called on me to make an unequivocal statement ruling out the joint force proposal. I did not advocate a joint force. It would be useful if the Sydney Morning Herald could discipline itself to more accurately report these remarks . NA",86

206,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The refusal of the Government to unequivocally honour its pre-election promises to older Australians I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",87
207,Ms MACKLIN,Unknown,"Jagajaga) (3.39 p.m.)When Labor came to power in 1983, older . Australians could have been described as the forgotten generation. Over the next 13 years, successive Labor governments set about addressing the situation of the elderly in our community. Our aim in government was to build up a holistic system of support for the aged--one that covered transport, housing, respite care, services to the elderly in rural areas and the elderly in minority groups. Successive Labor governments in the 1980s recognised the problem and systematically set about implementing a long-term program of improving the situation of the aged in our community. As those opposite will now know, the program became formally known as the aged care reform strategy. I am very proud that my predecessor, the previous member for Jagajaga, had very a large hand in implementing these reforms. The strategy had a number of aims: to change the balance of care away from nursing home care to support for people living in their own homes or in hostels; to develop a greater range of care choices for the frail aged; to improve standards of care in nursing homes as a result of the introduction of an upgraded program of monitoring; and to ensure that no pensioner in a nursing home would be required to pay more than 87.5 per cent of the standard pension. It is significant then that the minister responsible for aged care in this government, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), is prepared to canvass older people paying more for nursing home or hostel care. On the Four Corners program recently she also refused to rule out a death tax for older people to pay their nursing home bills. How does this possibly sit with the commitment to no new taxes? Does it mean no new taxes, except on the most vulnerable in our community-elderly people in nursing homes? Labor's strategy also emphasised the provision of higher benefits in hostel funding for those with higher care needs, support for carers and an action plan for dementia. Labor's commitment in this area is dramatically illustrated by our willingness to find the money to set about improving the position of older Australians. For example, in the area of home and community care, Labor's expenditure grew from $152 million in 1984-85 to $613 million in the last year or so. This represents a 163 per cent increase in real terms. That is the sort of need that Labor was left with to fill in 1983. It is fortunate for this government that the increases are there in the forward estimates to meet the growing needs of older Australians and their reasonable desire to remain independent in their own homes for as long as possible. But yesterday the Minister for Family Services refused to commit herself to this growth for home and community care, even though it is explicitly written in the coalition's election policy. It needs to be acknowledged that when Labor came to power the Commonwealth was spending $0.8 billion on nursing homes. Under Labor this grew to $1.8 billion. In fact, under Labor, aged spending in total grew to $2.9 billion in 1995. In real terms that represents a 62 per cent increase, compared with an estimated increase of only 33 per cent in the target population over the same period. In its pre-election promises, the government made many commitments to the people of Australia. Their promises were taken on trust. These promises, especially those to the elderly in our community, received further ratification by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he said: Now, one group in the community that is not going to be hurt is the most vulnerable.... we protect the vulnerable and the needy. These sentiments deserve the total support of this parliament. It would be carrying forward the work done in the area of aged care by previous Labor governments-governments that were guided by the basic principle that the way we respect and care for our aged and vulnerable is one of the yardsticks that measures how civilised, how decent, our community is.· Unfortunately, this government is not in power for more than five minutes when it seems to be trying to duck away from these promises. Could it be that these fine promises were nothing more than electioneering rhetoric, aimed at conning the Australian public into believing that a Howard government really did care for people? If so, how do we explain the implications of the proposals gradually revealed by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) over the last week? Even the manner of their public presentation has been a revelation. There was not a straightforward statement of intent, rather a succession of media releases, radio interviews and doorstops that gradually revealed this government's grand strategy: handing the bulk of aged and community care services back to the states. This plan is presented as a masterstroke, a means of cutting out duplication and waste. But is it simply a means of helping finance what has come to be known as a 'Costello con'? In fact, this is simply a trick to make the states responsible for a very difficult and costly area of government. We can only hope that even Liberal state governments will not be part of it. This area, I would suggest, is a true test of a government's commitment to its peopleand this government fails that test at the first opportunity. What does handing these services back to the states mean? To understand the full implications of this, we need to appreciate the situation that existed before Labor governments began to take an increased responsibility for financing and regulating care for the aged. The Giles report in 1984 makes a good starting point. I will not show you the pictures will because I find them too gruesome myself. It paints a very graphic picture of the types of problems that used to occur under state supervision and which could easily occur again. There were great variations in the quality of care provided, in staff to resident ratios, and too much of the care itself was of an unacceptably low level. In fact, the Giles report talks of 20 nursing homes in the Melbourne area alone that were gUilty of 'inhumane conditions and treatment'. Melbourne was not alone in this. The Giles report says that substandard nursing homes were prevalent in every state. Failure to guarantee minimum national standards is a fundamental failure for a national government. It is not just we in the opposition that see these hand-back proposals-the son or daughter of Fightback-as an outrageous abdication of responsibility. Aged care providers, representing both community and commercial interests, have been very swift to register their disapproval and dismay at this prospect. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association, representing 200 nursing homes and 55 hospitals, said in a media release on 3 May this year said: Why would the minister want to transfer a national program from one jurisdiction to eight? It makes no sense. The Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, representing private enterprise and church, charity and community operators of residential care facilities, issued a media release on 2 May which was headed 'Aged Care Providers Reject Transfer to States'. The association said they would 'reject outright any plans by the federal Minister for Health and Family Services to transfer to the states responsibility for financial allocations and standards monitoring in aged care programs'. They went on to say: Care of the frail aged in our community requires a national approach to ensure adequate funding ... and the consistent delivery of quality care across the whole of Australia. This task will be even more difficult to achieve if six state and two territory governments are involved. Alarmingly, they further go on to say: Neither the Minister for Health and Family Services nor any representative of the Federal Government has discussed this proposal with aged care service providers.",87
208,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,That is consultation for you.,89
209,Ms MACKLIN,Unknown,"That's it. What are we getting to here? Is this going to be government by decree, free from any consultation with interest groups? One has to wonder where the minister went for his information and what sorts of efficiencies he really has in mind. Would he call it efficient to return to the pre-Giles report scenario where it was all too common for large variations to occur in the availability of residential care and large variations to occur in the quality of care? The minister's proposals have provoked further criticism. Reverend Ray Cleary, Chief Executive Officer of the Melbourne City Mission, in opposing the transfer of aged care services to the states, says: This pass the parcel game seems to be the force determining the question of responsibility for aged services. The focus ought to be on the client. He asks: What better outputs can be achieved by devolution? Reverend Cleary then goes on to say: The loser in this game will always be the increasing percentage of elderly citizens of Australia require specialist aged care services. He also points out that the general perception among aged care providers is that when the states were responsible for standards of care the monitoring was inadequate. What was the response of the Minister for Health and Family Services to this criticism? On 2 May, he conceded that his plan may see differing health standards across the country. In his view-I cannot imagine what this means as far as aged care goes-this will encourage 'competitive federalism'.",89
210,Dr LAWRENCE,Unknown,That means you can move from South Australia to Victoria.,89
211,Ms MACKLIN,Unknown,"That's right. I think the minister might have difficulty pointing out the advantages of competitive federalism to elderly people forced into substandard care as a result of his washing his hands of this responsibili ty . The loss of federally regulated outcome standards is just the beginning of the problem. It is one thing to hand over responsibility to the states and receive undertakings from them in return. It is quite another to guarantee that the states will actually live up to these undertakings. In fact, establishing and maintaining adequate levels of accountability or performance from the states has been shown in other areas of government to be almost impossible. There can be no guarantee that the states will spend the money the Commonwealth allocates with these sorts of agreements. The minister, in one of his statements, says that he would tell the states, 'This is what we expect in the way of outcomes; you go and meet them.' Even assuming that all the states would accept this interesting direction in good faith and with goodwill-a huge assumption given the problems we have had with Medicare agreements-the minister is grossly oversimplifying an incredibly difficult and complex task. The crucial factors which are very difficult to measure in these areas, if they are not carried out properly, are quality of nursing home care, development of independent living skills and sensitive care of those suffering from dementia. These will be ignored if they are not able to be properly monitored nationwho ally. When you find that the states have not spent the money you have allocated for aged care, what will you do? You will be able to do nothing, and elderly people will be left without any care. This process is likely to be exacerbated by certain concomitant moves to introduce market principles into community services and aged care-things such as compulsory competitive tendering, privatisation and userpays. We have seen a lot of it in Victoria. The latest idea in Victoria is to tender out Meals on Wheels. That is where you are transferring aged care to--to people who have that sort of attitude to aged care. The people of Australia are going to want to know where in your policies before the election did you reveal the plan for such a revolutionary change in health and community services. In fact, like other conservative governments before you, particularly ours in Victoria, having been elected on one agenda, the real agenda remains hidden.",89
212,Mrs MOYLAN,Unknown,"I think the action of the shadow minister for family services, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), in bringing this matter before the House today is reprehensible. It is reprehensible because she has brought this matter to the House on the basis of mere speculation, and all that does is needlessly unsettle and worry older Australians. It highlights Labor's cynicism, which is obviously not receding after the electorate's stinging rebuke to Labor on the 2 March election. It is also utterly breathtaking in its hypocrisy. We have had government for nine weeks. The shadow minister is basing her comments today on mere speculation. That is all it is. When her party was in government, it had 13 years to address the problems of aged care and the problems of older Australians and it did not. I say to the shadow minister that perhaps when she has been in the parliament a little longer she might come to understand her responsibilities in the wider community in working on mere speculation in order to get a scare campaign going in what is such a very important issue. She might also learn a little about the budget processes, and that speculation is rife. Perhaps the shadow minister should consult with some of her senior people who have been in government. I do not propose to respond to the shadow minister's attempts to pre-empt our budget strategy except to say this: our government has never supported death taxes. It was your government who, prior to the last election, prior to the House rising last year, started talking about death taxes. We have never supported them. This government takes its election commitments very seriously. We will keep the faith of our commitments to provide assistance to those most in need. These commitments have been developed after extensive consultation with people in the aged care sector, with the providers and with the consumers. We have listened closely to what they have had to say. How ironic it is that this issue is being promoted by the Labor Party, the party of real broken promises. It is a great irony. I have just 15 minutes to summarise Labor's record of broken promises. And isn't it a lengthy one. It would take me hours in this chamber to summarise them. There is a litany of them. The previous policy documents of the Labor Party in relation to aged care are littered with broken promises. We remember, as do all pensioners in this country, that it was the Labor Party in the lead-up to the 1993 election which promised to take all pensioners out of the tax system by 1995. However, five days after the electionsurprise, surprise!-Dr Neal Blewett, who was then a minister, said it was an error. Can you believe it? Labor reneged on its promise. It was no error. It was calculated and it was a cynical ploy to hoodwink the elderly voters in this country. This was the first of many broken promises. But, more importantly, it highlighted that the Labor Party had callously deceived elderly Australians simply to get their vote. Can you imagine the outcry if this government were to hide behind the excuse that its policy was an error? Let us look at Labor's record of inaction on issues of importance to older Australians. Labor persistently refused, until last year, to abolish age discrimination in the federal Public Service despite years of pressure from the coalition and the general community. It took pre-election panic to get action from the then Labor government. Labor consistently failed to provide fair, just and equitable tax treatments for self-funded retirees. Labor's promise to pay the l-a-w, law tax cuts in the form of matching government contributions to superannuation displayed an arrogant disregard for self-funded retirees and those who will shortly retire, who have already provided for their future and no longer make superannuation contributions. Unlike the former Labor government, the coalition takes pre-election commitments very seriously. I specifically refer to, and suggest that shadow minister opposite reads, the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to ACOSS in October last year. Each and every member opposite should hang their heads in shamethere is hardly any of them in here; it obviously is not an important matter to them-at the inaction by the Keating and the Hawke governments on aged care issues. This government has inherited a legacy of serious neglect. Labor ignored the needs in the aged sector. In stark contrast, the coalition is committed to delivering improvements in living standards in this area. Labor has simply been a party of glossy reports and inaction. In particular, Professor Gregory identified the cause of the problem of years of neglect, of cumbersome bureaucratic funding structures which actually discourage providers from making provision for places for people in nursing homes and in dementia specific facilities. This was a major report into the funding requirements of nursing homes. When you look at the report you can see why the government tried to sneak out of it without paying it much attention. It is a damning indictment of the lack of care of Australia's frail and aged, and it was happening under the Labor government. They did not table this report in the House, let alone make it the subject of a ministerial statement. They did not want the opportunity to debate the matter. It was released from the office of the then Minister for Human Services and Health. We need look no further than that report to highlight the major problems cemfronting this area. What became of the Gregory report under Carmen Lawrence? It joined all the other reports on the dusty shelves of her ministerial office, reports like the first Gregory report, the Keys report and the Macri report. You name it; Brian Howe and Carmen Lawrence shelved it usually after muttering pious platitudes about how important these reports were and how important it was to implement their recommendations. At the end of the day we were left to rescue a residential aged care system in financial crisis, in a state of rock-bottom morale and in the a state of shock. Our government recognises that there is a need for substantial improvement in nursing home buildings in Australia. Because of Labor's rigid and incredibly bureaucratic funding formula and outcome standards there is a complete lack of any incentive to maintain good quality nursing homes. I will now tum to the government's plan for the aged care sector and set out just one or two of them. The shadow minister mentioned the home and community care program. Let me say that we have a very strong commitment. We recognise the importance of older Australians being able to stay in their own homes for as long as they can. We recognise the many benefits of this. We have outlined in our policy document-which is available if the shadow minister wants to look at it, although I am sure she has already seen itour commitment to the home and community care program. Australians are living longer. In the new century, when those of the postwar baby boom generation reach the final years of their lives, the 2.5 per cent of Australians over the age of 80 in 1993 will have grown to about seven per cent in the year 2040. As a community we must look ahead to provide the infrastructure of residential and community based aged care which will be required by frail, older Australians. The community expects the government to put both shortand long-term strategic plans in place to address the ongoing needs of the community. However, Labor's legacy in the aged care system is straining to cope with the present demand, let alone building for the future. Labor's aged care creation is collapsing under its own weight. It cannot even begin to address the needs of the future. We will address this. We will make sure this is addressed. Change will not necessarily happen overnight, but this government is working to lay strong foundations. Labor has a nasty record of ad hoc management and a strong tendency to make decisions about older and frail Australians for political expediency, not for good policy. What has amazed me as I have moved throughout the sector talking to industry and consumer groups in the few weeks since I was appointed minister is that the industry is suffering from a gross lack of action by the previous minister, the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). She sat on her hands and the workload that I am now dealing with testifies to that. This is reflected in the quality administration of the member for Jagajaga's spiritual guru, the former ministerial boss, Brian Howe, and her predecessor in Jagajaga, Peter Staples, when ideology counted for far more than real and practical outcomes benefiting frail aged Australians in need of quality care. Mrs Bailey-Driven by ideology, not by care.",90
213,Mrs MOYLAN,Unknown,"Absolutely. The industry is simply seeking leadership, action and, importantly, decisions. That is the one comment I have had made to me as I have gone around talking to people in the industry and to consumer groups. They say the former Labor government has failed to take any decisions for at least the last seven or eight years and this is one of the reasons why this sector is in such a mess. They just refused to address the issues. As I said before, they are so ideologically hidebound that they cannot consider the needs of elderly and frail Australians beyond their own ideological pursuits. That is a great tragedy for older Australians and for those who are frail and ill. The policies that this gov-rnment took to the election were overwhelmingly endorsed by the electorate. They are very clear and very specific. I heard the shadow minister make reference to them and we have not changed those policies. Today the shadow minister has engaged in mere speculation, which is cynical and reprehensible. It is mere speculation. We laid out our policies very clearly before the election. They were thoroughly endorsed by the electorate, and that is why we are sitting here and you are sitting over there. Unlike the Labor government, who could not provide leadership or action and could not make decisions, we will take action. All those beautiful, glossy reports lining the shelves in Carmen Lawrence's offices-some of which are very good and very acceptable-have been collecting dust for a very long time. The Labor Party had a serious problem in government. They spent a lot of money on consultants, had big staff numbers and big departments, but they have never been able to take their policy development-some of which we of the concede is good-from the point of policy development to implementing that policy for the good of Australia, and in this case for the good of frail and ageing Australians. We will provide the leadership, take the action and make the decisions that will address the crisis which Labor's inaction has created. You are the gUilty party. You broke election promises for the last 13 years. You broke them; not us. You made them; you broke them. They are there in black and white. I can bring the Labor Party's policies on older Australians into this House. You broke those policies. It is your record that is up for scrutiny. The electorate has scrutinised it, the electorate made a decision and you are out of government. You had the responsibility for 13 years and you did nothing. You can now sit back and watch while a committed government will deliver to older Australians.",92
214,Mr LEE,Unknown,"I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) paid the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) the courtesy of being in the chamber for this MPI. We could settle this very quickly if, by interjection, the Prime Minister could rule out the measures that are worrying and unsettling older Australians.",92
215,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,It's way past choir practice time.,92
216,Mr LEE,Unknown,"I acknowledge the Prime Minister's interjection, and I will make sure that the elderly residents of my electorate have a chance to read it. The reason why I wanted the Prime Minister to stay in the chamber was to hear me read from a couple of letters that I have received from my constituents who are worried about the very issues that the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) has been raising this afternoon. As the Minister for Family Services said, there is a lot of worry out there in the community. She claims that it is needless worry. She alleges that the Labor Party is in some way trying to unsettle and worry older Australians. I can tell the minister that a lot of elderly Australians are worried and unsettled. The reason they are going to stay unsettled between now and August is that the minister refuses to rule out means testing of nursing home benefits. Yesterday in this chamber the representative of the Minister for Social Security refused to rule out pensions falling below 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The next government speaker, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl)-one of the better representatives of the National Party----<:ould also make sure that the elderly people in his electorate will not be worried and unsettled if he gets an assurance, private or otherwise, from the minister and lets us in on the secret and tells us whether he can assure all elderly Australians that there will be no means testing of benefits paid to residents of nursing homes. He should also give us an assurance that pensions will not be allowed to fall below 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Let me give an example of why people are worried. I have before me a letter I received from a resident of Tumbi Umbi, within my electorate. It is entitled 'Proposed tax on assets of nursing home residents'. It says: Dear Mr Lee, The above subject. I am certain would now be worrying hundreds of thousands of older Australians. Mrs Moylan-When did you receive thisbefore the election?",92
217,Mr LEE,Unknown,"This letter is dated 18 April, after which you refused to rule out the means testing of nursing home benefits. It states: Dear Mr Lee, The above subject. I am certain would now be worrying hundreds of thousands of older Australians who face the prospect of one day, shortly perhaps, needing nursing home care. I recently read that the coalition government of Prime Minister John Howard was proposing to impose a tax on the assets of nursing home residents, residence being a tax determining factor-this death tax being applied on the same basis as deferred local council rates for elderly residents which are payable with interest from their estate. I would ask you, Mr Lee, to oppose this very unfair proposal on behalf of all the elderly residents of Australia. From my point of view as a mid-60 year old retiree on a small private pension, I am against this proposal for the following reasons. The coalition promised pre-eJection that they would not introduce any new taxes, and this is surely a tax. Mrs Moylan-We haven't proposed anything.",93
218,Mr LEE,Unknown,"You have refused to rule it out. On Four Comers you said that you would consider imposing a new death tax to fund improvements in nursing homes. My constituent goes on to say: It is a selective tax on a defenceless group. Hear, hear! He finishes by saying: Your help and support in opposing this very worrying proposal is earnestly sought. I can assure my constituent that the member for Jagajaga, myself and all Labor members of this House will be raising this issue every week and every day that the House sits until we get the assurance that the Howard government will not impose a means test on benefits provided to nursing home residents. What I find most outrageous is that just over a year ago the current Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, came into this chamber ranting and raving, claiming that he had a secret Finance document which would show that the then Labor government would introduce means testing of nursing home benefits. He demanded that the then Labor government rule the matter out. There was nothing then about it going to the ERe or waiting until budget night. Dr Wooldridge was in here day after day wanting us to rule the measure out. What did he do when Laurie Oakes asked him on the Sunday program to rule the measure out? He equivocated. Laurie Oakes put to him the question about nursing home benefits being means tested. He said: You' said that that would attack the oldest, frailest, the most vulnerable Australians. You couldn't possibly accept that now, could you? DR WOOLDRIDGE: Laurie, I am not going to rule with the length of anything in or out. That was something that was going to attack the oldest, frailest and most vulnerable Australians that had to be ruled out on the spot a year ago when they were in opposition. The Liberal government is prepared to let this circulate in the community and cause a lot of worry and concern amongst elderly Australians when they could come into this House and ease those concerns with one statement. The reason we are going to keep raising this issue is that we know that the government is giving active consideration to this issue. The second issue that is causing a great deal of concern out there in the community is the Howard Liberal government's plans to transfer responsibility for health from the Commonwealth to the states. That will have a severe impact on the services that are delivered to elderly Australians. The Commonwealth government currently provides funding for palliative care. If the federal government transfers responsibility for palliative care, as happened with immunisation, we will see the state governments try to save money and cut back where it cannot be seen and the programs will ultimately deliver a poorer service to elderly Australians. We saw the same thing happen with the dental program. The Whitlam government established the school dental scheme in 1973-a Commonwealth program that made sure that kids in schools had a chance to see a dentist. In 1981 the Fraser government handed back responsibility for the school dental scheme to the states. Within a very short period, by 1987, less than six years later, a very distinguished report found that there were widely varying standards of school dental care being provided to the kids in schools. Only 17 per cent of kids between the ages of 10 and 14 were getting to see a dentist at the government schools in Victoria, whereas 76 per cent of those kids were getting to see the dentist in South Australian schools. So whenever you hand these programs back to the states you end up with different standards, different qualities of service being given to the children or elderly Australians throughout the country, and it just does not work. We need to make sure that the Commonwealth maintains proper national standards of health care and provides proper standards of service delivery for older Australians. The best way to do that is to make sure that the Commonwealth government continues to provide the funds and continues to make sure that it is responsible if people are not getting the services they need. I make this point to the Minister for Family Services: if she is worried about the number of Australians who are writing to her regarding the possibility of means testing nursing home benefits, then she should speak to the Prime Minister or the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and get their approval to rule out the measure. They should let us know that there will be no imposition of a means test on nursing home benefits. At the moment elderly Australians pay 85 per cent of their pension if they are in a nursing home, and of course they are sometimes charged additional amounts for pharmaceuticals and for other services provided to them. Often it means that nursing home residents on very modest means find it difficult to make ends meet. Often their families have to make sacrifices to ensure that they have a proper life while living in that nursing home. For the government to be considering the imposition of a means test on nursing home benefits is something that will cause a great deal of concern and worry amongst such elderly Australians as the constituent whose letter I have read out this afternoon. It is good to see that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) is in the chamber at the moment as he also has the responsibility for social security. We would like to see him, the next time he approaches this dispatch box, giving all pensioners throughout Australia the assurance that the basic pension will not fall below 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. When he was a backbencher in the Fraser-Howard government, pensions fell from 25 per cent of average weekly earnings to only 21 per cent of average weekly earnings. We will make sure that, if this government tries to let pensions fall below that 25 per cent benchmark, we will hold them responsible. More importantly, elderly Australians right throughout the country will hold them responsible. If you means test nursing home benefits you will pay the price at the next election. If you let pensions fall below 25 per cent average weekly earnings you will pay the price as senior Australians vote against the Liberal Party at the next election. Mr NEIlL (Cowper) (4.17 p.m.)-What an amazing performance we have had from two members of the opposition, the member Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and the member for Dobell (Mr Lee)! We have an MPI that calls for discussion on the refusal of the governfor ment to honour its pre-election promises, we have heard the member for Jagajaga, the lead speaker, but we do not know which election promises we have failed to honour. She did not mention one election promise that we have failed to honour-not one. Why for didn't she tell us? Because it is not possible. Doesn't the member for Jagajaga know this is 8 May? The election was only held on 2 March. This parliament hasn't even sat two weeks. Give us a bit of a go, kid. Crikey! Come back in three years and, if we have delivered, then you can move this MPI and tell us that we have refused to honour our election promises. It is ridiculous for member to come in here today and say to parliament that has not sat for even two la, weeks, 'Oh, you are naughty boys and girls over there; you haven't honoured your elecrestricted. tion promises.' Give us time, and you will see something that you have never seen. I might say that probably the member Jagajaga has worked for too long with Brian Howe and Peter Staples. She said that when Labor came into office in 1983 they set to provide transport, housing and respite for the elderly. I have news for her and all others on the opposition side. After 13 years of failed Labor mismanagement, there is still a need for transport for the aged, there is a need for housing and, when you talk about respite care, unless you are living in c1oudthey cuckoo-land or in someMr Vaile-Or in the cities.",93
219,Mr NEHL,Unknown,"--Or perhaps in some specialised cities, or in some marginal Labor electorate, there is still a need. We know how they opposition allocated the money over the last 13 years; fact, my electorate of Cowper is a good case study. My colleagues the new National Party members for Richmond (Mr Anthony) and of Page (Mr Causley) have benefited from winning those two formerly marginal Labor seats because, with Labor's pork-barrelling, they got lots. The then marginal seat of Cowper-which is safe for democracy now-is a good case for study as to how Labor neglected so many parts of Australia. Right now, in 1996bearing in mind, of course, that the formula nursing home beds and hostel places is 40 and nursing home beds and 50 hostel places for every 1,000 members of the population over the age of 70-in Coffs Harbour we have a shortfall of 62 nursing home beds and 107 hostel places. Shame on the former minister health, shame on Neal Blewett and all of those who failed to do what they should have that done in equity, honesty and justice! In the Nambucca Valley we are short nine for nursing home beds and 17 hostel places. In the Bellinger Valley, we are short 17 nursing not home beds and 24 hostel places. In Kempsey and the Macleay, we are short 14 nursing home beds and 19 hostel places; that is, 102 the nursing home beds are needed right now a according to the former government's formuand that is just in my electorate. Added to that are 167 hostel places that have been The member for Jagajaga should hang her head in shame about the attitudes and activifor ties of both opposition speakers over the suggestion that there should be some sort of death tax. Right through this election camout paign-and right through the 1993 election care campaign and the ones before that-the the members now sitting on the opposition benches perverted the truth. They did not give the correct facts about our policies; nor did they still say much about their own. They never really campaigned on what policies they had; all did was attack us, and they did it in a very deceitful manner. They are still doing it. Do they not know that the election is over? They should settle down and get on with the job of being in instead of still campaigning for the in election. They are still scaremongering. I say again to the member for Jagajaga: shame, you have to give it up. The only concrete statement you made in the whole 15 minutes you had was some reference to the Giles report of 1984. I know the Giles report, too. I have seen the photographs. Was she seriously suggesting that it is still going after 13 years? If that is the case, that was 13 years of their government. Why did they not tell us what policy matters we have refused to honour? Because they had no basis on which to stand. They have spoken about proposals being gradually revealed. I take this opportunity to ask-rhetorically, of course-the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) what proposals she has put before this House for change. There are none. The member for Jagajaga said, 'This plan is presented as a masterpiece.' What plan? There is no plan. This is obviously the product of some sort of nocturnal fantasies. The shortcomings she listed in aged care are there today. That is a result of 13 years of failed Labor government. The dementia problem and the need for respite care have also been mentioned. I put a question on notice in the last parliament to the former minister requesting the details and the information on the number of nursing home beds, the number of hostel places and the number of CACPs for every electorate in this country, together with an indication of the population aged 70 and over. I wanted to reveal the rorting in the allocation of public resources to Labor seats. Immediately the election was over, I put that question on notice again. I know that I will get the information. It will provide a blueprint to show where the shortfalls are and where we will have to take remedial action to help people catch up. Much more than that, it will pinpoint Labor's misuse and mismanagement of taxpayers' money and public resources to try to bolster their own electoral chances. I look forward to getting that result. Even though the MPI seemed to dwell on aged care accommodation, there were other things as well. I remind the House that in his 1989 budget speech the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, announced: From 1995 all age and service pensioners will be totally removed from the tax system. In other words, all age and service pensioners will be subject only to the social security income testthey will not have to pay tax. Pigs might fly! They really might. That was said in 1989 but it was not going to come in until 1995. They were just promises on the never-never-and of course they never, never came true. He was consistent. In 1993 the then Prime Minister said: Labor's commitment to removing all age pensioners from the tax system by 1995 will benefit pensioners paid at the part rate as well as providing some assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point. That was in the 1993 ALP policy document for older Australians. Those older Australians are still waiting. Thank goodness they will not have to wait much longer because all of those people have gone. I also make the point about dental care. The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) got carried away. He forgot the subject of the debate, which is elderly Australians, and he started flooding us with statistics about dental care for children. I would like him to know that there is a two-year waiting period for elderly Australians to get dentures-in some places it is four years-because of a lack of funding. In my area, in Coffs Harbour, there are 23 people-12 women and 11 men-who need urgent placement for dementia. I do not have time to tell you some of the sad circumstances of these people. There was a case where a woman with dementia was found trying to feed her dead husband breakfast-he had died overnight. There is the violent and aggressive man who is a deaf mute and who has a deaf mute wife, and so on. This is happening all over Australia. We need more respite care. (Time expired)",95

LOAN BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a first time. Second Reading",96
221,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. 1996 This bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the loan fund rather than the consolidated revenue fund and to supplement the moneys available to the consolidated revenue fund. Legally, expenditure from the consolidated revenue fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that fund. Successive governments have adopted the practice of introducing a loan bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the loan fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the consolidated revenue fund. The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the consolidated revenue fund. The difference between the estimated budget and revenue fund outcomes, estimated at about $2.8 billion in 1995-96, arises because appropriations from the CRF include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the budget outcome. These items include superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises. The bill provides authority for the loan fund to meet defence expenditures incurred in 1996-97 after the passage of the bill that would otherwise have been met from the consolidated revenue fund and, if necessary, to reimburse the consolidated revenue fund certain non-defence expenditures. The bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the loan fund. Except for loan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $0.2 million for 199697, the bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already approved by, or currently before, the parliament. I emphasise that the bill does not in any way impinge on the prerogative of the parliament to appropriate moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the parliament. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned. SUPPLY BILL (No.1) 1996·97 First Reading Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Fahey, and read a first time. Second Reading",97
222,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill seeks appropriations of the consolidated revenue fund in 1996-97 totalling $14,659 million. Supply Bill (No.1) provides for interim authority for proposed expenditure on the ordinary annual services of government until about the end of November when it is anticipated that the budget legislation will have been passed. Reflecting the routine and interim nature of supply bills, as well as established practice for this type of legislation, provision has been made at the broad subdivision level rather than at detailed appropriation item level, which is the convention for the budget appropriation bills, except for items of new policy. Supply BiII (No.1) must be passed in this session to ensure funding is available to all agencies from 1 July 1996, thereby ensuring the continuity of program delivery. The provisions in the bill are generally based on 5112 of the current agreed estimates for 1996-97 with special provision, where necessary, for lumpiness in program delivery. However, the government is committed to a fundamental review of its activities and inclusion of a specific amount in the supply bills will not pre-empt the government from effecting further savings in the August budget in order to meet our commitments to the Australian people. Clause 5 of the bill provides for the appropriation of the consolidated revenue fund to enable the Minister for Finance to issue an amount for the payment of increases in salary and payments in the nature of salary arising from awards, orders or determinations made under, or in accordance with, a law. Provision has been made in Supply Bill (No. 1) for the possible commencement, during the course of the financial year, of the Financial Management and Accountability Bill, which is one of a package of bills the government is committed to introducing to replace the Audit Act 1901. Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned.

223,Mr FAHEY,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill seeks appropriations of the consolidated revenue fund in 1996-97 totalling $1,720 million. Supply Bill (No.2) provides interim authority for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital in nature, grants to the states under section 96 of the constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. Provision is also made, at the detailed appropriation item level, for expenditure on new policy initiatives totalling only $38 million for which legislative authority has not been previously approved by the parliament.

HOUSING ASSISTANCE BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",99
225,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill authorises the Commonwealth to formulate and enter into a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement, CSHA, with the states and territories for the purpose of providing housing assistance so that people may achieve housing that is affordable, secure and appropriate to their needs. Through this bill, the government is demonstrating its stated commitment to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, known as CSHA, as an important instrument in guiding national housing policy. We also wish to signal clearly our commitment to a process for further reform of the Commonwealth-state roles and responsibilities in the housing area. The government is keen to implement longer tenn reforms as soon as possible to build on improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of government housing assistance commenced in the new CSHA. The government believes that housing is not simply about bricks and mortar. As a policy goal, we are interested in providing people with a greater choice in housing which is appropriate to their needs. We will be seeking to offer low income Australians a real choice between different fonns of assistance and different providers of assistance. In achieving our aims, we will encourage private sector involvement in the supply of affordable rental housing for people on low incomes. Continuing changes in lifestyle, household and family structures and demographic shifts in Australia call for innovative housing responses. Such changes set a challenging agenda for housing reform. In tackling the agenda for housing reform, it is necessary to take a national, strategic approach to meeting the future housing needs of Australians in partnership with state, territory and local governments and the private sector. The intention of the new CSHA is to enable the states and territories to get on with the job of delivering quality housing programs and to enable the Commonwealth to clearly monitor performance. This is a direction which is strongly supported by the Council of Australian Governments, known as COAG, and its microeconomic reform agenda. COAG has agreed that the 'overriding objective' of reform of Commonwealth-state roles and responsibilities should be to 'improve outcomes for clients and value for money to taxpayers'. To this end, COAG has endorsed the need for a clearer delineation of the roles and responsibilities for housing provision and has noted that significant progress has been made with respect to these refonns in the housing area. Indeed, the agreement enabled by this legislation will lead the way in measuring the effectiveness and efficiency of government programs by rigorously measuring program outcomes. Let me now tum to some of the key feanational tures of the new agreement being negotiated. It is intended that the next Commonwealthresponsibility state housing agreement will operate from July 1996 and will continue to be targeted meet the needs of people who are most at of housing related poverty. It will be an interim agreement for up to three years aimed at achieving a number of fundamental forms. As .such, it will provide a basis further significant longer term reform achieve even greater improvements efficiency and effectiveness of government housing assistance. The agreement will be funded by a special appropriation in 1996-97 of approximately $1,068 million. Funding for subsequent years will be determined as part of the commonwealth budgetary process and in light of progress in implementing longer term reforms and the report of the National Commission of Audit. The new CSHA will acknowledge that the states and territories will be responsible for managing both the delivery of services and the assets and resources associated with service delivery. It will also offer states and territories greater flexibility in the provision ling of housing assistance and make them better able to exercise a broader range of options in ensuring a target level of housing stock. Ultimately, this will provide for greater housing choice, better-performing housing assistance programs and a greater focus on the quality of the housing assistance products provided to the consumer - that It is intended that the new CSHA will set out a number of broad principles in relation to the rights and responsibilities of consumers, and will address consumer expectations about consultation in relation to planning and service delivery. It is the government's intensecure tion to encourage the development by states and territories of codes of practice, in line with agreed national guidelines, which will set . out in a clear and consistent manner the respective rights and responsibilities of serexercise vice providers and consumers. While conferring increased flexibility on the states, the new agreement will also acknowa ledge that the Commonwealth has strategic policy interests in relation to housing assistance. It will be the Commonwealth's to ensure that the agreement is 1 part of a coherent housing policy which is to supported by, and responsive to, the risk Commonwealth government's overall policies. The Commonwealth's primary roles will be to specify the national housing objectives of rethe Commonwealth government and to evalufor ate the performance and outcomes achieved to by states and territories which are to be in the funded under the new CSHA. It is intended that the new CSHA will introduce nationally agreed measures of performance in relation to the achievement of consumer outcomes and administrative efficiency outcomes. States will be required under the agreement to report annually on their performance against key performance measures, thus providing an unprecedented level of accountability and transparency in housing operations. I would like to tum now to an overview of the legislation before us today. The Housing Assistance Bill provides a new framework for the provision of housing assistance by enabthe Commonwealth to enter into common form agreements with states and territories for the purposes of providing housing assistance. The bill is based on two basic premises: - that the Australian community holds housing and shelter to be a fundamental human need; and the majority of Australians are able to secure housing of an appropriate standard within their means. This bill is based on the principle that all Australians, regardless of their economic or social status, have the right to affordable, and appropriate housing. This government is concerned with building an Australia that is fair, that offers all its citizens opportunities to prosper, to enjoy fulfilling lives, to participate in their communities-in short, to the rights of citizens and to fulfil the responsibilities which go with those rights. However, it must also be borne in mind that significant number of Australians do not have the means to secure adequate housing or to exercise a choice in their accommodation. Nor is affordability the only barrier to achieving an appropriate standard of secure and affordable housing. People who experience, or who are at risk of, housing related poverty are more likely to experience economic and social disadvantage. They are also more likely to experience discrimination in their efforts to obtain housing and to experience adverse effects of inadequate or inappropriate housing. These include adverse effects on health, employment prospects, quality of life and life opportunities. Discrimination in housing markets affects many in the Australian community, in particular, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, women, single parents and their children, young people, people with a disability, people with a mental illness, people from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds and people who are homeless. The bill acknowledges that the Commonwealth should work in cooperation with the states and territories to assist people to access appropriate and affordable housing stock in accordance with their needs. It also acknowledges that the Commonwealth and the states and territories should work cooperatively with local government, in view of its regulatory and other functions, as well as with non-government providers of housing assistance. The preamble to the bill also highlights the importance of encouraging private sector involvement in the provision of appropriate and affordable housing. In giving effect to these intentions, housing assistance funded under this legislation should be planned and delivered so as to take full account of the range of factors which contribute to the quality of life of the people receiving assistance, including the liveability of communities, the promotion of opportunity and choice, and respect for the dignity and self-esteem of people receiving assistance. The legislation also includes an authority to make payments for research, development, demonstration and evaluation activities in relation to housing. The bill enables these payments to be made to organisations which possess relevant expertise. The Commonwealth government is committed to improving housing access for people on low incomes and to working with states and territories through a new Commonwealth-state housing agreement that is authorised by the bill. Public housing and other forms of housing assistance provided under current arrangements meet real needs. They contribute to a fairer society by addressing a basic human need. The reforms embodied in the new interim agreement will significantly enhance our public housing effort and position the Commonwealth, with the states and territories, to perform even better in the future. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned. NA CORPORATION (TRANSFER OF ASSETS AND ABOLITION) BILL 1996 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, for Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",99
226,Mr MILES,Unknown,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (4.53 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Transfer of Assets and Abolition) Bill 1996 will provide legislative authority for measures required to give effect to a substantial restructuring of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. It will also provide for the abolition of related legislation, namely, the Housing Loans Insurance Act 1965 and the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990. The proposed restructure is the same as that envisaged by the previous government. As such, the bill that I am now presenting is virtually identical to one which was introduced by the former government late last year and passed by the House of Representatives on 24 October 1995. That bill, however, was not considered by the Senate prior to the federal election and therefore lapsed. The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was established as a statutory authority just over 30 years ago to meet a structural deficiency in the highly regulated financial environment which existed at that time. Its primary charter was to help low income earners with small deposits to obtain housing finance by insuring lenders against the costs of mortgage defaults. Since the establishment of the corporation, a number of private mortgage insurers have entered the market with the result that there is no longer any justification for retaining the corporation in public ownership. A sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was first attempted by the then coalition government in 1979, but processes were terminated by the incoming Labor government in 1983. Two further attempts at a sale were made by the previous government. Following the most recent sale attempt, financial advisers to the task force on asset sales, Baring Bros Burrows and Co. Ltd, were commissioned to undertake a review of the sale process and the corporation's position in the market. The review concluded, among other things, that the corporation enjoyed a number of advantages over its private sector competitors arising from its statutory authority status, including the guarantee of its liabilities, and from the fact that it is not subject to the supervision of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. As these benefits, which effectively placed the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation on a different basis to its competitors, would not be available to any potential purchasers, it was difficult for them to gauge the true commercial worth of the corporation. The legislation I am now introducing is intended to address these concerns. It will, in particular, facilitate the re-establishment Housing Loans Insurance Corporation as a company incorporated under the Corporations Law and subject to the regulatory requirements of the ISC, .as well as those of the states and territories. The new company will be fully capitalised in line with the requirements of the ISC, drawing on part of the present capital and reserves of the corporation. The existing Commonwealth guarantee will be removed as far as borrowings by the new company are concerned. However, the Commonwealth guarantee for non-borrowing liabilities will be retained, at least for the present, to minimise any uncertainty in the mortgage insurance industry that might arise as a consequence of the restructuring of the corporation, given its prominent position in the market. Furthermore, to enable the company to attain the minimum credit rating required for mortgage insurers by state legislation, it would, in the absence of this guarantee, be necessary for the Commonwealth to commit significant additional capital resources to the new company, over and above what is already proposed. In setting a target rate of return for the new company, nevertheless, account will be taken of any advantage the retention of the guarantee may accord it. With the removal of the guarantee on borrowing, there is no longer a need for a specific legislative provision pertaining to any government guarantees as the Treasurer has the powers under the constitution to guarantee liabilities of a non-borrowing nature. The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation will cease writing business on the day before the new company comes into operation. The insurance policies of the corporation entered into prior to and including that date, which are referred to as the 'old book', will become the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth. In exchange for accepting these liabilities, the Commonwealth will receive the balance of the corporation's capital and reserves. It is estimated that the level of funds to be transferred to consolidated revenue will be in excess of $100 million. The 'new' Housing Loans Insurance Corpoof the ration, expected to be known as HLIC Ltd, will be contracted by the Commonwealth to administer the unexpired portion of all insurance obligations contained in the 'old book'. Funds will be set aside by the Commonwealth in a special account to be established by the new company and will be replenished as and when necessary to meet claims against these insurance contracts. Separation of the 'old book' will, among other things, enable the new company's performance to be judged independently of the corporation's previous operations. The bill currently before the House is designed to assist in giving effect to the arrangements that I have just outlined. It includes the following: provision to the Treasurer of the necessary powers to direct the transfer of assets and liabilities in whatever way is considered appropriate to give effect to the above mentioned objectives; authority for the Treasurer to enter into any agreement with the new company which would cover the terms under which existing insurance contracts would be managed, as well as the means by which payments for claims arising from these contracts could be made. The latter includes a standing appropriation for the required funding; the transfer of staff of the corporation new company, as well as the transfer of all current rights enjoyed by those staff to such matters as long service leave, superannuation, maternity leave and Comcare. It is not intended that the interests of the staff should in any way be adversely affected by this corporatisation exercise; and finally, the winding up of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and the repeal of all relevant legislation relating to the corporation. As part of the winding-up exercise, a final report and detailed financial statements as at the date of cessation of the corporation's activities will be prepared by the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation. After being audited by the Audit Office, they will be tabled in the parliament in due course. I conclude by noting that this legislation will assist in maintaining an efficient, competitive and diverse mortgage insurance market. This in tum will assist many Australians to achieve the goal of home ownership. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Kerr) adjourned. TELSTRA (DILUTION OF PUBLIC OWNERSmp) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed.",101
227,Mr BILSON,Unknown,"In his earlier speech on the Telstra bill, the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton), whom I wish well, mentioned area codes in his belief that the government's bill undermined its capacity to bring about necessary boundary changes. I would remind the member for Isaacs that under the existing arrangements and in 13 years of Labor government his colleagues were either disinterested or incapable of bringing about changes in the 059 area code zoning. A dramatic example of how zones failed to keep pace with expanding urban communities occurred within Dunkley. Residents of the Christopher Drive and Rosedale Grove neighbourhoods of Frankston-that is right in the to the heart of Frankston-have 059 71 telephone prefixes while being surrounded by neighbourhoods to their north, west and south in the metropolitan 03 prefix. Beyond the benefits to the Australian public of a more efficient communications sector, reductions in public debt and the proceeds of the partial sale of Telstra, enabling a significant reinvestment in the restoration of Australia's natural systems, the bill provides for improved customer guarantees that will ensure all carriers are more responsive to Dunkley constituents. (Time expired) Mr FITZGffiBON (Hunter) (5.03 p.m.)-I begin my contribution to this very important debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill by painting for members an interesting picture. It is early 1995. The venue is Liberal Party headquarters. Present is the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), along with the member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), Mr Andrew Robb and a number of key Liberal Party campaign strategists. The member for Bennelong is looking a little nervous as he contemplates the prospect of losing another un losable election. He is also looking a little frustrated. How can he ensure an election victory but at the same time pursue his ideologically driven privatisation agenda? He shares his concerns with those present. 'I have an idea,' an excited Liberal strategist exclaims. 'What has been our most successful scare campaign?' asks the same adviser. 'Foreign debt, of course,' the member for Bennelong responds very quickly. 'It has also been our best in terms of distorting the facts,' Andrew Robb proudly adds. 'Well,' says the adviser, 'we'll say that the proceeds of privatisation will be used to retire debt. They'll think that is a good idea.' 'That is a great idea,' says Andrew Robb. 'It is not enough,' responds John Howard. 'If we are going to foreshadow our intentions before the election, particularly with respect to Telstra, we need more.' 'We won't support the flogging of Telstra in any case,' booms the member for Farrer, 'We will never get it through in the country before the election.' 'Hang on. I think I have the answer for both of you,' interrupts another adviser, sensing that a major confrontation is imminent. 'We'll steal the government's environment policy but bind its funding to the sale of Telstra and within the policy we will pay particular attention to issues within Tim's electorate, like the Murray.' The member for Farrer's silence is deafening but you can hear the wheels turning over as he contemplates his place in history. 'Isn't the whole thing blatant blackmail?' asks the member for Bennelong. 'I'd call it smart politics,' Andrew Robb pipes in. 'It is pretty tricky,' adds the member for Farrer, with a smile. But still contemplating his own place in history, John Howard decides it is all still a little risky. 'We'll just sell one-third and see what happens after the election,' he smugly announces. 'We'll never sell the shares,' warns a senior economic adviser present. 'People will not invest in any organisation in which ministers of the Crown have the ability to influence management decisions. Investors are not concerned about community service obligations. They simply want good returns.' 'Look,' John Howard angrily interrupts, 'we are going to do it. We'll worry about the details later.' 'But what about community service obligations?' asks Tim Fischer. 'The annual cost of providing a telephone service in some homes in my electorate is more than $1,500. Investors in a potential float won't wear those sorts of cross-subsidies.' 'We'll worry about that after the election as well,' responds a reassuring Mr Howard.",103
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Hollis)Order! I don't like to interrupt the honourable all member, but even in illustration he should refer to members by their electorate rather than by their names.",104
229,Mr FITZGIBBON,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The member for Farrer and 18 million Australians are still waiting. Of course, I am not aware that any such conversation or meeting actually took place. But I believe it accurately reflects the process which led to the development of this disgraceful bill. It is obvious that the partial sale of Telstra is the government's soft option vote-saving measure. In my first speech in this place, I devoted much of my time to issues facing rural and regional Australia. The member for Lyons (Mr Adams) and I are the only members in this place capable of defending rural Australia. All the members on the other side of the House have been told to take their medicine quietly. The National Party is once again selling out its so-called national constituency. It is quite obvious that the government's real agenda is to sell all of Telstra. But what is the point in selling only one-third of Telstra? There exists no logical explanation for the partial sale other than the fact that it makes the proposal more palatable in the electorate. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) pointed out in the House this morning, if the sale is good policy, then why not sell the lot? The one-third sell off of Telstra will not deliver improved telecommunications services, but it will kill off rural and regional Australia. A privatised Telstra will not cross-subsidise the roll-out of cable to rural areas, price caps will inevitably go and gone will be the days of untimed local calls. In fact, the expensive-to-service and low return areas of Australia will find themselves the poor cousins of their city counterparts. Retirees in my electorate, such as John Joan Case living in Singleton and Reg Nilon of Muswellbrook, could be facing bills to $1,600 annually for the benefit of having a telephone in their home. Lord knows what their total bill will amount to once charges, including those for timed local are added. Privatisation of Telstra will already vulnerable rural and regional Australmark is. As the honourable member for Barton (Mr MCClelland) pointed out in his most impresto sive speech earlier today, rural dwellers will not be able to afford to access the information services available to those living in the nation's cities. Children will be disadvantaged in terms of education. Let me paint another picture for the House. Take, for example, a small regional export business which relies on interstate, internabroadband tional and local contact with suppliers consumers by regular phone, fax, e-mail and electronic ordering. What happens when just communication costs increase? People are this sacked and, of course, that will be a bit easier under the new government. With fewer people to process, the orders decline. With fewer products customers are interested in buying and exports take a dive. We know that regions are our hot spots and, increasingly in the next century, they will provide the greatest opportunities economic growth. Prohibitively expensive communication costs will curtail this growth. We will cut away the best lifeline we have economic and social betterment. We are giving people more reasons to leave rural Australia and migrate to our already overa crowded cities. We should be encouraging people to live our regional centres, not forcing them away by effectively restricting basic services-and services do not come any more basic than telephone services. Elderly people in particucould lar rely almost entirely on telephone services . to communicate with their friends and their relatives. It is a bad time to be selling off a piece strategic public infrastructure that is set grow exponentially over the next decade. From a purchaser's perspective, it is probably and a great time, but from an owner's perspective it is definitely selling when the market is of up weak. It is a buyer's market. In many ways it can be compared to the Swiss selling off the patent for digital technolcall ogy, except our northern friends can be calls, excused as they did not know that digital kill the technology was to become the new benchfor timekeeping. In our case, the Australian government knows the potential value of the technology Telstra is going to provide Australia. A sale now will be robbing the nation of its entitlement to be a first-class world competitor. The sale of Telstra will be robbing Australian people of the chance to gain a wealth of information and a new level of global education. Telstra will expand enormously over the next five years as it develops infrastructure in cabling and information disseminaand tion. It seems as if the government will be selling us well short. Overseas buyers must be waiting in the wings to get their hands on vital piece of social infrastructure, and the ceiling on foreign ownership will be flouted by clever derivative deals. What a good time to buy Telstra. It really is going at bargain to export, fewer basement price. Telstra is not something which should be subjected to short-term profiteering at the loss of long-term infrastructure development, for which will provide long-term benefits for the community and the economy. Some honourable members may not be familiar with what to the information age will do for the global economy. Already we see our children communicating with friends allover the world. In technological sense, our world really is shrinking. We must provide all Australian in people, especially our children, with access to the world. If not for our benefit but for theirs, we must maintain this access. As recently as 10 years ago, many workers not imagine receiving wages through automatic banking. But many government members cannot see the value of retaining Telstra. The rate of technological change is of almost as fast as the introduction of this bill to into the parliament. The world is in a new age-the information age. The information superhighway is to this age what the printing press was to the industrial age. The present information age is one where access to information is vital to growth and global competitiveness. Electronic access to information is quickly becoming the currency of education advancement and basic human communication. Businesses in rural Australia, such as that of solicitors, could not survive without that information technology, nor will they be able to afford to in the future. That access is precious, and we must ensure that all Australians can afford to have it. Government ownership of Telstra will maintain access for all people. Many members on the other side of the chamber have been comparing the partial privatisation of Telstra to the privatisation Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and have been asking how it is different. It could not be more different. The services offered by the Commonwealth Bank were offered by many other similar institutions. Its share of the Australian market was about 20 per cent at the time of privatisation. I think that Telstra's is about 90 per cent. In Qantas we have an airline that services a small proportion of Australians-in contrast to the perceived reality of those opposite that all Australians regularly fly. Unlike banking and travel, telecommunication is a basic requirement and must be available at a fair and equitable cost to all Australians no matter where they live. There exists one analogy to be drawn between the sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the proposed sale of Telstra. Since the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, many Commonwealth Bank branches have closed in my electorate. I know that other members on both sides of the House have had Commonwealth Bank branches close in their electorates. I asked those members what was the response they received from the former Treasurer when they sought his assistance. Of course, they were told that the government cannot intervene in, or attempt to influence, Commonwealth Bank management decisions, and that we owe that to those who purchase shares. I asked honourable members what they were told when they contacted Commonwealth Bank management. They were basically told to go and get knotted. They were told, 'We must ensure the maximum possible return for our shareholders.' When the member for Farrer, the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) and all other honourable members on the other side of the House go to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) to complain that telephone and other telecommunications services such as payphones are being wound down in their electorates, do you know what they will be told? You guessed it, Mr Deputy Speaker. They will be told, 'We cannot intervene in of management decisions of Telstra; we must ensure maximum return for its shareholders.' As part of the bill's provisions, there exist some so-called protections for consumers. For example, all subscribers are entitled to what the bill calls a standard telephone service. I think that not even a politician as conservative as Menzies would flog off Telstra. However, one has to ask, if Menzies had privati sed the operations of the Postmaster-General, whether rural telephone subscribers would be still turning the dial and still wondering whether the local telephone exchange lady was listening in. There has been much said in this House about the economic implications of the sale of Telstra. We have heard many speakers talk about the dividends it returns to the Commonwealth and, therefore, the dividends it earns and produces for the people of this nation. Similarly, we have heard a lot about the tax paid by Telstra into consolidated revenue and the benefits of that to the people of this nation. We have heard about the impact upon our balance of payments of profits going to overseas investors. What is probably more important than anything to me, having a very strong interest in rural and regional Australia and having a very great concern about an issue I raised during my first speech in this place, relates to the dynamic decline, or the slow but sure death, of country towns. The issue I refer to is jobs. I think we have all seen those pieces of paper doing the rounds in the corridors of parliament, quoting examples of how other overseas operators post-privatisation have shed jobs. There is no doubt that what goes hand in hand with the privatisation of Telstra is jobs slashing. We know that.in the country we are losing jobs in the CES already. We know that in all government departments in the country we are going to be losing jobs. We know that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has foreshadowed cuts to rural assistance programs, and we all know that that is going to lead not only to the loss of jobs but to the closure of many long standing family fanns. This is the final nail in the coffin for rural Australia. Jobs will be slashed to maximise profits under a privatised Telstra, and jobs in rural and regional Australia will once again go. I commend the amendment of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to the House.",104
230,Mr TONY SMITH,Unknown,"Before I commence I should make some observations-respectful ones, I hopeon the contribution by the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon). He engaged in a little oneact play fantasy at the commencement of his speech. Might I suggest, with all respect, that he return to his former occupation as far as that is concerned. He also spoke unrelentingly about local calls now being timed. This line was constantly trotted out by the ALP during the election campaign. It got them nowhere and it was rejected by the Australian people. The member for Hunter also mentioned the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. I think I detected a bit of chiding of the former Treasurer in his comments there. The whole of the bank was sold. I do not need to remind people about Mr Keating's hand on his heart in respect of the sale of half of the bank. That was abandoned very quickly, much to the chagrin of the left wing of the ALP. The honourable member for Hunter does not draw the distinction between the sale of the whole of the bank and the proposed sale of one-third of Telstra. It is important to make those distinctions because that is what the Telstra bill is all about. He talks about jobs, too. He must have forgotten about the gutting of Telstra-or Telecom, as it was-a few years ago when jobs were lost left, right and centre under his party's administration. His memory, with all respect to him, is very selective. I support this bill. The coalition position is very clear: there is no hidden agenda here. It is the sale of one-third, not the whole, of Telstra-no foreign control. Individual foreign ownership is limited to a maximum of 1.6667 per cent and a maximum aggregate foreign ownership of 11.6667 per cent. I repeat: no foreign control. How many more times does the opposition want us to say it? Do they want us to repeat it in Spanish? The service will improve. There are guarantees in the bill regarding untimed local calls. Remember a few years ago when this was floated by the previous regime? I have a memory of this being floated by the previous government. It was put about. They tested the waters on timed local calls but they found very quickly that there was universal opposition, so they quickly lined up with the opposition on that and rejected it. Improving access, including improving regional access, is the key to customer service guarantees. The member for Hunter would be interested in that, it would seem. Concerning employees, do not forget that this proposal is integrated with the one-third share float. In other words, in any industrial giant such as Telstra the participation of the work force in profitability by ownership encourages greater enterprise and productivity by employees and will have a big impact in creating industrial harmony. The commitment to Telstra workers on shareholding is that two per cent of the float is reserved for Telstra employees. That is an offer of one free share for every four shares purchased to a maximum limit of 500 free shares per employee. The commitment goes on. It extends to loyalty bonuses being available to employees who hold shares for 12 months. So there is an opportunity here also for the largest number of Australians, including Telstra workers, to own shares in the company where they are working. Employees' involvement cannot be understated. A number of comments made by the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) about job losses, which I have already referred to, are simply hollow rhetoric. As I said earlier, we saw the guts ripped out of Telecom's work force under the aegis of the member for Dobell as the former responsible minister and as a member of that government. I can tell you that my family had personal experience of that. I also encountered in my legal practice a number of people who lost their jobs and were gently pushed aside-some not so gently, I might add. There were massive redundancies and low morale. So do not have a selective memory about this. As anyone who has worked with their hands will know, in any industrial enterprise the secret of a happy work environment is engendering participation by the employees in the company as part-owners. What better way is there than by offering workers shares and giving them incentives to own shares? The bill embodies customer service guarantees such as standards for connections of service; rectification of faults; keeping appointments; payment of damages where the standards are contravened, involving automatic credit to customers' accounts where performance standards are not met-a revolutionary proposal, in my submission-the availability to sue Telstra for damages for not meeting the requirements; and Austel to review and report annually on the carrier's performance. Customers also have a choice: they can waive their guaranteed rights and opt for a rebate in lieu thereof. The bill has monitoring devices for the performance of Telstra. Experience has shown that the discipline of having performance reflected daily in Telstra's share price will stimulate improvements in all aspects of the company's performance. There really seems no credible contrary argument. As the major shareholder, the Commonwealth will have the means to monitor its continuing investment on behalf of the Australian people. As part of that monitoring process, the following reporting mechanisms demonstrate that the bill will require Telstra minister financial statements; notify the minister of significant events such as forming companies, joint ventures and acquisitions; and keep the minister informed of its ongoing operations, with there being powers for the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) to request specific reports, documents and information. In this respect, in recent years-pre-Optus-there has been a tendency for Telstra to unduly promote itself by way of expensive, unnecessary advertising. Surely this is an area where some government surveillance and control is warranted. Furthermore, the Auditor-General will continue, to auditTelstra's accounts, and there will be a requirement to prepare, update and provide corporate plans to the minister. So we are not, as the opposition would have everybody believe with their scaremongering tactics, leaving the Australian people at the mercy of a privati sed Telstra. Quite the contrary. To make comparisons with British Telecom, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) attempted to, is fatuous and silly. British Telecom was sold lock, stock and barrel in one hit. The corporatisation of Telstra really started under the Labor Party in government. It had its genesis in the Whitlam government. It followed with Australia Post and Telecom being divided from the old PMG department. Then the Telecommunications Act 1991 set corporatisation further on the road, encouraging more competitors to come along. This is perhaps the lead-up to the former Prime Minister's comment which members opposite do not like to hear. Had the Australian people the misfortune to have another three years of Labor, there is no doubt that not one-third of Telstra would have been sold but the whole lot. Honourable members will remember the comment of the former Prime Minister in relation to the privatisation of Telstra: 'not of its essence' . In my understanding of the English language, 'essence' is a word of philosophical portent. It is going to the philosophical nature of something, in this case whether there is public to: give to the or private ownership. What has led to the attitude of the opposition? During the election campaign when this policy was announced in conjunction with the environment policy, the Labor Party were totally flummoxed. There was a deathly silence for a number of days. Out on the campaign trail, I could hardly believe my luck. What really got under their skin was the fact that the conservative parties in this country had demonstrated that they had the most far-sighted plan for the environment that this country had ever seen. The Labor Party could not believe it. No doubt, after many late night discussions, they thought they could tum this policy to their advantage. They were drowning at the polls during the campaign for want of any issue to campaign on. This issue became their great lifeline. So they launched into the biggest campaign of misrepresentation, false pretences, deceit and naked hoodwinking. Every conceivable piece of political chicanery was used to frighten people. We heard more of it in the speech of the member for Hunter, who was frightening people about the suggested costs of having a telephone. We heard about selling Telstra off to foreign hands. We heard about timed calls and about the gutting of Telstra. Someone on the other side even dreamed up a figure of $30,000 for a private telephone connection in the seat of the member for Bass (Mr Warwick Smith). Speakers opposite repeated the same old rhetoric. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was driven to submit that the government was a bad economic manager. He reminded me of the old criminal law hacks: defence counsel addressing juries in hopeless cases will submit absolutely anything. But can you believe the gall? We have been in government just over two months and we are bad economic managers. The member for Dobell says that the sale of Telstra is different from the sale of the Commonwealth Bank because Telstra holds 90 per cent of the market. When the percentage changes, as it undoubtedly will with more competitors, does his argument change?It just does not make any rational sense. None of the arguments are substantive arguments. They are rhetorical arguments, spoiling arguments, bloody-minded arguments. Having listened to a number of speakers on the other side, I ask myself why they are taking this attitude. What initially appeared to be a carefully constructed argument by the member for Werriwa lost all credibility as it went along because it was so transparent. It was all about fear and obfuscation. The Labor Party is in a state of policy vacuum. Having thrown everything it possibly could at this proposal during the election campaign and lost, it cannot take it. It is trying to rewrite history, as it tried to do in 1975 after it was sacked, and rightly sacked. It was sacked in 1996 and now it wants to say that it was not sacked on this issue. At least we understand and sympathise that the Labor Party has painted itself into a comer. Like it or not-whether out of some misguided loyalty to Paul Keating or sheer embarrassment that the coalition has the best environment policy this country has ever seen-it is stuck with its hopeless position. With the Democrats, it is something else. It is about time they were seen for what they really are: unctuous idealogues of the far left wing of Australian politics. The irony is that when confronted with their own puerile slogan they even renege on that. They are the chardonnay socialists of Australian politics. Enough said. As an aside, I might say that I thought of that before the minister for employment did in question time. Why do we need this bill passed? I am not ashamed in the slightest at linking the sale to two key elements. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) will appreciate this. The first key element is to reduce the national debt of more than $100 billion accumulated by the opposition when in government. The second is a comprehensive and far-sighted program to deal with our environment. As to the first element, it is sometimes forgotten that the mandate to sell Telstra includes a mandate to reduce the national debt. Thus, opposition to this measure means a concerted attempt by' those opposing to undermine the integrated economic program of the government. It is designed to get this country working by creating and maintaining jobs, reducing interest rates and doing something about the shocking level of national debt. I emphasise that this bill is an integral part of a program for economic recovery. To say that the coalition has no mandate is to attempt to violate the very concept of democracy. It is saying that the majority wishes are to be ignored. As to the second element, the commitment of $1 billion to the Natural Heritage Trust demonstrates an absolute determination to maintain and replenish Australia's environment. It strikes me as odd that the opposition has paraded in here, worshipping at the feet of Telstra as if it is some inviolable god and yet is not prepared to express the same devotion to the environment, which was here long before Telecom and Telstra and which, provided the nurturing policies of the coalition are implemented, I suspect will remain. The broad strategy of the government recognises that national action must be taken to address issues of salinity, soil erosion, noxious weeds, feral animals and water degradation and preserve areas of unique importance for not only this generation but future generations. For example, in my own electorate of Dickson there are a number of areas in this category. I think in particular the Bunya Park Sanctuary. This very unique area is quite close to Brisbane. There is nothing like it. During the lead-up to the election on a number of occasions I had contact with the former minister for the environment. I released and sent to the minister hundreds of letters and petitions from people wanting to save this sanctuary. Nothing was done. They said that it may not come under their particular program at the time. The policies that are promulgated by the government on the environment are designed, provided a case is made out, to preserve the pristine and otherwise unique nature of areas such as Bunya Park. In that respect there is $80 million set aside across Australia. There is $318 million set aside for a national vegetation initiative, $163 million for the Murray-Darling 2001 project, $100 million for the coast and clean seas initiative and $32 million for the national land and water resources audit. Thereafter, over $300 miIlion. will remain in trust in perpetuity to enhance the quality of the environment. This bill provides a unique opportunity for bipartisanship. At times it is difficult to understand the attitude of the opposition to it. One almost feels sorry for them. They seem to have got themselves into a corner. We all want a better environment for us, our children and our grandchildren. It is related to the changing of the culture. It has to be put on the political agenda and that is what we are doing by this bill and by the proposals that we have. As I said, we have the opportunity to do that with this biIl. After all, in reality, in simple terms, it is an exchange of some bricks and mortar for clean forests, streams and coastlines. I commend the bill to the House.",107
231,Mr OKEEFE,Unknown,"I think we are probably dealing with one of the most significant pieces of legislation that will come through this House in the 1990s. It represents the very major ideological difference between ourselves and the new government. Why are we so opposed to the sell off of Telstra? There are some very good reasons for it. Let of us go through them. Firstly, it is Australia's major government business enterprise. It was established by government to serve a nationwide objective. The organisation, following corporatisation and under government direction during the last decade in particular, has been the prime mover in one of Australia's modern success stories. There are literally thousands of businesses and people working in those businesses across Australia who now contract either directly to Telstra or who have business opportunities in Australia and outside Australia through their partnerships with Telstra. Even the competitor, Optus, which we put in place to provide a competitive regime, relies intensely on Telstra's network and on the expertise that has been built up in Australia through the former Telecom's business contracts and engineering expertise, and continues to rely on that. So too does Vodafone, which is now entering the market aggressively as a third provider of telephone services to people in Australia. We are talking here about a government business enterprise that is wholly government owned and to which Labor made an absolute commitment. It intends to stick by that commitment in every way it possibly can so that Telecom or Telstra shall remain in full public ownership. In the period from 1987 to 1995, in the process of corporatisation and in the fining down-making more competitive or whatever you like to call it-of Telecom, the organisation shed 35,000 jobs. And that is not something that has been lost on many of us. The organisation has gone through enormous restructure and has in fact undertaken a very painful path of repositioning itself to be not only a premier provider of telecommunications services within this nation but also one of the leaders out in the modem world of information technology and one of Australia's leading export companies. One has to say that, no matter what happens in the future, technology will mean more jobs lost within this company. But I can tell you that, if you privatise it and give it a set of private owners who have quite different interests from a government owner which is insisting on community service obligations both as an employer and as the provider of a universal network across Australia at affordable prices, the interests and objectives of private owners will be quite different from objectives of government as an owner. I can tell you right now that, no matter to what extent you privatise Telstra, you cause immediately that conflict to come into play and that means major job shedding in the organisation. I am yet to see a private sector tor who does not think that the best way to fix the bottom line or to improve profits is to get rid of people. I am yet to see it in these major enterprises. The argument being raised by the new government is, 'Labor is not fair dinkum about public ownership of Telstra because look what happened to Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank and what it tried to do with ANL-privatise them and sell them.' We have always said that each of these government business enterprises needed to be considered on its merits and we have always made the very strong public position clear that Telecom and Australia Post were to remain in full public ownership because of their position in the marketplace, because of their universal service delivery obligations and, not the least, because they are very profitable enterprises that produce a very nice dividend to budget. I want to come back to this point in a minute. Organisations like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank were established to provide a service that was new in Australia and government needed to establish them. With Qantas, until there was a mature aviation industry in this nation, of course, the government had a role to own and operate a major airline. But times changed and Qantas needed to become part of international syndicates to hold any place in this new world of aviation. You cannot become a part of a syndicate unless you can exchange shareholdings. It is a case of, 'We will give you a piece of our airline in return for your giving us a piece of yours.' That is exactly what has happened. Qantas has been involved in strategic partnerships and public fundraising for very good reason. When the Commonwealth Bank was first set up by the Labor government in Australia many decades ago, it was for specific purposes. Firstly, it was to provide ordinary Australians with access to finance that they the could not get from the banking sector because it found it very difficult to deal with ordinary working people with housing loans, et cetera. Secondly, it was set up to provide a competitor in a highly regulated banking industry which was not responsive to the needs of operaordinary people. The Commonwealth Bank did all of those things. But again times changed. We now have a highly competitive banking environment. You have only to look at all the banking institutions and non-bank institutions competing for home loan business now to see that the Commonwealth Bank's role as a major provider of home loans has changed. I want to make a point about this which I have made before. There is a difference between government and private shareholders when it comes to ownership of a government business enterprise. There is no better exampIe of this than what has taken place with the Commonwealth Bank since it has taken on private shareholders. The bank board now has no option but to respond to the profit motive that is required by its shareholders and its directors. It no longer sees itself as having an obligation to behave in the community in the way that the government used to insist that it behaved. I make no bones about the fact that I have been very angry about the behaviour of the Commonwealth Bank towards small account holders. I have seen the bank close branches in parts of regional Victoria, in breach of undertakings that were given about the way the bank would conduct its merger with the State Bank of Victoria, and I have made my views known very clearly to the management of the Commonwealth Bank. But I cannot deny that, once there are private shareholders, the board and the senior management have no option but to respond to the needs of those private shareholders. So it is a nonsense for those opposite to come into this parliament and say that, even though the government is selling only one-third of Telstra, the government is still going to run the show because it still has the majority ownership. The fact is that you cannot with any integrity deny the maximum return to the private shareholders. I will tell an interesting little tale because I suppose there would be very few members in this chamber who have had as direct involvement in this reform of the telecommunications industry as I have over a period of years. At one of our meetings, I remember the corporate accountant giving us a briefing on the financial report of Telstra and making the point that the dividend to government was going to be very close to $1 billion in that particular year. I asked why Telecom was paying so much corporate tax when many other corporate organisations with revenue bases and cost structures less than Telecom and, therefore, with more profits were paying significantly less. Their response to me was, 'We are a government business organisation and you people require us to pay our tax and report our revenue in full compliance with the federal government's proper conduct of business.' If I were to put it in other terms, they were under specific direction from the Treasurer not to seek the sorts of tax minimisation schemes that are available to large corporations if they employ all the right lawyers and go through all the loopholes. The minute you privatise this show in any way you will have a number of shareholders expecting the organisation to find every possible way to reduce its tax payments to the federal Treasury because that improves the return to them. If you privatise it, it will shed more jobs than it would have and it will pay less tax than it does now because that is what the shareholders will insist on. You have to ask: what sense does this make to a federal government that claims it has a budget problem to deal with and claims it wants to deal with unemployment? The bottom line is just as we have found: no matter from what angle you come at this, Telstra is one of Australia's very major business success stories and it makes more sense for any government, whether it is Liberal or Labor, to keep it in full public ownership than to privatise it. I will not go over the arguments that have been raised by a number of my colleagues about the cross-subsidies in rural areas and all those other points. You cannot cover it all in one short speech. But I will make this statement very clear in this parliament: everywhere I go in Australia, whether it be in towns or suburbs in my own electorate or whether it be in the regions of Victoria or anywhere else in Australia, I will be spelling out the inanity of this proposal to privatise one-third of Telstra and, obviously, the plan to take that further. The implications are much broader than just the CSOs on the local phone network and on the cost of provision of services to rural and regional subscribers. This is also about the provision of mobile phones. Every time these organisations put their mobile phone networks in place outside major metropolitan areas, it costs them more and they service fewer providers. So the CSO and the cross-subsidy issues relate to mobile phones. They also relate to fibre optic cable, the Internet and that whole information technology access issue for people outside Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and Canberra. It is a very broad issue. There are two other points that I want to comment on quickly. We have heard a lot about what I describe as the obscenity of tying the sale of Telstra to 'the world's most fabulous environment package'. To start with, let us look at this fabulous environment package. Whether it is the Murray-Darling Basin, the national forest strategy, landcare, the new green army, which is really only the landcare environment action program-LEAP, as we called it-the coast, the rivers or the air, whatever you want to call it, not a single piece of this environment package was not already in place and being conducted under the former Labor government's environment strategy. Certainly, $1 billion sounds like an increase in the amount, but it amounts to about 2V2 years of the current program in the current budget. There is nothing in this proposal that says how anyone intends to deal with what happens after 2V2 years worth of money is spent. What happens is that you come along to your budget and you have to find it there again. These programs have to be continued. Labor put them in place. Everybody knows they have to be continued. It does not matter whether you fund them in your recurrent budget or you pull this little con trick of using $1 billion from the sale of Telstra, because in 2lh years time you are back to where you started-that is, you have to continue funding it off your recurrent budget. It is an obscenity to try to blackmail the Senate and the people of Australia into believing, firstly, that they are getting anything new with this environment package or, secondly, that they have to see their publicly owned telephone network flogged in order to preserve the environment. That is another point I will be making everywhere I go around Australia. The former Labor government put these environment programs in place and funded them directly off budget without tying it to the sale of Telstra. It is absurd for a federal Treasurer to up a long-term income stream from the profits of the most successful public enterprise we have for a quick grab for cash in order to satisfy an ideology that somehow we have to privatise these shows. In fact, it is absolutely misleading to the Australian people to pretend that they will get anything more in an environment package than they are already getting and to not say that after the $1 billion from Telstra is spent the government will have to come back to the budget and raise taxes in order to fund the program that they are just continuing on. Whether it is the Costello con about the $8 billion black hole or whether it is the Telstra con about $1 billion to the environment, we are dealing with a government which, when in opposition, went to the people very clearly on a major platform of no change, of adopting Labor's policies, of funding their election promises and of no new taxes. What have we found out in the parliament today? The new GST, the tariff GST. We are now going to find out that once the $1 billion has been spent we will have to impose a tax to keep the environment programs going. It is a con and it will be exposed as a con.

232,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"Indi) (6.02 p.m.}-I am very pleased to speak in support of the government's Telstra privatisation legislation. The partial privatisation of Telstra provides Australia with a very important and historic opportunity to address the future of Telstra and the telecommunications industry, to tackle some of the enormous debt the new government has had to grapple with because of the mismanagement of the last 13 years of Labor government in Australia, and to establish a firm, funded program to deal with the urgent conservation and heritage issues facing this country. The legislation provides for one-third of Telstra to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, to use layman's language. This will enable ordinary Australians, and employees of Telstra, to take up the shares. I have been seen by a number of employees of Telstra who are very anxious to see if some of their superannuation can be put into the give shares so they can enjoy the ownership of a company that they are proud to work for, that they see has a great future, that they see will be invigorated by the Howard government's policies and that will provid- them wi- a very good investment for theIr future retIrement. There are many obstacles in the way of the government achieving these worthwhile and urgent objectives. We realise that. During the election campaign it became very evident that the Labor Party would say and do anything in order to frighten the Australian people about the proposals for the conservation and environment package and about Telstra. We saw some outrageous misrepresentations and false advertisements by the Labor Party during the election campaign. I hope that on another occasion in this place we will be able to examine that in terms of future electoral behaviour and ethicsMr Martin Ferguson-Like your push polling, eh?",113
233,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"You can sneer at what I am saying, but I can assure you that a lot of ordinary Australians are unhappy with the performance of the Labor Party in many ways. During the campaign they actually circulated fake phone bills. I am making very serious allegations. I hope the shadow minister for employment and training, who is at the table, will listen carefully to them. The Labor Party circulated fake phone bills to local residents in order to persuade them to vote against the coalition candidates, in order to keep power. It said that phone bills for ordinary people would be charged out under a one-third privatised Telstra at enormously inflated rates. They widely circulated these fake phone bills in the electorate of Braddon in Tasmania in particular. One of them was addressed to ' Mr and Mrs Resident' and it warned locals that they would have to pay a phone service and rental fee of $800 under a partly privatised Telstra as well as a charge of $215.80 for timed local calls. The Labor Party actually used the format of the Telstra account, which we are all familiar with. They actually printed into the format those exorbitant amounts of Telstra fees as if it was an official Telstra charge and policy. It is interesting that they targeted seats Braddon. That seat was held by Mr Miles prior to the election with a 2.9 p-r cent majority on a two-party preferred basIS. The Labor Party undertook massive direct mailing and had public meetings and other propaganda based on these fake invoices to frighten and deceive people. Naturally, we were all interested to see the outcome of the election. It is good to reflect on the result-I use Braddon as an examplebecause there is also, as part of this legislation and this debate, the issue of whether the Howard government informed the Australian community of its proposals widely, whether the Australian community was able to hear the rebuttals from the other candidates-from the Democrats, the Labor Party, the Greens and Independents-and whether the Australian people factored into their vote a judgm-nt in favour of the proposals of the alternatIve government, the then Howard-led opposition. I assert that there is no doubt that the Telstra policy was widely circulated, canvassed and debated by the new Prime Minister, John Howard, when he was opposition leader. It was criticised, maligned, attacked, misrepresented and subjected to grave misrepresentation by the Labor Party particularly. Residents and voters throughout Australia such as in Braddon, received direct mail - nd all had their attention drawn to this proposal. It is interesting to note, using the example of Braddon, which was held by the sitting Liberal member Mr Miles with a margin of 2.8 per cent, that as a result of all of Labor's false propaganda in the election Mr Miles increased his vote and in fact doubled his majority. He now holds Braddon by a two-party preferred majority of 5.7 per cent compared with 2.8 per cent. To put into context the effect of the propaganda-the false and phoney bills whi-h frightened many innoc-nt people-I - IIl relate some instances WhICh occurred dunng my campaign in the electorate of Indi. For example, I was approached by low income pensioners living in Wangaratta who we-e distressed because they saw the Labor candIdate, the previous Prime Minister and ot-er like members of the discredited government gomg about their business trying to undermine and demolish the Liberal and National parties' proposals regarding Telstra. It is never pleasant as a member of parliament or as a candidate to have to talk with constituents across Australia who have been frightened and who feel that their security and future ability to maintain their phone service, in this case, is beyond their grasp. It is pleasant task. I find one of the worse features of politics is that people are given assertions and material which is not accurate. On a number of occasions I had to deal with those sorts of concerns, and I did it to the best of my ability. I also took the trouble to write to every newspaper and media outlet in country Victoria, certainly in my electorate, explaining the Telstra policy of the then alternative government so that it was widely canvassed. That was typical of all of the candidates for the Liberal-National Party in Australia. We widely canvassed it. As I said, we were attacked, maligned and subjected to false documents being circulated. We stood our ground, we explained our policy carefully, and John Howard and Tim Fischer received an overwhelming mandate for their policies. It is in that context that we in the House of Representatives are dealing with the first part of important legislation which the Australian public has already indicated that it approves in principle. In listening to the members of the opposition criticise this legislation over the last couple of days, they have attempted to say that directors of a one-third privatised Telstra will be obliged to answer the call of the private shareholders and will be obliged to discard the community service obligations: for example, untimed local calls will be discontinued and Telstra will be prevented from delivering the service across Australia to isolated communities. That is a total lie by members of the opposition who are putting that view. Alternatively, it is an indication of their ignorance and that they have not read the Telstra bill. It is true that directors in a public company are required to do their best to earn the maximum profits in the context of· their obligations, using the assets of the company that they are the directors of. I have a little knowledge of this as I am a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. I am aware of the corporate responsibilities involved in being a director, particularly in a public company. But the directors' obligations, and the relationship between the shareholders and the directors, are spelt out in the not a memorandum and articles of the company. In this case, it is the legislation that enables the memorandum and articles to be established and the process of shares to take place. The directors' obligations are read subject to that. The opposition has tried-perhaps through ignorance because it does not realise-to represent this legislation as legislation that will be discarded inevitably by the directors because the shareholders of the one-third ownership will insist that they abandon the community service obligations. That is just nonsense, it is poppycock, because it is a matter of law that the directors and shareholders will not be able to discard the community service obligations since they will be enshrined in legislation. The memorandum and articles of the company will reflect all that. If members of the opposition are challenging us and are threatening to go around Australia to make all of these various assertions, all I say to you is that you are even more out of touch with the Australian community than I thought you were and that you did not lea - n anything at all from the devastating defeat that you suffered on 2 March. Furthermore, if you are intent on building your party into a great party again, do you honestly believe that you are going to do so by going around Australia making misleading statements on important matters of policy in order to maintain or gain some advantage for yourselves and some greater political input into the process of Australian politics in the future? You are totally out of touch if you think the Australian community will swallow the sort of misrepresentation that has come from numerous members of the opposition when we hear them talk on this matter. While I will be sad if you do what you say you will, I look forward to the debate across Australia when you do it.",114
234,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Truss)Order! I ask the member of Indi to address his remarks through the chair.,116
235,Mr LIEBERMAN,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. When the former Prime Minister came to the electorates of Farrer and Indi to launch the then government's environmental policy, he did it at the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre, which is located just out of Albury at Thurgoona. That was actually a couple of days before he went to the Governor General and the parliament was dissolved. The now Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and I were pleased to see him visiting our electorates. But, while he there making his great promises about the future Keating government's environmental policies-addressing things that they should have addressed 13 years ago, I might add, although God knows how he was going to pay for them-the very place that he used as his backdrop, the research centre, was not being funded by the Labor government! The Deputy Prime Minister last 3Y2 years, have pursued the outgoing government and its ministers to resolve the funding problems that the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Centre has had to put up with because the Keating government failed to provide adequate funds to enable the core research into the Murray-Darling freshwater resource to be maintained. To this day, the new government, on top of the deficit we have inherited-which was concealed from the Australian people-is grappling with issues like finding the solution to funding important research centres like the Murraycapitalised Darling Freshwater Research Centre which expand, was neglected over the last few years by the Labor government. We will resolve that problem. We will find a way to do it. Part of the solution to the urgent environmental and heritage issues, particularly in the Murray-Darling area, provide a firm funding basis. It is poppycock for opposition speakers to say they had a great environmental policy that was funded and that they were going to do all the things that this new government has said it will That is just not right, because the Labor government ran us into a deficit. They were borrowing more money all the time. They took total borrowings to $180 billion, increasing the government's debt by more than four times in about four years, from memory. They have actually put this country in a position where we have to spend $10,000 million a year just to ·pay the interest on the government component of the debt which it ran up. Incidentally, that $10,000 million virtually represents all the money that we as a Commonwealth have to spend on health. It is a vast sum of money. I heard opposition speakers today saying that their environmental policy was stolen by was the government and that, furthermore, they had it all paid for. That is just not true. If they had been re-elected-heaven forbidthey would have had to break their promise or increase taxes or borrowings, or both, and God knows what else. And at what cost to small business, to young people trying to get jobs, to people in semi-retirement and others who have been trying to find the security that has been slipping away during 13 years of and I, for the Labor government? Those in the opposition are the people who are now saying that they have some credibility and should be listened to in this debate. I simply say to them that they do not have credibility but they do have the opportunity to reassess where they are at. The position that I put very strongly to the parliament is that we now have a unique opportunity to do a number of things through this legislation. Firstly, we have the opportunity to enable Telstra to go into the next century properly and in a position to compete and as we all hope it will. In fact, I call this legislation 'Telstra liberation legislation'. The fact is-if those opposite do not know this, I suggest they get briefings-to be able to compete in the telecommunications market in Australia and around the world, which is is to what we want Telstra to do, it will need access to vast amounts of capital. If the Labor Party's dead-hand policy prevails and they stop this one-third privatisation, they will force the Commondo. wealth-the Australia taxpayers-to provide further funds, further loan money, to enable Telstra to struggle to compete with all of the other competitors. You cannot do that to a great organisation like Telstra. You must liberate it; you must enable it to have access. The way to do that is to enable it to have access to the private sector in the way that is proposed. The second point is that it is a nonsense to say that Te1stra is an entity that has to be protected. The Hawke-Keating government brought in Optus to take a share of the mobile telephone market. Vodafone is now in the market as well. The market is already alive, already increasingly more competitive. Telstra cannot be left in the shadows, cannot be kept back from meeting the challenges that it faces and should be able to face. It should be liberated and allowed to go into the future. (Time expired)",116
236,Mr GRIFFIN,Unknown,"Bruce) (6.22 p.m.)Tonight we are debating a crucial piece of legislation, the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bi111996. As other speakers have said, this is probably going to be one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this parliament. That can be shown by the amount of public debate that has occurred and by the number of speakers seeking to put their views on this legislation. It can be shown by the angst that has occurred in various question times in the last couple of weeks when the government have tried to defend their position on this issue and it can be shown by the detail within the legislation and its very far-reaching implications for Australian society. One of the issues that have come up continually in the Telstra debate, particularly since the election, has been that of a mandate. The government have been saying ad nauseam that they have a mandate to move forward with this policy. I think that in politics 'mandate' is sometimes a much abused word. I guess we all use it on various occasions to defend the actions that we may take as a government or as an opposition. Certainly in the last couple of weeks in particular, but also since the election, 'mandate' has gone far beyond what many Australians saw when they went to the polls on 2 March. There is no doubt that we lost the election and, having lost that election, we have many lessons to learn in the future. I believe we will learn those lessons. However, we also have to look at the reasons for that loss as opposed to what some say the reasons are. When we look at the way the government have used the word 'mandate' in the last few weeks, we find that it covers industrial relations policy, family policy, taxation policy, general economic policy and environment policy . You name it, it covers it. Mr Martin Ferguson-Moving to Sydney.",117
237,Mr GRIFFIN,Unknown,"That is right. It has been used to cover almost every government policy, except the ones that they are going to dump over the next couple of months. It also covers a whole range of policies which were not their policies at the time of the electionfor example, the movements in the pilblic sector; the massive downsizing of the Public Service. We see it also being used by the minor parties-for example, the Australian Democrats-in their opposition to the sale of Telstra. We see it also from the Labor Party, of which I am proud to be a member, in our opposition to the sale of Telstra. I guess we will keep debating that word and the word will be abused on a continuing basis by just about everybody, but I am here to say that I have always opposed the sale of Telstra. I have opposed it in party forums, I have opposed it within the caucus, and I will continue to oppose it. Members of my partycertainly the ones that I have spoken to, and I have spoken to most--oppose the sale of Telstra, have always opposed the sale of Telstra and will continue to oppose the sale of Telstra. Telstra is an icon of the Australian community. Telecommunications policy and telecommunications activities are an even more important part of Australian society today then they were 10, 20 or 30 years ago. We are a large country with a population which is spread significantly around the edges. Telecommunications is crucial to the community; it is crucial to the social well-being of many Australians. Privatisation has also been an issue which has been raised in terms of Telstra and the sell-off. One of the government's arguments has been: we have privati sed so many things as a government, what's another thing? The Commonwealth Bank and Qantas-essentially the argument is that we privatised, therefore, we should support this proposal and, if we do not support it, we are being intellectually dishonest. The argument that if you privatise some things you therefore support privati sing everything is ridiculous. I am sure we all agree that some things should not be privatised. We may disagree as to what they are. Mr Andrew-The Commonwealth Bank?",117
238,Mr GRIFFIN,Unknown,"My friend the member for Wakefield and I would probably not agree on all of them, but certainly we have to say that there are some things that should not go. Mr Martin Ferguson-The water supply system in South Australia.",118
239,Mr GRIFFIN,Unknown,"The actions of state governments in some of these areas are worthy of note, as the member for Batman just mentioned by way of interjection. In South Australia we are seeing a range of utilities being considered for sell-off. In Victoria we are seeing the same thing. Each issue has to be judged on its merits. Each piece of legislation has to be judged on what it will do for Australian society. When we talk about privatisation, each enterprise has to be judged on a range of criteria as to whether or not it the country's interests for that entity to be privati sed. Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank are two entities that have been mentioned on a regular basis and people have said, 'They are just the same.' They are not the same. Qantas is an airline in an area where there are many airlines. The Commonwealth Bank is a bank in a situation where there are many banks. would have to say that I did not support our internal party processes the Commonmit-and wealth Bank being sold either. But the fact the matter is that they are both in competitive markets. Both are not operating as monopothis lies. Because a large number of players are involved, issues such as community service obligations and fairness and equity can taken care of to a large extent under the question of competition. In the environment of recent years the capacity of the Commonwealth Bank or Qantas has not been such as to cause great aggravation in the operation of their sectors in the Australian community. Another difference is the fact that both Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank, as has been said by other speakers, were in need of urgent capital injections. The question which faces government is whether huge sums of taxpayers' money being placed into these entities, and in that way maintaining them and helping them grow, is preferable to private sector support. Telstra is a very different kettle of fish. Telstra has about 90 per cent of the telecommunications market in Australia. That will change to an extent. As has been mentioned by other speakers, Optus and, more recently, Vodafone have come into the market, and other niche market operators will come into the field over time. That is having an impact and will continue to have an impact. The impact competition has had on a wide range of telecommunications services is that there have been cuts in SID and ISD call rates and, I think, improved service delivery. Certainly when I had a phone connected I was impressed by the service given by those providers. Other competitors are still developing, even though Telstra dominates the market. That is is in important because there are elements of the services that Telstra provides that would be unlikely to be profitable for other competitors. These elements relate to the national interest-rural and regional Australia and the poor and disadvantaged in society. Another issue which has been raised in recent times is the Senate. I found that pretty . amusing. I remember sitting on the other side I of the House just a few short months ago-I in much preferred sitting there, I have to adI heard someone, I forget who it of was now, define the Senate as 'unrepresentative swill'. Normally I heard it coming from side as an attack on the then Prime Minister. But certainly the comments from the opposition at the time were very much in be defence of the role of the Senate-that the Senate was a crucial part of democracy, that the Senate had a right to take decisions and that the Senate had a right to review and, if necessary, reject legislation. The opposition defended that right even if it meant cutting up the government's program, even if it meant stopping the government from implementing election promises and even if it meant destroying the legislative program and the underlying budget position. In the same way the current government might say to us that we cannot have it both ways. You are the government now and you have to deal with the Senate. In those circumstances one should try to temper the rhetoric of just how horrible the Senate is and understand and expect that members of that place have been elected to do a job. They have been elected on behalf of constituents and they have a right to make decisions. If they make decisions that affect your legislative program, they have a mandate to do so. Another argument which has been raised is that it is all a bit of a joke, that we would sell Telstra anyway-we were hiding that from the Australian people and we were going to act on it the week after the election. Why had we not done it already? Much has been made by the government that we were on the treasury bench for some 13 years and we should have done this and we should have done that. It would seem that if we were going to move on Telstra we would have done it already. I think the government very clearly underestimates the Labor Party's commitment to Telstra being a government owned enterprise. I think it massively underestimates the concern that we have, and have held for a long time, about the impact of the sale of Telstra on rural and regional Australia. Another argument which has been raised by the government is that we are only talking about one-third of Telstra, that it is not full privatisation and that that in itself means everything will be all right. There is a range of reasons why everything will not be all right. It has been said by other speakers that if one-third of Telstra is privatised we will have private shareholders. That will be the result. Private shareholders are, quite rightly, business of trying to maximise the return on their investment, as are their directors. There are a range of issues relating to the operation of Telstra which will become increasingly difficult for a board of that nature to handle. The circumstances of a cross-subsidisation and a whole raft of community service obligations that are undertaken by Telstra will put that board in a situation where it will have to make difficult decisions. When you look at the legislation and the situation that is to be faced by the government in the future, you will see that there will be inexorable pressure to privatise more of Telstra. That has not been ruled out by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). They are not ruling out that at some time in the future-three years, five years, six years, maybe sooner-we may well be here debating another bill on the further privatisation of Telstra. Even when one-third of a board is privatised, pressure is placed on the board. You can endeavour to put safeguards in place through legislation, as the government has tried to do, to defend those community service obligations, but when you look at the sort of activity Telstra undertakes you cannot necessarily legislate for all outcomes. You cannot necessarily guarantee all the obligations that we would probably seek to have enshrined in the operation of Telstra. Legislation often has holes. Most of the time in this House we debate amendment legislation. Quite often, we are amending for new circumstances or for unintended consequences. As was said by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) earlier today, this has implications beyond strictly telephones. The whole question of communications policy in the longer term is developing at a dramatic rate. Developments in communications are taking place now as we debate this issue. The whole development of pay TV and a range of other issues means that telecommunications policy has to be watched on a continuing basis. Quite rightly, the board of a privati sed Telstra, even part-privatised, will be looking in the for opportunities to minimise its nonprofitable operations, to minimise its obligations which it sees as not being economically relevant. Legislation cannot guarantee that all those obligations affecting rural and regional Australia will be kept in place. Another issue has been the link between the coalition's environment policy and the sale of Telstra. It has been said by many opposite that this is the greatest environment policy ever. It is also your only environment policy ever. It is also mainly our policy. The fact is that over the last 13 years you have consistently been behind in the policy debate on the environment. Whether it be the Franklin Dam, the Daintree, uranium mining-you name itthe coalition has always been right behind the game when it comes to environment policy. So now you finally have a policy, but you will not fund it through the usual means. Instead, we have a situation here of policy blackmail and fiscal extortion-no sale; no policy. When you look at the actual budget situation, which has again been commented on by a number of speakers, and when you look at forward funding estimates and the implementation of our policies prior to the election versus yours, there is a minimal funding difference. What we are really seeing is a cost shifting situation here. We are moving policy and funding commitments off the usual budget into a situation of a one-off sale. The fact is that you do not need to sell Telstra to have an environment policy. That is your choice, and it is a con. Another issue that has come up has been the question: can you sell it? By that I mean that there are grave doubts that the Australian capital markets can absorb it in the sorts of time lines that are undertaken by the government on this issue. That means you may not get the price that the government wants or you may have to wait longer to get it. For a range of circumstances, this legislation ought be opposed. As I have said, you cannot guarantee the community service obligations that are undertaken under this legislation. You cannot have a situation where you can be sure in the future that rural and regional Australia will not be severely hurt. The situation in terms of the cost of services-whether it be the cost of the phone call, the cost of the connection, the time to make that connection or the time taken to ensure that you are up to date with technologies in parts of Australia-cannot be guaranteed. You can have it in the legislation to an extent, but the fact is that in one year's time, two years time or three years time-and we have seen it in many other areas, where you have had businesses go into privatisation and be in a situation where they start rolling back their networks away from those sorts of areas-you see an erosion of services. The problem with having a private ownership component of Telstra is that you will have a situation where the commitment of those directors will be to try, in all circumstances that are possible to them, to maximise their return for their shareholders. That is fair enough, but something has to give. I do not know that we will see change tomorrow if this bill goes ahead-it may not be for some time-but you will see job losses, and you will see job losses to a greater extent than you would see under a government owned Telstra. You will see a situation where the electronics industry in Australia is severely handicapped because of the movement which will definitely occur of Telstra to source its components overseas. You will see a situation where a range of electronics companies in this country which have come to rely on Telstra as the base to their expansion will see that base disappear. The legislation should be opposed. It should be opposed by all of us because it is bad policy. Its implications for Australians as a whole are bad. Its result for rural and regional Australia will be bad. I urge all of you to oppose this legislation and ensure that we do not have a situation where a major national asset, which performs a crucial role for Australian society, is destroyed and frittered away as a result of this privatisation measure.",118
240,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in this Telstra debate, and I particularly welcome the opportunity to follow my friend the member for Bruce (Mr Griffin), whose concluding point in the debate was that in some strange way rural and regional Australia would be disadvantaged by this legislative move. That taken is an extraordinary remark to be made by a member of the opposition. It is an extraordinary remark to be made simply because the representatives of rural and regional Australia are here on this side of the parliament. It is the representatives of rural and regional Australia that are backing this sale. I remind both the parliamentary secretary and the member for Bruce that it is the National Farmers Federation, the group that represent regional and rural Australia, who have said, 'This is the right course for us to take.' I stand here as the representative of a regional seat, and I stand here as a representaThose tive of a seat-as, indeed, the Deputy Speaker does-that is dependent on the community service obligations in order to have its communication needs met. I would not tolerate this piece of legislation if it disadvantaged constituents. If that were not of itself a persuasive argument, given that I am joined in this debate by the National Party as well, let me say this to the opposition: the minister responwithout sible for this piece of legislation represents rural and regional seat himself. He has no desire to see the communication facilities available to his constituents reduced in any way at all. I am very pleased that the minister is in the chamber. The minister is the one whose electoral responsibility includes King IslandMr Warwick Smith-And Flinders.",120
241,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"And Flinders Island. There is a circumstance where clearly there would be a communication disadvantage if the community service obligations were not being met. The legislation obliges Telstra to continue with its present community service obligations. Were that not the case, I would not want to know it. Other regional members would not want to know it, the National Party would not want to know it, the National Farmers Federation would not want to know it and the minister would not want to be identified with it. After listening to this debate, one could forgiven for thinking that the government was standing here proposing the sale of Telstra. I must be fair to the member for Bruce. He was very objective in his analysis and referred to the partial sale of Telstra. But not all of his colleagues have been as honourable in their participation in the debate. We are talking about the partial sale of a government asset. We are talking about a sale that will limit individual foreign ownership to 1.667 per cent-that is, five per cent of the nonCommonwealth equity in Telstra. Criticism is coming from people who have themselves not only proposed but also executed the sale of other major Commonwealth assets, such as the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas and the Federal Airports Corporation. sales, not conditional on a partial sale, were made by the now opposition when in government without any reference to the people. The member for Bruce went on to say that my he supposed, as former opposition members had supposed, that this partial sale would be followed by further sales of parts of Telstraforgetting the government's commitment not to proceed with any further sale of Telstra first seeking the approval of the a people of Australia by referendum or election. The facts are that this is not a sale that places my electorate or my constituents at risk. But the other thing to. be borne in mind-and the other point I would want to make on the comments from the member for Bruce---.: - is that while the focus has been on this sale, as if the sale of Telstra were the only technique that the opposition had to fund its environment package, the opposition has conveniently forgotten that the motive for this sale is not funding the environment package but sorting out the economy that it inherited. The motive for this sale is to give the Australian economy an opportunity to be refreshed, a breather. There are too many opposition members who too conveniently forget that during their period in government we saw this nation become increasingly less competitive. For example, from 1975 to 1988, when the now government had stewardship of the national be books, we never recorded a current account deficit in excess of $1 billion. Out of the 150 months recorded from 1983 to 1995, when the now opposition had stewardship of the national books, on 96 occasions the current account deficit was over $1 billion. In fact, on 11 occasions it was over $2 billion. That was a measure of real economic failure. As a result of that economic failure, our national income per capita and our position on the world scale of national income per capita slipped from 10th to 22nd. The economy is not something the now opposition can be proud of. The situation we have inherited has obliged this sale to allow us to address the fundamental economic problems we face. While the member for Bruce was making his contribution, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) interjected and suggested that since I was following in the debate as a South Australian I would have an interest in drawing a parallel between the sale of Telstra and the sale of SA Water. The reality, of course, is that the member for Batman was quite wrong. SA Water has not been sold by the South Australian government. In fact, SA Water has sold nothing more than the service delivery. The South Australian government retains the ownership of all of the capital assets of SA Water and all that has been sold is the service delivery.",121
242,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,That's sophistry.,122
243,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"The parliamentary secretary may want to listen to my rather useful illustration of what the sale of SA Water does. The sale of SA Water is like the South Australian minister taking a shower and standing there with his hands still on the taps, because he still has control of the water but the rose has changed-the technique for delivery is all that has effectively been sold. The parliamentary secretary says that that is sophistry. Let me remind him that the only reason the South Australian government proceeded down this course was precisely the reason that forces the present federal government down this Telstra course-that is, they inherited an impossible budget situation.",122
244,Dr THEOPHANOUS,Unknown,"So that justifies selling water, does it?",122
245,Mr ANDREW,Unknown,"It absolutely does in SA Water terms, yes. The motivation behind the sale of Telstra is not simply to address the debt. There is also the question, as everyone has acknowledged, of what we do about the environment. Professor John Loveri-g, when addressing the Murray-Darling Association in Broken Hill late last year, said: If you want to pick a fight in rural Australia, forget woodchipping, greenies and dole bludgers. If you want a blue, talk about water. The real issue concerning rural Australia is the supply of water, particularly in a drought. Ask the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), who hails from Queensland, about the experience Queenslanders have had-or indeed you, Mr Deputy Speaker Truss-over the last five years. The experiences have been all too dramatically changed in much of Queensland over the last week. For most Australian rural producers, the key issue is the supply of water-and the supply of quality water. Nowhere is that more marked than in my own South Australian electorate. I have most of the key irrigation areas in South Australia in my electorate. I recognise, as the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) said in her maiden speech, the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin system to the supply of fruit and vegetables in Australia. What is happening across the Murray-Darling Basin system, as everyone in this House is aware and as every Australian is now aware, is that there has been a deterioration that cannot be allowed to continue. The document Saving our national heritage states: One-third of the nation's output from rural industries originates in the Basin, of which three billion is derived from irrigation. Irrigation accounts for more than 95 per cent of the water diverted from the river systems in the Basin. The problem is that salinity in rivers and streams is increasing alarmingly. Algal blooms are more frequent and severe, water quality is continuing to decline and wetlands and river flora have suffered. Agricultural loss as a result of the impact of salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin is calculated at $260 million per annum-an astonishing cost. It is a cost that has reflected the degeneration of the Murray-Darling Basin system. This government proposes to do something about it by addressing what we do with the River Murray. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in response to a question at question time two days ago that in six out of every 10 years the Murray effectively flows in a drought situation because of the amount of water that is now diverted out of the Murray and not replenished in some way. Under natural circumstances the drought flows would have been one in 20. As a government, the coalition proposes, aided by the Telstra sale, to direct $163 million to a Murray-Darling 2001 project to do something about the standard of water available to Murray irrigators, to New South Welshmen, to South Australians in general, and also to Victorians, particularly in the Sunraysia area. This is a critical program. Every Murray-Darling irrigator, every South Australian, is dependent on the quality of the water delivered from the Murray-Darling into their homes. Take, for example, the member for Grey e Mr Wakelin). In his electorate, were it not for the diversion of River Murray water to the city of Whyalla there would be no industry; and, in 1996, it is probably fair to say there would be nothing more than a small town in the now city of Whyalla. My state depends on quality water from the Murray-Darling Basin. It depends totally on it and so do the key industries in which I have participated and which I represent as the member for Wakefield. Much has been done, even by the former government, to in some way improve the quality of River Murray water. I am very conscious, for example, of the Woolpunda scheme where $27 million was allocated solely to identify underground saline flows which occurred in the Murray-Darling Basin and which had little to do with irrigation but a great deal to do with the fact that the area was once an inland sea. As a result of 26 tube wells being placed along the Murray-Darling Basin and intercepting these highly saline flows which had come from all over·northern New South Wales-because this was once an inland sea-salinity at Morgan in South Australia was reduced by eight per cent. That was a step in the right direction. It is interesting to note that the water intercepted by those tube wells and directed out to an evaporation basin has probably never been seen by the human eye andcertainly never by the European eye until it comes out of the pipe into the evaporation basin. That is because it is water that fell as rainwater or existed there as inland seawater certainly before Europeans and possibly before human habitation of this great island. This scheme is picking up these saline flows going into the Murray-Darling Basin and diverting them. As a result of the scheme funded by the previous government, salinity has improved. But, as anyone who knows anything about the Murray-Darling Basin can attest, the grim reality is that, with the demands we are placing on the basin as a result of expanded agricultural practice, principally in cotton but now to a large degree in wine grape production, and as a result of the drainage water that has accumulated, that eight per cent improvement is quickly lost with the demands that the Australian population is putting on this food bowl. Hence the need for a major program. Hence the need to allocate $163 million to continually improve the status of the Murray-Darling Basin. This is an allocation that cannot responsibly occur unless we generate the funds to make it happen, and those funds can only be generated out of the partial saleand I emphasise 'partial sale'-of Telstra. So the government stands here proud of what it proposes to do. It proposes to maintain an essential Australian asset-still available to Australians, still recognising its community service obligations, still ensuring that the Flinders Island constituents of the member for Bass, the minister at the table, will have the same access to not only their existing telephone services but also improved onesand still be able as a result of that sale to both improve the national economy and do something about the environment. The Prime Minister has made it perfectly clear that he will set up what has been called a Natural Heritage Trust and that out of that trust $318 million will be allocated to a national vegetation initiative and 250,000 hectares of ground per annum will be revegetated. With all of the problems that the Murray-Darling Basin faces, the best way to deal with the surplus water currently occurring in the Murray-Darling Basin-as the result, in many instances, of drainage run-off that is not being picked up-is not to put in pumps as a way of intercepting that water but to plant trees, because day and night, without consuming fossil fuels, those trees provide a pump to lower the saline water levels. Hence the importance of the Natural Heritage Trust and the importance of the revegetation program proposed by the Prime Minister and to be funded by the legislation currently being considered in the House. I think the minister ought to be commended for the role he has played in putting this package to the House and making it available for real debate and consideration by all Australians. On that note, I will make my final point. The member for Bruce, along with many opposite, has made much of the fact, as he saw it, that we, the government, could not claim a mandate for this particular action. It is self-evident in this chamber that we can claim a mandate, but the member for Bruce has suggested that in the other chamber people had taken out an insurance policy by which we could claim no mandate at all. He was conveniently forgetting the statistics made available to every Australian by Malcolm Mackerras, who, looking at the Senate result from the 2 March 1996 election, pointed out that 40 senators went to the polls and 20--a half, would you believe-were returned as members of the Liberal or National parties. That hardly leaves a mandate for anyone else in their own right. I rest my case. A half were returned as members of the Liberal and National parties. Forget about this chamber, we are reflecting on the Senate. Fourteen were returned as members of the Australian Labor Party, five as members of the Australian Democrats and one as a Tasmanian Green. I put this question to the House: what did the majority of Australians vote for? The simple, inescapable truth is that the majority of them voted for the Liberal and National parties, for this program and for a commitment that we have to the partial sale of Telstra and the consequent simultaneous tidy up of the economy and the environment. I commend the minister on this legislation, and commend it to the House.",122
246,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"Newcastle) (7.01 p.m.}- Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, at the outset I offer my congratulations to you, the Second Deputy Speaker and the Speaker on your elevations to your positions. We should talk a little bit about the election and what its result implies. We have heard an awful lot of nonsense and discussion about mandates. I wonder whether all Victorian members should vote against this legislation, because the majority of Victorians voted against the Liberal Party at the election. In fact, the opposition out-polled the Liberal Party in Victoria. So, on the reckoning of those opposite, all Victorian members of this House should vote with us. That seems to be the way the opposition want to play it. That is their idea about mandate. The fact is that the majority of Australians voted against the government in both houses. I have spent some years in this chamber listening to those who are now opposite lecturing and hectoring us in government about how we had no mandate. Everything we tried to do they opposed, undermined and used their numbers in the other place. They did not come in here with the pious posturing that we are seeing now. It is absolutely amazing. But it is not surprising when you consider it is coming from honest John and his friends. Those who are here for the first time may be a bit puzzled by this change in attitude. My friend the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) does not surprise me, because he has always had the capacity to be all things to all people. Now, of course, he is playing the pompous posturer. He is talking about a mandate, knowing as well as I do that he spent the years on this side of the House arguing the opposite case. We are also hearing a massive campaign of lies. I find it amazing. The word 'lies' is parliamentary. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) used it the other afternoon on three occasions and was not stopped once by the Speaker. So I accept that the word has been used in this chamber by the leader of the government since the election with no opposition from the Speaker. He used the term quite specifically, not even generally. The lies that have been propagated about the opposition policy and its attitudes on Telstra are mind boggling. There is the issue of the budget deficit. It is very clear that government put forward proposals which were $4 billion short of funding. They made a promise that they would keep all their promises. They even promised that they would go into deficit rather than break those promises. That is the first promise broken. The fact is that they are $4 billion short of funds for the policies they put forward. The Treasury estimates that have come forward are based on current government policy. The idea that Treasury cos ted the policies of the former government is a nonsense. They costed the current government's policies. As we have seen, those policies require a downturn. Access Economics have pointed out, as has almost every other commentator, that there will be anything from a 0.3 per cent to a 0.7 per cent drop in growth in the current year alone. Treasury factored those estimates into the projections for the next budget, as it has to do. If it is factoring in our policies, with accord in place and with lower wage growth, there would have been a different budget bottom line. Firstly, there is the $4 billion shortfall, which was fabricated by the opposition in terms of its costings. Secondly, the difference is made by government policies in slowing growth and increasing unemployment in the short to medium terms, and God knows for how long. The idea that somehow they can persuade the Australian people that this country is in dreadful shape is not on. Their attempt to demoruse the opposition for what they have inherited is just a joke. People out there know that inflation is low, wage growth is low and employment growth has been enormously high. They are watching very carefully now. I note with great interest that, since the election, there has been no outburst of spending by the government. In fact, it has been the opposite situation. Going further, what the government has done to the national capital is appalling. Any government which deliberately suspends a whole city, a national capital, of this size four months of absolute uncertainty for political gain-simply to back load the redundancy packages into the current budget-is the disgraceful. What the government has done is very simple. Packages are available until 30 June for those who want to retire. The cost of those packages will be measured against the previous government's budget. This attempt to shift the budget figure in the 1995-96 budget is disgraceful and immoral. Rather than making a decision about what they are doing, they are spreading that over four months, from now right through until budget night. So the whole of Canberra is frozen for four months. Why? Because the government want to back load a few hundred million dollars into this year's budget. That is a shabby, squalid little trick. What about the debt question? The fact is that debts relate to assets. The issue at stake does not relate simply to the size of the debt. It also relates to the value of the asset held and to the capacity to service the debt. Does the government suggest that this generation the should pay now for everything-the roads, the public utilities and infrastructure that will last for decades-in cash so that the next generation inherits all those assets without contributing towards them? Is that the idea-that somehow debt is intrinsically wrong? If so I have never heard that put forward in that way before. The government has not argued that. It did not say that during the election campaign. It has not articulated that kind of a thesis. The fact is that each generation in a society pays a share of what it uses. It is important that the assets and infrastructure we pass to future generations are in good shapebut not that they are necessarily debt-free, because the debt is part of the asset. What matters is the relationship between the value of the asset and the debt and the capacity to service that debt. The idea that this issue is about getting the debt down is suspect. It is even more suspect because what they are going to save is the interest on the debt. What is that? Five per cent? Six per cent? Seven per cent? Eight per cent? The fact is that the $8 billion that will for be gained from the sale is currently earning about 14 per cent. Why would you retire debt and save seven per cent when what you are retiring is currently earning you 14 per cent? I remember very well the unctuous lecture from the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) yesterday about how economically literate he was. He was trying to justify the better value of retiring the debt. He forgot the return on the asset the government wants to flog. The $8 billion asset it wants to sell will return more to the people of Australia if they own it. I have heard with great amusement the idea that somehow we should share this wonderful golden goose with all the battlers, who will all want their little share of it. The fact is that they have a share of it now, and it is earning them 14 per cent. Those opposite want to flog it off to someone else and save seven per cent. These are the economic gurus, the leading lights of the next century, who are supposed to be putting Australia on the right path. This policy came up about 10 years ago in 1987. Those opposite have been talking about it in various forms at various times, at various elections. Suddenly it has come forward now to solve a deficit problem in the current budget. What a lot of gobbledegook. Telstra has a $15 billion a year turnover. It is a business which plays an enormously important role in this country. We have already heard that it pays $650 million a year in taxation. It is one of the genuine corporate taxpayers; it observes the spirit of the law because the government says it has to, because the government can make it do so. Take away section 3 in the legislation, under which the minister can direct Telstra to act in the national interests, and we lose the capacity to make sure it observes the spirit of corporate taxation. Telstra plays an important role as a corporate model for taxation. Telstra pays another $300 million a year in other taxes-rates, state taxes and payroll taxes. It pays more than a billion in dividends. That is the type of organisation we are talking about-not some run-down and ineffective bureaucratic department. I mentioned earlier the role Telstra plays in corporate taxation. The member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) quoted the report of the inquiry of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology into government purchasing. The members for Indi (Mr Lieberman) and 1996 Bendigo (Mr Reid) both took part in that inquiry. We went through the various departments and the effects of government purchasing and the role played by Telstra. Telstra expects to spend about $10 billion in the next five years in Australia. Talk to the companies that Telstra buys from and they will say that without government policy pushing Telstra to do so it would not be happening. They could buy cheaper and nastier somewhere else. Our high-tech exports have gone from about $50 million to almost $1 billion a year. Telstra has driven that. Telstra is an arm of government. It can be directed by express government policy. More than 90 per cent of its purchases are made in Australia. Seventy per cent of its high-tech purchases are made in Australia. There would be no Australian telecommunications industry if Telstra were not government owned. Go around the world and ask and you will find someone who will sell the products Telstra needs for a cheaper price. Why would a private company with a responsibility to its shareholders not buy the cheapest product? Why should it observe government policy? Of course, it cannot. When overseas, I am asked, as I am sure other members are asked, why small pockets of population are scattered all over this vast continent---on the east coast, in the west, up north. Telstra's technology has been world class for a very long time, yet when we came to government in 1983 Telstra was not able to go overseas. We had to pass special legislation, which eventually got through in 1984. There was not much cooperation then to allow Telstra to go and sell overseas. Ericsson-the great shining light of the previous government-was established in Australia to supply to Telstra. I thought that was a wonderful thing until I went there in 1983 and discovered that Ericsson Australia was not allowed to sell outside Australasia and New Guinea. Ericsson Sweden supplied Asia, not Ericsson Australia. It was all wrong. The design and the methodology indicated the previous government's inability to understand the capacity of Telecom to drive Australian industry, to be a player in a bigger game than just the domestic scene, to project into trade. We are talking about a large, dynamic organisation that has been incredibly successful. Let us talk about the sale of Telstra. I noticed that section 3 of the legislation, which relates to ministerial discretion to direct Telstra in the national interests, goes. In other words, under this legislation Telstra cannot be directed to act in the national interests. The price capping on its charges applies for only as long as the current disallowable instrument-that is, 1997 on the current policy. We know nothing beyond then because no policy has been articulated. It has been proposed but we are still in a vacuum. There are some interesting words used in the legislation, which are quite meaningful when you have ministerial power to direct in the national interest the universal service obligations to ensure access to standard telephones. The key words are 'on an equitable basis'. Those opposite are going to start finding out that people in Melbourne or Sydney will not think it is equitable that they are subsidising the bush. The fact is that they outnumber everybody else. If Optus will not put cable into Dungog, why should Telstra keep cable there? Is that equitable? It is not simply a question of access to services; it is a question of the services being maintained there. Watching the withdrawal of the Commonwealth Bank, as mentioned by previous speakers, is nothing compared to Telstra beCause, very simply, Telstra can use mobile technology. It puts in a simple transmitter and everyone goes on to mobile phones, from which calls are timed. Time charges do not affect mobile phones. Mr Deputy Speaker, it will be very nice in your electorate. You will have access to mobile telephones. Why keep the cables running? Why upgrade the cables? You will not need to as it is not equitable. They cannot be made to. The mobile charges that your constituents have will be the same mobile charges as the charges in Melbourne and Sydney, and so they should be. That is the answer. I do not think you people understand where technology has got to. We are looking towards a world where digital technology will be universal. It can be broadbanded and it is all timed. The little travesty in here of a clause about timed charges is a furphy, and you know it because your advisers are not stupid. You may be technologically illiterate, but they are not. Two million Australians are already using mobile phones. By the end of the century that will have almost trebled. Once your technology has got to that level, the bush will go mobile and we will all be timed. Don't you dare suggest that I am telling lies or being misleading because that is what is going to happen and you know it.",124
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable member that I will not suggest that he is telling lies. At the same time, he might address his remarks through the chair.",127
248,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,Unknown,"I am delighted to hear that, Mr Deputy Speaker. For those opposite to claim that they are being misrepresented is wrong. What I am suggesting now is accurate and you know it. It is also fascinating to look at the question of foreign debt. One of the big issues of the last election was the mandate about foreign' debt. Who gave you a mandate to increase it by $3 billion? That is what you have done. Your foreign sales of $2.8 billion will be by debt. You know the trick; you know the system. Establish an Australian company. It borrows from its parents offshore. It brings the money in as a loan and then buys the shares. They all do it, or haven't you noticed? That is what the foreign debt is about. It buys equity and assets through Australian companies which have borrowed off their parent company or subsidiary overseas. It is not just the ownership of Telstra that is involved. You are about to increase foreign debt by $3 billion and you walk around the countryside talking about how dreadful we were for allowing the foreign debt to blowout when you are deliberately and consciously doing it. What kind of chicanery is that? Truth is all. Truth is absolute. This fortnight we have seen the most disgraceful display of slipping and sliding, walking away from, avoiding and misleading that I have seen in a long time from people who put to us in this chamber not many months ago that truth was absolute. I have seen very little truth in this fortnight. Mr Deputy Speaker, I pointed out to you that those in your own constituency and those in rural and regional Australia, who I am close to, are going to be the victims of this. They are facing a shift in services. The government cannot direct Telstra to maintain a service that is no longer economically viable and where the hardware is out of date. Telstra is putting in the most modem technology available, which will be mobile technology. That is equitable, fair and accessible. It meets all the criteria and it is all timed. Who decides the rental charges? Not Telstra, but somebody else. An unbelievable hypocritical action is going on in here. I feel a bit sorry for who have come into this parliament for the first time because they actually believe a lot of this stuff. They think that what they are being told is accurate, genuine and honest. They are in for an awful shock if this legislation gets passed. Let us debate it up and down the country. Let us go around Australia talking about this topic. I think Australians will see through you. You have no mandate. You have a mandate to govern and nothing else. If you took mandates seriously, you would have voted differently over the last 12 years. Let us debate this issue up and down Australia. Let us go to your electorates and see who has the mandate. (Time expired)",127
249,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"Being on this side of the House, I obviously oppose this Telstra legislation and support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). Yesterday, in his contribution, my colleague the member for Werriwa described this bilI as a bad, bad piece of legislation. He is correct. During the recent election-and we have all been parading the mandate we received during that election-I received an overwhelming vote in my electorate to oppose the sale of Telstra.",128
250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Nehl)Order! The chair would be grateful if the member for Watson would allow him to see the speaker. He might observe standing order 57 while he is at it.,128
251,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,"I visited many workplaces during the election campaign to talk to workers about a wide range of issues. One issue that was always raised with me was the sale of Telstra. I told them, just as I told every voter in Throsby during my campaign, that I would oppose the sale of Telstra. Today, like my colleagues, I fulfil that promise, that solemn commitment, I gave to the people of Throsby. Bear in mind that I was one of the few on this side who had an increase in their primary vote, which was probably because of my very strong opposition to the privatisation of Telstra. I oppose the Telstra privatisation legislation because it is contrary to the interests of the employees of this telecommunications machine, the taxpayers of Australia and the consumers of the telecommunications those opposite services in Australia. During the last couple of days there has been a lot of talk in this chamber about Labor's support when in government for the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. While I never agreed with these decisions made by the previous government, Telstra is in a different set of circumstances. I listened to the contribution made by the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) this morning. He said that no-one publicly, privately or in the caucus-and I do not know how he knows what went on in our caucus as he was not even a member of this parliament-opposed the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank or Qantas. I made many public statements on the issue and I suggest that he read my appropriation bill speech delivered from that side of the House on 30 May 1995-incidentally, my birthday. It is on page 596 of the Weekly Hansard. In that speech, at some personal cost to myself but with an electoral bonus, I very strongly criticised the party, the government, for its sale of the Commonwealth Bank and the privatisation of Qantas. As many people would know-and they have heard me say this ad nauseam in my speeches-I have always opposed the sale of ANL. I have always been very public in my statements and, again, I will have another opportunity tomorrow to restate that. For those on the government side who are saying that no members on this side opposed privatisation when we were in government, I suggest they have a look at our record. Some of us on this side have always been opposed to it. I vividly remember one ad which was shown during the recent election campaign. I must say I thought it was one of the best as from the Liberal Party. The advertisement appeared on regional and rural television networks. It flashed up on the television a photograph of the local Labor Party member of parliament, whoever that member might have been, and then came the voice-over with a message about some sin which the local Labor member, in their view, had committed by voting on legislation of the previous government. One such ad was in Gilmore. Up would come a photograph of the former member for Gilmore, Peter Knott, and the voice would come over and say, 'Did you vote for tax rises, did you vote for this or did you vote for that?' Then there would be a big sign that said no and the photograph of Peter would come up and it would say, 'But Peter Knott did,' and then some other thing would be stamped across his face. Come the next election there will be quite a few government members who will be kept accountable by those on this side of the House. I have to transgress a little bit by mentioning names here instead of just the electorate. There will be a few more of those as running in the lead-up to the next election. For example, we are going to see the big screen and the smiling face of the current member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) with a voice-over saying, 'Did you vote for Telstra to be sold off? No? Well, Joanna Gash did. Did you vote for a reduction in service quality of your telephone service? No? Well, Joanna Gash did.' Members opposite will be held accountable for their vote on this legislation, let there be no doubt about that. The sale of Telstra will deliver no national benefit. It will have a negative impact on both public finances and the quality and price of telecommunications services to residential customers. Of particular concern is the downgrading of this parliament's support for and commitment to providing a universal service for all Australians. Until the introduction of the legislation, it did not matter where you lived. All Australians, be they in the cities, the bush or the provincial centres, were treated the same in the provision of basic telephone services. This universal service was covered by the adherence to universal rental charges, universal installation costs, universal call rates, universal service charges and universal untimed local calls. But by passing this Telstra privatisation legislation this parliament is downgrading that long standing commitment. The commitment is downgraded by these words on page 48 of the bill: (1) The Parliament re-affirms its intention: (b) that the universal service obligation described in section 288 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 should be fulfilled as efficiently and economically as practicable... With the addition of these words to the Telecommunications Act 1991 it is clear that the universal service obligations of Telstra will be linked to the definition of efficiency and economical. We on this side oppose this qualification in the legislation. The universal service obligation, which this parliament is committed to, does not specify a qualification in the provision of this service. There is no choice. It is a condition to be fulfilled-no ifs, no buts, no maybes. That is the way it should remain. We oppose private owners and foreign owners of Telstra being given the opportunity to ignore the universal service obligations. It is simply not good enough for these people, in the overall assessment, to declare that the universal service obligation is not, in the words of the bill, efficient and economical. As a result, they will not fund it. The provisions on page 48 of the bill allow the private and foreign owners of Telstra to do that. It is a provision which should not stand and will not stand, or we will not accept it on this side of the House. The universal service obligations of Telstra should not be linked to pure financial considerations, especially not in a land which is so diverse and which has population centres in the bush, the provincial centres and the cities. By linking efficiency and economics to Telstra's universal service obligations, the legislation allows private owners and foreign investors to also downgrade their commitment to the people in rural and regional Australia. Debate interrupted. NA",128
252,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being 7.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Paedophilia  I want to speak about paedophiles, but firstly I want to say that I think all members support the initiatives for a national approach to child abuse announced by Minister Moylan and that it would have bipartisan support. But I believe that if you have a national approach to this subject, you cannot quarantine the department of immigration's involvement. Last year, as the chainnan of the Human Rights Subcommittee, I wrote to then Minister Bolkus asking specifically what protection was offered for overseas children who were sponsored to Australia to undertake studies at schools, boarding schools and TAFEs. I got a response that I was disappointed with. Basically, the department is saying that they only have to satisfy themselves about the bone fides of the student status of those children. I believe that advice proffered to the then minister-I have also written to Minister Ruddock-is seriously flawed. The Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act 1946 is stilI in force. Section 6 states: The Minister shall be the guardian of the person, and of the estate in Australia, of every non-citizen child who arrives in Australia after the commencement of this Act to the exclusion of the father and mother and every other guardian of the child, and shall have, as guardian, the same rights, powers, duties, obligations and liabilities as a natural guardian of the child would have, until the child reaches the age of 18 years or leaves Australia permanently, or until provisions of this Act cease to apply to and in relation to the child, whichever first happens. The department is suggesting that subsection 4AA(l) negates this overall responsibility that the minister directly has. But I contend on reading it-I have had it subsequently confinned-that it only limits the minister's powers in relation to children who are intended to become pennanent residents of this country. It is not good enough for the minister and the department to say that they have no direct responsibility when the minister himself under this act still in force has sole responsibility in guardianship of all these children. I do not think anyone in this House could be satisfied that the department of immigration will not open its files, will not detect those who are sponsoring multiple students and refuses to have any officers of the department directly investigate cases of paedophilia. I think this is absolutely disgraceful. If the minister or the department has an advice from the Attorney-General suggesting that my interpretation is wrong, then let them table it in this parliament. But let us not walk away from the prime responsibility of the immigration department and the minister. If their interpretation is right, let us put an amendment into the act to delete 4AA(l) so that the original intention of the act, passed in 1946, makes abundantly clear the minister's and the department's direct responsibility for these overseas children who are, as we know through the royal commission inquiry and other things, victims of paedophiles. Indeed, if Australian children are powerless, just imagine how much more powerless poor families from Fiji or India are. I seek leave to table my correspondence to the then minister for immigration, Senator Bolkus, and to Minister Ruddock, and Senator Bolkus's reply. Leave granted. Longman Electorate: Primary Producers",130
253,Mr BROUGH,Unknown,"Longman) (7.34 p.m.)One week ago, last Wednesday, I rose for the first time to speak in this place. In doing so, I brought to the attention of the House the devastating impact the drought had been having on many fanners in Australia, in particular those in my part of the electorate, the Brisbane and Lockyer valleys. Unfortunately, since that time-in fact, within 48 hours of having brought that to the notice of the House-the same people have been inflicted by flood. It certainly shows the vagaries of nature and what can happen. However, there are a few points I would like to bring to the attention of the House. The pictures that came out of this area, Laidley and Esk, were very much of the business community as water entered the main street and took over a couple of hotels, with a couple of feet of water in each one, as well as a few businesses. About 30 houses were also inundated with water. What does not make good pictures is the farming land that has been destroyed and the houses and lives of those people that have been destroyedalong with their incomes for the next six months. I make mention of this because, whilst it is always very difficult for anybody to experience a natural disaster, particularly a flood, the devastating and long-term effects of those that have been affected on the land should never be underestimated. Whilst the pictures on the television showed the hotels with the water on the floor, the fact is that within 24 hours they were trading again and their income was stable. The farmers, on the other hand, having endured five years of drought and having received some rain in January, took the plunge and went beyond any debt regime they had previously run up because they finally did have water. Having looked towards the good times and planting some 9,000 cauliflowers each week-or 12,000 broccoli or whatever else they might have had on their properties-they now find themselves with the whole crop destroyed. The problem they now face, after five years of drought and now with a devastating flood, is that they do not have any income for the next six months. They do not have any other means of relief in the form of loans, even though the state government has come to the party there. If they are to continue on the and continue to be the salad bowl of Brisbane, these two regions of the Brisbane and Lockyer valleys are going to need far greater assistance. I welcome both Mick Veivers, the Minister for Emergency Services in the Queensland state government, and the Premier, Rob Borbidge, going out to the area and offering their support-the area has been declared a natural disaster zone-but it is going to take a lot more than that. I would like to bring to the House's attention one particular example of a family whose son was about to return to the land. That family have been on their property for 70-odd years. The family are broke but, like most of our farming community, will see things through to the bitter end. Unfortunately, tonight-and I have just got off the phone to this family-that family do not know where to tum. Theirs is just one of many properties in the same predicament. I hope that Australia realises that, whilst rain may have a mediumand long-term beneficial effect in these areas, there are many families who have struggled for many years and who are now going to go to the wall. It behoves all of us in this place to be aware of that, and I will certainly be making representations to the appropriate ministers to see what additional actions we can take as a parliament to support the state government in its endeavours. These areas are already beset by extremely high unemployment. They have all the other problems that Australia has endured over the . last 13 years, and now, with these natural disasters, I fear that many of them are not going to be able to continue. I feel it is important that I bring this information to the House's attention. I assure the people in the Brisbane and Lockyer valleys that I will do my absolute best to ensure that this parliament and the state parliament do everything in their power to support them in their greatest hour of need. Canberra: Public Sector Cutbacks",130
254,Ms ELLIS,Unknown,"I rise in this place tonight to express the concerns land of the people of Namadgi and, hence, the people of the Australian Capital Territory. The effects of this government's policies in relation to the public sector are proving disastrous for this territory. Of course, it is not only the ACT that is suffering or that suffer from this. Service delivery and the type of society we want in this country-all of that-are under threat. But,given today's rally by the Public Sector Union outside this place and given that my electorate is in this territory, I want to specifically address the local implications. The effect of these policies on Canberra is dramatic. Forty-eight per cent of our work force is employed in the public sector. That is quite understandable, because Canberra is the national capital. It is the seat of govern the ment. We need to continue to remind ourselves of that. Much has been said by those opposite and their supporters about how we, in putting these facts forward, are talking down Canberra. Nothing could be further from the truth. To say that is to shoot the messenger. The people of the ACT are extremely worried. They are scared and they have little faith in the future. Frankly, most of them today do not know whether they will have a job tomorrow. There is a rather prophetic joke going around this town at the moment and it is this: what is the definition of optimism? A public servant who irons five shirts--or could I say five blouses-on a Sunday night. Their concern is really understandable and should not be disregarded. This government said again and again in the recent election campaign that only 2,500 jobs would be lost through natural attrition-no more-no matter what. During the recent election campaign the former liberal member for Canberra went around this town not only promising a limit on the job cuts but also giving misleading promises and saying that our unemployed youth would have increased opportunity for employment in the public sector. How deceitful-and it is such a vulnerable group to mislead. But he was only saying what he was told to say. I do not really think he believed that propaganda at all. What is going to happen to the young people in the ACT? With the local Liberal government instituting a recruitment freeze and holding to that recruitment freeze in their public sector and the federal Liberal governwill ment cutting jobs and cutting back spending in the IT industry, where are the jobs going to come from? The private sector in the ACT is simply not able to employ all these new job seekers overnight, no matter how genuine their efforts. It would be a very sad day for this city if our kids and families had to start thinking about leaving in order to maintain some sort of economic and employment future. Already in excess of 10,000 job cuts across the public sector have been announced and this is before Audit Commission reports, before the budget and before the Industry Commission's recommendations on privatising and contracting out are announced and enacted. And you wonder why the ACT community is reacting the way it is! Believe me, any trust, any honesty that the other side was claiming can be forgotten. You can give it away. Your gross dishonesty is absolute. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) came in here today and told us in the ACT to calm down, telling us of the successful meeting he had today with the ACT Liberal Chief Minister and ACT business leaders. 'Everything will be okay,' he said. How dare he! Why is it then that the business community is taking out full-page as in the Canberra Times in an attempt to encourage confidence-something I congratulate them for and wish them well with? We in this town have to collectively do all we can in the ACT to counter this government's attack on and disregard for our local community. Uranium mining",131
255,Mr DONDAS,Unknown,"Northern Territory) (7.43 p.m.}--On Monday night the shadow minister for the environment, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), spoke in her contribution to the address-in-reply debate about the opposition to mining at Kakadu. In fact, she spent most of her time allotted for that debate telling us in this House why we should not be mining uranium in Kakadu. To say that where the mines are situated at the moment-the Ranger mine and Koongara, another mine on the labiluka site-are part of the park is like saying that Canberra is part of New South Wales. Talking about the size of the park, I would like to highlight the dismore tance. If you draw a line from Sydney to something Bathurst and then to Newcastle-that is a pretty large area-and visualise that all you are going to mine in that area oval, then any impact on the pristine condition of the park would appear to be unlikely. ERA at Ranger has one of the best environthere mental records in the world in mining opervarious ations. It has a very good record. Since 1979 Aboriginal communities in that area have received nearly $150 million in royalties. the honourable member for Fremantle said that there was no real direct benefit for those communities and that they were very as to whether other mining should take place in that region. I can assure the honourable member for Fremantle that the Northern Land Council and the traditional owners are very interested in having discussions with mining companies about mining in that particular area, provided that stringent environmental controls are put in place and provided the Aboriginal community want mining, and there is no reason why it should not proceed. It seems that mining at Roxby Downs is all right. Even though we have the capacity the Northern Territory for at obviously the other uranium mines were not all right but a political decision was made by the Labor Party to allow the Roxby Downs site to go ahead. This country will need valuable exports because we owe $180 billion. We can create additional resources through exports of uraniindicated, um and other goods. As I said the other day, $1.64 billion worth of exports came out of the Northern Territory in 1994-95, which sents one per cent of the population producing two per cent of the GDP. Jabiluka will be the first site to go ahead, provided the environmental impact statement is approved by the minister. It is an underdescribed ground mine that would not be visible from the road, and there is a 20-kilometre road linking it to the mine at Jabiru. People ing the area would not See that operation; there would be no interference. The honourers able member for Fremantle made the point last night about 30 jobs-I believe there are than 30 jobs in that province-affecting like 5,000 jobs in that area. But the mine site at Jabiluka, with its underground facility and the road into Ranger, will not is one football impact on the area. If you have ever been to Kakadu you would know that the park is quite large and that are very many sites of significance in areas of it. One in particular that the road would go past is Obiri Rock, which is probably one of the best attractions in the Yet park and the one closest to the mine site. Neither I nor some environmentalists believe that mining of uranium in that area will affect divided the park. (Time expired) Election Campaign Material",132
256,Mr FILING,Unknown," Mr Speaker, I was interested in the response the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made last week to comments made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) relating to advertising material circulated in his electorate during the election campaign. The Prime Minister indicated that he had not authorised the use of the words in that material, that he was very angry about it, and that he made those views known into the Western Australian division of the least three mines, Liberal Party. The purpose of my standing this evening is to ask the President of the Western Australian Liberal Party how on earth he can tolerate the blatant fraud perpetrated during the campaign in the seat of Moore. As the Prime Minister there was a clearly misleading use of some of his own words in the advertising material in an attempt to denigrate the candirepredature of the member for Curtin. The member for Curtin and I were both attacked using quite fraudulent or misleading lines about our role in the parliament. That is something an editorial in the West Australian as 'blatantly dishonest'. In my electorate we had the extensive use of pushpolling both before and after the preselection visitfor the Liberal seat of Moore. There was defamation at the doorstop--<:ampaign workgoing to doorstops and making clearly defamatory comments about me, comments that were repeated back to me by the persons concerned who were quite distressed by the behaviour of these people. We had the stealing of signs. In fact, a person charged with stealing my signs was found to be a campaign worker for my Liberal opponent. He was later convicted of the offence and required to pay restitution for the signs that he had damaged when he was stealing them. In the last week of the campaign we had a quite extraordinary event. The candidate was discovered at about 2 o'clock in the morning knocking in signs outside a house in my electorate. He was discovered by a women who was suffering from cancer and who was awoken by this noise in the street. When she went out to complain she was told that he was perfectly within his rights to do so and he carried on knocking them in. I might say that she also commented that several of my signs which had been up when she had gone to bed were then on the ground while his signs were up. I really did not want to dwell on that because what I am really concerned about is the fact that in this campaign there was the use of something which actually breaches the Electoral Act, and that is the production of dirt sheets. Dirt sheets were circulated to every household in the electorate under the title the Moore Report. The first Moore Report was authorised by a person called Glen Crook-interesting name--of 284 Walcott Street, Menora, and printed by Swanweb, 102 Bannister Road, Canning Vale. We could not locate Mr Crook to find out exactly who he was. The document was circulated as purportedly being an independent third party sheet, supposedly informing people about issues in the Moore campaign. It became more interesting when the second edition appeared. The March edition of the Moore Report contained a number of other defamatory comments. It was an interesting one because it purported to be authorised by an M. Nagi of 18 Wallbrook Place, Coodinup. When a staff member from my office went to that address he discovered a resident who said that neither he nor his wife, the only people at that address, had any knowledge of that document. Yet a person named Nagi of that address was supposed to have authorised it. It was printed by Vanguard Press of 26 John Street, in Northbridge. What happened after that was that we made some more inquiries and we discovered that the printer had an order-this is the Vanguard Press-from a company known as Lightning Distributors. They ordered this particular document to be printed at Vanguard Printers. One of the partners in Lightning Distributors-surprise, surprise-is a Simon Ehrenfeld of 70 Bradford Street, Menora. Simon Ehrenfeld happened to be the campaign manager of my opponent. So by a little bit of quite simplistic detective work we discovered that this document, authorised by some unknown person--quite clearly it was not Mr Nagi-was produced by the campaign of my opponent. It was quite clearly a breach of the Electoral Act. I hope that eventually these people will be prosecuted so the clear message is sent to people that these types of dirty tricks will not be tolerated in Australian electoral campaigns. Chernobyl",133
257,Mr ZAMMIT,Unknown,"On 26 April, the day after ANZAC Day, I attended a candle vigil outside State Parliament House in my own right but also representing the Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, organised by the Ukrainian Council of New South Wales. The purpose of this vigil was to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster in which some 200 people died almost immediately and some 2,300 have since died as a result of the radiation. Because no-one really knows what the time frame is for the effects of radiation to appear, it could well be that we will be looking at one of the great catastrophes of mankind. I addressed that meeting that was organised by the Ukrainian Council. It was held on the steps of Parliament House, Sydney. We marched down from there to the Sydney Opera House. It was a very moving ceremony. The organisers got us to stand first of all in a straight line facing the Opera House and there was another row running in an eastwest direction. In fact, we built the cross on the foresteps of the Opera House in Sydney. It was very moving to hear of what has occurred and what is currently occurring. The Ukrainians are in a terrible situation now because they just do not have the money to do the work that needs to be done. They have been left in the terrible position of never being able to resolve their situation without outside help. At the meeting two motions were put. I might just mention that these were two requests made by the Ukrainian Council of New South Wales of the former government which were either rejected or not replied to-I am not quite sure. However, the bottom line is that they were not able to get these requests granted from the former government. The motions were moved and passed unanimously by those present at the candle vigil. I gave them the assurance that I would read the two motions in this House and, in so doing, request the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to give consideration to their requests. The first motion reads: Given the continued suffering of thousands of Ukrainians from the consequences of the Chemobyl nuclear accident, the attendees of the Sydney candle vigil hereby resolve that: The Australian Federal Government grant tax exempt status to donations to the Australian Chernobyl Children's Foundation so that funds can flow freely to the people in need, particularly thousands of children afflicted with aggressive thyroid cancer. The second ,.reads: Given that the Government of independent Ukraine bears the financial legacy of the communist USSR and does not have enough funds to assist victims as well as shut down the remaining Chernobyl reactors, the attendees of the Sydney candle vigil hereby resolve that: The Australian Federal Government make strong and direct representations to all Governments G7 countries to provide humanitarian relief for Chemobyl victims and financial assistance for the plant's final shutdown. I feel very strongly about this because I have read a great deal about the Chernobyl incident. I think that, as a nation .that prides itself on going to the assistance of those who are in desperate and dire need, agreeing to the requests of the Australian Ukrainian Council of New South Wales so it can assist its former homeland and people who are suffering, the likes of which, fortunately, we will never experience, is the least we can do. Holy Family High School, Marayong",134
258,Mr MOSSFIELD,Unknown,"I ani pleased to advise the House that 173 students from one of the many excellent schools in the Greenway electorate have been visiting parliament this week. That school is the Holy Family High School at Marayong. This school has been at Marayong for 28 years. You can get a full appreciation of the huge amount of resources that go into educating our young people when you realise that this school, which has over 720 students, has a teaching staff of 60 and another 17 administrative and support staff. I had the opportunity of meeting four groups from this school at the Parliamentary Education Office today. I would like to compliment the education office on the excellent work it is doing to educate our young citizens in the procedures of parliament. The school certificate results for 1995 were the best results of any group of students from the school for over four years. I am pleased that these results were particularly strong in English and mathematics. I also understand that the results were encouraging throughout the school-leading, hopefully, to a good showing in the 1996 school certificate. A new house system was introduced in 1995 which replaced the four colour houses that I recall applied when I was at school. The houses are now appropriately named Chang, named for Victor Chang, the pioneering heart surgeon; Gould, named for Shane Gould, the Australian olympic swimmer; Bennelong, named for the first Australian of the born person to receive a school education; and Francis, named for. Francis Siedlesha, founder of the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth. I am pleased to advise this parliament that in competing in many activities the results were: Bennelong won the volleyball, Chang won the th-tre sports, Francis won the cross country and, as expected, Gould won the swimming and was the overall winner for 1995. I congratulate all participants. One of the famous ex-students of Holy Family is Elizabeth Ellis, who was part of the Australian netball team that won the 1995 WorId Cup final after beating South Africa in South Africa. Liz was also named player of the match. In 1998, Holy Family will amalgamate with John Paul II to become a single high school with two campuses. St Andrew's College has been suggested as the suggested name for this new college.",135

Of course, this politics after 13 years in the On historical precedent, one has to have if we have reference to the Fraser government to do and to a bit of the history afterwards, relation to areas such as wages and staffing when, after 15 years in the wilderness, we there were going to be similar changes. The minister has a job ahead of him in from that government when similar promises Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey) made reference over the regime that operated in that state. survive the actual government-whether it to have created a 'climate conducive to corruption' after tax evasion or the assistant secretary MAIN COMMITTEE MC663 Wednesday, 8 May 1996 MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity fair to say that you are widely respected in the I wish you the best.
