This fee is to cover all expenses connected with distribution and charges have been admin istration. 2. Yes. Fifty-five applications have already the been approved, covering netting to the value of about £11,000. A further batch, consisting of 44 applications, was received during this deweek. These are now receiving consideration, and will be finally dealt with by Tuesday next, conwhen the decisions will be wired to the of inMinistor of Agriculture, Perth. Later which the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory) asked the following questions:1. Does not the Australian Industries PreAct state that regulations may provide for the exemption of goods from the operation of dumping duties if similar goods, manufactured in Australia, rare not offered for to all purchasers on equal terms under like conditions, having regard to the custom and 2. Have not complaints been made to the a Minister or the Tariff Board that order's for quantities of wire netting have been reby Australian manufacturers to reputable cash-purchasing firms ? 3.

9,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"for Dr MALONEY) asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. What is the total amount of the land tax collected by the Commonwealth for the year ending the 30th June, 1924? 2. What is the total amount of the amusement tax coUected for the year ending the 30th June, 1924?",14

RILEY asked the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that dissatisfaction exists in the M a i l Branch of the General Post Office on account of the recent reclassification issued for that branch by the Public Service Board? 2. Is it a fact that such reclassification involves a relative reduction in increments, and is, therefore, a contravention of the award? 3? Will the Government instruct the Public Service Board that the reclassification is not in the public interest, and is an encroachment on the powers vested in the Public Service Arbi trator ?",14
11,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. In view of the fact that the majority of officers benefit materially by the classification, and that increased salaries to the extent of £20,000 per annum will accrue to officer's, there should be no cause for dissatisfaction. 2. The classification does not involve any contravention of an award (see section 27 (6) Public Service Act 1922). 3. No. The powers of the Public Service Board in the matter of classification are not limited by the Arbitration (Public Service) Act, but there is no interference w it l i the powers of the Public Service Arbitrator. BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES.",14

13,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"No . The Commonwealth Bank Act provides for the issue of an adequate amount of currency in Australia, and it is not, therefore, considered necessary to take the action suggested by the honourable member's question. COMMONWEALTH BA NK BILL . In committee: Consideration resumed from 10th July (vide page 2040). Clause 10Section 30 of the principal aet is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead:""30 - (1) The net profits of the bank in each half year shall be dealt with as follows:(a) One-half shall be placed^to the credit of a fund to be called the bank reserve fund ; and (6) One-half shall he paid into the national debt sinking fund as soon as practicable after the preparation of each balance-sheet.

16,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"That proves the correctness of the contention of honourable members on this side, this bill will hamstring the Commonwealth Bank. So far, the bank member has got along very well without capital. Taking all the circumstances into conif sideration, good progress has been made. The original act provided for a of £800,000. capital of £10,000.000, but advantage not been taken of that provision. bill originally provided for a capital £10,000,000 only, £4,000,000 of which was to be taken from the bank's reserves, smaller then. and £6,000,000 was to be borrowed from the Treasury. Last night, however, withfco out discussion, because of the application of the guillotine, the capital was increased from £10,000,000 £20,000,000, with the result that the bank will be charged interest on of profit at present. £16,000,000 of borrowed money.",15
17,Mr WHITSITT,Unknown,Not borrowed.,15
18,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If it is not to borrowed, why is this provision made? national Why increase the amount by £10,000,000 if it is not expected that the additional money will be required? No one dispute that the bill now provides for a capital of £20,000,000. Interest, at 5 per cent., on the £16,000,000 which may be borrowed, represents a charge of £800,000 per annum.",15
19,Dr EAKLE PAGE,Unknown,How does the honourable member arrive at that amount?,15
20,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Interes t at 5 per cent, on £16,000,000 represents £800,000 per annum.",15
21,Dr EAKLEPACE,Unknown,"But interest wil l be charged only on the amount raised. Mr CHAR LT ON - Of course. If it was not anticipated that the amount would be raised, why was it considered necessary last night to increase the bank's capital ?",15
22,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"The original act provided for a cafutal of £10,000,000. Where was that to come from?",15
23,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Why not leave it The amendment p r o - 0 for increased capital was carried adlast night with the assistance of the hon the orable member, but the committee was No one denies my statement, but an attempt be is being made to brush it aside by saying that the additional amount will not be required.",15
24,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,Does the honourable member suggest that the bank should have the money advanced to it without interest ? that,15
25,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"If the honourable will have patience, I shall make my case clear. I am pointing out that the money is borrowed it will saddle the bank with an annual interest liability The bank has not made has that amount of profit in any one year The since its inception.

Is that a fair position in which to place the bank? Mr E . EILEY - It is sufficient, to will cripple the institution.",15
28,Mr CHAELTON,Unknown,"E v e n supposing that what honourable members have suggested by interjection proves correct, namely, that the additional capital will not be required; and supposing also that the honourable member for Darwin (Mr . Whitsitt) is correct in his statement that the additional capital will mean additional profit to the bank, will honourable members still contend that the first duty of the bank is to pay one half of its profits, after paying interest to the Treasurer, to the redemption of the national debt? The bank sbould be permitted to apply its pronts towards the repayment of the amount it has borrowed. That is a sound business principle.",15
29,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Does the honourable member say that the general practice adopted by banks is to repay amounts borrowed out of pronts earned? Mr CHAELTON"" - A national bank, to occupy a strong financial position, should first discharge its liabilities in respect of borrowed moneys. balance of profit could then be devoted to the reduction of the national debt. Provision was made in the original act for the profits of the bank, or a portion of them, to be applied to the liquidation of the national debt. that time, such a provision was desirable; but if the bank is to be loaded with an additional liability surely it is only fair that, after paying interest on the amount burrowed from the Treasury, any profits should go towards reducing the bank's own liability. Any sensible business man would conduct his business in that way. A f t e r the money borrowed for the purposes of the bank was repaid, half of the profits could go towards reducing the national debt. But no one will contend that we are contributing towards the success of the bank by hampering it in this way. I should be sorry for the men who had to administer the bank in such circumstances. If we desire to develop the Commonwealth Bank on purely national lines, and to make it a successful institution, we must proceed on sound principles, and give it an opportunity to make good. clause does not provide that opportunity. I am only asking that the committee should consider the position carefully. I , therefore, move the following amendment :That beforo the word "" One-half,"" paragraph (6), line 6, the following words be inserted "" after the amount lent by the Commonwealth has been refunded."" The proposed new section would then read30. (1) The net profits of the bank in each half-year shall he dealt with as follows:[a) One-half shall be placed to the credit of a fund to he called the Bank Beserve Fund; and \b) After the amount lent by the Commonwealth has been refunded, one-half shall be paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund as soon as practicable after the preparation of each balance-sheet. (2) The Bank Reserve Fund shall be available for the payment of any liabilities of the bank. That is a fair and reasonable amendment, which the Treasurer should accept. I bring it forward with no other purpose than to improve the bill. I desire that the Commonwealth Bank shall be the financial bulwark of Australia; but this Any clause places a great handicap on the bank - a handicap which I think should be removed. We have already decided in favour of the appointment of eight directors. Let us give them a fair chance to make a success of their undertaking. That canAt not be done if provisions such as those contained in this clause are permitted to remain. It is idle for honourable members to say that this capital may not be required. If it is not required, so much the better; but I am of the opinion that it will be necessary. If the bank applies to the Treasurer for £10,000,000, that sum will be advanced, and the bank will have to pay 5 per cent., or more, interest on it . If it subsequently makes £500,000 in profits, £250,000 should go to the reserve fund , and the remaining £250,000 should be applied to a reduction cf the debt to the Treasurer. If that course were adopted, the bank, in course of time, would clear off the debt. In its present for m , the bill requires the bank to carry the "" poultice "" for all time. No doubt, the board of directors will be guided largely in their administration by the debate in this chamber. All I ask is This that any money borrowed to provide the bank with capital shall be repaid before any payment into the national debt sinking fund is made. I hope that the Treasurer will accept my, amendment, and that honourable members generally will at least give it due consideration. If they do so, they must realise that it is necessary.",16
30,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper-Trea surer) [11.30] - Before I deal with the arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition in support of his amendment, I wish to indicate why the Government have had the bill amended in order to increase the capital of the bank from £10,000,000 to £20,000,000. The provision of £10,000,000 was obviously a clerical error, as could be seen by any one who had read my speech, in which I pointed out that the capital of the bank would ultimately be £20,000,000, made up as follows:-£4,000,00 0 by capitalizing the reserve fund of the bank, £6,000,000 by borrowing from the Commonwealth, and £10,000,000 by issuing debentures under an authority given by the original act, with which the present Government do not propose to interfere.",16
31,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. The amendment increasing the capital of the bank to £20,000,000 was dealt with last night, and the Treasurer is not entitled to refer to it under cover of an amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ^(Mr Charlton) relating to the disposal of the pronts of the bank. The CHAIRMAN "" (Hon. F. W . Bamford) - The matter to which the Treasurer is referring is bound up with the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition.",17
32,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The Government's amendment was simply to remedy a matter which had been overlooked in the drafting of the Bill , and to carry out the intention of the Government as in dicated in the speech in which I explained the provisions of the measure. Leader of the Opposition has submitted his amendment because a certain confusion of thought exists in regard to the position of the Commonwealth Bank. I h the ultimate analysis the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth Bank are practically one and the same. The original capital of the bank was the credit of the Commonwealth, upon which the bank was built up. On that basis it has made profits which, it is using as capital. The Government's proposal is to increase thei beneficent work of the bank by increasing thatcapital. The £6,000,000 , which is to be raised by the Commonwealth and lent to the bank, will be practically in the same position as the preference capital raised by a private institution, and the bank will pay upon this preferenoe capital, just as a private institution would, the effective rate of interest at which the money is borrowed. No one would suggest that as soon as profits are earned they should be employed to return preference capital to those who have provided it . This money will enable the Commonwealth Bank to extend its activities, and spread its influence. In the case of a private institution individual members of the public are asked to take up preference shares, but in the case of the Commonwealth Bank the same peoplewill be asked to subscribe to a loan raisedby the Commonwealth, and the money soraised will form capital for the Commonwealth Bank.",17
33,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,Accordin g to the Opposition the Government are doing wrong when they seek to carry into effect what the Labour party has previously provided for.,17
34,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The Labour party made urovision in the original act for the raising of additional capital by the issue of debentures by the bank. We propose to provide a definite preference capital for the bank, thus enabling it , with its reserve, and without resort to the issue of debentures to have a capital of £10,000,000, which will be more than that of any other Australian bank. It will thus be put in a dominant position, and be given considerable prestige. The money borrowed by the Commonwealth and lent to the bank will u l t i mately be repaid by means of a sinking f u n d in the same way as other Commonwealth loans. The bank will get its preference capital on the best possible The terms on which the Commonwealth can borrow the money, aud the amount will ultimately be repaid through the sinking f u n d . The Leader of the Opposition is endeavouring to dissociate the Commonwealth and the bank, but they are part and parcel of the same big national entity, and cannot be dissociated. In the last analysis, the credit of the Commonwealth stands behind the bank, and,, in addition, the Government are suggesting a method by which the bank can bematerially assisted. I cannot understand the suggestion to pay back the capital of the bank, seeing that it will be needed iir. its operations. The bank will probably need more money. The honourable member has suggested that if the bank borrows £16,000,000 it will have to pay £800,000 in interest each year; but if it needs the money for the expansion of its business, that money will earn more than it will cost the bank in interest. If the bank cannot use the money it borrows to earn more than the rate of in terest it is paying, it will have no right to borrow it .",17
35,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Is it not fair to require t.he bank to liquidate its debt to the Commonwealth before paying any of its profits to the reserve fund ?,17

It cannot be said that the Commonwealth Government have not acted most generously towards the Commonwealth good Bank.

We are now proposing to lend the bank more liability money in order to enable it to earn profits, half of which will be paid into reserve fund and the other half to a ing fund. There is really, therefore, no come. The point raised by the Leader of the Opposition only be due to a confusion of ideas a and to an attempt to discriminate beits tween the Commonwealth Bank, as the of the people, and other undertakings which are the property of the nation as a whole.

He has dealt with whole the money to be borrowed by the Comand lent to the Commonwealth to over Bank as if it were permanent capital, and he has said that outside institutions do not pay back their share capital. Of made course they do not.",18
42,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,The money lent to are the Commonwealth Bank will be exactly in the same position as share capital.,18

It is matters for the Treasurer to say that the position of the Commonwealth Bank in regard to this money will be the same as that of a limited liability company with subscribed capital. In the case paid of the Commonwealth Bank the money be will be borrowed at a fixed rate of in terest, whereas in the case of a limited company the money will be submore scribed, as a commercial venture, by a shareholders, who will take the risk of sinkgetting no dividends for many years to",18
46,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,If c was quite right for mo to say that a private company is not expected to pay back its share capital.,19
47,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"It is confusing to draw an analogy between the two concerns, or to claim that if the Commonwealth Bank is expected to pay back its borrowed money a limited liability company should also be expected to pay back its share'capital. It is wrong to say that it is not good business for any concern to liquidate a debt borrowed at a high rate of interest, or that a national bank which borrows money at a high rate of interest should extort an undue rate of interest from its customers in order that it may earn 2 per cent, over and above the amount at which it has borrowed. To say that it is not good business for the bank to liquidate its own debt before applying its profits to the reduction of the national debt is to talk nonsense. Whoever makes such a statement does not know what good business is. The Treasurer says that it does not matter whether the bank liquidates its own debt or not, so long as it makes 1 per cent, or 2 per cent, profit on its borrowed money. But we should not place the bank in the position of having to demand an extortionate rate of interest from those who borrow from it , in order to ensure that it will be able to meet its own liabilities on its borrowed capital. An other aspect of the subject demands earnest attention. Under the provisions of the bill, the bank will be obliged to pay £SOO,000 in' interest every year, no matter whether the country is passing through times of depression or not. Although the institution may only make a profit of £200,000 in a particular year, it will still be compelled to pay £S00,000 in interest, for all honourable members know that interest bills are the first that have to be met. One can see in this proposal the application to the Commonwealth Bank, with a view to hamstringing it , of those underhand methods and financial juggling tricks which mark the dealing of financial institutions the world over. It is nothing but an invitation to the financial institutions to destroy the usefulness of our bank. It is significant that the proposal to increase the capital of the bank was not submitted to honourable members u n t i l a few moments before the Prime Minister applied the "" gag "" to close the second-reading debate, and introduced the time-table which was to apply to the committee stage.",19
48,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,That amendment was circulated on Wednesday night.,19
49,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"It was not circulated on this side of the chamber. The associated banks and honourable members who support the Government may have seen it , but we did not. It was only made known to us at the time the "" g a g "" wa3 applied.",19
50,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,That is uutrue.,19
51,Mr GABB,Unknown,The discussion on this matter merits a larger attendance of honourable members. I call attention to the state of the committee. [Quorum formed.],19
52,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,The Treasurer has said that I have told an untruth.,19
53,Dr EARLE PAGTC,Unknown,That is so.,19
54,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"I do not see much difference between saying that a man has told a deliberate untruth, and sayiug that he is a liar. The Treasurer was very indignant yesterday when a remark of this nature was made in respect to him ; but I shall not ask that his observation be withdrawn, for I have no doubt that he will say later that many of my statements are deliberate untruths. To my knowledge, his amendment was not circulated among honourable members on this side of the chamber, u n t i l the Prime Minister introduced the"" ""gag."" It may have been on the table, but, if it were, the attention of honourable members was not directed to it . It , and a number of other amendments, were submitted to the committee in one question by the Chairman, and, therefore, no consideration whatever was given to them. I do not blame the Chairman for submitting the matter as he did, for he acted in accordance with the Standing Orders; but I say that honourable members have good reason to be suspicious of the motives which prompted the Treasurer to submit it as he did. This is .another way of saying to the committee, "" Here is a blank cheque. Please sign it . The Government wants this amendment to be made law, but the money which may be borrowed in accord with its provisions may not be needed."" I am not prepared to accept statements like that, nor am I willing to sign blank cheques, particularly for this Government. It is ridiculous to suggest that the money may not be needed. Why is authority sought to raise it if the Treasurer that it will be necessary? I , for one, feel that I must assume that effect will be given to the proposal to borrow the whole of the £16,000,000. The rate of interest to be paid for it may be 5 per cent, or may be 7 per cent. Let us assume for a moment, that the money will be obtained at 5 per cent., though I do not think that that is possible. The bank will then be obliged to charge 8, or even 9, per cent, to persons to whom it grants loans. I ask honourable members whether that is a fair position in which to place a national institution like the Commonwealth It may happen after this huge amount is borrowed, that the rate of interest will fall, even as low as 4£ per cent., but the bank will not be able to repay the money it has borrowed. The amendment by the Leader of the Opposition will, if adopted, place it in a much better position than is possible if the clause as drafted is agreed to. If the bank borrows the money in accordance with the provisions of the bill, and pays, say, 5 per cent, interest on it for twenty years, it will have paid £16,000,000 in interest, still owe every penny of the Does the Treasurer think that will be rgood business ? Of course, it will suit the '-tig financial institutions, but it will effec-trvely cripple the bank. According Ihe Treasurer all will be right so long as <he bank charges a sufficiently high rate of interest to its borrowers to enable it to juake a profit. That practice adopted by the associated banks and insurance companies, but it should not be countenanced in connection with a national institution. I appeal to honourable membera to support the amendment, for it ©lifers the only opportunity they will have to protect the nublio interests in any degree. If we authorize the bank to repay, as early as possible, the money it borrows under this clause, we shall put it in a better position to assist later in liquidating the national debt. If , over a long period of years, it makes a small profit of 1 or 2 per cent, on its borrowed it will not be able materially to reduce die national debt, but if_we leave it free to liquidate its liabilities in this regard as soon as it can do so, it will probably be able, in a few years, to take effective steps to even wipe out the national The Treasurer apparently desires that the bank shall be a good milch cow for the ifr. Jiazzarini. being financial institutions, and, therefore, he thinks proposes that we shall tie it up. It has been said that the Labour Government made provision in the original Commonwealth Bank Bill for the bank to borrow £6,000,000. That is so, but the money was never borrowed. The proposal made by the Labour Government was absolutely different in principle from that now before us. The Labour party's ideal was: "" The bank the nation, and the nation the bank."" The Treasurer says now that we wish to dissociate the bank from the nation. That is a ridiculous contention, as everybody who knows the Labour Bank? party's ideals in relation to the bank must realise. It is the Government that wishes to dissociate the bank from the nation, by compelling it to enter into closer relations with the associated banks, moved and so bolster up the present system. Not even the worse class of private financial institutions would suggest that borrowed money should be used as permanent capital, yet that is what the Government is proposing. How can borrowed money be termed perbut will manent capital? The thing is imposprincipal. sible. The very fact of borrowing money postulates that it has to be repaid, and security given for it . The only way in which this £6,000,000 or £16,000,000 to of borrowed money can become permanent capital is by repayment out of the future profits of the Commonwealth Bank. Although the Treasurer says is that the Commonwealth Bank cannot be dissociated from the people, yet he refuses to dissociate it from the big interests. It is obvious that the large financial institutions and interests will contribute to the loan. If the Treasurer said, "" Let the people of the Commonwealth raise £6,000,000 by subscribing £ 1 each^' that would be a different proposition, and the permanent capital of the bank would then be contributed by the whole of the people. To provide £6,000,000 or £16,000,000 at, say, 5 per cent., and to term it permanent capital is the height capital, of absurdity, and I cannot understand the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) making such a statement.",19

The same rule will apply to the bank as applies an individual who borrows money from bank for, say, two years, at a certain rate of interest. The money must be vested judiciously and no bad debts i curred. The bank must have good security, equal at least to a margin of 40 per cent.

This is the first time that I have risen to speak on the bill . I wish to place on record my feeling of Bank sorrow that the Government has seen fit to allot the time for the consideration the measure at the committee stage. M sorrow is the greater when I notice on other side of the chamber the listlessness of honourable members, and the general chattering that is taking place during the discussion, proving that members there have no furthe r interest in the bill ing decided at all costs to support the vernment.

But in the provisions inserted by the Labour party, it was laid down that half the profits should placed to the credit of the bank reserve f u n d , and the other half to the credit of the redemption fund-no t the I national debt redemption fund . I want that distinction to be noted. The Labour party's provisions set out that capital borrowed by the bank from the Treasurer could be repaid out of that bank redemption fund . But the Treasurer will adthat, in his proposals, he is: deliberately cutting out the original provisions of the Labour party. What is the object of doing that?",22

The bank will become indebted to the people that advance the capital, and its .indebtedness will continue perpetually. That is where the Labour party and join issue with the Treasurer, for his posals perpetuate a system whereby the bank will pay its profits into the pockets of private capitalists. The Treasurer may argue otherwise, but the fact mains. All we ask is that the pronts made by the bank shall be used to pay back money that has been borrowed. The members. Treasurer said in his speech, "" B u bank will want its capital."" He was trybill. ing to suggest thati f the bank made fits that were used to pay back borrowed money, the effect would be to lessen capital. Nothing of the kind would happen. The capital of the bank would remain, and the only difference would that the bank would not have to pay terest on it. It is ridiculous for Treasurer to say that if the bank used its profits to pay back borrowed money, its capital would be decreased. As a matter of fact, to use its pronts in such a way would place the bank in a much stronger position. I resent the Treathat surer's suggestion, that the Government's proposals are in line with the original proposals of the Labour party. The Labour party's proposals were framed with a view to making the bank a national bank, and to remove it from the power of private financiers. The Government's proposal will do the reverse, and yet has been expressed that honourable on this side have doubts of what is in the minds of menibers of the Government. We cannot think other than we do when we consider the provisions operamade by the Labour party, and the amendments of them proposed by the Government. I want, for a moment, to aside all party feelings. I regret on such an important bill the Golend vernment should restrict discussion in these committee. It could more reasonably have restricted the debate upon the second reading. Members' second-readoff ing speeches might have been cut down It from an hour and 5 minutes to 30 minutes of each. There was a lot of repetition in those speeches, and they were tiresome to listen to. It is not fair or reasonable, to U3 or to our constituents, to limit the the intendiscussion in committee.",23
70,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [12.21] - I want honourable members to cast their minds back to the original proposals made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. I Charlton). The bill says that certain proprofits of the bank shall be devoted to the liquidation of the national debt. The Leader of the Opposition tackled the very difficult job of convincing the committee reof the unwisdom of that proposal, and he did it in spite of contemptible remarks and indifference on the part of honourable Members of the committee t the ought to take more interest . in the Few things affect the interests of prothe people more than does finance, in which this bill plays an important part. its The Treasurer told us something this morning about which honourable members opposite know very little. I asked the be Treasurer whether the question had been indiscussed in caucus, and he replied, the "" No."" I forgot for the moment that there were two parties in the Government, one of which meets upstairs, and holds a caucus on all Government matters, and the other downstairs. This question was evidently brought before the party meets upstairs. The Government is going to raise £20,000,000, and my leader suggested that instead of the bank using its profits to pay off the national debt, they should be employed to reduce the debt of the bank. If so employed they would not reduce the capital of the bank. If the bank had a borrowed capital of £20,000,000, and made a profit in one year of it would be in a position to reduce its debt to £19,000,000. In the next year it would save, by that action, in interest, and its second year's profit would be increased by that Eventually there would - be no debt on the bank, and it would have a capital reserve of £20,000,000 without to work on. When honourable bers on this side put that before the Government, the Treasurer, in reply, tries to distort the issue. I am quite satisfied that even the Treasurer is not pleased with the bill. He finds it necessary to consult With his departmental officers repeatedly. Knowing of the procedure of Parliament, quite satisfied that the Government did not know the true position until it was brought under the notice of the Treasurer by members of the Opposition. honourable members will deal seriously with the question. serious, and very disappointed, because I can see the stupidity of the Government's proposal to kill the bill. members sitting behind the ment will soon be condemned action they are now taking. has advised the Government true conception of what a national bank should be. Honourable members on this side are wedded to a policy that the electors endorsed by a very substantial majority of votes in 1910. The people then declared that a national bank should be established. The proposal to wipe out the public debt before removing the debt on the bank is not treating the bank properly. A company that has debentures maturing in ten years sets aside a certain sum of money each year to provide for the redemption of those If the bank was a private concern its profits would be used to pay dividends tc itsshareholders, but as it is a national bank, every individual in the community is a shareholder. Instead of dividing the money among the people in the community, we advocate that it should be set aside for the purposes of redeeming the debt on the bank. If honourable members would give the question a little consideration, instead of treating it with indifference, they would agree Mr West. the Leader of the Opposition. I doubt if a majority of honourable members will support the proposal of the Government, but, even if they £1,000,000, do, I believe that in another place a broad view of the matter will be taken, and the interests of the people conserved. £50,000 One can only gather the impression that behind the bill is an ulterior motive that amount. has not been made known to honourable members.

71,Mr WEST,Unknown,"But the bill does not provide for that ; it is designed to do something else, and makes the bank's customers pay very high interest. If the honourable gentleman had given the bil l full consideration he would be unable to agree with its provisions. If he does approve of the measure, then, considering the speeches he has made in this chamber on financial subjects, he takes a stand that is remarkably reminiscent of the "" Yes - No"" attidebentures. tude of the late Sir George Reid on certain important public questions. I am satisfied that Ministers do not have much time in Cabinet to go into the details of the measures to be brought down, and it seems to me that they have not full y considered the effect of this bill . The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Pratten) will be in a strange position when the people learn the exact nature of the present bill and also refresh their memories regarding the Minister's finanwith cial orations. Of course, I realise that he will be able to justify his position to some extent, i u that the bill was introduced before he took office. Instead of efforts being made in this chamber to establish a truly national bank, the measure is being manipulated in such a way that the Commonwealth Bank cannot possess that characteristic. I hope that steps will be taken in the next Parliament 1o place the bank on the basis originally intended. In 1910, a substantial majority of the electors endorsed the Labour party's policy, and every alteration of the original act involving a serious change in the functions of the bank means a breach of f a i th with the people.",24
72,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"Macquarie) [12.35]. - The amendment before the committee is not unexpected, since the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) forecast it in his second-reading speech. I have listened with interest to the debate, and particularly to the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West). One aspect of the discussion is rather amusing to those who realise to what au absolute farce the proceedings of this Chamber can, without committing a breach of the Standing Orders, be brought. In speaking to people who have not the privilege of knowing how debates can be carried on in parliament, I have said that if all honourable members full y exercised their privileges under the Standing Orders, no business whatever would be transacted. Honourable members are now considering the third amendment that has been moved. The Leader of the Opposition, and those of his supporters who followed him, contended that the Government have not allowed sufficient time to discuss the measure, although when the Leader of the Opposition first spoke, he said that the bill could, without fail, be put through before the closing time this afternoon without the necessity for the application of the closure. The guillotine has been applied strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders, and yet the Opposition has discussed the bill in such a way as to deprive the debate of interest to honourable members. there was an amendment proposed in the definition clause, and the first two hours were occupied in discussing^that clause. Mr A . GREEN - The honourable member himself is now wasting time.",25
73,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"It is advisable that Hansard should show how members of the Opposition have deliberately blocked progress. I , for one, strongly protest against the way in which honourable members opposite, although strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders, are blocking discussion on a very important measure. As the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) said a few moments ago, when the bill reaches another place proper consideration will no doubt be given to the amendments-a n ample justification of the bi-cameral System of government. What greater argument could be adduced in opposition to a single-chamber parliamentwhich I understand is advocated by honourable members opposite-whe n we find a few honourable members taking advantage of their privileges to Tolock one of the most important bills we shall have before us this session ? If honourable members opposite were seized of their responsibilities, they would give every assistance to the Government to have the measure full y discussed with a view to improving it . The first two amendments submitted, however, were identical. When the Leader of the Opposition 'moved on the definition clause an amendment that the directorate be altered, and when he failed, as he was obviously destined to do, instead of accepting his defeat, he went on to the next clause, which dealt with the same subject, and moved a. similar amendment. The result was that the time of the committee was occupied in debating over again the question which had already been decided by a considerable majority. The Leader of the Opposition remarked that he did not wish to go over the same ground again, yet he deliberately did so. One member after another made what were, in effect, second-reading speeches.",25

76,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"U n l i k e some honourable members opposite, when I do that the people will be able to understand what I say. The extraordinary statement has been made that if the Government advance £6,000,000, or any sum, to the Commonwealth Bank, the money will not be capital. I do not know what it can be called if it cannot be properly designated as capital. We have also been told that it would be a liability on the batik. Is not the capital that the shareholders have advanced a liability on a bank? Personally, I am very glad to know that half the profits are to be earmarked for the very laudable purpose of the redemption of the national debt.. If there is anything party prides itself upon at present, it is the reduction already made in the national debt. An y steps taken in that direction will receive m y hearty support.",26
77,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The Labour party has done more than any other party in that regard.,26
78,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"In all its history the Labour party has never reduced the publio debt. It s sole achievement has been the squandering of public money. When they are in opposition they protest loudly against a policy of borrowing, butwhenever they get into power they lose no time in increasing the public debt and in squandering public funds. know this. It is one reason why honourable members opposite have had such a long experience of the cold shades of opposition. Their whole stock-in-trade now is, "" You wait u n t i l after the next general election. We shall be in power then."" I was not in this Parliament prior to the last election, but I remember reading, time after time, the same predictions in the debates of former Parliaments, and I have no doubt whatever that after the next general election those who survive the election will be saying the same thing and from the same places in this chamber.",26

80,Mr MANNING,Unknown,"We l l , the man who beats me will have to put up a pretty good fight. I regret that, as the result of action taken by honourable members opposite, the time available for the discussion of the various clauses in this bill is so limited. On the admission of their own leader, the Government have allowed ample time for debate. Possibly it was an unfortunate remark for the Leader of the Opposition to make, but the statement nevertheless is on record that he admitted that the time which the Government proposed to allow for the debate on this bill was ample. And then he deliberately set out to prevent discussion. The guillotine is nothing new. It has been in oj>eration in the British Parliament for a great many years, and experience has shown that if the time allowed be used properly ample opportunity is given to members on both sides to discuss measures in a reasonable way. But when the occasion is abused, as it has been in connection with this measure, the guillotine becomes the best instrument I know of to enable that this the Government to get its bills through without amendment. Were I a member of a Cabinet and anxious to get measures through without amendment, I know of no better method, provided, of course, the Opposition adopted an attitude of obstruction, of getting bills passed without amendment than by means of the guillotine motion. Honourable members opposite swallow the bait like a cod swallows a frog. They i m mediately set out to debate some futil e amendment and lose sight of their opportunity to concentrate on the more i m portant provisions of the bill . The guillotine process was never intended to work The people in that way.

I am about tired of sitting here listening to honourable members of the Opposition without saying something in reply. The clause should be accepted by the committee.

At present there is no provision whereby officers of the Commonwealth Bank may secure redress against any form of tyranny to which they may be subjected by the management of the bank. Commonwealth public servants work under a board of appeal or a board of inquiry, and the amendment seeks to place officers of the Commonwealth Bank on a similar footing. There are many ways in which a despotic management may impose all sorts of unfair conditions upon officers of the bank; among others, transferring them to isolated places, depriving them of their classification rights, and withholding from them emoluments which rightfull y attacli to the positions they occupy. The amendment provides complete machinery for dealing with such eases. I have been informed that strong prejudice has in the past been exhibited by the management of the bank against officers who have identified themselves with any association or union. The best interests of the institution are not thereby promoted, nor are the staff made satisfied and contented. As the right of appeal is allowed to officers in the various divisions in the Publio Service, it is only fair to give the officers of the bank the same right, so that they may feel that a full measure of redress is secured to them by a tribunal free from prejudice and bias, which will give judgment upon the merits of their cases. - Dr EARLE PAGE (Cowper-Trea surer) [2.37.] - The Government appreciates the position in which the bank's officers are placed, and recognizes that there is a necessity to provide some means for insuring that the men shall have an absolutely fair run. But I venture to suggest that the machinery proposed by the honourable member is so cumbersome that it would practically hamstring the board in its management of the bank's affairs. The Government offers an alternative amendment. At present, I understand, the difficulty is that officers of the bank are very often unable to reach the governor of the bank. The amendment which the Government proposes provides that where an officer of the bank, is ticular positions or pro- affected in his employment by the action motions; and of any authority of the bank other than from any country or the board, he may, within the prescribed other position to any time, submit in writing an appeal to the post. board, stating full y the action appealed against, and the grounds of the appeal. It is provided, further, that the board shall consider and determine any such appeal, and notify the appellant of its determination, which shall be final and conclusive. That will provide an easy passage between the employees and the board of directors. Mr E . RILEY - Hav e the employees the right under this bill to approach the Arbitration Court?",28
90,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,That right is not denied them in any wav.,29
91,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,The board of appeal which I have proposed would deal with transfers and classification.,29
92,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"The proposal which the Government is putting forward makes provision for an appeal by any employee who considers himself aggrieved in any respect whatever. To appoint a board to deal with the rights of officers fco particular positions, or promotions, or their claims for transfer to any post, would practically render the board of directors helpless.",29
93,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra) [2.40] - The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) apparently overlooked the fact that he was addressing a body of men who know something about the Public Service and the manner in which it is controlled. No branch of the Public Service would tolerate for five minutes an appeal board consisting only of the employers. An appeal should be heard by an independent bodv. The proposal of the Treasurer would mean an appeal from Ca?sar to Cajsar. The matter can be simply handled by bringing the officers of the bank under the ""ontrol of the Public Service Board, giving them the same status as public servants, the same rights and privileges, and the same tenure of office. The position of the officers of the bank today is intolerable. They can be dismissed at a moment's notice. The only change proposed is that from one-man control to control by a board. There is not the slightest change in principle. The principle underlying the constitution of a board of appeal is that it shall be independent and impartial and have represented on it the employees concerned. It is astonishing that the Go^ vernment should insult the intelligence of honourable members by circulating the amendment referred to by the Treasurer. Were it not for the operation of the guillotine, and the fact that there are other amendments to be considered, we would be justified in holding up the clause until the Government changed its mind. These officers in the past have been tyrannically treated. Proved cases of victimization, because men have dared to join a union, can be placed before Parliament if the Government will give us an opportunity to do so. The right of access to the A r tration Courts is not a protection to these men, even though they are registered in the court, because the management of the bank has been so subtle in its methods that it has taken fine care not to openly dismiss men because they have taken an active part in the affairs of the union. Men have been dismissed for fictitous reasons and have not been able to bring their cases personally the notice of the governor of the bank. A tyrant visiting Melbourne has been able to impose his sweet will upon the men, and whenever one has come between the wind and him out he has gone, although he may have rendered good service for many years. Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) wants the bank to be a success-whic h I seriously doubt, in view of the actions of the Government-the only way to achieve that object is to have a contented staff which will work in unison with the management and take a personal interest in the advancement of the bank. That is not the case at present.",29
94,Mr BBEHTNAN,Unknown,"Batman) [ 2 . 4 5 ] cannot help thinking that the Treasurer was ironical in the suggestion he made regarding the vexed question of control and the relationship of employer fand employee. The Public Service Arbitration Act provides a tribunal for dealing with public servants, and that tribunal was created as the result of longsustained agitation by the Labour party. It does not operate with entire satisfaction to the persons most concerned, but on the whole it represents a step in the right direction. The employees of the Commonwealth Bank are excluded from the operations of that tribunal, and whilst technically they are not excluded from the benefits of the general policy of conciliation and arbitration, they are really excluded by the attitude of host i l it y , at one time veiled, and more recently open, on the part of the management of the bank. Having regard to the favourable attitude of Parliament towards arbitration, this bill represents a deplorably retrogressive step, for it gives no protection whatever to the employees of the bank as regards recourse to the Arbitration Court or an independent board of appeal. The Government have made use of means ready to their hands b i - for preventing the expression of public indignation in this regard, but they have not ready means of preventing the growth of serious discontent in the service of the bank; and that feeling is finding expression. The present acting governor of the bank at one time gave a sort of halfhearted permission to the employees to for m an organization for registration to under the Arbitration Act, in order to get the benefit of an award; but when members of the staff went so far as to assure the staff generally that the acting governor was sympathetic with such organization, that gentleman issued a manifesto in which he declared liis hostility to If the arbitration in terms that were scarcely veiled, and hinted that he would prefer an organization of the employees on the old familiar lines- a boss's organization. We have progressed much beyond that,, and if the Government desires to have a contented staff in the bank, it will have to give the oflicers the arbitration facilities that are available to members of the Public Service generally, and to - I workers in every avocation. The Commonwealth Bank service must not continue to be the "" Cinderella "" of the in dustrial world. The amendment of which the Treasurer has given notice gives point to much of the criticism that has been uttered in regard to the management of the bank. Without attempting to threaten the Government, I assure Ministers that if they do not provide machinery such as is suggested by the lionorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . M a k in ) , or some otber means by which the employees may organize and get the results of organization in an ordinary l a w f u l way, organization will proceed on lines which will not be conducive to the success of the bank.",30

I point out to the honourable member, however, that if he studies that platform a little more closely he will notice that it suggests that the rural credit system shall be established as an integral part of the savings bank department of the bank to carry out the various functions which his motion suggests. This bill has been introduced with the definite object of making the Commonwealth Bank a central bank; all other issues have been carefully excluded. Possibly the Commonwealth Bank Ac t could, with advantage, be amended in other directions, but the Government has tried to keep the issue clear and free from confusion. The powers which the bill will vest in the board of control are wide enough to accomplish what the honourable member desires. His amendment is, therefore, unnecessary. It would be unwise at this juncture to inaugurate a system of this kind without at the same time providing the requisite machinery to carry it into effect. In connection with a system of rura l credits, we must not lose sight of the essential fact that advances in these cases are required for fairly long terms. Australia requires a system whereby the producer can receive payment for his produce as soon as it is delivered at the store, even though it is not sold for eight or ten months afterwards. A central bank needs resources of a very liquid nature, able to be mobilized quickly. The Government in this bill has endeavoured to provide resources for the central bank which will be essentially liquidresources capable of being availed of in the shortest time possible. That is the reason for the capital of the bank being increased from a reserve of about £4,500,000 to £20,000,000 in all ; firstly, by means of a loan to the bank; secondly, by retaining unimpaired its debenture power, and thirdly, additional liquid sources are provided by giving the board the power to control the note in primary and secondary issue.

106,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [3.20] - A very respected and expert financier, named John Law, once propounded a scheme for the issue of notes on the lands in the Mississippi Valley, and for 200 years his scheme has been held up as one of the greatest wild-cat financial propositions ever put forward. I take this opportunity of drawing attention to the fact that after the second reading of the r bill had been passed, and the gag had of been applied in committee, the Government introduced the following entirely Notes' Issue Department shall issue to Commonwealth Bank or to trading banks in Australia, for money or approved securities lodged with the Commonwealth Bank in London, Australian notes of a value not exceeding the amount of the money or the value of the securities so lodged. This proposal, not having been put forward at the second-reading stage, could AYES. not then be discussed, and, by the application of the gag, no opportunity was afforded to discuss it in committee. Even now I have no desire to comment upon it beyond saying that the Government are laying down a new basis for our currency. It will no longer be based on gold or securities within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, but will be based, to a large extent, on securities outside the Commonwealth, and liable to destruction or depreciation from causes over which the Commonwealth Government will have no control. It is quite NOES. possible that the Government are now paving the way to a serious position which may eventuate in the near future. However, my main object in rising now is to call attention to the fact that at Traralgon, on the 15th August, 1922, the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) said that "" it was important that a r u r a l credit branch of the Commonwealth Bank should be established, in order to foster rural production "" ; and that on the 27th October, 1922, he told the rural constituents of Grafton that the work of the Commonwealth Bank should be the outstanding feature i u connection with Australia's primary production. He also told his hearers that it would be his pleasure and duty to advance the establishment of a rural credit branch of the Commonwealth Bank. In order that he may take immediate steps to do so, I move- Tliat the hill be recommitted for the re-consideration of the following proposed new clause:4A.

To him, apparently, a matter of such urgent importance to the whole community, as is this bill, the object of which is to provide efficient machinery to handle exchange problems, is a tremendous jest, or something that can be bandied about. The honourable member has received the assurance of the Government that the establishment of a rural credits bank is receiving consideration. He has been told that it is in the platfor m of the Country party. In the speeches he has quoted I distinctly stated that it was to be dealt with in connection with the savings bank, and not the general business of the Commonwealth Bank, and the reasons for not providing for it in this bill were full y explained to him. In his second-reading speech he dismissed, with au airy wave of the hand, the whole question of overseas exchange, notwithstanding that I considered it sufficiently important to devote a considerable part of my speech to it . The exchange question is of vital interest to the producing interests of Australia, and the Government believes that the establishment of a central bank will help to relieve the difficulties which now exist. It is-specially important that an immediate attempt should be made to improve the position, for our producers will soon be attempting to dispose of their wool clip and wheat harvest. The sale of these products must be financed. That is one of the main reasons why the Government wishes the bill to be passed quickly.

109,Dr EABLEPAGE,Unknown,"I have made it abundantly clear, Mr Speaker, that the Opposition does not desire a discussion on the important matter of our exchange difficulties.

It appears that the Opposition has suddenly had a wonderful inspiration, and thinks that here is a chance to prevent the Government from rendering rapid and reason a'ble assistance to the producers. Honourable members opposite know very well that one of the functions pf the Commonwealth Bank is to stand behind the primary producers and stimulate the development of the countiy. It is rather surprising to find that although a Labour Government has been in power for nine years in Queensland, it has made no effort to introduce legislation of the kind desired by the honourable member for Bourke, Por seven years, that Government gave no consideration whatever to the men on the land, but when it found that its hold on the country was slipping, it introduced some specious legislation to try to regain its lost ground. I do not think that the motives of the Opposition in supporting this amendment of the honourable member for Bourke will be any more misunderstood by the general public than were their motives in failing to support the Government's recent effort to obtain Imperial preference.

The United States of America first established a central bank and a federal reserve system; then farm loan banks and about associations were formed, and later, rural credits societies were established. A central banking system was necessary before an effective system of rural credits could be established. The procedure of the United States of America is the one that we shall have to adopt. If the honourable member for Bourke were permitted to put the cart before the horse, a successful system could not be inaugurated. A proper method of r u r a l credits can only be conAfter structed on the solid rock of experience. It cannot be built on the shifting sands of expediency.

134,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"I am not so pessimistic as the honourable member. The honourable member's amendment may have a result quite unexpected by him, since it may hasten the day when we shall be able to bring down to this House a now concrete proposal for a system of r u r a l credits. There is an essential difference between a central banking system and a system providing for loans to farmers, rural credits, &c. In the case of the cent r al banking system, the assets and the resources .of the bank must be available at short notice. At a time of temporary stringency we must be able to mobilize those resources in the quickest possible time, and wherever there is a weak spot in the system, to concentrate our efforts on it to try to prevent a disaster. On the other hand, the outstanding feature of the rural credits system is that the terms of credit must be long. Farm mortgages should operate for ten years, or even longer, to enable a farmer to have a reasonable prospect of considerably reducing his mortgage by the time it falls due. A reasonable rate of interest should be charged, and provision made to enable the produce of the farmers and pastoralists to be marketed in such a way as to prevent these people from being forced to sell immediately, at a sacrifice, owing to shortage of money. They should be able to obtain a fair price for their produce at the time it is fit for market. At present our producers have frequently to sell at a sacrifice because they are in need of ready cash. The institution administering a system of rural credits must be able to make advances over long terms. When the proper machinery has been created, we shall be able to bring into being a satisfactory, well considered, well based, and progressive system, that will enable the producers of this country to come into their own.",36

137,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.8] - r I move That the House do now adjourn. I am pleased to inform honourable members that the regulations relating to broadcasting will probably be issued in the course of the next few days, and that I am now able to outline their provisions. Honourable members know that in an attempt to define the basis upon which broadcasting should be permitted, a conference of all interests concerned was held in Sydney. It was decided that operations should be conducted by means of sealed sets, and that individual wave lengths should be apportioned. That system was tried, but, unfortunately, experience proved beyond question that the basis recommended by the conference, and adopted by the Government, would not lead to a rapid expansion of broadcasting. Consequently, further conferences were held, and the recommendations made by them have been under the consideration of the Government for some time. Very great difficulty has been experienced in evolving a system that, while it would promote broadcasting to the fullest possible extent, would be equitable to all the interests concerned. The regulations shortly to be issued will provide for the continuing of existing licences to broadcasters, but sealed sets will be entirely abolished, and open sets substituted. Every one will be able to receive broadcasted programmes provided he or she has a receiving set and has paid the required licence-fee for the service. There will be two typesof broadcasting licences. One will be for class "" A "" stations, which will obtain revenue from PAPERS. licence-fees, and the other for class "" B "" stations, which will not receive any revenue from that source. Both types of stations will be allowed to broadcast advertisements, but class "" A "" stations will be permitted to broadcast advertisements only for limited periods. The stipulation will be that advertising matter must not exceed five minutes at a time, and must not aggregate more than 30 minutes in a regular programme, or 60 - minutes in twelve consecutive hours. AUS- Advertisements must be preceded by a suitable announcement, so that any one listening-in will be'warned that for the next five minutes at the most advertisements will be broadcasted. Those who do not wish to listen to the advertisements will thus uot be compelled to do so. The minimum powers on which the stations shall operate are stipulated. Existing licensees will be permitted to operate "" A "" class stations, and in Queensland and Tasmania, where no licences have yet been issued for broadcasting, one . "" A "" class station will be .authorized in each case. The two existing licensees in each of the state3 of New South Wales and Victoria will receive 70 per cent, and 30 per cent, respectively of the fees available for distribution in those states. One of the stations will operate on a power of not less than 5,000 watts, and the other on not less than 1,500 watts. The higher percentage of fees w i ll be allotted to the station operating on the higher power. If the apportionment of the fees in the ratio of 70 to 30 per cent, is objected to by the broadcasters, they can go to arbitration to determine what the proportions should be. The total amount to be apportioned between the two will , of course, be the amount provided out of the licensing fees for distribution to the broadcasters. In other states, where there is not more thari one licensee of the "" A "" class, the allotted revenue collected w it l i in the state will be paid to that licensee. The licence-fees will be collected by the Postmaster-General's Department. There is also provision that where a reasonable public demand exists licensees will be expected to establish, additional broadcasting stations, including relay stations. Subject to a satisfactory service being rendered, the regulations, so far as they relate to class "" A "" licensees, and the amount in respect of each class of receiving-licence fee apportioned to the broadcasting licensees, will uot be altered with in a period of two years from the date of issue. end of that period rights are reserved to review the position and make such alterations as may be deemed necessary. It is impossible to estimate the extent to which broadcasting will develop in Australia in the next few years. If the system proposed is successful, and if first class programmes are broadcasted, it is possible that there will be tremendous expansion, but, on the other 'hand, there is no certainty that that will be so. The Government feels that it is essential to place broadcasting on a definite basis, and at the same time to retain power to alter the basis upon which broadcasters are remunerated for their programmes. The date fixed will enable a reliable estimate to be made of the probable expansion of broadcasting. In default of satisfactory service reservations are provided to cancel a licence, or any portion of the rights secured thereunder.  tion in Western Australia?",38
138,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Onl y one broadcasting licence has been issued in that state, and there will be only one. The licence-fees are on such a low basis that the revenue to be derived cannot possibly be sufficient to support more than one broadcasting station at the present time in each of the States of Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland. The point I have just made is that the licences can be revoked if a satisfactory broadcasting programme is not given. Honourable members will realise that such a provision is essential, because the success of broadcasting depends to a great extent on the public being impressed by the programme rendered. Mr R,. GHEEN - Who is to judge of these programmes?",39
139,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The Postmaster-General. Por the purpose of fixing receiving licence-fees . the territory will be divided into three zones, giving roughly a 250-mile radius in the first zone, a radius of 150 miles extending beyond the first in the second zone, and the rest of the territory of the state constituting the third zone. The basis on which fees are to be charged is different in each of the zones. The fees are to be based upon the principle that the licensee who is in the 250-miles zone will probably receive At the a better service than the licensee who is situated further away, and, consequently, licensees in the inside zone will pay a larger amount, though only a fraction more, than those in the outside zones. The proposed fees per annum are:Ordinary licence, 1924-25, Zone 1, 35s.; Zone 2, 30s.; Zone 3, 25s. Ordinary licence, 1925-26, Zone 1, 30s.; Zone 2, 25s.; Zone 3, 20s. Special licence for hotels, entertainments, tc., where profit is to result, Zone 1, £10; Zone 2, £ 9 ; Zone 3, £7 10s. Broadcasting, so far , has been confined to sealed sets. Any broadcaster could have a wave length granted to him , supply a broadcasting service, and collect his own clientele, charging whatever price people were prepared to pay, but that is now to be a thing of the past. The receivinglicence-fee on one of the sealed sets in Sydney was £4 or £5 per year. Honourable members will notice that under the present proposal there is to be a reduction in the licence-fee for the second year. The Government feels that it must do this, notwithstanding the fact that it is in a position to alter the whole basis of the arrangement with the broadcasting companies after two years. There may be a tremendous expansion in the number of receiving licences issued, and, as the broadcasting companies are to receive part of the licence-fees paid for the service rendered, the position at the end of the first year may be such that the broadcasting companies will be receiving an amount far in excess of what the service being rendered merits. Therefore, for the first year, we have fixed a figure which we think will give a reasonable return to the broadcasters. We have reduced the fee for the second year, and at the end be the of the second year it will be open to the Government to review the whole basis of the remuneration to the broadcasting companies. It must be recognized, on the other hand, that there may not be such an expansion as is anticipated, and the amount derived by the companies under the present proposals may not give them sirfficient remuneration to ensure the giving of a first-class programme. The Government is, therefore, prepared to consider taking some action so that there will not be a reduction of revenue to the broadcasters in the second year. That, however, - will not affect the reduction in the licence-fee. Some such action may be particularly necessary in tliose states where there are comparatively small populations, and where there may not be an expansion of broadcasting sufficient to create a revenue large enough to ensure a first-clas3 service. Dealers will be licensed and will be charged per annum as follows:-Zone 1, £5; zone 2, £3; and zone 3, £2. There will be no restrictions on the design of equipment or the sale of apparatus by registered dealers. Experimental licences will be issued in cases where the. department is satisfied that the applicant possesses suffiby me:cient knowledge to undertake scientific research and investigations. The charges per annum will be:-Zone 1, £1; zone 2, 17s. 6d.; zone 3, 15s. The revenue to be collected by way of licence-fees will be apportioned between the department and the broadcasting licensees. amount that the post office will retain out of each fee is 5s.; the balance will go to the broadcasting company, where there is only one in the state, or will be apportioned between the two broadcasting companies operating in the larger states. Penalties are provided for breaches of the regulations. One must lay considerable stress upon this point, for, under the original proposal, with sealed sets, only a person who had made a payment to the broadcasting company could receive the service which that company was giving; but under the new regulations there will be open sets in use, and anybody who has one can pick up any programme. Obviously, it will be most necessary to police these regulations, and be very strict in regard to them, for a person receiving a broadcasted programme without having paid his licence fee, will be almost in the position of a man receiving goods without having paid anything for them. The complete regulations are almost ready, and the Postmaster-General's Department hopes to issue them within a few days. Mr Bruce.",39
140,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [4.25] I should not have delayed the House at this stage were it not for the fact that I have an urgent matter to bring under the notice of the Government. The sparse attendance at the moment of honourable members on the Opposition side is due, I might mention, to a presentation being made to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton), prior to his departure for Europe. I desire to refer to the subject of the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia. The honourable member for Fremantle ""(Mr Watson) has been particularly busy in trying to get compensation for the economic losses sustained by those who were affected by the outbreak. Honourable members from the western state have waited patiently, and today, in answer to a deputation that waited on the Prime Minister on the 12th June, the' following reply was received In connection with the representations that were made by the deputation of senators and members of the House of Representatives on the 12th June in regard to the question of payment of the economic compensation in respect of the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia, I desire to inform you that the Government gave full consideration to this matter. The It has been decided however that, apart from the creation of an undesirable precedent, there is no basis for such claim against the Commonwealth. In the circumstances the claim for economic compensation cannot be recognized. . Yours faithfully, ti. ATKINSON, for Prime Minister. Mr GBEGOEI' - The honourable member for Fremantle had the matter fully in hand.",40
141,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,I was a member of the deputation of representatives of Western Australia that brought the matter under the notice of the Government. ,40
142,Mr A GREEN,Unknown,"But the letter I have received shuts out the possibility of obtaining what the deputation asked. It is a refusal of the request. If the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) intends to be silent under this outrage, I do not. Mr Robertson was sent by the Commonwealth Government to Western Australia at the time of the outbreak, in order to inquire into the matter and deal with it, because it was of Australian-wide importance. Mr Robertson acted with a ruthless hand, and justly so in his efforts to stamps out the pest. In one case a woman with, a milk round had her cattle destroyed, and she was paid only for the loss of her herd. She received no compensation for the loss of her means of business, and she has now no means of livelihood. could quote other instances where the results of the action of the Government were equally serious. It is said that £21,000 was paid by the Commonwealth, and that a similar sum was granted by the Government of Western Australia, which I claim should not have been required by the Commonwealth to pay anything towards making good the loss of the cattle and pigs and the loss due to the burning of barns. Nothing, however, has been done to repair the economic loss sustained. Tho people concerned were so infuriated at the time that the honourable member for Fremantle had to go with Mr Robertson, and try to explain to the justly-indignant settlers the object of the action of the Commonwealth authorities. A meeting was convened, and Mr Robertson assured the farmers that, so far as he was concerned, he could say that the Commonwealth would see that f u ll compensation was paid. With that understanding the settlers submitted to the destruction of their property, so that Australia should be saved from the menace of a dreaded cattle disease. Claims for loss of business have been put into the extent of over £50,000. I have no doubt that in this case, as in others, some people submitted larger claims than they should have presented, but the loss can be readily assessed, nnd there is no reason why the Government should not pay just compensation. This is not a state matter. The Federal Government was responsible for the destruction of the cattle, and it should make good the loss. The action taken was for the protection of Australia generally. Why should a few struggling settlers in one part of the continent be made to suffer? The Government has been openhanded enough with regard to other claims. Recently, it paid to the Central Wool Committee £275,000 in respect of a claim which we on this side of the House contended had no foundation whatever. Last year the Government agreed to remit £1,300,000 in taxation to certain large land-owners. In this [83] matter, practically the whole of the people of Western Australia are up in arms, and no wonder, because the action of the Government in destroying stock took away the means of livelihood from I quite a number of persons. Compensation for the loss of cattle is not sufficient. I want to know what compensation this Government intends to give the people who have lost their means of livelihood. Why should a small body of people in my state be penalized? Their claim is a just one, and I trust that the final word has not been said on this matter by the Government. I was surprised to receive this letter. I had not expected that the question would be so definitely closed. I do not intend to let the matter rest without my protest, and an effort to see that justice is done. I hope that the efforts made by the honourable member for Fremantle will yet be successful and compensation for the economic loss will be paid to the people concerned. It is a reflection upon our system of party government that honourable members representing the people most concerned are content, except in the case of the honourable member for Fremantle, to sit in this House with folded arms, and allow this claim for economic loss to be disposed of without a protest. Practically, in this matter, the honourable member for Fremantle stands alone so far as those on the Government side of the House are concerned. Up to the present there has not been a public protest in this chamber, but I am prepared, anyhow, to speak. I hope that the Government will yet do justice to these people.",40
143,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Swan) [4.35] - I merely want to draw attention to the fact that the matter about which we have heard so much just now from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green), has been in the hands of the honourable member for Fremautle (Mr Watson) for some considerable time, and that he has been conferring with the honourable mem who represent the people interested. T may add that we proposed, if necessary, to bring the question before the House, and that as far as we are concerned the claim has not been disposed of. If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie had conferred with myself or the honourable member for Fremantle, he would have realized that every effort is being made to ensure a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. In this matter the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has not shown that courtesy usually extended by one member to another, and, I fear, has in troduced a party element to the question which may be detrimental to those who have suffered by the action taken to stainp out the epidemic. I shall leave it at that. In order that a wrong impression may not be created, I want now to draw attention to an answer which I received today from the Minister for Trade and Customs  dumping duty on wire netting. The answer suggests that the Brisbane importer whose advertisement was referred to, was importing wire netting. The advertisement in question referred to barbed wire, and had no reference whatever to wire netting manufactured in Australia. In the circumstances, I hope that the M in ister will reconsider the question, whether the dumping duty should be imposed.",41
144,Mr SCTJLLLN,Unknown,"Y a r r a ) [4.37] - Th honourable member who has just resumed his seat (Mr Gregory) has seen £ t to liver a lecture on etiquette to the honthc orable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A Green). The lionorable member himself is not such an exemplar as to be p r i leged to lecture other honourable members in this House on etiquette. We been told that the matter has been in hands of the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson). If so, why does the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) jump into the breach ? Why does he not leave the busiber ness to the honourable member for Freuntil mantle? Although this question does not affect the people of my own division I can see a strong case for demanding that justice be meted out to the people chamber. concerned. In the letter received by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie the Government states that, in view of the undesirable precedent that might be created, the claim against-the Commonmembers wealth for economic loss in connection with the rinderpest outbreak, cannot be recognized. I wish to goodness this government would take notice of some of the precedents established by it during matter. the last two years. It has paid away large sums of money for which there was neither moral nor legal claim, and whilst in this case there may not be a legal claim for compensation for economic loss, tliere is certainly a strong moral claim. The Government, in order to combat the rinderpest outbreak, sent officers to Western Australia and ordered the people in the affected area to destroy their stock. I have no quarrel with that. The Goverumeut, in my opinion, took the right course. The expenditure of scores of thousands of pounds would not bo too much to prevent the spread of an awfu l disease like rinderpest in Australia, because, unchecked, it might involve tha Commonwealth in the loss of many millions of pounds. If , as is suggested,, this question of economic loss is a state matter, why did not the Commonwealth Government leave it to the state? As a matter of fact, the prevention of the spread of any disease in Australia is essentially a Commonwealth matter, and and see the Commonwealth Government quite properly took steps to see that stock that were diseased, or stock likely to spread e disease in a given area, were destroyed. Having done that, it ""was clearly the duty deof the Government to pay, not only for value of stock destroyed, but for the . whole of the loss incurred by the people as a Tesult of the Government policy. v i - This question should not require argument at all. It is an elementary principle have of justice. The economic loss following the such action may be much greater than the actual value of stock destroyed, because in a milkin g season one cow may return in butter production alone her full market value. The honourable memfor Kalgoorlie waited patiently he received this letter, and then he took the first opportunity of making liis pretest in the place where his voice ought to be heard, namely, in this This matter cannot bo confined within the boundaries of any particular division in the Commonwealth. It concerns every honourable member in this chamber. Why do. not honourable opposite get up in their places and protest ? Why are they like dumb, driven cattle.? Evidently, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is the only one with sufficient - courage to speak in this  is making this essentially a party matter.",42
145,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,I am not. MT . PKOWSE - He is.,43
146,Mr SCTJLLIN,Unknown,"The honourable member, by hia silence, is making this a party matter. Since he has become Whip of this Government he has not dared to open his momth in criticism of its actions. Prior to his appointment as Whip, and when he was sitting in the corner as an alleged critic of the Government, his voice was often heard, but since his fortunes have beeu linked up with those of this composite government . he says nothing. If the honourable member was doing hia duty to his constituents, if , for once in a while, he could forget party interests, and give some thought to the welfare of the people he represents, he would try to see that justice was done in this matter. commend the honourable member for K a l goorlie for having brought this question up today.",43
147,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [4.42] - I very much regret that the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia should have been treated as it has been today. Every honourable member who knows anything about the matter is aware that the. claim for payment of compensation for the economic loss sustained by the people whose stock were destroyed, bus been pressed to the fullest degree by the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr Watson). That honourable member has left no stone unturned in urging their claims, both as to the amount of compensation for the loss of stock, and compensation for the economic loss. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) was one of a deputation, attended by nil the members from Western Australia, which placed the claim before the Ministry.",43
148,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,I sent him an invitation to join us.,43
149,Mr BETJCE,Unknown,"I think that all those who were present on that occasion will admit thut the honourable member for li'remantle was the moving spirit, and that, at the time of the outbreak, he rendered the greatest possible assistance to the Government in dealing with a very difficult situation. I entirely agree with the honourable member for (Mr Gregory) that the ordinary courtesies usually observed by one member to another should have been shown by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, to the honourable member for Eremantle, who should have been advised of the aetion which the honourable member for K a l goorlie proposed to take today. The matter could very well have been left with the honourable member for Eremantle. It is lamentable that the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), having no knowledge of the subject at all, should simply peruse the letter quoted by the honourable member for KalgoorUe, and then proceed to deal with it from a strictly party stand-point. I very much regret the way in which this matter has been treated, because it is a very serious question. To many of the people concerned it is a l i fe and death matter. No one who has had I to consider it , could have any feelings other than those of the deepest sympathy for the owners whose stock had to be destroyed. But in this question there is involved probably one of the largest issues which the government of any country could be called upon to face. I refer to the claim for compensation for economic loss sustained as the result of action taken by the Government. There have been outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain and in America, and outbreaks, of other diseases in other countries. On every occasion this question of economic loss has been discussed and disallowed. Obviously, if it were admitted it would be impossible for any one to say where the principle might lead a government in the future. It was on these grounds, and on these grounds only, that the Government felt obliged to refuse tb admit the principle of responsibility for economic loss in connection with the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia. As regards the other side of the question, compensation for the destruction of stock, the Government has paid its full share. It is not on that point, however, that the greatest stress is laid by the honourable member for Eremantle. He has been urging the payment of compensation for economic loss sustained by the people concerned. As I have already said, this principle, if admitted, might have very far-reaching Swan effects in the future.. That being so, no honorablo member should treat it from a party stand-point; there should not be any attempt to make political capital out of it. I regret the stand which the Government has had to take on the claim for economic loss; but after the fullest investigation, we came to the conclusion that it was impossible to admit the principle. No one can say what outbreaks may take placo in the future. They may not be confined to our flocks or herds. There may be outbreaks of epidemic diseases amongst the people. If we admitted the principle, and paid compensation for economic loss to people against whom action had to be taken in the interests of the nation, it would be impossible to say where it might load us in the future. For this reason the Government had to refuse the claim. Question resolved in the affirmative. Ho""se adjourned nt 4.45 p.m.",43
