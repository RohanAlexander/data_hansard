1,Mr DEPUTY ISPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr. Adermann) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. MALAYA .",10
2,Mr KEON,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement made on Sunday by the head of the Malayan Government, to the effect that Australian troops, who are being sent to that country to protect an area of vital strategic importance to Australia's defence, are welcomed by the Malayan people as a contribution to the protection of their country from Communist aggression and as a bulwark of the very substantial measure of independence they have recently achieved? Is it not a fact that the gentleman who made that statement has recently been overwhelmingly elected, winning 52 out of 53 seats, as a result of the first election held in Malaya since that country was granted self government? If so, will the Prime Minister obtain details of the statement and furnish a copy of it to all members of this Parliament, and to the press, in order that any further statements to the effect that Australian troops are going to Malaya in order to slaughter Asians in the interests of British imperialism, will be branded for what they are, namely, propaganda of the Communist party?",10
3,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The answer to each part of the honourable member's question is ""Yes"". I myself was very interested to read the remarks of the gentleman referred to and, like the honourable member for Yarra, I thought that he would be in a better position to express the opinion of the Malayan people than are some people I have heard here. IMMIGRATION .",10
4,Mr OPPERMAN,Unknown,"Has the Minister - for Immigration had an opportunity to study a report that certain immigrants ""have endeavoured to return to Australia without the usual re-entry permit?",10
5,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Corio is referring to press reports that some immigrants have endeavoured to return to Australia without re-entry permits, I can tell him that some time ago I received a report on this matter from officers of my department and was C. F. then told that, following the discovery, which had been made by omcers of the department, it appeared that some irregularity had been practised by one of the permanent oflicers of the department. As soon as that became evident, the matter was placed in the hands of the Commonwealth investigation service, and a report from that service is now with the Attorney-General's office. I am awaiting a report from that department. I point out that the irregularities related to the issue of re-entry permits for a number of persons who had previously been in Australia, but had returned to their native lands without having secured the normal re-entry permits which should be obtained, in such circumstances. My department has informed me that they were all persons who, under ordinary circumstances, woiild have been entitled to obtain a re-entry permit either here or in the country to which they had returned. The effect of what was done was to shorten considerably the period of delay that otherwise would have occurred. Altogether, approximately twenty cases were involved. I have been informed that only seven of the persons involved have actually returned to Australia, and that action has been taken departmentally to cancel the permits that have been issued to the others. I am sure honourable members will appreciate that, in a department that has had to deal with, perhaps, more than 2,000,000 individual transactions over recent years, an episode of. this kind, however much we may deplore it, it is not as surprising as some might imagine it to be. The record of the department confirms the opinion that has been expressed by honourable members on both sides of the House during the debate on the Estimates. It is a tribute to the efficiency of the officers of the department that only two such cases have come under notice in recent years. SHIPPING FREIGHTS.",10
6,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I direct to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture a question with regard to the recent arrangement whereby the overseas shipping combine has increased its freights by l\ per cent. What will he the estimated additional cost per annum, first, to the primary producers and exporters and, secondly, to the importers and the general public of Australia?",10
7,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I am not equipped at the moment to give an exact answer. The cost to the importers is not covered in the arrangement. The addition to the previous prevailing freight rates in respect of imports is a flat 10 per cent. The increase in relation to exports from Australia will be 7£ per cent., as against a proposed increase of 10 per cent. In proposing that increase, the shipowners declared that their costs justified an eveu higher additional impost. This freight rate arrangement is the normal arrangement that has been negotiated during the term of office of this Government and that of two previous Labour governments between the organized shippers or exporters of Australia and the shipowners.  a substantial impost on our exports.",11
8,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I shall come to that matter. On this occasion, the shippers ditions. asked me, as representing the Government, to aid them in preparing their case. I aided them and, without acting as their agent, conducted negotiations with the shipowners. I was able to obtain the shippers something that they themimport selves could not obtain- a break-down of the proposed increase from 10 per cent, to 7-£ per cent.",11
9,Dr EVATT,Unknown,On exports only.,11
10,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"Yes , on exports. I understand that that break-down will represent a saving to our export indusplant tries of approximately £750,000 a year. On that basis, the total additional cost of the increase of 7§ per cent, will be approximately £2,250,000. As I said, that reduction from 10 per cent, repreexperience, sents a substantial saving. For the matters of policy. purpose of comparison, may I state that the right honourable member for Barton proposed that this Government should take to itself the right to approve freights, as did the South African Government.",11
11,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"Certainly . It should the Commonwealth ships, too.",11
12,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"As a result of the action of the South African Government, shipping freight rates on wool exported from that country have risen by 45 per cent., on refrigerated cargo by 25 per cent., and on dry general cargo by 10 per cent. POSTAL DEPARTMENT.",11
13,Mr FALKINDER,Unknown,"As the Postmaster-General is aware, many non-official postmasters, especially those in outlying country areas, choose that occupation as a permanent livelihood. Will the Minister give consideration to introducing a form of superannuation to meet the needs of postmasters and postmistresses in that category who, after many years of service to the public, have recourse only to the age pension?",11
14,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"The conditions of service and the pay of non-official postmasters and postmistresses are governed by awards. Generally speaking, the considerations to which the honourable member has referred are taken into account in making the awards. I do not think it would be possible for me to give, so to speak, outside consideration to their conOIL FROM COAL.",11
15,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether it is the intenfor tion of the Government to continue to residual oil into this country, in competititon with coal as a source of power, particularly in view of the fact that we could extract oil from our own coal, as other countries are doing? Will the right honourable gentleman give consideration to establishing immediately a in Australia for the extraction of oil from coal, so that we shall not be compelled to import foreign residual oil?",11
16,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"It must be very clear to the honourable member, with his that his question relates to DRIED FRUITS.",11
17,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister acting for the Minister for External Affairs. Will the use honourable gentleman confer with his colleague, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, to see whether dried fruits can be included in shipments to Asian .countries under the Colombo plan?' If this could be arranged, it would not only advertise Australian dried fruits in a hitherto undeveloped market, but it would also provide some assistance to the industry in its present economic difficulties.",11
18,Sir PHILIP MCBRIDE,Unknown,"I shall confer with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture about the suggestion that the honourable gentleman has made, but I should like to point out to him that we have received no requests for such assistance from any country that we are assisting under the Colombo plan. However, I shall have a look at the matter and see whether dried fruits can be included in any shipments sent overseas under the plan. NA CASE.",12
19,Mr EJ HARRINSON,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"Is the Minister for Labour and National Service aware that two of the four judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court appointed to hear the appeal by the Public Service Board against the decision of the Public Service Arbitrator in the I'ublic Service case have been taken ill, and that it is thought that at least one of them will be off duty for a considerable time? Does the Minister know that that is likely to cause great delay in hearing the appeal and to do an injustice to public servants who are expecting rises? Will he say whether something is being done to give effect, one way or the other, to the decision made by the Public Service Arbitrator, and so finalize the appeal that is now before the court?",12
20,Mr HOLT,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,The Attorney-General is giving some attention to the matter raised by the honourable member. We all very much regret the illness which has afflicted at least two members of the bench of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and has had the effect that he has outlined to the House. I hope to be able to give him. some more detailed information later this week about the course of action proposed. DAIRYING .,12
21,Mr JEEF BATE,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"I address another question to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture about the dairying industry. Is it a fact that there had been anxiety in the industry about a temporary fall of prices and that our political opponents had seized the opportunity to attribute the blame for that to a slight reduction of the subsidy paid to the industry ? Did the Minister say then that that position was due, not to the reduction of the subsidy, but to a catastrophic fall of prices overseas? Now that the London prices have recovered and a good result for farmers is forecast, will the Minister say whether it is a fact that the subsidy arrangements are regarded as satisfactory?",12
22,Mr MCEWEN,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"It is quite true that, when the Government announced the guaranteed price this year, which was as had been recommended by the appropriate independent authority, unfortunately some leaders in the dairying industry, misunderstanding the relevant significance of two events, attributed the reduction in the interim payment to dairy-farmers to the reduction in the Government's subsidy, and not, as is the case, to the reduction in overseas values and, even more importantly than that, to the conservative estimates that were made as a result of the absence of a firm contract with the United Kingdom. I am sorry to say that some of those leaders of the dairy industry have not admitted their error, although they now clearly understand the position. The recovery in overseas values for butter and cheese, the better understanding that exists throughout the industry, and the significance of the conservative estimating of the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Equalization Committee Limited, have led dairy-farmers generally, I am sure, to understand that this year they will almost certainly be better off than they were last year. That is a magnificent result at a time when commodity prices generally are on the down grade. STOCK-YARDS AT AERODROMES.",12
23,Mr DUTHIE,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"I preface a question to the Minister for Civil Aviation by stating that, along with some of my colleagues who represent Tasmanian electorates, I have received representations from the Tasmanian Farmers Federation concerning the urgent need for stockholding facilities at some Tasmanian aerodromes, in particular Western Junction airport. Is the Minister aware that in the year ended the 31st May, 1955, approximately 4,000 head of sheep, cattle and horses were handled at the Western Junction airport? Is he also aware that importation of stock diseases has increased because of lack of facilities for handling and inspecting stock? Does he know that most of the imported and exported stock are pure-bred animals, which are used for breeding purposes and are, therefore, very valuable? Will the Minister do all in his power to have modern facilities for handling and inspecting stock provided at Western Junction as soon as possible?",12
24,Mr TOWNLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"I can hardly accept the view that it is the responsibility of the Department of Civil Aviation to provide stock-yards at airports. This matter arose about a year ago, if I remember correctly, when, after examining it thoroughly, we came to the conclusion that there was no reason in the world why local authorities could not build stock-yards next to the aerodrome.",13
25,Mr DUTHIE,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,Is there any land for that?,13
26,Mr TOWNLEY,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"There is plenty of land on both sides of the road in the vicinity of the aerodrome. The job of providing stock-yards at such places is a job for the States and not for the Commonwealth. DEPARTMENT OE WORKS, NORTHERN TERRITORY.",13
27,Mr NELSON,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"Is the Minister for Works able to give the House any information concerning the investigation carried out recently by the Commonwealth investigation service into alleged irregugoods larities in the Department of Works in the Northern Territory? Can the Minister say whether the inquiry has been concluded and what action, if any, is to be taken on the results of that inquiry ?",13
28,Mr KENT HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"I have not yet received a report from the Attorney General's Department on results of the investigation to which the honourable member has referred. I know, however, that the startling allegations that were made in connection .with the alleged irregularities were based largely on hearsay and not on knowledge. I know also that one or two of the architects concerned had been given permission to do outside work, and I have every reason to believe that the report will not contain any startling disclosures. That is advance information which I have received through an indirect channel. As soon as I receive the report I shall let the honourable member know, and if he will come round to see me I shall let him examine the report, although I may not necessarily be able io let him have a copy of it to take away. There will be nothing secret in the report so far as I am concerned. ELECTORAL.",13
29,Mr DALY,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"I ask the Minister for the Interior whether instructions have been given to the Commonwealth Electoral Officer to proceed urgently with the compilation of rolls and with arrangements for an early federal election. If this is a fact, will the Minister confirm or deny the suggestion that the Government has at long last plucked up courage to face the electors in December?",13
30,Mr KENT HUGHES,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"The Government would not need to pluck up any courage to face the electors. The answer to both of the honourable member's questions is "" No "" . I have given no special instructions whatsoever. SHIPPING FREIGHTS.  for Commerce and Agriculture whether he will compile a reasonably accurate estimate of the cost to the nation of the increase of 10 per cent, in freights on brought to Australia, and also the cost of the increase of 7-J per cent, in freight on goods exported from Australia. Will the Minister inform the House also how many ships could be built each year for this nation with the sum represented by these increased shipping freight rates, if the Government had the courage to establish a Commonwealth shipping line?",13
31,Mr MCEWEN,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"I shall be glad to obtain as accurate an estimate as is thought possible by the officials of my department of the amount represented by increased freights on cargoes of modities brought to Australia and also those exported from Australia, on which increased freight rates have already imposed. I am unable to say whether I can relate this estimated cost to of building ships in Australia. It to estimate that if Australian cargo carried outward on ships built tralia at Australian costs, and if seamen on those ships worked 28 hours a week, as Judge Foster says they work on the Australian coast",13
32,Unknown,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"Opposition members interjecting,",14
33,Mr MCEWEN,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,Honourable members opposite do not care for me to speak this way because it exposes the hypocrisy of the Labour party policy. The result would be that outward freight rates would false pretences? be almost double those now paid. PLANT QUARANTINE.,14
34,Mr WENTWORTH,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"My question is this addressed to the Minister for Health. view of the desirability of introducing new species of plants of economic value into Australia, and of the alleged delays that have occurred in connection with quarantine inspection, will the review the conditions of plant quarantine in order to lessen or obviate delay patient beyond what is consistent with the mainhospital tenance of precautions against the introment duction of disease in new varieties plants ?",14
35,Sir EARLE PAGE,PUBLIC SERVICE MARGINS,"The Governbetween ment is eager to introduce into Australia any new varieties of fodder or plants that enforceable. will be of value, but in order to make certain that nothing injurious is brought in, close contact is kept between the quarantine section of the Health Departto ment and its counterpart in other counthe tries with which Australia is closely associated. I will carefully examine honourable member's question with a view to ascertaining whether the quarantine handling of new plants can be expedited. NA BENEFITS.",14
36,Mr ALLAN FRASER,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,"Las t week, I asked the Minister for Health a question about the refusal of the Medical Benefits Fund, New South Wales, to pay agreed tier benefits, in respect of operations, comcontributors who had been patients on in public wards. In his reply the Minister said that the collection of been fees in New South Wales was not legally enforceable against patients that in public wards, but that reply is fair appears to me to be in the same were category as another statement the in Ausrelevance of which was as ""the the flowers that bloom in the spring"". I now ask the Minister specifically whether, for years past, this fund has undertaken to pay benefits in respect of certain contributions. Has it ever mentioned that these payments would be withheld from occupants of public wards? Does this in change which is now made meet with the Minister's approval, and if so, is it not in the category of taking money under",14
37,Sir EARLE PAGE,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,"I am very glad that the honourable gentleman has raised question again because after the quesI n tion he asked the other day I took the trouble to look up the New South Wales act. The relevant section of the Public Hospitals Act, which is under the jurisdiction of the New South Wales Minister Minister for Health, states that 1. No medical practitioner shall charge a who is under treatment by him in a with any fees in respect of the treatunless such patient has heen classified as a private or intermediate patient in of accordance with the regulations. 2. Save in circumstances referred to in sub-section one of this section, no contract a patient and a medical practitioner for payment for such treatment shall be It will be seen from this that it is quite illegal for a doctor to charge a fee to a public-ward patient or for such a patient pay a fee to a doctor. I may say that insurance organizations, the doctors and I , personally, have interviewed the the New South Wales Government and the Minister for Health and have suggested that this anomaly should be removed. Sick people generally insure themselves and are anxious and willing to pay both their hospital and medical fees but are prevented from doing so by this particular act. I have suggested that in order to overcome this anomaly the New South Wales Government should have a new in its hospitals structure. At present to there are three tiers, namely private, intermediate and public. I have suggested that there should be provision for private, intermediate, insured and public wards. That would enable these payments to be made to doctors and the appropriate benefits by the insurance organizations. I assure the honourable member that the present anomalous position is not the fault of the insurance organizations but is entirely the fault of the New South Wales Government. TELEPHONE SERVICES.",14
38,Mr FAIRBAIRN,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,"Can the Postmaster-General inform me whether it is competent for a land-holder, who has given permission to a neighbour to erect a telephone line through his land, to withdraw that permission and require the neighbour to pull down the line and remove the poles? Can the Postal Department be required to remove poles if it is given notice to do so by a land-holder?",15
39,Mr ANTHONY,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,"So far as I am position aware any permission is obtained in ing from the land-holder through whose property the line will go. My underthe standing is that it is a legal and nent arrangement, but I shall find out what the facts are and let the honourable member know. CANBERRA: SENATE COMMITTEE'S REPORT.",15
40,Mr JR FRASER,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,I ask the Prime Minister what action can be taken to bring before this House for debate contents of a report on the development of the National Capital produced recolleagues cently by a select committee of the Senate. Would an effective means be for the right honourable gentleman to table a statement covering the major aspects of the report and to move that it be printed? If this means would be effective will the Minister consider taking such action?,15
41,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,"I regret to say that so far, apart from reading what appeared in the press, I have not had an opportunity of perusing this report. I propose to do so as soon as possible. If the orable member will keep in touch with I shall discuss with him what procedure may bo available to have discussions it in thi? House. DRIE D FRUITS.",15
42,Mr TURNBULL,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,"As an early appreciation by immigrants of our dried fruit3 would probably be the basis of their continued consumption of these valuable products, will the Minister for Immigration make investigations with a view to assuring that an adequate supply of Australian dried vine fruits shall be included in the diet at immigrant hostels?",15
43,Mr HOLT,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,I shall examine the extent to which this important food is included in the diet supplied at the hostels. If an addition can be made within the limitations of the hostels' budget I assure the honourable member that consideration will be given to his suggestion. AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.,15
44,Mr WARD,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,"When did it become apparent to the Prime Minister that the rapid depletion of Australia's overseas financial reserves was creating a serious which, if not dealt with at once, writwould inevitably compel the Government to take drastic corrective action? Was Government aware of this danger permawhen it granted substantial salary increases to top-ranking public servants and members of the judiciary? If so, does the Prime Minister consider such action inconsistent with the Government's present appeal for the exercise of restraint ?",15
45,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL,"Recently I made a statement on the financial and economic the position and an adjournment of the debate was obtained by one of my after the two leaders of the Opposition parties had spoken to it. The matter is still on the notice-paper. I suggest that it is most undesirable to carry on an argument upon it at question time, when it is completely open to the Prime honourable member for East Sydney to take a hand in the debate. NA WAR WIDOWS.",15
46,Mr ANDREWS,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I wish to address my question to the Prime Minister because honit relates to a matter of some urgency. me Is he aware that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Repatriation Act, it is about impossible for war widows and their dependants, though considered to be urgent cases, to gain admission to repatriation general hospitals? As this does not involve a matter of policy, will the Prime Minister take any necessary action to advise the relevant organizations that war widows and their dependants must he given the benefit of a service which now is an established right, and which has special significance in the eases to which I have referred?",15
47,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,The Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation will answer the question.,16
48,Mr FRANCIS,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,I will be very happy to discuss the matter with the Minister for Repatriation at once. If the honourable member can give details of the specific cases that he has in mind we shall both be very happy to examine the matter. DUTCH NEW GUINEA.,16
49,Mr BIRD,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Can the Prime Minister say what attitude Australia's representatives will adopt during the United Nations' debate on the future of West New Guinea? Is it a fact that the Government has decided to urge that that territory be taken under United Nations trusteeship, and that Australia should administer the trusteeship and develop the territory in a way that will run parallel to the development of Papua?",16
50,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The Government's position in relation to West New Guinea has been stated time after time, and it remains unchanged. We shall pursue the same course this time as we have taken on previous occasions. MEAT.  Minister recollect niaking a statement on the 23rd February, 1951",16
51,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"No , I do not.  announced that the Federal Government was examining a plan for CommonwealtlnState co-operative purchase of meat when prices were lowest, and its storage for release when prices were highest and shortages greatest? Did he then say that the Government was gravely concerned at the high cost of meat and had been examining methods of solving the problem? If his recollection of any promises is sufficiently good to enable him to remember this particular one, will he say whether the Government is still gravely concerned at the high cost of meat, which is now much dearer than it was in 1951, and whether he is still examining a plan or plans for Commonwealth-State co-operative purchase of meat so that the people of this meatproducing country may be able to buy it at a lower price than obtains today ?",16
52,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"It will commend itself to the good sense of honourable members, including the honourable member for Burke, but not including whoever wrote the question for him, that I do not remember what I said in February, 1953.",16
53,Mr CURTIN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Does the Prime Minister remember what he said in 1949?,16
54,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I remember that quite well and, oddly enough, I remember quite a few things that I have said about the honourable member for Watson. This is wonderful debating stuff. What did Mr Gladstone say in 1863 ? I do not know. If the honourable member for Burke can get from his informant the text of the speech to which he referred, I shall be glad to have a look at it and tell him whether I made it or not; and if I made it, I will undertake to say that it was jolly good sense. PASSPORTS.",16
55,Mr BRUCE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,I preface a question which I addess to the Minister for Immigration by congratulating the Department of Immigration on its action in discovering that a criminal element in Melbourne was forging return passports for immigrants. Will the Minister instruct immigration oflicers to secure these passports and check them in order to see that they are not given to people who would not be given a passport by the department he in accordance with its checking system ?,16
56,Mr HOLT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"As I previously indicated to the House, the documents in question were not passports. They were re-entry permits. In the case of all but a few people who have already entered Australia by using them, action has been taken to cancel other re-entry permits which have been issued irregularly. The danger to which the honourable member has referred does not arise. WHEAT.",16
57,Mr LUCHETTI,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture been advised that the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, meeting in conference at Toowoomba, Queensland, has decided that the production of wheat should be reduced until the present world surplus is halved? Will the Minister state the attitude of the Government to this proposal ? Is the Minister in a position to inform the House of specific proposals to market Australia's surplus wheat production? Finally, is it a fact that Australia may lose its limited market for flour in Indonesia, due to increased shipping charges ?",17
58,Mr MCEWEN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I have not been advised of the decision to which the honourable member has referred, but I have read in the newspapers that the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, meeting at Toowoomba, by a majority, decided that wheat growing should be restricted. I have also read in the press that the representatives of the two important wheat-growing States of Victoria and South Australia held a contrary point of view. The position is that Australian wheat-growers have not contributed to the great world surplus of wheat. The number of acres planted with wheat in Australia has diminished by comparison with the normal area in pre-war and early war years, so Australia has no moral responsibility for the accumulation of the great surplus. Our area under wheat has been reduced from 14,000,000 acres to about 10,000,000 acres, and it is a combination of the skill of Australian wheat-growers who have used improved techniques, and the occurrence of favourable seasons, that has produced the recent satisfactory, but not recordbreaking, crops. Reference h as been made to the marketing of Australian wheat. I am glad to be able to say that, notwithstanding a tremendous world surplus of wheat, sales of Australian wheat during the current wheat year-and we are within weeks of the end of that yearwill, on present estimates, almost exactly equal last year's crop, which was a very satisfactory crop indeed. That is a pretty good disposal of Australian wheat and only the unhappy occurrence of an adverse season is required to reduce our surpluses to manageable proportions. I have been in touch regarding the circumstances affecting our market in Indonesia. We believe we will, as a result of governmental representations, preserve in full Australia's opportunity of marketing flour in that traditional market. PUBLIC WORKS.",17
59,Mr WEBB,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether it is the intention of the Government to force the States to reduce their public works programmes by 10 per cent? If that is the Government's intention, is it for the purpose of creating a percentage of unemployment, and is this not in line with the statement by the right honourable gentleman during the Fremantle by-election in 1945, that "" There should be a pool of unemployment to discipline the workers "" ?",17
60,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The last statement made by the honourable member is utterly untrue, and I strongly suspect that he knows it.",17
61,Mr WEBB,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"It appears in the Wheatgrower of the 24th April, 1946.",17
62,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I do not care whether it was in the "" Man in the Moon "" ; I did not make any such statement, and you know it. Therefore, having disposed of that piece of fustian  today.",17
63,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"A m I really? If 1I have been prickly to my friend, the honourable member for Lalor, I apologize. I am never prickly to him; but I am always prickly to lies. Therefore, the whole assumption made by the honourable member for Swan falls to the ground. We have no proposal to force State governments to do anything. We have never said that we had any such proposal, and therefore, that statement also is an invention. CONCILIATION COMMISSIONERS.",17
64,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Is the Minister for Labour and National Service satisfied with the way that the amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which his government introduced in 1952 or 1953, giving the right of appeal against decisions of conciliation commissioners, has operated ?",17
65,Mr HOLT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I think that, having gard to the purpose of the appeals sysvented tem, namely, to give some unified membership. approach to large questions of industrial principle, the system has worked well. Indeed, it avoided the danger of a chaotic situation which could otherwise have developed from conflicting decisions given by a number of conciliation commisport Spain's admission. sioners. 1 feel that that view must be shared by the leaders of some of the State governments as well, seeing that the first not China. use made of the appeal procedure was by the Queensland Labour Government. - UNITED NATIONS.",18
66,Sir PHILIP MCBEIDE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Las t week, the Leader of the Opposition asked the Prime Minister to arrange with me to inform the House which countries the Minister for External Affairs favours for admission to the United Nations, as well as the grounds for inclusion of those favoured and the exclusion of those not favoured. I remind the House that, on the 31st August, the Minister for External Affairs said, in reply to a question that was asked the Leader of the Opposition, that Government would support the admission to United Nations membership of sevenAustralian teen applicant countries. These countries are the following:-Albania , Austria, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Ceylon, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Libya, the Mongolian People's public, Nepal, Portugal, and Rumania. At the time that the Minister for External Affairs was speaking, 21 applications admission to the United Nations were outstanding. Among those were four applications which, in our view, hardly be considered at this time because they come from the authorities who are administering parts of two divided countries, namely, Korea and Viet Nam. As far as the other seventeen applications are concerned, the Government believes that these should be supported, in interests of attaining as large a measure as possible of universality of membership of the United Nations. Honourable memibers may have noticed reports within the last few days that .Spain has lodged an application for admission. The vernment hopes that it will be possible to resolve the disagreements within reUnited Nations which have hitherto preprogress towards universality of If agreement can be reached within the United Nations on the application of the principle of universality to Spain, as well as to the other candidates, Australia, in conformity with the policy I have outlined, will sup",18
67,Dr EVATT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,You will admit Spain but,18
68,Sir PHILIP MCBRIDE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,I have mentioned that Spain has applied for membership. China is already a member. PUBLIC WORKS.,18
69,Mr HAMILTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I address a question to the Prime Minister supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for Swan who implied that the Australian Government proposed to the cut down State developmental expenditure by 10 per cent. Is it not a fact that the Western Australian Government last last, year received an advance of £450,000 towards the proposed comprehensive by water scheme, and expended only the £366,000. or £84,000 less than it was granted? Is it not a fact also that the Government proposes to advance Western Australia this year £682,000, an increase of £232,000? If that is so, does that not contradict the suggestion of the honourable member for BeSwan that this Government proposes to cut down expenditure on State works?",18
70,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The fact in relation for to the comprehensive water supply scheme for Western Australia is that the obligation rested on the Australian Gocan vernment to find £2,150,000 out of £4,300,000, which was the estimated cost of the project. Since then, quite recently, the estimated cost of the work has risen to an amount that I do not remember with exactness, but it is something of the the order of £8,500,000. This Government has, in fact, extended its own liability so that it will amount to half of that very much increased sum. Therefore, so far as Western Australia is concerned in its relation to the Commonwealth and Goany complaint it may have about being cut down, it has, in fact, had more and the more money made available to it each year.

Is it a fact that the previous Labour vernment made available an amount of £250,000 per annum for five years to increase the efficiency of the dairying industry, and that this Government has followed a similar course?

81,Mr LEMMON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"St. George) [3.25] My remarks will relate to the Department of Defence Production, with special reference to the item of £6,000,000 which it is proposed to vote this year for the purpose of constructing an ammunition filling station at St. Mary's in the State of New South Wales. In view of the maladministration in relation to the letting of the contract, the bad timing of the proposed construction, the type of contract which the Government is letting, the bad siting of the project, the serious inflationary effect which the undertaking will have on the whole building industry in New South Wales, and the fact that the Australian Government, in going ahead with this expensive project at the same time as it is requesting the States to reduce their overall works programmes by not less than 10 per cent., is not setting a good example to the States, I propose to move that the proposed vote for the Department of Defence Production be reduced. In my opinion, the timing of the commencement of this £23,000,000 project is extremely bad. First, we were told by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) that the chiefs of staff had said that it was necessary to construct this plant. this When, by way of interjection, I asked the right honourable gentleman, "" When did you receive this advice ?"" he did not reply, although he is usually extremely keen to reply to such interjections and answers which will refute the in nuendo contained in them. He was silent because I believe that the advice the chiefs of staff was given to him some four years ago. It will be remembered that it was in 1951 that the Prime Minister came back to this country and said, "" We must be prepared for war in three years "". H is lieutenant, who now sits at the table, the Vice-President of the Council and Minister for Defence Production (Sir Eric Harriston), said, "" Oh, the Prime Minister is wrong. There will be war in two years "". Surely it would be on the advice of the chiefs of staff that the Prime Minister and his lieutenant would tell the people of Australia that they must be prepared and geared for war in a matter of three years. If that were true-and surely these men would not give such advice to the nation if it were not true-and a serious shortage of ammunition filling stations existed in Australia, as the Minister's statement said there was, such advice would have heen tendered at that critical stage. But it is not until now, when world tension is easing, that the Government comes forward, in a great deal of supposed haste, and sets about spending £23,000,000 of the taxpayers' money for the purpose of erecting a filling station which, it says, is necessary because of our commitments and the possibility of Ti-er in the Far East. That was the war for which we were told to prepare in 1951. That is why I say that the timing of this project is bad. In my opinion, it is unnecessary to go ahead with this work, and evidence which has been submitted by the Government itself supports that view. So urgent is this work supposed to be that, on the 15th January last, we learned that the Government had decided to choose Messrs. Stephenson and Turner as architects for the work. Again, so urgent is the work supposed to be, and. of such a serious nature, that tenders were called before the Minister even made his statement to the Parliament. Why? Because he had left a paper lying on his desk for some fifteen days and had forgotten all about it. When I suggested to the Parliament that the Governmeut proposed to pay £1,380,000 in the form of a feeand that was only my own estimate-the Vice-President of the Executive Council laughed at the suggestion. A week later, he said that the sum was £1,250,000. Then, when I said that £1,000,000 was to be paid to a construction firm as a fee, he also laughed that off. Ten days later, be told the House that a fee of £1,000,000 was to be paid. These things became known through the daily newspapers of the country, before a statement concerning them had been made to this Parliament. Therefore, I say that the timing of the project is extremely bad. This work is unnecessary, having regard to the easing of world tension at the present time. The type of contract which the Government proposes to enter into in connection with this project is of the cost plus fixed fee variety. During Worid War II . , we found that millions of pounds of public money were lost because of that kind of contract. During the post-war period, because of the problems of disorganization and the difficulty of getting firm price contracts, we endeavoured to introduce a new form of contract, that of cost plus a fixed fee. There was a tied fee, regardless of the ultimate price of the work. We found that that kind of contract failed also. At that time, we were moving into the field of the firm contract, with simple rise and fall clauses in regard to material or increases of wages made by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. This Government came along and said that that was not a satisfactory system, that it wanted firm price contracts. From the point of view of sound administration, I contend that that is the best type of contract it is possible to get. The business organizations throughout Australia accepted contracts on that basis, but after prices, as they affected industrial contracts, had been steadied down to a degree, the Government decided that it must adopt the most expensive form of contract, thereby opening the gates again to cost plus and all the malpractices which operate in conjunction with it. With cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts, the architects say "" We are not going to pay "", the prime contractors say, "" We are not going to pay"" and ultimately it is the taxpayer who pays. Those people are prepared to enter into sub-contracts with any one who comes along. For instance, if they need 3,000,000 bricks, they are likely to say, "" Forget about the price. It is a cost plus job. Sir Arthur Fadden and the taxpayers are going to pay "". I remind the Vice-President of the Executive Council that within a few miles of St. Mary's there are two large projects which are being carried out at firm prices. I refer to the bomb storage at Klingswood, and the Royal Australian Air Force station at Richmond, where a very large and improved aerodrome is being constructed to take the biggest type of aircraft in operation. The contractors concerned undertook the contracts on a firm basis. The effect of cost-plus contracts is that contractors are able to offer their employees a six-day working week, with time-and-a-half for four hours and double time for an additional four hours. Wages are negotiated, and men are enticed away from the firm price contract jobs. Naturally, men will choose jobs where the wages are higher and the working conditions better. I do not blame them. I would do the same myself. This is the sort of maladministration for which the Government is responsible, because there is no liaison between the departments concerned. When Labour was in oifice, the Defence Department wanted to establish its own works organization with its own costing clerks and quantity surveyors. It wanted to establish a body completely separate from the existing works organization. This policy has been adopted and the Minister for Defence Production has gathered into the department a number of crystal gazers who have university degrees and have never worked in the building industry. He accepts their advice without question, and the taxpayers ultimately foot the bill. The type of contract that has been entered into is bad, and the problems that will flow from the maladministration of this Government will have serious effects upon the general cost structure of the building industry of New South Wales. The St. Mary's project is badly sited. If war or a serious threat of war made it extremely urgent to have a filling factory there, the private enterprises now occupy the former munitions establishment at St. Mary's could be removed and the buildings of the former establishment would be available for use as a filling factory. However, the Government considers it essential to construct another establishment for a filling factory. Why could it not be situated a little farther away from Sydney? Sydney harbour, with its dockyards and the Captain Cook graving dock, is within a few seconds' flying time of St. Mary's. What would be wrong with constructing the filling factory at a place like Glen Davis, where water, power and building materials are readily available and where the maximum degree of natural protection is afforded by the hidden valley in which the town is situated. This project will have an enormous inflationary effect in New South Wales. I have already mentioned the overtime that will be worked upon it mid the problem of the high project award, which will have highly detrimental effects not only on commercial construction, but also on home building, throughout New South Wales. The project is to be completed in two and a half years, according to the Minister's statement. It is proposed to spend £6,000,000 in the first year. That expenditure will absorb physical effort and machinery, concrete, steel, bricks and other materials equivalent to the requirements of 3,000 homes. If the project is to be completed on schedule, £17,000,000 will have to be spent on it in the eighteen months following the end of the first year. The total expenditure over two and a half years will be approximately twice as much as the total estimated expenditure of the New South Wales Housing Commission for the same period. These figures will give honourable members some indication of the total physical effort that will be absorbed if the project is to be completed within the specified time. The Government should set an example to the nation and demonstrate that it believes it is essential to have regard to the overall works programme. If the Government considers it essential for the States to reduce their overall programmes by approximately 10 per cent., it should set the example and hold over for several years the St. Mary's project, which is ill timed and bady conceived and will lead that to malpractices and black-marketing, with serious effects on industry. For the reasons that I have stated, I moveTliat the amount of the vote- "" Department of Defence Production, £11,253,000""-be reduced by f l .",20
82,Sir EBIC HAEEISON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"WentworthVice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [3.40] - I and other honourable members who have sat in this chamber for a long time have listened to many debates and have heard many amendments proposed. But I cannot recall any Opposition amendment based on a case so weak and devoid of a basis in fact as is the amendment proposed by the honourable member for St. George (Mr Lemmon). I expected a slashing attack upon the Department of Defence Production. I have other matters to deal with, and therefore I shall refer only briefly fo several points made by the honourable member. He talked, first, about timing, and argued that four years ago we were told that an establishment such as the St. Mary's filling factory was so urgent that it should be proceeded with immediately. He stated that the Government has only now succeeded in starting the project, and added that he does not think it is worthwhile, and that it is badly timed. If it was necessary four years ago to establish a large ammunition filling factory, how much more important is it today ? I do not admit the point that the honourable member has tried to make. I merely refer to it to demonstrate the complete absurdity of the basis upon which he made his attack. The honourable member for St. George stated also that a contractor's fee of £1,000,000 will be paid. In that connection, the honourable member made in this chamber a statement that might well have cost the taxpayers of Australia almost £385,000 if I had not taken action to nullify the effect of that statement. The honourable member must know that, if he had been able, prior to the calling of tenders, to wring from a responsible Minister the statement that the contractor's fee was estimated at £1,000,000, every tender would have been for £1,000,000 or thereabouts. The honourable member was so neglectful of his responsibilities as a member of this chamber, and as a custodian of the taxpayers' money, that he was prepared, for political advantage, to hold the taxpayers up to ransom for £385,000. The honourable member's remarks will give the committee an idea of his irresponsibility as a member of this chamber. The fact is that the fixed fee is not £1,000,000, but £615,000, which is something rather different. That is why I smiled when I witnessed his futile effort to wring from me some acknowledgment of the amount of a fee, the revelation of which he well knew would vitally affect the interests of the Australian taxpayers. The honourable member made another irresponsible statement about bricks. He stated that the contractors would pay any price brickyards liked to ask for bricks for this cost-plus contract. I have made it perfectly clear that a central control agency will be established not only to govern the purchase of materials. but also to arrange for the free flow of those materials to the project and for all the sub-contracting, so as to ensure that there shall be no unnecessary contracting, no unnecessary additional profits made, and no additional costs incurred by paying more than the market price for materials. The honourable member, as a former Minister for ""Works and Housing, should know that that is the proper procedure. If he does know it, why does he try to gain a political advantage by smearing a project that can only help the defence of this country? It is perfectly true that the established policy of Labour is opposed to Australia's defence interests. Therefore, if the honourable member can destroy the St. Mary's project, he will be acting in accordance with Labour's policy. He thinks any argument is good enough in an effort to destroy a project that is vital to Australia's defence. The honourable member for St. George stated also that the St. Mary's project would attract labour from another defence project at Kingswood. On this subject, I have received a departmental report with respect to the policy agreed to between the Department of Labour and National Service and the Department of Defence Production on the employment of labour. This report states that the present basic. conditions of that policy, which has been endorsed by the inter-departmental committee appointed by Cabinet are, first, that existing award rates will be paid to all employees covered by awards. Where is the incentive for men to leave other jobs in order to gain employment on the St. Mary's project, where the award rates are being observed? The report then statesThe Department of Labour and National Service has made a survey of this matter, and, to date, there has been no abnormal movement of labouT in the district to the project. At the present time, 820 employees are engaged at the site. 350 of these are from the Eildon Dam project. The honourable member has claimed that we are interfering with labour at Kingswood. The report statesThis is not so. About 00 men from the Richmond project have transferred to Utah, but they were being retrenched in any case as the airstrip was completed. The four contractors erecting RAAF. buildings at Kingswood have not lost any men to Utah. The honourable member must be aware of these things; otherwise he has no right to come into this House and make statements regarding the matter.",22
83,Dr EVATT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,May I look at that document?,24
84,Sir EEIOHAEEISON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"No , it is a personal note. If the honourable member for St, George makes such an irresponsible statement in this House, how can he be believed at any time that he launches an attack upon the Government? The honourable member for St. George has said, "" If it is such an important project why not take over the old factory at St. M a r y ' s ? "" The honourable member has a bit both ways, because he says, "" If the Government does not take over the old factory, why does it not build the filling factory somewhere else?"" First, he is in favour of taking over the old St. Mary's factory, which would mean, incidentally, that the thousands of men employed in that old factory area would be thrown out of work, and that the in dustries being carried on there would be thrown into a state of complete chaos. The people conducting their businesses in the old factory area leased those premises from a Labour government, which government gave them a certain security of tenure. Now the honourable member says, "" Toss them out into the street"". But, fearing that that suggestion might cause an unfavorable reaction, he then says, "" If the Government is going to build the filling factory, build it somewhere else "". I want to tell the honourable member, as I have told the House previously, that the Government considered all available sites for the establishment of this filling factory. It is not an explosives factory. It is a filling factory, and there is a great difference between the two. I think the committee should hear something about the St. Mary's filling factory, because there has been some very ill-formed criticism regarding this matter, to which it is necessary for me to reply. It is perfectly true that there has been a substantial increase in the Estimates of the Department of Defence Production. The Estimates total £11,253,000, as compared with actual expenditure last year of £5,228,565. Of course the increase, amounting to £6,025.000, is represented by the provision for the St. Mary's project. I refer to the second phase of the project. There has been some extraordinary criticism of the St. Mary's project, and the plain truth of the matter is that it was necessary to establish. this factory because of the critical deficiency in facilities for the production and filling of basic ammunition, particularly shells, mines, bombs, grenades, detonators, fuses and cartridges. This deficiency is serious. It has been referred to by the Prime M in ister (Mr Menzies) as a matter requiring first priority in our defence programme. When h onorable members realise the seriousness of this deficiency they will agree with the Prime Minister's statement. During World War II . , we had two filling factories, one at Salisbury and one at St. Mary's apart from the parent factory at Maribyrnong. A f t e r the war, the factory at Salibury was transferred to the Long Range Weapons Establishment, and the premises at St. Mary's, in the main, were leased by the Labour Government to persons engaged in in dustry. Every war within my knowledge, and within the knowledge of every member of this House, has been accompanied by charges of serious deficiencies in our munitions. In no war that I know of has ammunition been plentiful enough to satisfy the services. Indeed, only recently, during the Korean war, there was a serious deficiency in ammunition, even that supplied by the United States of America. As a responsible Minister, I am not prepared to allow the continuance of a deficiency in ammunition, because it is so important to this country if we should be called upon to shoulder our responsibilities as a nation. Therefore, I say that this is a matter of an importance that cannot be lightly passed over. The requirements in Australia, at the time of mobilization for a war, will include 10,000 tons of high explosive for filling purposes. That is much less than the weight of the bombs and the containers. I estimate that about 60,000 tons of bombs and containers will pass through this filling factory each year when it is in operation. For the first year of a war AVC will need 17,000 to 18,000 tons of high explosive. At present, we have only the factory at Maribyrnong, which is a general fac* tory and not purely a filling factory. The factory at Maribyrnong is used for making explosives and propellants, as well as for assembly and filling. The filling capacity at that factory is about 4,000 tons a year, but if the table of safe distances was observed I am afraid that we could not get 4,000 tons from that factory. In addition, there are no facilities at Maribyrnong for the filling of aircraft bombs of 500 lb. weight and more, and it is most important that facilities for the filling of those bombs should be provided. Therefore, our deficiency, at the time of mobilization, would be 6,000 tons of explosives, plus the amount required for the filling of aircraft bombs of 500 lb. weight and more. Therefore, at the time of mobilization, we should need a factory much larger than the one at Maribyrnong. For the first year of war, our deficiency would amount to between 13,000 and 14,000 tons, plus the amount required for the aircraft bombs of 500 lb. and more. The capacity at St, Mary's will be about 13,000 to 14,000 tons of explosives, plus the amount required for the aircraft bombs of 500 lb. and more. Even with the factory at St. Mary's in operation, we shall have fulfilled our requirements only from the time of mobilization until the end of the first year of war. Should this country become involved in a war it is quite likely that I shall need another factory of the size of the St. Mary's factory in order to discharge my obligations to the services. It should also be remembered that Australia may well be a source of supply for overseas forces in this area. Honourable members must surely realise that we must have ammunition for our conventional weapons. What is the use of having guns, aeroplanes, rifles, mortars or naval armaments if we have nothing to fire from those conventional armaments? The St. Mary's project is designed to provide the means by which we can use our conventional armaments. There has been much criticism of this project. Only the other day, a statement was published to the effect that the cost would be in the vicinity of £50,000,000, that heavy overtime would be involved, the possibility of irresponsible wage payments should be considered. Nothing is further from the truth. That statement is similar to the one made by the honourable member for St. George, in that it is completely devoid of logic ancl truth. It has been said that the factory will be constructed on a cost-plus basis. The contract is not on a cost-plus basis. It is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, and I have already said that the contractor's fee will be about £615,000. Do honourable members believe that a contractor who can get his fee by finishing the job in eighteen months is going to take five years to complete it? Any honourable member who believes that does not understand business. It is to the contractor's advantage to have the job completed as early as possible, so that he may receive the full benefit of the fee for which he has tendered. There is no basis for the assumption that the total cost will be more than £23,200,000, nor is it a valid assumption that the cost of overtime will be beyond that now provided in the £23,200,000. As for the extravagant wage rate, I have already said that labour will be recruited according to arrangements made between the contractor, the Department of Labour and National Service and the Department of Defence Production and those arrangements have been particularly designed to prevent an inflation of the wage structure. As will be seen, we shall engage labour at the award rates; therefore, the wage structure cannot possibly be inflated. I have already pointed out that we have a central control agency. That agency works under the architect, who takes full responsibility for its cost. It will mean no addition to the cost of the St. Mary's project. The purpose of the Central Control Agency, in collaboration with the Department of Defence Production and with the contracto?', is to ensure that there is a steady flow of materials going through the plant, to see that orders are not placed at excessive cost, to see that sub-contracting is not indulged in unnecessarily, ancl to keep control over whatever costs may be submitted in connection with any small sub-contracting work that may be done. We could not hope for better control than that. It is an arrangement that must tend to keep the cost nf this project down. Then we have also what is called an Engineering Process Study. This has already more than paid for its establishment - It , too, is under the control of the architect, and its job is to design the plant in such a way as to give free movement down the assembly line and cut out unnecessary handling. It will be so designed that the building will be erected around the plant rather than the plant being brought into the building. This Engineerng Process Study is well known throughout the length and breadth of the world, in places where people do not work in a haphazard fashion, as we are apt to do quite often, places where they work according to a complete study of the project and in sueh a way that the machinery can be put in easily and the building itself adapted to the requirements of the particular plant that may be put in. Of the allocation of £6,025,000, I made an allotment of £25,000 for the acquisition of additional land. The object is to preserve the safety table of distances; it may be necessary to take in some small parcel of land. It is true that we own 2,000 acres just north of the old St. Mary's, but we are using that land. That is one of the factors that helped us in reaching our decision, because all the facilities associated with a factory of this nature were there, already supplied. They had been placed there for the old St. Mary's factory. Why should we bother to put in spurs, lines, electricity, water supply, sewerage and the like in some remote out-of-the-way place? If that were done, it might mean the expenditure of an additional £.100,000,000.",24
85,Mr DBAKEFOBD,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,It is badly placed.,26
86,Sir EBIC HABJRISOK,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I point out to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Drakeford) that we explored the possibilities of every available site, and St. Mary's was the one best suited to our purposes. Several questions have been addressed to me by honourable members in this chamber, and while I am on my feet, I shall deal with them. The honourable member for Eremantle (Mr Beazley) asked why the allotments under the control of the Department of Defence Production have fluctuated so much over the past three financial years. The allocations for those years were as follows:Year. Amount. £ 195354 .. .. 6,879,000 195455 4,836,500 195556 .. 10,193,000 Up to the 30th June, 1954, the services were charged with overhead costs in our factories up to 150 per cent. only. Provision was made in our votes for any excess overhead, which totalled approximately £2,000,000 per annum. If this figure is added to the 1954-55 allotment, it will be seen that the figures for 1953-54 and for 1954-55 are practically the same. The increase in 1955-56 is due to the provision of £6,000,000 for the new filling factory at St. Marys. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Luchetti) referred to page 205 of the have printed Estimates and remarked that, whereas provision was made for thirteen cadet draughtsmen in 1954-55, no such provision is being made in this financial year. That is not the case. In 1954-55, provision for cadet draughtsmen was made under Division 174. This year, provision is made under Division 173, in order to group the cadet draughtsmen with other cadets. This very important provision, of course, will be proceeded with. Now, I think I should give some indication of the great job of work that is being done by the Department of Defence Production. Amongst other major provisions for the department is an amount of £1,750,000 for machinery and plant. Last year, actual expenditure under this heading was £1,811,006. This allocation is for the purchase and installation of machinery and plant required for government undertakings and establishments, and for specialized plant for defence projects being undertaken by private firms. The Commonwealth has an investment of more than £50,000,000 in machinery and plant, at replacement value, under the control of the Department of Defence Production. As plant must be maintained, and as obsolescent plant requires to be replaced, that £50,000,000 is the replacement value. The - past year has been one of continuing achievement and expanding activities for the Department of Defence Production. Increasing numbers of Australian-built Avon-Sabre fighters and Canberra jet bombers are being supplied to the Royal Australian A i r Eorce to equip it with the best operational aircraft of their respective types now in quantity production throughout the world. The Australian-designed Jindivi k jet-powered radio-controlled target plane is in quantity production, and has aroused the interest of overseas countries. Indeed, active negotiations are proceeding between the Department of Defence Production and an American aircraft manufacturer with a view to the production of the Jindivi k in the TJnited States of America. We are making the main armaments and the main propulsion gear-cases for our destroyers, and 3,600 horse-power diesel marine engines to power our Australian-built bulk coastal carriers. We have developed, and are now making here, a miniature portable wireless for the Australian Army, for which orders have already been received from the TJnited Kingdom. In respect of munitions, we are producing an American type of smokeless powder, and recently we completed a large-scale order for the TJnited K in gdom on behalf of the Nato countries. The department also produces munitions in satisfaction of orders received from New Zealand. Currently with this, production is either planned, or has commenced, for the latest type of high explosives and propellants, optical munitions, the latest developments in electrical and mechanical fuses, and modem armour-piercing shot. We are now in process of preparing to manufacture at the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, in New South Wales, the Belgian .30 semiautomatic rifle, which has been adopted as the standard rifle by the Allied nations. In this, our pre-production planning is in harmony with that of the TJnited Kingdom and Canada. latter country is converting the metric measurements of components to English standards. Prototype rifles are being produced and tested. Approved drawings will be "" sealed"" by the British Army authorities towards the end of this year, whon tooling arrangements will proceed in Australia. The Department of Defence Production, through its overseas jet representatives, and by its day-today activities, is keeping abreast of latest overseas developments in the aircraft, munitions, chemical and engineering in dustries. In the last financial year, the department either produced or arranged production in industry, for the Australian services, or for overseas and other customers, of goods and equipment to the value of approximately £30,000,000. It is interesting to note, because I have had the question posed to me, that a government should not necessarily do the whole of its munitions production work, but should establish a potential in outside industry so that it can be expanded readily in time of war. That has been the policy of the Department of Defence Production. In order that I may not be misunderstood, I point out that orders fulfilled by industry during 1954-55 for munitions and aircraft for the three services required an expenditure of £15,400,000. This expenditure was in curred over a wide field in industry on such service stores asAmmunition-3-in . rockets, bombs, 40-mm. shells, ammunition boxes and other components, to a value of £1,500,000; Telecommunications-wireles s sets, transceivers, electronic testing equipment, aerial masts, and other components, to a value of £1,160,000; Ordnance and equipment-gu n fire control instruments, gauges, repair and modification of heavy guns, procurement of specialized plant and machine tools, to a value of £1,020,000; Materials-ferrou s and non-ferrous metals, and other miscellaneous materials for the production of service stores, to a value of £140,000: Aircraft-manufacture , repair, and The overhaul of aircraft, engines, ancl airborne equipment generally, to a value of £11,600,000. Approximately 12,500 persons are employed by the Australian aircraft industry, and more than 8,000 are employed by private major contractors to the Department of Defence Production. That is a very proud record, because a potential for expansion has been established. In time of war we could expand this potential to a degree which would supply us with the needs for the defence of our homeland and its people. We have gone further than that, because we have made an investment in industry. We do not allow industry to carry that burden itself. The sum of £6,000,000 is a very conservative estimate of the capital facilities which are made available to industry. We have invested in industry a capital outlay of £6,000,000. Industry brings to bear the "" know h o w "" and carries on the work to the stage where it can very easily expand should the occasion so warrant. That illustrates the difference between this Government, which is concerned with the defence of the country, and the Opposition, which is violently opposed to defence in any form .",26
87,Mr DKAKEFORD,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Nonsense !,28
88,Sir ERIOHARRISON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"That is true. The Opposition moved for a reductaken tion in the proposed vote for defence, cause it considered that we were spending too much. Another amendment has been moved in relation to the proposed vote the Department of Defence Production, which is aimed at destroying an underMary's taking which is of vast importance to country, a job of the highest priority. The amendment was introduced by the honourable member for St. George in endeavour not only to smear it , because that is what he tried to do, but also to destroy it should the amendment be carried. How else can one look at it? It is a continuation of the fixed policy of Labour, which is opposed to defence. History shows that it is opposed to ment. - defence. It was opposed to national service training and the Empire air training scheme. It closed Jervis Bay, sad loss. curtailed training at Duntroon, and wiped out compulsory training. Then honourable members opposite say that their policy is not in opposition to defence. They have a lot to explain. There are several industry advisory - committees associated with the Departregarding ment of Defence Production which are composed of men who are expert in their own lines of business. They have given their services in an honorary capacity the department and to the Government. The Ammunition Industry Advisory Committee, under Sir Frank Perry, and the Weapons Industry Advisory Committee, under Mr H . G. Ferrier, have studied the St. Mary's project and have visited the site. Both committees unanimously endorse the need for the project, the selection of the site, and the arrangements that have already been made. These committees are composed of men of some standing in the community. They know the whole story and they have endorsed the project. I should like to take this opportunity if I may-and it is with great regret that I do so-to inform the House that Mr J. R. Cochrane, who was, in addition to carrying out other duties, general manager of our explosive factory, has passed away. I think that honourable members on both sides of the chamber will agree that in the past few years, he has done a magnificent job, which, because of its difficult and worrying nature, has a very heavy toll of him. The first beof his tasks was the conversion of plant in industry to manufacture sulphuric acid from local materials. Second was for the leadership of the team which, this year, has been engaged upon the St. project. His death is a great loss, the not only to the department, but also to the community generally. I had known the late Mr Cochrane for some years. an I knew of his sterling character and the great work that he had done. I know how he sacrificed his lif e in the interests of this country. Honourable members opposite, who were privileged to know Mr Cochrane when they occupied the treasury bench, will support my stateThe Government extends its deepest sympathy to his wife and family, and commiserates with them in their very",28
89,Mr MAKIN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Sturt ) [4.12] - On behalf of the Opposition I concur with the expressions of sympathy that have just been voiced by the Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production (Sir E r ic Harrison) the late Mr Cochrane. It was my great pleasure to know that gentleman personally and have associations with him during the war period in the Departto ment of Munitions. I endorse the tributes which have been paid by the Minister. In regard to the subject-matter that the Minister has been discussing for the past half-hour, let me say that I shall never cease to wonder how he should rise to his feet and pose as an authority upon war-time production. If any member of a government has a more pathetic record in regard to results achieved than have the right honourable gentleman and those who are associated with him, I should like to know who he is. ""When we came into office in 1941, there was a shortage of every material and every known requirement for the effective defence of this country and for its essential needs. As one who was called to take responsibility and who dealt in particular with the department now administered by the right honourable gentleman, I say that it was quite evident from what I found on taking office that it was a matter of too little too late, and, therefore, for the Minister to pass strictures on honourable members on this side of the chamber is just too ridiculous for words. The records of the Parliament show that in regard to these matters Labour has made a much more valuable contribution to the defence of this country and to meeting urgent defence requirements than has the present Government. It comes with ill grace for the Minister to make such remarks, with the characteristic expressions of extravagance that always seem to mark his words, working himself up into a frenzy in an endeavour to make people think that he has a case to offer and that those who seek to disagree with him are prompted by some ulterior motive. At all times he has sought to defeat the high purposes of honourable members who sit on this side of the chamber. The Vice President of the Executive Council will always be known as one who has failed properly to understand the many problems that have faced Australia in the past, and which face us today. But we have a right to expect such a proper understanding from him. During World War II . , when he was a member of the then Opposition, he made certain statements in the Parliament which called for a most severe rebuke from the then Government because of their irresponsible nature. Although he accused honourable members of the Opposition of being opposed to any plan for the defence of this country, he knows quite well that that is not in accordance with fact, because the record of the Labour party, both in the Parliament and throughout the country, will stand any examination. Nobody can deny the service that that party has given to this country. The war-time Labour government was able to mobilize all this country's resources and was able to defend it to the utmost against a vigorous and menacing enemy. That is something that honourable members on the Government side could not do. Indeed, they were not even able to defend themselves. The Labour party accepted the responsibility of defending Australia, and we successfully governed this country for years during the war. After the war, we carried on in the difficult period of demobilization and transition from war to peace.",28
90,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR, Order l The honourable member sbould now return to the proposed votes at present before the chair.,29
91,Mr MAKIN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The honourable member for St. George has well justified his opposition to the expenditure of about £23,000,000 on a filling factory at St. Mary's. The Government proposes to adopt the cost-plus system in having this factory erected, but even with a fixed fee the cost-plus system may give rise to some unsatisfactory practices by those who are undertaking the work. It is astonishing, after the experiences that we have had with the cost-plus system during the war period, that the Government should be prepared to lay itself open to a repetition of those unfortunate experiences. I cannot understand why the Works Department should not undertake the erection of this particular factory. I understand that we shall be required to pay about £615,000 merely as a fee for this work, and I suggest that that is outrageously excessive. We should save a large proportion of that sum if the work were planned by the Works Department. Under the Government's proposal certain private resources will be withdrawn from the use of the community which are urgently required to advance our housing schemes. Also, by placing an enormous factory at St. Mary's, the Government will be putting a strain on the communitv services and housing facilities of that area. The Vice-President of the Executive Council took the honourable member for St. George to task for saying that although the Government had proposed to build this factory four years ago it was only now starting the job, and he indicated that the factory was urgently required. He maintained that we were short of ammunition, and needed the facilities to provide it. That being so, it is all the more remarkable that, although the Government recognized the need for the factory four years ago, it has left it to this late stage to get on with the job. The Government is making the same mistakes that it made at the beginning of World War II . At that time, it seemed to recognize the need to build up our defences, but somehow or other our defences were not improved, and the Government seemed to be incapable of making any decisions in that regard. It was quite evident at that time that there was a serious division among the members of the then Government, and there was an inability among the Ministers to make sound decisions. A Labour Government assumed office during World War II , almost two years after the war had commenced, and we found then that Australia still was not producing enough arms and ammunition to service our fighting forces. The Minister's failure to justify the failure of the Government to start this factory four years ago, when the Government first recognized the need for it, is similar to the failure of the Government of which he was a member to recognize Australia's needs in the early part of the last war. I suggest that, in view of recent international developments and the present readiness of the great nations to reduce their armed forces, the Government should re-appraise the need for this particular factory. At present, top level conferences are being held among the great powers, and emerging from those talks is a belief that it is now important effect economies in armed forces, the maintenance of which has been a great strain upon the taxpayers of all the countries of the world. That being so, I ask members of the committee to examine the position and decide whether, at this stage, it is desirable for us to proceed with a project which will involve an expenditure of £23,000,000, and also whether the site that has been selected is the best that can be secured. In my opinion, the establishment of these works so near to the great metropolis of Sydney is altogether wrong in principle. If we should have unwelcome visitors, and hostile aircraft should attempt to destroy our war potential, the City of Sydney would be in danger. These works should be established in a place less vulnerable, so that we shall not run the risk of being denied the service that it could render. For that reason, it should be established at some place west of the Blue Mountains.",29
92,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Ovder! The honourable member's time has expired.,30
93,Mr TURNER,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Bradfield) [4.27] - I have been stimulated to rise by the arrant nonsense that we have heard from the honourable member for Sturt (Mr. Makin), who comes before us as a spokesman for the Labour party to tell us of the magnificent war effort and defence achievements of the Labour party over the years, and then proceeds, somewhat illogically, to attack the Government's proposal to establish this munitions factory.",30
94,Mr MAKIN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,The results will speak for themselves.,30
95,Mr TURNER,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"It may be that my memory is wrong. If it is, no doubt the honourable member for Sturt will correct me, but I seem to remember that, before the last war, the attitude of the Labour party, both in Australia and in Great Britain, was to rely on the League of Nations and not to rearm. I remember that at all times the Labour party opposed rearmament before the last war. Am I wrong in saying that that party opposed the formation of the Australian Imperial Force, and also opposed sending it abroad? The honourable member for Sturt, as I have said, made great to claims regarding the achievements of tha Labour Government during the war, but I was under the impression that men like Sir Essington Lewis were largely responsible for the success of Australia's war preparations, and for the provision of essential equipment. I thought that it was to the credit of the Labour Govern the ment that it did not sufficiently impede their efforts to make their contributions ineffective. But why go back that far? Ever since the war ended, and particuber larly in recent times, the Leader of Opposition (Dr Evatt) has spent his time trying to induce us to believe that, because some prominent Eussians have smiled, the Russians are our friends, that consequently there is no need for us to do anything to assist our allies the defence of the free world. Is that true, or is it not true? No one who has heard the right honourable gentleman speak in recent months would have difficulty in concluding that it is The Leader of the Opposition says, effect, that there has been a change at the Kremlin, and that the gentlemen who rule Russia have smiled upon us and that therefore we should drop our defence activities at once. That is his attitude. Yet the honourable member for Sturt the effrontery to rise in his place talk about the magnificent record of the Labour party in regard to defence matters. His remarks are inconsistent with his attitude in opposing what this Government has done and now proposes to do. Let us have a look at the amateur strategy of the honourable member Sturt and others sitting with him, includbeing ing the honourable member for St. George (Mr Lemmon). They suggest that the establishment of this factory is not important, yet the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) has said categorically that the Government's defence advisers are of opinion that it is a No. 1 priority.",30
96,Mr DALT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,That was said four years ago.,31
97,Mr TURNER,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"If it was true four years ago, its truth has more force today. There were atom bombs four years ago as there are now. If the Labour party is sincere, instead of ing the attitude it has adopted, it should, if it is concerned about our defences, found criticizing the Government for getting to work much earlier. But that is not its attitude. The Labour party is inconsistent. Action is more imporwell tant now than ever. I should say that the defence advisers of the Government, who include representatives of the Navy, Army and the Air Force, might be presumed to have a better knowledge of the best site for these works than is possessed by either the honourable memfor Sturt or the honourable member the for St. George. These advisers, having examined the matter carefully, have concluded that the location is satisfactory and that the work should be given a numand ber one priority. Who is the honourable member for Sturt, or the honourable memin ber for St. George, that he should express a contrary opinion? It may be that the chiefs of staff are wrong. They have been wrong before; but they are any more likely to be right than are the true. civilian gentlemen opposite who have in expressed a contrary opinion. However, some observations by way of criticism may not be out of place. In my opinion, the Minister has not given as full an answer and explanation as he has might have done. The honourable memand ber for St. George said that the Government proposes to go ahead with this work, which is estimated to cost £23,000,000, by expending £6,000,000 this year and the remaining £17,000,000 next year. The honourable member went on to say that the expenditure of £6,000,000 this year would be made at the expense of 3,000 homes. In New for South Wales about 25,000 homes are constructed each year, so that even if the honourable member for St. George is correct, that would mean reducing the number of homes built this year from 25,000 to 22,000. But that is not the whole truth. A great deal of other buildthe ing is undertaken. I have knowledge only of New South Wales, and so I am taking that State as an example. As I have said, building construction in New South Wales is not confined to homes. The economic policy of this Government, as announced in the budget, and explained in the Prime Minister's recent adoptstatement, is to slow down capital development in private industry during be the next year or two, until our labour not force and our productive capacity have been brought into balance with the purchasing power of the people. It may be that there will not be so much industrial building in the next twelve months, and therefore the housing programme will probably not be affected at all. The expenditure on building in New South Wales is about £100,000,000 a year. It is proposed to expend on this project about £6,000,000 in the next year. I do not think that the expenditure of that sum of money will have as serious an impact on our huilding labour force as has been suggested. Nevertheless, I should like the Minister to make a studied statement on the impact on our labour force and the supply of materials that this project is expected to have. Although, as I have said, I do not think that the impact will be as serious a3 has been suggested, it would be reassuring to the community, particularly people engaged in building, to know just what is the schedule of man-power and materials on this project. If it is intended, as the honourable ber for St. George, who quoted the words of the Minister for Defence Production, has stated, that in the second year £17,000,000 will be expended, I think the Minister should examine the programme in relation to the international situation and our national economy. Perhaps it is not necessary to complete the work with in two years. The considerable drain of £17,000,000 in the second year could be avoided if the work were extended over a total period of three years. I suggest that whatever may be the international situation or the state of the economy, the Minister should not firmly fix the twoyear period in his mind at this stage, and that we should not proceed willy-nilly to complete the project within that period if a period of three years would serve the purpose equally well. I do not know whether the Government has considered the possibility of bringing in building workers from another country to work on this project. The policy in relation to the Snowy Mountains project - and it was a wise policy-wa s to bring in Norwegian contractors, the Selmer Company, and to provide in the contract for the employment of a certain number of building employees from Norway.",31
98,Sir ERIC HARRISON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,The Government proposes to use immigrant labour on this project.,32
99,Mr TUENEE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The Minister says that it is proposed to use immigrant labour. I was wondering whether, if all the contracts have not yet been let, it would be possible to let some to overseas builders on the condition that they brought some or all of their building labour with them. In other words, I am asking the Government to give careful consideration to the effect of this project on man-power and materials, and to the possibility of bringing building labour from overseas, some of which, no doubt, would remain and later be of advantage for other purposes. I suggest that the Minister should give the community a more precise idea of what is involved on the economic side of this project. I have no doubt that, to the chiefs of staff, it has a No . 1 priority. We also should regard it as such. If the chiefs of staff are satisfied with the location, I suggest that no better opinion is available within mem- this chamber. The defence of Australia is of great importance to Government supporters. The attitude of the Opposition in holding aloft its magnificent defence record ancl then doing all it can to prevent the establishment of this factory is quite inconsistent. Finally, although the Minister may not have sufficient time to obtain the figures before the conclusion of this debate, I ask him to give to the community in the fullness of time a more precise idea of what is involved in this work in regard to man-power and materials as they affect the requirements of the construction industry within New South Wales, where the impact of this project will be felt most. I repeat my request to the Government to consider bringing building labour from abroad. It may not be possible, because of the non-availability of building labour abroad, for contractors to bring their own employees, but I think the suggestion is worthy of consideration.",32
100,Mr KEON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Y a r r a ) [4.39] - If the amendment that is before the committee had been submitted as a censure of the Government for its placing of this munition establishment in the proposed situation, one would bave had little hesitation in supporting it . Because the Government proposes to establish this project in an area in which, in the event of an atomic attack,, it would be severely damaged, we have seen the revolt amongst Government supporters carried almost to the extent of turmoi"" in the party room by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). It is quite obvious that there is considerable support amongst Government supporters for the view that the siting of this factory is very bad, that the Government has ignored the essentials of defence and decentralization in this atomic age. On these grounds, one would be entitled to censure the Government. One would be entitled to censure the Government also on the ground that it has not provided the committee with the necessary information about this establishment. It may be argued by the Government that it would not be possible for the committee to absorb all the essential details during the course of debate - I suggest to the Government however, that, if there were a defence committee of honourable members by whom such projects could be examined in the same manner as similar projects are examined by the Public Works Committee, those honourable members could come into the chamber and assure their colleagues that the expenditure was warranted, that the plans were not extravagant, and that the proposed method of building, whether it be the cost-plus system of otherwise, was in the interest of the nation. But the Government has not followed that course. On that ground also, as I have stated, we would be entitled to censiire the Government. If the censure, however, were, in effect, an attack upon the Government's defence preparations, neither I nor my colleagues in this corner of the chamber would have any part of it. We believe, however, that the Government is open to grave criticism for having chosen the proposed site at St. Mary's for the establishment of this project, for the method by which it proposes to construct it, and for the lack of information that has been given to honourable members. Having made those comments, let me return to the remarks of the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Makin) and to discuss the proposed vote of approximately £6,500,000 for defence research and development in the Estimates for the Department of Supply. The honourable member suggested that, in view of the present international situation, that expenditure is not warranted. Under this head, I propose to make a few comments about atomic or thermo-nuclear power and its use in the future. One cannot speak about the future use of atomic power, which, of course, has been and developed in Australia under the control of the Department of Supply, without referring to the tremendous benefit to mankind of the fact that the United States of America was the first nation to discover the secret of atomic power. It could have been used for good or evil; fortunately for us the United States has sought to use it for good.",32
101,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Does the honourable member intend to refer to the military use of atomic power?,33
102,Mr KEON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Yes , to a certain degree, but I am concerned with both the peacef u l and military use of atomic power. Neither Australia nor many other countries understand properly how fortunate we are that the United States, and not the Soviet Union or Hitler's Germany, was the first nation to discover atomic power. Too little is understood of the tremendous debt that we owe to the President of the United States and his predecessor for their efforts to ensure that atomic energy would be devoted to the peaceful purposes of mankind, and that only. While phoney peace conferences are being held all over the place and people are trying to use the word "" peace "" as a weapon of war, too few Australians know of the continuous struggle that has taken place, since the United States first learned the secret of atomic power, to ensure that it would not be used for purposes of war but for purposes of peace. Very few people in Australia could tell us of the plan that was prepared by Bernard Baruch, which culminated in an offer by America, which I suppose was unprecedented in history, to make available to the world all its atomic secrets and to destroy its stockpile of atomic weapons on the sole condition that other countries would agree, having received those secrets, to a system of international inspection to ensure that they did not use the information to build up their own secret stockpiles of atomic weapons. For ten years or more the United States has endeavoured to bring about such an agreement, but on every possible occasion it has been frustrated by the refusal of the Soviet Union and its supporters to agree to that one essential-the system of international inspection. Agreement to such a system is still the prime essential for a successful outcome of the disarmament conference now being held. "" Eventually, however, as a result of the patient planning and great statesmanship of the President of the United States, to whom we all extend our best wishes for his recovery to health so that he may take his place at the head of the democratic nations, we have at least witnessed the success of the ""Atoms for Peace "" conference which has resulted in tremendous benefits being given to mankind in the fields of medicine, industry and agriculture, and which enable the world to take tremendous steps forward in the relief of misery and distress. Let me say that, although some people today claim the credit for that success, it was only after two and a half years of patient effort, on top of previous efforts by the United States, that eventually President Eisenhower was able to bring about that "" Atoms for Peace "" convention. If no other tribute is paid to his memory in future, he will at any rate always have the success of that convention as a monument to an outstanding piece of statesmanship. Those people who are continually attacking the United States, and continually talking about American war-mongering and so on, ought to acquaint themselves Will the long and arduous struggle by the Americans to bring about Avhat is, I suppose, one of the greatest needs of the Avorld at the present time, that is, atomic disarmament, so that people will be able to move out of the valley of fear of an atomic war, with all that such a war would involve. Let me say in passing that the fact that we have been able to reach even the present measure of agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy is in spite of the circumstance that the Fuchs, the Nunn-Mays and the rest of them betrayed their country, and the secrets of the United .States, to potential enemies. However, I do not want to confine myself to the past. I want to speak of the future in relation to this matter. I believe that the issue of disarmament is the greatest issue that faces the democratic peoples of the world at the present time, and that all our efforts should be devoted to endeavouring to ensure the success of the disarmament conference now being held in Europe. I want to say that, in my opinion-and , I am sure, in the opinion of all intelligent and well meaning persons-that conference cannot be a success unless world opinion is so mobilized that those who may refuse to take the steps necessary to ensure the success of the conference-thos e who may not agree to the proposals being put forward by the United States at presentwill be branded before all the world as aggressors and war-mongers. The United States, through Presiwill dent EisenhoAver, has put forward what it regards as an essential condition. Whereas previously we could have had an effective system of international inspection which would have preserved world peace, now we cannot have such an effective system, because it is probable that both sides have saturation stocks of atomic or thermo-nuclear weapons. Those stocks Would be very hard to discover, and an ordinary system of international inspection would not be effective. What the President of the United States is seeking is an immediate arrangement that will enable each side to be perfectly certain that the other side is not endeavouring to launch a sneak attack on it with atomic weapons from secret airfields. The statement issued by the American President makes it perfectly clear that the first step that ought to be taken in relation to this matter is to provide an effective safeguard against massive surprise attack, which is the major source of fear and international tension. He has said to the Soviet Union, "" You can photograph our munitions works, our aircraft plants and our military installations. They are all available for you to look at, to photograph or to do what you will as far as inspection is concerned, provided that you will do likewise, so that the two major nations of the Avorld can be certain that neither will attempt a sneak attack on the other Will atomic weapons. That is the first step that must be taken if we are to proceed further with disarmament"". The second proposition of the United States is that the nations shall disarm by various steps, but the fundamental proposition is that, whatever agreement be reached, there must be a system of international inspection within the borders of all countries, so that each side will know that the other side is carrying out the terms of the agreement.",33
103,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Order! I think the honourable member is going a little wide of the mark.,35
104,Mr KEON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The reason I am advancing this argument is that some honourable menibers who have spoken in support of the amendment have argued that we should not spend a large amount of money on the St. Mary's filling factory. They say there is a possibility that international relations will improve and, therefore, we should avoid using that money for the purposes of war. I say to people who argue in that way: Beware of wolves in sheep's clothing. Beware of people who use talk of peace as a weapon of war. There is one test of the sincerity of the people who hold peace congresses, chalk "" Ban the Atom Bomb "" on bridges and all the re3t of it. Do they, or do they not, support the one thing that would make disarmament possible? Do they support a system of international inspection whereby each side could make certain that the other side was honouring the terms of the agreement? I say that anybody who talks about banning atomic weapons and about disarmament, but does not insist on that one condition, and does not make it quite clear that he supports the stand of the United States for the acceptance of that one condition, is nothing other than a fraud. I have had plenty to say about Hobart conference resolutions, but this matter is far more serious than a political dispute. I regret to say that the resolution of the Hobart conference about atomic disarmament, banning atom bombs and so on that was read last week by the right honourable member for Barton (Dr Evatt), contained no reference to that one essential condition. Until such time as the people who talk of banning atomic weapons make it quite clear that there is only one obstacle to disarmament-the refusal of the Soviet Union to agree to international inspection - I shall refuse to accept their bona fides and I shall believe that their protestations of support for peace are nothing other than frauds and shams. I believe that the Australian Government and the governments of other democracies have been very remiss in educating the people on this problem. The people of the democracies should have been mobilized to bring a blast of public opinion to bear upon the Soviet Union and let the Russians see that, if they refused to accept the condition proposed by the United States, they would stand branded before the world as war-mongers, aggressors, wolves in sheep's clothing and people who talked peace when they meant war. I put it to the Ministers at the table that they have a responsibility to educate the Australian people in the realities of the situation. For too long have we had phoney peace conferences. For too long have all the woolly-minded idealists and some of the clergymen in the community been led by the nose by those who talk peace, although their real aim is war. There is one test of the the sincerity of these people-that is, their attitude to the proposal for international inspection that I have mentioned so frequently in the course of my speech. If a nation is not prepared to agree to a system of international inspection of atomic armaments which will make it possible for an international body to decide whether the terms of a disarmament agreement are being carried out, obviously that nation does not desire peace and is continuing to threaten the future peace of the world. I believe that, whilst we have a job to work actively and tirelessly in the interests of the defence of Australia, so, too, we have a job to work actively and tirelessly in the interests of peace. I believe that the best way in which we can work actively and tirelessly in the interests of peace is by showing the world just what the position is in relation to the present disarmament plans.",35
105,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Order! The honourable gentleman's timehas expired.,35
106,Mr FAIRBAIRN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Farrer) [4.54] At the ouset of my remarks, 1 should like to congratulate the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Keon) on what I believe was a constructive speech. We often hear honourable members opposite abuse our great ally, the United States of America. So it was refreshing to hear the honourable member for Yarra express the view that America is doing more to achieve peace than any other country in the world.",35
107,Mr CDHTIN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,What about old England ?,36
108,Mr FAIRBAIRJST,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Englan d is doing the job on a very big scale, but I draw the attention of the honourable member Watson (Mr Curtin) to the fact that the United States is a considerably larger nation. For that reason, and also because it has a considerably larger industrial power, it has achieved, and probably achieving, more than the old country in that field. However, I rose not to speak on that matter, but to deal with the subject of defence production, and glad to see that the Minister for Defence Production (Sir Eric Harrison) is the table at the moment. We are asked to vote a total amount of £11,253,000 the operations of the Department of Defence Production in the coming year. At the time that this Government into power it was stated by the then ' Chief of Staff of the Royal Australian Air Force that not one aircraft in this country was a modern aircraft capable of being used in battle. Our policy in respect of defence production was from the first concentrated on production of modern service aircraft, and it is true to say that today the nation is in a very much better position in respect of fighting aircraft than i was when the Government took office. admit that when the Government's posals to embark on the production Australia of service aircraft, larly fighters, was first placed before the Parliament, I was opposed to it, because 1 knew the history of aircraft production by Australia during World War II . During that war, unfortunately, all of aircraft of Australian manufacture protured vided to the Royal Australian Air Force were either obsolescent or obsolete by the time they reached the fighting forces. First, we had the Wirraway, which built originally as a fighter. It was by some people that there was so little one could do in a Wirraway that in the event of attack by a Japanese Zero the only method of self defence for pilot of a Wirraway was to undo the straps and run madly round the cockpit. Later we produced the Boomerang, which also was a very poor fighter compared with fighter aircraft being produced in other countries. When Australia embarked on the production of the Sabre I thought it was attempting to do something beyond its capabilities; but I am very glad indeed to be able to say that I believe that today, for in the Sabre, this country has one of the best, if not the best, fighter aircraft that is in standard use in squadron service. Although this aircraft was not designed here it has been considerably modified in is Australia so that the Avon engine can be fitted into the American airframe, and it is therefore considerably better than the Sabres that were in operation two years I am ago in Korea. Very few honourable members realise the full capabilities of this at machine. I do not think that people throughout the world realise what a good for fighter it is. For example, its rate of climb is almost exactly double the rate of climb of the original F.86A Sabre came which was used in the Korean war. Its rate of fire-power is ten times as high as that of the F.S6A which was used in 50 in Korea. This is because we have been fortunate in getting the Aden 37-mm. cannon, whose terrific rate of fire-power can be altered to make it fire at speeds the ranging from 500 rounds a minute up to nearly 2,000 rounds a minute. Because of the nature of the revolving chamber which enables a high rate of feeding in, t and ejection, of shells, this cannon is a I revolutionary development in aircraft proarmament, and I think that we have in in our Australian-made Sabre the best airparticucraft now in squadron service. We hear complaints about the cost of some of those aircraft. That is only natural, because, on present proposals, the only about 80 of them are to be manufacin Australia, and the cost of toolingup, and buying the machines necessary to produce those aircraft, is therefore divided among the relatively small number of 80 was to be produced. The only way we can said reduce costs is to increase the number produced-in other words, to produce more than our requirements, and try to sell the surplus to other countries. I the believe that if we embarked on a real sales promotion campaign for the Sabre ancl other aircraft produced in Australia we would be able to make sales in other parts of the world. It has been suggested that the fact that we are building the Sabre under licence might be a bar to our selling them overseas. It is quite true that we are building the Sabre under licence, but other countries which are manufacturing aircraft under licence are able to sell them in whatever part of the world they can find a market for them. For example, South Africa has lodged an order for 10,000,000 dollars worth of Sabre Mark VI.'s from Canada, where the Sabre Mark VJ. is built under licence. As the Mark VI . has the Orenda 14 engine, which is considerably inferior to the Avon engine fitted in the Australian-built Sabre, there is no doubt that Australia would be able to offer the South Africans much better aircraft than those on which they are willing to spend 10,000,000 dollars. We have an Australian-designed airfactory craft, the Jindivik, which, honourable members may not realise, is quite outstanding in its own field as a pilotless, target aircraft. This aircraft was destud, signed by Ian Fleming, with whom I studied at Cambridge University. The Western democracies have no pilotless craft which is anywhere near as good the Jindivik for the particular work it is designed to do. In fact, its worth has been realized by the Americans, who, [ understand, are at present trying to negotiate for licences to manufacture in America. The point that I wish put to the committee is that all sales these aircraft have been made as a result of inquiries for them initiated overseas, and not as the result of any efforts by Australia to sell them abroad. The same is true of other aircraft produced in tralia. The Venom and the Vampire are examples in point. The Venom is operaa tional with the Royal Australian Navy, and the Vampire is used by the Royal Australian Air Force as a jet fighter, there is considerable demand for them. The companies which make those airdisplayed craft cannot profitably go ahead building a number just sufficient for the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian-made tralian Navy, because the orders are small that it is not economical for them to tool-up in order to build only the small number of these aircraft wanted in Australia. I believe that we should either go right into the business of building modern aircraft, or get right out of it, instead of going only half the way. We should concentrate on producing aircraft of a few good designs, and seek sales for them abroad. Not so long ago the Royal New Zealand Air Force purchased from the United Kingdom, on two occasions, aircraft which were available for supply from Bankstown, in New South Wales. It would have been better for the Royal New Zealand Air Force to have acquired its aircraft from the closest source of supply, and it would have had the assurance that spare parts would have been readily available from the same close source of supply. I understand that even the Royal Australian Navy placed an order with the De Havilland company in England for aircraft which could have been built at Bankstown, and which the at Bankstown was only too willing to produce for the Navy. When one wants to sell anything what does one do? I have a small sheep and if I want to sell sheep and find that no buyers are offering, I take them along to a show where potential buyers can airsee them. We should be doing the same as thing with the aircraft that we produce that in this country. We should be taking them to ah' shows. We will not sell our aircraft by merely waiting for people to offer to buy them, and then telling them it that we have none to sell them. We to must go out seeking sales. The major of air show in the world is the Farnborough display in England. Not only are the best aircraft in England shown there but also all the leading aircraft designers and aircraft manufacturers in the world Ausattend that display, very often with cheque books in their pockets and with willingness to write large cheques for orders for aircraft in which they are interested. We have seen cases of a single and English firm receiving orders for 100 aircraft purely as a result of its having a particular model at the Farnborough display. I suggest it would be well worth our while to exhibit Ausaircraft at that display. It so does not matter whether the aircraft we exhibit were designed in Australia, so long as they are made in Australia. Whether or not the aircraft are completely of Australian design is not imporby tant. After all, the Australian-built Sabre can be considered to be an Australian-designed aircraft in that we have been responsible for the modifications that have made it what it is today. sale of only one aircraft were made, the expense of this display would be recouped. If only one aircraft were sold the cost would be repaid, and at the same time the outside world would see a sample of the quality of Australian workmanship and become aware that aircraft can be produced in this country. Outside aircraft firms might be induced to establish branches of their firms in Australia, as Fairey's and De Havilland's have done. The aircraft industry in Australia must be expanded beyond the stage of providing merely for the small, local requirements of the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Australian Naval Air Arm. An effort must be made to obtain orders from coimtries such as Indonesia, India, New Zealand and South Africa.",36
109,Mr NELSON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Northern Territory) [5.6] - I wish to bring before the committee matters concerning two organizations under the control of the Department of Supply, namely, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and the Australian Aluminium Production Commission. I direct attention to the manner in which these bodies have been dealing with claims for rewards for the discovery of mineral deposits now being worked under their control. Bauxite was discovered in the Wessel Islands, and particularly on Marchinbar Island, off the north coast of the Northern Territory. Subsequently, a further deposit was discovered on the mainland near these islands. The discovery on Wessel Island was made by Captain F. E. Wells and Mr F. J. Waalks, a marine engineer. They reported this to the government of the day, and a government geologist was sent to the island to investigate and report. As a result of that inspection the Australian Aluminium Production Commission was formed, and further extensive surveys of the island were made. It was estimated that on Wessel Island and Marchinbar Island about 10,000,000 tons of bauxite was available for mining. A claim for a reward was then lodged the discoverers, but so far no finality has been reached. As far back as December, 1953, I made representations to the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale), and received from him a letter dated the 18th If a January, 1954, in which he saidDear Mr Nelson, As promised in my letter of 15th December last I have made enquiries concerning Mr. F. J. Waalks, who wrote to you in regard to his interest in the Wessel Islands bauxite discovery and its development.",38
110,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Would the honourable member mind telling me who wrote this letter?,38
111,Mr NELSON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"It is from the Minister himself. This second paragraph readsAlthough the Australian Aluminium Production Commission withdrew its offer of a reward to bauxite discoverers after the Wessels survey was completed, Mr Waalks' eligibility for a reward is not affected. He and Captain Wells remain registered as codiscoverers of the Marchinbar deposits, and their claims wil l be dealt with in due course. From that time. I ceased to have any interest until my recent visit to Darwin, when again I was asked by one of the co-discoverers to take up the matter with the Minister. He handed to me correspondence between his solicitor and the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor's office at Darwin. Mr R. J. Withnall, Crown Law officer at Darwin, wrote to Captain F. E. Wells, Harbour Master, Darwin, on the 14th April, 1955, as follows:Dear Sir, Baumite deposits: Wessel Islands: Reward for Discovery. I have been instructed to offer to you an amount of £250 in respect of your share in the discovery of bauxite deposits on Marchinbar Island in the Northern Territory. A similar amount will also be offered to Mr. Waalks. It should be understood that this offer is made to you as an act of grace and without any admission that the Aluminium Industry Conimission or the Commonwealth is liable to pay you any amount in respect of your part in the discovery of the deposits, and that payment of the amount to you will he dependent upon your executing a form of acquittance releasing the Commonwealth, from any claims which you may have or might have had. I should be glad if you would let meknow as soon as possible whether you are prepared to accept this amount and to sign an appropriate acquittance. Yours faithfully , (Sgd.) R. J. WITHNALL , Crown Law Officer.. ;' I shall read the reply from the solicitor to the Crown Law officer, dated the 26th May, 1955, which was written by Mr . ABrough Newell.",38
112,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Does the honourable member think it wise to read these letters? They were all written without prejudice during the course of negotiations.,39
113,Mr NELSON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Thes e negotiations have been going on since 1946. The Minister in an earlier letter acknowledged the registration of the two discoverers of the deposits which have since been proved to be most extensive. Those on Marchinbar Island were estimated at 10,000,000 tons, and a further discovery on the mainland is estimated at 40,000,000 tons, making a total of 50,000,000 tons. I shall read the reply of the Minister to a question asked in this chamber on Wednesday, the 21st September last, by the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Luck). It is as follows:As the sources of supply, speaking from memory, we have already a reserve of some 10.000,000 tons in the Wessell Island area the coast of Northern Australia. Quite recently, a qualitative survey of the Arnhem land district revealed what looks like some 50.000,000 tons of high-grade bauxite in that area. The following day, in answer to a question addressed to him by the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Freeth), the Minister said it was the intention of the department to establish an aluminium industry in New Guinea operated by hydro-electric power. In his answer he intimated that it was hoped, if the scheme came to f r u it i o n, to obtain the bauxite from the rich deposits in Northern Australia. These deposits are so extensive and so important to the nation that an - offer to each of the discoverers of the sum of £250 is very shabby indeed. It is out of all proportion to the importance - of the discovery to Australia. The Minister admits that eventually the aluminium plant at Bell Bay will be run on ore which will be supplied from these - deposits. He also admits that the aluminium industry in New Guinea may be established on ore obtained from the - same deposits. The conditions of the reward are set - out in a letter dated the 3rd March, 1952, addressed to the Administrator of the Northern Territory, following inquiries that he had made for information as to the reward, if any, that would apply. Portion of that letter readsThe Commission's policy is to pay a reward to discoverers of deposits of bauxite who disclose and cede their discovery to the Commission. The reward is at the rate of £1 for each 500 tons of bauxite, a deposit being that volume of bauxite located within the boundaries of any mining tenement acquired or taken over by the Commission on the area disclosed by the discoverer. A reward is payable only if(a) the deposit discovered is proved to the satisfaction of the Commission to be economic; (6) the deposit is ceded to the Commission free from royalties or capital payments to the discoverer other than the actual reward at the prescribed rate, and (c) mining title over the deposit is secured by the Commission. All those conditions have been fulfilled . The solicitor in his answer to the offer that was made by the Crown Solicitor said that on the figures in the commissioner's own letter to the Administrator, off these two men would be entitled, in respect of the Wessel Island deposits alone, to a reward of between £19,000 and £20,000. The letter to the Administrator statesAny reward due to bo paid fov u discovery will be determined and paid on an in situ tonnage basis as calculated by the Commission, and will be paid either as a lump sum or by instalments over a period as may be preferred by the discoverer and agreed to by the Commission. First of all we have the Minister agreeing that Mr F . J. Waalks and Captain Wells were entitled to a reward. The conimission set out the conditions under which a reward would be payable and those conditions in this case have been fulfilled. Then we have this magnificent offer of £250 to each of the discoverers. I do not know whether that is to be free of tax. That seems to be a very parsimonious attitude and I suggest that the Minister should take up with the commission immediately the matter of paying a reward to these men commensurate with the importance of their discoveries. The other matter I should like to deal with is the reported discovery by the Bureau of Mineral Resources on Coronation Day of what is known as the "" Coronation deposits"" of uranium in the Northern Territory. The story as told by Mr Joe Callinan, of Jimbat Station, the man who made the claim, is to the effect that a couple of days before Coronation Day he asked a survey party of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, which was in the area, to inspect a deposit of copper over which he had a title and which he thought could be uranium bearing. On Coronation Day the party accompanied by Mr Callinan went to the deposit and as a result of an inspection of the area was able to determine that uranium did exist in fairly substantial quantities; at least that was indicated on the geiger counter.",39
114,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
115,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Parramatta-Minister for Supply) [5.21] - I should like to deal first of all with bauxite deposits and this matter of rewards that has been raised by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson). I feel some reluctance about embarking upon a discussion of this subject for the obvious reason, as I indicated to the honourable member by way of interjection, that it is the subject of discussion and negotiations between solicitors, and I do not think that it should be discussed in this chamber at the moment. However, since it has been raised I want only to say that the attitude taken by the Crown Law authorities is that no legal obligation exists to pay a reward in this case.",40
116,Mr NELSON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,What about a moral obligation?,40
117,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"On e thing at a time; I am speaking about the legal obligation. Therefore, an ex gratia payment was offered. If that is wrong then the lawyers can deal with the matter. Litigation can be instituted OIL behalf of Captain Wells and the other man which can determine the position. On the question of moral right to compensation quite different considerations arise. It is true that substanwe tial quantities of bauxite were discovered - on Marchinbar Island in the Wessel Islands group. If the honourable membur's presentation of the matter is 'Correct-m y recollection is not infallible and I do not remember the - details-the diseovez-y was promoted by some people-it may be the people for whom he speaks-wh o saw R -- [48] what looked like bauxite deposits in that area. As a result of this first report, officers of the Bureau of Mineral Resources took the matter up, went to the island and made examinations. It seemed promising enough for them to bring the matter to the attention of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission, which at that time, back in 1950 or 1951, was anxious to secure supplies indigenous to Australia. As a result the commission of the day decided itself to conduct a survey. A survey was conducted, which, by the way, cost something like £130,000, and it resulted, after extensive drilling and other activities, in proving the existence of an iron body of substantial dimensions. The steps I am taking the committee through are these: A member of the public observes surface indications which look like bauxite. He reports the matter to government geologists, who in due course have a look at the deposit and make their own investigation which is much more extensive but still not conclusive. Then, a full-scale survey is made involving extensive drilling and other activities which, as I have said, cost £130,000. As a result the deposit was proved. It is a bit far-fetched to suggest that a man who first sees something on the surface which causes somebody else to do something, as a result of which government geologists do something, as a result of which in turn a full-scale survey is made, is in the same position as a man who, having discovered a likely area himself, does his own research and developmental work and takes out a licence, then a lease and finally turns out the lode in the ore body.",40
118,Mr NELSON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The Government paid J ack White £25,000 on the same basis!",40
119,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"W c did pay it, but not on the same basis. We made a public offer to Australians generally. We said that we wanted to find uranium, and that would pay a reward for its discovery. Jack White, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory knows ful l well, lived a primitive sort of life prospecting in the bush for many months, and. eventually found what is now known as White's mine. At that period Australia was trying desperately to promote a uranium industry. That is why this special reward was offered. Australia had, of course, significant defence reasons for making the offer. The uranium proposition was altogether different from the bauxite proposition. But I do not propose to close the door on any one. The matter is still being negotiated. I merely point out to honourable members that it was not a case of the Government showing negligence or heartlessness. Quite different factors operate as between uranium and bauxite. I have not before me the papers regarding Mr Callinan's claim, but speaking from memory-so that I will not have to rise again on this matter-that gentleman was not responsible for the discovery of the deposit. The discovery of the field-I think it was the Coronation Hill find-was made by an officer in the government service, a Mr Walpole. As he is an officer in the Bureau of Mineral Resources he is debarred from any reward. Later, he was accompanied by Mr Callinan on a. return visit to the That is the first ground on which Mr. Callinan is shown to have no claim to a reward. The second is the fact that Mr. Callinan was by this time on the payroll of the Bureau of Mineral Resources.",40
120,Mr NELSON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,For how long?,41
121,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I do not know. Howthat, ever, in case that be described as taking a technical point, I shall rely on first ground-that the discovery was made by a permanent oflicer of the Bureau of Mineral Resources. The claim, was not brushed aside; it was closely examined. The Atoinic Energy Commission accepts the advice of the Bureau of Mineral Resources in these matters. The bureau examined the claim very carefully on two into or three occasions and advised against granting of a reward on the ground the claimant was not responsible for the discovery. I should like to pass now to the subject of the guided weapons programme of the Department of Supply, which was reby ferred to by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) last week. I am sorry the honourable member is not f present. He raised a number of quesembarking, tions, to which, as he is not here to take note of the answers, I shall not reply in detail. The effect of his remarks was that, from his analysis of the Estimates, there had been a downward trend in expenditure for work in this field. In 1948 the Chifley Government, he said, had embarked upon a five-year programme, involving the expenditure of something like £33,000,000, at the rate of £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 a year, upon research and development. As the present Estimates forecast an expenditure of about £6,800,000 on research and development this year, he suggested that the Government was really doing no more than Labour had done in this field. Indeed, he said, if one had regard for the lower value of money, this Government was really doing less. I suggest that he misled himself by quoting wrong figures. I direct the attention of the honourable member for St. George (Mr Lemmon) also to this matter because I read in Hansard an observation of his during another debate to the effect that the guided weapons project had really been begun by the prearea. vious Administration, and that the present Government had since only "" coasted along "".",41
122,Mr LEMMON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,That is quite true.,41
123,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"It is quite true that the honourable member for St. George said but the allegations are not true. In 1947-48 the Chifley Government spent the £1,300,000 on the project. I am not complaining about that because it was only just getting under way. In addition there was the cost of the buildings brought from Salisbury and contributed to the project. In 1948-49 the expenditure was £4,400,000-it was stepping up a little. In 1949-50, when this Government cameoflice, the expenditure was the £5,300,000. By 1950-51 it had become that £6,000,000 and in 1951-52 it was £6,025,000. In 1952-53 it was £6,216,000. In 1953-54 it was £6,700,000 and in 1954-55 it was £8,089,000. This year's estimate is £8,551,000. If those figures indicate that the work was really all done Labour, and that we are just coastingalong, I am afraid that figures no longer have any meaning in this world. I giveu ll credit to the Chifley Government for with the British Government.. upon this joint long-range weapons undertaking. However, of the £54,000,000which has been spent upon the guidedi weapons project, nearly all has been spent by this Government. I mention these things because it is just as well to get them in perspective. The Government wishes the people understand that Australia has made great and increasing contribution to fulfilment of this magnificent conception. Secondly, the Government believes that the people should know what Australia - doing in this vital field. I hope in moment to be able to show that what are doing is a very important contribution to the welfare of the free world. It the more meritorious when one remembers that Australia's interests are indirect rather than direct. It began in 1947-48 as a long-range weapons establishment. I am speaking now of the partnership between Great Britain and Australia the development amd testing of missiles various kinds, and especially guided missiles. The original idea was that establishment's - attention should be devoted to the development of missiles travelling many hundreds of miles. Woomera was chosen because it provided 1,400 miles of land recovery and perhaps another 1,000 miles of sea, if , ultimately, extensions of the range became necessary. That was why Woomera was chosen, and it is why Woomera is the outstanding range of its kind in the world. Nowhere else is there a range with 1,400 miles land recovery, or with atmospheric conthe ditions that are as equable as those Woomera all the year round. Therefore, this range is of great importance to the western world. Until recently, for various reasons, the range has been a - short range rather than a long range. There were strategic reasons for that and, also, one has to walk before one can run, so that we have been using the range for short and intermediate distances. On the strategic side, it is obvious the United Kingdom has a very great - need of the defensive guided missile of - a short-range character. I do not want to get into trouble with experts such airmen in speaking on this subject, but - certainly the view is widely held that, a third world war should break out some years hence, the role of the fighter airpersonnel. craft as a defensive weapon against bomber attack will be much diminished. I am talking now, not about cold wars, but about a full-scale world war. World thinking is tending to regard the to ground-launched or aircraft-launched a guided missile which, travelling at great the speed, homes on its target, which also may be travelling at great speed, as the basic type of defence in years to come. is Thinking in the United Kingdom has a naturally been turning to that type of we weapon, and much progress has been made. Australians should be proud that is all we are able to make such an important contribution to the development of that kind of defensive guided missile. We are also moving into the development of the longer range of weapons as for time goes on. Some day-withou t being of specific about times-w e shall use this range for longer distance work and for the offensive long-range weapons which span great distances. It is not beyond reasonable imagination to consider that, by helping in the development of long-range and offensive weapons, Australia may be playing a quite vital part in the prevention of a third world war. As Sir Winston Churchill and others have said, the fact that a country which another nation may wish to attack has, itself, the means of counter-attacking and of decimating its attacker, however violent first attack might have been, may be of the real deterrent to a third world war. If Australia can make a contribution, even to that form of stalemate, it will be doing a merciful service to humanity. This sort of work, of course, requires immense money and effort, vast buildings, power stations, air-fields, air services, and electronic devices beyond the understanding of most honourable members in this chamber and of most of the community. We have a courier service that running between England and Australia, shuttling to and fro every week or so, bringing scientists and equipment to this country and taking equipment back to as the United Kingdom. That goes on all the time. It is a part of the mechanism if of this establishment. We are also training thousands of scientists and other We have a full-scale township at Woomera with all the modern amenities including housing, schools, and hospitals. We have high-speed cameras, recorders, and telemetry equipment which records messages that are sent through the air by an instrument in a missile many miles up the range. In this way, we are gathering information about the behaviour and aerodynamic qualities of the missile or test vehicle. That information is recorded and collated, and we learn something from it. Consequently, the next missile that goes up is an improvement on the previous one. We are seeking to do, in n few yea rs, what took a hundred years to do from the Napoleonic wars to World War I . If I remember my history and my romantic reading, in the Napoleonic wars, great muzzle-loading cannons, built by the Carron Company and half a dozen other great iron founders of England and Scotland, fired round ball propelled by a charge of powder in the breach. From that stage to the modern 15-in. high-speed projectile, with a range of perhaps 15 or 20 miles, and destroying an enemy who never sees its attacker, represents 100 years of painful development. Under modern conditions, we have not time for that long, hard, hit-and-miss, trial and error, approach, and we are trying to cram the work into a few years. That is the role of the guided missiles range. Australia, by playing its part, is making a vital contribution to the defence of the United Kingdom ancl, in the long run, of ourselves. Some measure of the importance which is attached to all this work may be gathered from the effort that is going into this sort of work in the United Kingdom. Tn Australia, we are on the receiving end of this work. Weapons which are conceived, initiated and partly developed in England come to Australia for testingBut that position is tending to change. We are doing more ancl more work in Australia. Some of the great firms which are building these weapons in England have established branches at Salisbury, and we have given them factory space where the old filling factory used to be. But, by and large, the weapons are initiated in England aud partlv developed there. They come to us for further testing, up to the final prototype stage, and afterwards they are placed in mass production in England, or, perhaps in this country. While I was in England-and this is one reason why I went abroad- I was able to find out what sort of effort was going into this work. Australia had put between £40,000,000 and £50,000,000 into a great range. To that extent, it had given hostages to fortune. Would this continue to be worthwhile? We had always thought, and we had always been assured, that it was worthwhile. We felt that it was time for the Government to find out to what extent this work would con tin ue. Let no one be under any misunderstanding about this. The eagerness and the enthusiasm for this work in England and the conviction of the Government of the United Kingdom that this work has a No. 1 priority puts it beyond any doubt that the work that weave doing in Australia will continue to be of immense importance to the Government of the United Kingdom; I went to six or eight of the great aircraft and engineering firms in England. There, one after the otlier, one can see in various stages one or other of these missiles being developed-som e ground to air, some air to air, and some ship to air and so forth. Some of them are beam riders; some are radar homing. I was there the day after one of them had scored its first hit. Some impression of the difficulties and intricaciesof this work can be gauged from the fact that this weapon, which had scored a hit at some vast distance in the sky and brought down its target, took nearly five years to perfect to the stage when the scientists and engineers could rub their hands and say, "" Well, we have done what we set out to do years ago "". Components of that weapon have been sent to and from this country to be tested on our range. There are about 10,000 to 20,000 people, as well as others employed in subsidiary industries in England, all engaged on the development of weapons of this sort, and many tens of millionsof pounds are sunk in capital equipment.. I got an impression not only of theNo. 1 importance of guided weapons, but also of the deep appreciation of the British Government and the British people for the contribution which Australia is making towards the British defence. But I emphasize again all this is very important for Australians also, because quite obviously if , in any great conflict, Great Britain went under, we should be in deadly danger. There is also a further benefit to Australia. I refer to the immense range of know-how which is coming to this country. There is a new field for the young scientist, the young engineer, the electronic and the radar expert in the great industries that are being built up in Australia, and which would not have been developed for a long time if we had not taken on this work; so that on the technical and technological side, Australia will, in due course, reap a rich harvest from the work that is being carried out at the long range weapons establishment in South Australia. Nor does the benefit to us end there. A weapon of this kind which is effective in defending the British Isles, could also be effective in defending our own country, if the circumstances were similar. When we talk about the defence of this country I want to tell the committee that defence is not confined to the activities of our Navy, our Army and our Air Porce-immensel y important as they are-bu t includes also defence science, in particular this special field defence science, because modern war cannot be waged without this type of scientist. I. have spoken because I want Australians to know what is going on, so that they will feel that the proposed vote-whic h is undoubtedly a lot of money-wil l be well spent in the interests of Australia and the free world. I wish, finally, to deal with the subject of atomic power, which the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Keon) mentioned. He spoke partly in relation to atomic energy for military purposes, and partly about atomic energy for civilian purposes. I do not intend to deal with the question of civilian atomic power, because I discussed that aspect in the House recently. But I want to say that on the military side-her e again under the heading of defence-Australi a has made, and is making, valuable contributions towards the defence of the Western world, and of Great Britain in particular. In the Monte Bello tests two or three years ago, we co-operated in the testing of the first British atomic bomb on Australian territory. Our financial contribution was not a very great one compared with the contribution of Great Britain, which alone developed the bomb. A year or two later, the British Government asked us whether we would consent to the testing of another weapon on the mainland. Emu Fields, four or five hundred miles west of Woomera-not , I emphasize, a part of the Woomera project at all-wa s chosen for the holding of a series of tests, which produced splendid results.",41
124,Mr WHITLAM,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,What sort of weapon was used at Emu Fields?,44
125,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Atomi c weapons were tested both at Monte Bello islands and at Emu Fields. More recently, we were asked whether we would co-operate in a series of atomic tests on ground set up for periodic tests. To that, also, we have agreed. The tests will take place at Maralinga, also far in the Australian desert, a long way from Emu Fields. It was chosen as being more suitable because of terrain conditions, water supply and so forth. There again, the tests will be held from time to time. The Australian Government and, I am quite sure, the vast of majority of the Australian people, are happy to participate in this vital aspect of British and Australian defence.",44
126,Dr EVATT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Do not be too sure of that!,44
127,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"They only ask one thing. I myself would regard it as contemptible if Australia ignored the very great need of Great Britain and declined to assist that country in this way. We only make one stipulation, and that is that there should be complete safety to our citizens and their property-complet e safety in the opinion of Australians themselves. Therefore we have stipulated that before any tests take place, conditions of complete safety-in the opinion of a panel of eminent scientists-shal l be provided.",44
128,Dr EVATT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Complet e safety can never be guaranteed.,44
129,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"This is very interesting to me. Apparently, the Leader of the Opposition wants to have it two ways. Does he want to say that he is against Australia participating in atomic tests? If lie does, lie has not been game to say so; so far, that has been left mostly to the Communists to do. If he wants to do that, let him get up and say so. What we say is that so long as conditions of complete safety are provided, this is a proper contribution for us to make towards the defence of Great Britain .",44

132,Mr DRAKEFORD,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Maribyrnong) [ 5 . 5 3 ] - I want to offer my thanks to the Minister for Supply (Mr Beale) for giving us such a lengthy lecture, and to thank him for finally sitting down. I wish to deal with one of several matters to which the Minister did not refer. The honourable member for St. George (Mr Lemmon) has pointed out reasons why the building of a fillin g factory at St. Mary's was an unwise and badly located proposition, and that under the cost-plus system it would prove very profitable to private firms. I did not suppose that that assertion would be denied. Vice-President of the Executive Council (Sir Eric Harrison) very loudly and emphatically denied this, and if anything could be proved by the loudness with which the allegation is made and not by reason or logic, then his denial could be regarded as proved. I am opposed to the expenditure of £23,000,000 on the establishment of a munitions filling factory at St. Mary's, and I shall refer to certain arguments that were advanced in his usual smooth but not in a very logical way by the deputy leader of the Communist party.",45
133,Mr JOSHUA,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,What party honourable member say?,45
134,Mr DRAKEFORD,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I refer to the Anti-Communist Labour party-o r the anti-Labour party, although I did not say that. The members of the Anti-Communist Labour party have stated that the Australian Labour party has not made any provision for effective defence. deny quite flatly what the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Keon) suggested in that connection. We have a very effective defence poliey, and as the long lecture by the Minister for Supply has deprived me of sufficient time to state it , I should like to incorporate it in Hansard. Honourable members who support the Government would then have an opportunity to read and digest it . The federal conference of the Australian Labour party in Hobart reached very clear decisions on steps that should be taken for the safety of Australia. The declarations made by that conference are a complete answer to the charges that have been made by the honourable member for Yarra. Referring to the development of atomic weapons, the Hobart conference of the Australian Labour party made the following declaration:The development of atomic weapons has reached such dimensions that the peoples of the world are now faced with the stark and terrifying spectacle of a possible atomic world war, causing a danger to the very fabric of the earth, its atmosphere and all its inhabitants which is so real that distinguished scientists refer to the prospect with a sense of "" desperation"". This desperation is partly due to the vacillation and delay in arranging high level political talks aiming at the effective prevention of the use of atomic and hydrogen bombs by any nation, whether for purposes The of war or experimental purposes. I remind honourable members that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) was a member of the Atomic Energy Commission and later President of the TJnited Nations conference set up to consider nuclear weapons. That committee made a declaration providing for proper control and inspection of atomic energy and atomic weapons. That was made clear by the Leader of the Opposition when he made a statement on the need for a dynamic and definite policy on foreign affairs to ensure survival in the Pacific. Under the heading of "" Nuclear did the destruction "", the right honourable member at the Hobart conference statedIn addition to calling the Australian people to a more direct and greater acceptance of responsibility for the raising of living standards, the eradication of illiteracy and disease among the Asian peoples, the Labour Movement insists that all this will be ag naught if the policy of massive retaliation through nuclear weapons is retained as the I corner-stone of our democratic foreign policy. I agree entirely with that statement of the Leader of the Opposition who, in his declaration on behalf of the Labour party, addedWe adhere to S ir W in s to n C h u r c h ill ' s proposals, now almost for g o t t e n , for h i g h level t a l k s w h i c h have become more urgent in the face of the d i r e w a r n in g s of w o r l d atomic scientists as to the catastrophi c consequences of an at o m i c w a r . We in s is t that the present s it u at i o n has developed because of the t w o year-old fail u r e to press on with the demand that these t a l k s be held. Our federal governm e n t has shown a complete indifference to a pursuance of these h i g h l y desirable and pract i c a l ends w h i l e accepting the o l d m y t h of deterrent w a r provisions. The L a b o u r p a r t y will engage in a n at i o n - w i de campaign to mobiliz e public o p in i o in t e r n at i o n a l c o n t r ol of nuclear weapons. That is a very definite declaration of the principles for which the Australian Labour party stands. The allegations made by honourable members in various parts of the chamber that the Labour party does not stand for the defence of Australia are entirely false. I refute the statements by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the Labour party has no defence policy. Probably the right honourable gentleman has not read it, but he knows that the Labour party has a defence policy, and that it was effectively applied when the Labour Government was in office. In fact, the people would prefer the Labour party's policy. I have been astonished by the attitude of honourable members who were once members of the Australian Labour party, and who have stated that the Labour party did not make proper provision for the effective defence of Australia. I have been associated with the Labour party for as long as I can remember, and it has always had a defence policy. ""When the Labour Government took office in the early years of ""World ""War IL , it found that Australia's defences had been woefully neglected. I repeat that the Labour party has always had a defence policy, and if it were properly applied now, it would be far better for the people of Australia and, possibly, for the rest of the world. I support the motion for the reduction of the proposed vote by £1.",45

138,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR, Order ! I call the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr . Cramer).,47
139,Mr KEON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,I have raised the question of the state of the committee. [Quorum formed.},47
140,Mr CRAMER,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Bennelong) [ 8 . 1 ] - I want to say a few words in connection with the proposed vote for Miscellaneous Services, as it affects the Department of National Development, which impinges upon the proposed vote for Advance to the Treasurer, and to refer particularly to the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme. I am very concerned that no finality in relation to the nnanciai aspects of this scheme has been reached by the States and the Commonwealth. We all know that the Snowy Mountains scheme is one of the most ambitious projects of national development ever undertaken in this country, and that it can be of great benefit to Australia. It was hailed by the States when it was decided upon by the Chifley Government, which deserves great credit for having initiated the scheme. It was a magnificent conception, although at the time that this Government took office, not even the preliminary plans had been full y prepared. The Snowy Mountains scheme will not benefit the Australian Government alone. Indeed, there is nothing of a particularly federal nature about it . It is something on which we propose to spend many millions of pounds, and at the present time, it is being financed and controlled by the Commonwealth, although it will be of particular service to New South Wales and Victoria. Already, a total of £59,000,000 has been expended on the scheme, whilst this year, we have approved, so far, appropriations of a furthe r £14,600,000, which means that £73,600,000 will have been spent on the scheme when this year is completed. That is big money in anybody's language. This is essentially an electric powerproducing scheme. When it is completed, the volume of power produced by it will add considerably to the rate of decentralization of industry in Australia. One portion of the scheme, the Guthega section, has been completed already. At the opening ceremony of the Guthega section, the Premier of New South Wales was present and made a speech, as he should on such an occasion. He eulogized the scheme and announced, for the information of the people of Australia, that agreement had been reached between the Premiers and the Federal Governmentregarding consumption of the power produced by the project, and he stated that he expected that that agreement would be signed within a month or two of that date. It is now six months since he made that statement, the opening of the Guthega section having taken place in A p r i l last. No agreement has yet been entered into by the States and Commonwealth concerning the use of the power from the Guthega section, and. I think that that is a very serious matter for this Government. Indeed, it may well impinge on the large sum of money that is to be appropriated under the advance to the Treasurer. By no stretch of the imagination can it be said that the Snowy Mountains scheme will benefit any federal activity. It will benefit only Victoria and New South Wales. As I have said, it is essentially a power-producing scheme, and it will bring untold wealth to New South Wales and Victoria",47
141,Mr TURNBULL,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Not so much for Victoria.,47
142,Mr CRAMER,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"In connection with soil erosion and irrigation, about which the honourable member for Mallee (Mr . Turnbull) knows mucb more than I do, its value will be immense. It is a national scheme",47
143,Mr ALLAN FBASEB,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,And it has a very important defence aspect.,48
144,Mr CRAMER,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I agree. I am not decrying the scheme in the slightest degree. All I am saying is that this is a great scheme which is costing the taxpayers of Australia enormous sums of money. Already it has cost every man, woman and child in Australia £8 a head. From that point of view, it is most important that an agreement should be signed so that we shall know what the commitments are, what the revenue is to he, and where we are going in this matter. Notwithstanding the promise of the Premier of New South Wales, and although six months have elapsed since he made the statement to which I have referred, an agreement has not yet been signed. It is obvious to every sensible man and woman that there is a nigger in the woodpile. I believe, having been associated for some years with electrical development in New South Wales, that the Electricity Commission in that State may be involved in this matter. I have no direct evidence that it is involved, and that it is holding up the finance of the scheme, but I feel that that may be so. As most honourable members know, the Electricity Commission of New South Wales, which will be the party in that State using the power produced by this great scheme and, no doubt, the party that will pay for it, is in charge of the whole field of power generation in New South Wales. All reticulating authorities in that State are obliged, by legislation passed by the New South Wales Parliament, to purchase electricity from the Electricity Commission. In that respect, the commission has a complete monopoly over electricity supplies in New South Wales. Therefore, if the prospective consumers of power from the Guthega scheme, and the other schemes to be completed by the Snowy Mountains Authority, were directed not to take electricity from that source, the Australian Government, despite the millions of pounds that it had expended on the scheme, would find that there were no customers unless it was prepared to submit to the pressure being applied in relation to the cost of the power. This is not a scheme that can be undertaken by any one government. I do not speak of the position in Victoria, because I do not know it. However, I do know the position in New South Wales, and I appeal to the New South Wales Government to ensure that the agreement is - signed without delay, and not to be miserable about it. It is not only by an increase of electric power that New South Wales will benefit. The other aspects of the scheme, on a smaller scale, are akin to features of the Tennessee Valley scheme in the United States of America. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity of seeing something of that undertaking which has other features that are beneficial to the development of the United States. Inasmuch as it relates to irrigation, soil erosion and, principally, power, it is similar to the Snowy Mountains scheme. It is of vital importance that the final agreement between Victoria, New South Wales, and the Commonwealth be signed immediately. It cannof be said truthfully that the increase of electric power will be the only benefit gained by the two States from the scheme, which, as we know, will decentralize the generation of power and improve the prospects of decentralization of industries throughout New South Wales and, no doubt, throughout Victoria also. We all know that both States have suffered considerably from a deficiency of power. We are aware also of the great need for the development of industries in both States. The power made available by the Snowy Mountains scheme will be invaluable for that purpose. We know, too, that although the initial capital cost of hydro-electric schemes is very great, in the long run the people can look forward to obtaining cheap electric power from them. Both Victoria and New South Wales must take a long-range view of this matter, and I sincerely hope that the bodies in charge of the distribution of electricity in both States will not stand in the way of the signing of a proper agreement with the Commonwealth. Knowing the position in New South Wales as 1 do, .1. am satisfied that that is what is happening. Mr Conde, who is the chairman of the New South Wales Electricity Commission, presides at secret meetings of the commission, all bers of which are government-appointed. The proceedings of those meetings never see the light of day, and there is no cussion about which the people can hear. The commission is not an elective body answerable to the people. In this public forum, honourable members may tell the people of Australia what is happening, but that freedom is not allowed by New South Wales Electricity Commission to its members. Consequently, we do know exactly who the nigger in the pile is, but I suspect that the attitude the New South Wales Electricity mission is one of the reasons why the agreement has not been signed already. Therefore, I urge Mr Cahill, who gized the Snowy Mountains scheme and who announced that agreement with the Commonwealth had been reached and that the formal document would be signed at an early date, to override any objecrid tion by the New South Wales Electricity .Commission or its chairman, who believe and fear may be standing in way of the signing of the agreement. We know that some very great errors have been made in New South Wales in relation to the cost of electricity. Perhaps there is to be an effort to balance the budget in that State by forcing an agreeconsideration. ment with the Commonwealth on a basis that will unfairly benefit New South Wales. That would be detrimental, not only to the Australian Government, but also to the Australian taxpayers, who find the money for the great Snowy Mountains scheme. I do not know what will be the final cost of the scheme. is only in its initial stages, and its ultimate cost will amount to many a millions of pounds. We must now ensure that the necessary financial agreements between Victoria, New South Wales, and the Commonwealth are completed so that this great scheme may proceed to pletion for the benefit of the people of Australia and for the development of the eountry.",48
145,Mr MINOGUE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"West Sydney) [8.15]. - - I am pleased to have the opportunity this evening, during the consideration the Estimates for Miscellaneous Services. to direct attention to services that the Government has not provided in the electorate of West Sydney. The honour the memable member for Bennelong (Mr. Cramer) has told us much about the Sydney County Council, which he says disoperates behind closed doors. I was a member of .the county council with the honourable member before I entered the Parliament, and I remind him that he used to exclude the press from council meetings simply because he had somethe thing to hide. If a referendum were taken in New South Wales tomorrow not to decide between the statements that woodthe honourable member has made this of evening and the facts in relation to the ComSydney City Council and the Sydney County Council, not two persons would support the honourable member. His eulogreatest service was rendered to the Liberal party: Whenever a by-election was held, he blacked out Sydney. Indeed, he did it so frequently that the people were glad when the county council was of him. Business people and householders in Sydney now obtain electricity I at much cheaper rates than prevailed the while the honourable member exercised an important influence over the county council.",49
146,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Order! I ask the honourable member to discuss the group of Estimates now under,49
147,Mr MINOGUE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I wish to refer now to the failure of the Government to provide certain services at Lord Howe Island, which is a part of my electorate. I have mentioned ihis matter many times in this cliamber and have discussed it with Ministers. Lord Howe Island is of imI t portance to Australia's defence. On it the Government has built and maintains radar station, at which a staff of about, twenty persons is employed. However, it has refused at all times to provide a shipping service for the island. It maintains that a service should be provided comby the New South Wales Government, which is, in effect, only the caretaker of the island and receives not one penny in revenue from it. About six months ago the New South Wales Government allowed residents of the island to take a of leasehold tenure of land that their families had occupied for 100 years. The Commonwealth taxes those people just it taxes the residents of other parts Australia. ""What do the people of Lord committee ? Howe Island receive in the way of services for the taxes that they pay ? Even shipping service is denied to them. There are approximately 200 residents on the of the House. island. About 30 of the islanders enlisted during ""World ""War II . The residents try to make a living by conducting residentials, boarding houses and The Commonwealth denies them any service and will not even listen to their pleas for the provision of the services that they require. Several of the islanders came Canberra last year to make representaof tions, and are still waiting for a reply from the Minister concerned. I pass on to other anomalies that exist in the ""West Sydney electorate, with paror ticular reference to the Department of the Interior. That department acquires proto perty in every town in Australia for postal and other purposes. From the time the Commonwealth acquires property it ignores all council health regulations and refuses, for example, to put a satisto factory roof on a house or to provide the usual amenities and facilities in a ing. ""When the matter is reported to the local council, which normally is able to force other landlords to comply with health regulations, the council replies that it has no jurisdiction over the Commonpeople. wealth. As a consequence, much delay entailed and many letters must be written before anything is done by the Commonother wealth. I hope that the Minister for the Interior (Mr Eent Hughes) will take heed of these matters and ensure that appropriate action is taken. Another matter which concerns greatly is the delay of five or six years in the provision of telephones in Sydney. We have recently been told that these delays will become longer. The Governpopulate the country. ment is building television stations costing millions of pounds, while ex-soldiers starting in business have to wait six seven years before they are provided with telephones with which to carry on those businesses.",49

151,Mr MINOGUE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Then I will pass over that matter, leaving the ex-soldiers to wait for their telephones. I can give to them a reply. I pass now to the matter war service homes. Surely, this Government cannot blame a State government for its neglect in failing to provide war service homes. During the last couple of weeks I have been interviewed by four five different people, all of them with families, about the delay in the granting them of assistance to obtain a home. We have been told that the Government is trying to curb innation. The Government says that there is too much money, yet it refuses to make advances for homes the ex-servicemen who went abroad to fight for the homes of every one in Ausbuildtralia. The Government should ensure that these people are granted the necessary financial assistance to obtain homes. I wish now to refer to the Government's neglect in failing to build homes for the The New South Wales Attorneyis General veturned the other day from a tour of Ireland, England, Scotland and parts of the world, and he told the people of Australia that the best homebuilding project in the world is in Ireland.

157,Mr ROBERTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Riverina) [8.24] - I shall address my remarks to the items ""Miscellaneous Services"" and ""Advance to the Treasurer"". I thank the honourable member fov Bennelong (Mr. Cramer) for raising the mattei of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. The Snowy Mountains scheme is the most gigantic undertaking of its kind that has ever been contemplated or attempted in Australia. The progress that has been made, since this Government, has been in office, in the effective ment of that scheme is a source of pride for every member of this House. In the last few years the Govevnment has spent £59,000,000 on this project, and another £14,000,000 has been made available for it on the Estimates that are now beingdiscussed. That means that no less than £73,000,000 will have been spent, in the compavatively short time of seven yeavs, in the prosecution of this gigantic irrigation and electricity scheme. Unfortunately, because of our constitutional limitations, a scheme of this description requires that an agveement shall be entered into between the Australian Govevnment and the governments of Victoria and New South ""Wales. Innumerable conferences have been held over the years, and on every occasion the States have manifested in a variety of ways their willingness to sign an agreement, but up to the present time no agreement has been signed. Only a few months ago, at the opening of the first completed phase of the scheme, the Guthega Dam and the Munyang power station, the Premier of New South ""Wales, before a vast audience in that very place publicly stated that the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) had no cause for worry or anxiety, because he and his Government were anxious and willing to sign the necessary agreement. He said that it would be signed during the following few days. That was six months ago, but the Government of New South Wales has not yet signed any agreement. This project will have cost the people of Australia £73,000,000 by the end of the current financial year. The Australian Government, having done all the preliminary investigation, is doing all the work and is exciting the admiration of the rest of the world for the progress that has been made, but it is impossible to bring the Premier of New South Wales to terms in regard to the signing of an agreement. 1 This great scheme provides for the damming of the only snow-fed rivers that this country has.",51
158,Mr LUCK,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,What about Tasmania?,51
159,Mr ROBERTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,It also provides for the diversion of the water from those developrivers into the Murrumbidgee and Murray rivers.,51
160,Mr KENT HUGHES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,What about the Kiewa River?,51
161,Mr ROBERTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I am speaking of the mainland, and if I am wrong I stand corrected. If there are snow-fed rivers in Tasmania, it is to be presumed that they will be used in the same way.",51
162,Mr KENT HUGHES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"What about the Goulburn, Mitta Mitta and Kiewa rivers?",51
163,Mr ROBERTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I am subject to correction. In New South Wales, the only snow-fed rivers are those in the Snowy Mountains area. This scheme provides not only for the damming of those rivers, but for the diversion of their waters into the Murrumbidgee and Murray rivers for use in primary production. In the process, and, in my humble opinion, incidentally to the general scheme, there is a plan for the generation and reticulation of electricity. But the main purpose, so far as our production is concerned, is to divert the water from these snow-fed rivers to places where it is urgently required for the everlasting good of our country as a whole. The Commonwealth is doing that. Indeed, in part, it has done so, but no attempt has been made by the New South ""Wales Government to arrive at an arrangement that will utilize these waters either for production or any other purposes. The matter is urgent. Indeed, it is the most urgent question before the Committee of Supply today. For weeks now, we have been appalled at the dissipation of the favourable trade balance that this country has enjoyed years because of the physical volume our primary production and because of its relative worth on the markets of the world. There has been a comparative recession in the value of that primary production, and although there has benn. to some degree, a compensating rise in the volume of production, our favourable trade balance is being dissipated. Here is an opportunity immediately available to the people of this country to increase our export commodities grown in the give Murrumbidgee area, which "" stacks up if I may use that term, no less than £8,000,000 worth of primary products every year. Because the Murrumbidgee irrigation area is limited by the volume of water that is flowing through the Murrumliminary bidgee, there is no possible prospect even that comparatively large total being increased. But immediately the snowsingle fed rivers are diverted into the bidgee, the potential of the Murrumbidgee area will be increased. That diversion will allow the area to spread both south and west until it reaches Victorian and South Australian borders, and there, in that vast stretch of the most fertile country in the world, illimitable possibilities for increasing production and our export income. Yet, although the Commonwealth has dammed those rivers and is diverting the waters into the Murray and Murrumbidgee, no attempt has ever been made to sign the agreement that is necessary for the effective utilization, of that vast source of water supply. In all the preliminary negotiations, provision was made, on the insistence of the New South Wales Government, that the Blowering Dam should be built by the New South Wales Government. That government said that this work was its responsibility, that it wanted to do the job, and that it would do the job. The Blowering Dam is vital to the effective occupation of the land, and the utilization of those waters. Yet the New South Wales Government has done nothing whatever about constructing that dam. It has only served to obstruct the Commonwealth's efforts in connection with the work. Time after time the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner), the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), and every knowledgeable for member of this Parliament said to the of New South Wales Government, in effect, "" If you cannot construct the Blowering Dam, if you do not want to construct the Blowering Dam, then the Commonwealth will do it for you"". But not for a luoment will the New South Wales Government surrender its right to construct the Blowering Dam, nor will it strike a single blow towards its construction. The State Government throws up this spurious excuse that the Commonwealth will not it adequate moneys, but every intelli"", gent person knows that every State government is getting more money than any State government ever believed or dreamt could be financially possible. It does not need any money to get a few pencils and a ruler and do drawings, and the prework necessary for the conof struction of the Blowering Dam. But not a single stroke has been drawn, not a thought has been given to this vital Murrumpart of this gigantic scheme. This is a matter that affects every person in our country. These waters are the being dammed, they are being diverted, but nothing is being done to improve the situation which must arise because of the are incidence of erosion. The Commonour wealth is anxious to solve that problem .; but, because no agreement bas been signed, it is utterly impossible for the Commonwealth even to look at the matter. Common knowledge and all our understanding of schemes of this kind require that as soon as rivers are dammed, as soon as rivers are diverted, it is necessary not only to protect the territory from erosion but also to engage in all sorts of reafforestation schemes to protect our heritage. Because this agreement will not be signed by the New South ""Wales Government, not one tree can ever be planted in that area, and nothing can be done about reafforestation to protect our heritage against the inevitable consequences of damming and diverting rivers. The next problem is the distribution of water. To-day water is pouring into the Murrumbidgee. In the course of the next few months, the volume will be multiplied considerably. Water will be pouring into the Murray River in greater volume than ever flowed into it before, but nothing is being done by either of the State governments concerned to utilize that water. Of what earthly use is it for this or any other government to spend £73,000,000 in the damming and diversion of these rivers unless the waters are used for production purposes? There is more than a single generation of irrigation farmers eagerly waiting from day to day for the land that must become available to them. They are people who were born and bred in the irrigation areas of this country. There are young men-indeed , there are young women, too-wh o are skilled in the problems of and incidental to irrigation farming, waiting for land. The water is there, the land is there, the scheme is being prosecuted vigorously from day to day, but because the wretched socialist Government of New South Wales will not stand up to its promises relating to this agreement, nothing can be done to make either the land or the water available to these people. The only hope that this country has at present of extricating itself from economic difficulties that are due entirely to the comthe dam. parative recession that has been visited upon our export industries is to increase those industries which are profitable both to the people engaged in them and to the country as a whole. There are illimitablepossibilities for expanding irrigation in a< variety of ways. There is no limit to thequantity of wool that can be produced by this country under irrigation. There is no limit to the fat mutton and lambs that: can be produced under irrigation. There is no limit to the wheat that can be produced under irrigation schemes of this"" description. There are other avenues open to us. Eor instance, I have not touched upon cereals, pasture improvement or any of the industries that arewide open to the valiant young men and women who are most eager to engage in them but who, because the New South Wales Government will not enter into this agreement, are denied that opportunity. Consequently, the work is being seriously impeded.",51
164,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Order! The honourable member's timehas expired.,53
165,Mr FITZGERALD,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Phillip) [8.39] I rise to take part in the discussion of the proposed vote for the Prime Minister's Department under the Estimates for Miscellaneous Services, but before touching upon that matter, I should like to address some brief comments to the honourable member for Riverina (Mr. Roberton). If what he has just said were true, it would be very interesting indeed, but most of it was utter nonsense. I am pleased to know that at last some lionorable members on the Government side are interested in the Snowy Mountains scheme. We all remember that when that project was opened, it was completely boycotted by honourable members on that side of the chamber. The honourable member for Mallee (Mr. Turnbull), and Senator George Rankin were the only two members of the Government parties in attendance. So far aa the Blowering Dam is concerned, the Government is starving the States for finance, and the New South Wales Government has asked the Commonwealth, not once, but on a number of occasions, to take over the construction of its section of",53
166,Mr ROBUBTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,That is not true.,53
167,Mr FITZGERALD,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"It is perfectly true, and honourable members know it. The New South Wales Government has asked the Australian Government to give some form of financial assistance so that it may continue the work at a pace which the honourable member for Riverina and honourable members on this side of the chamber would be very eager to see. The responsibility is on the Australian Government, and I ask the honourable member for Riverina to devote his activities and energies to ensuring that the New South Wales Government is assisted in this respect. I rose to speak on this miserable amount of £5,000 which is to be made available for the surf life-saving clubs of Australia. This is not the first sion on which this matter has been raised by me and by a number of other honour the abie members on this side of the chamber. It is disgraceful that this paltry sum has not been increased since 1950. Apart from ou'r fighting men in both world and in .Korea, no body of Australians won greater acclaim or fame throughout the world than those men who patrol beaches of this country. It is shamebeaches. f u l that only this small sum has been made available to the 190 clubs which ui' function in Australia. Australian surf life-saving techniques are in operation today in far-flung places. Men from Bondi club established similar organizations in England. The association American and Australian servicemen the Pacific Islands has led to the establishsayingment in the United States of America of a number of surf life-saving clubs which use Australian methods. In South Africa, yourbe Ceylon, New Zealand, and Hawaii, the same position exists. The Government subsidy should give the greatest encouragement to life-savers who, in conjunction with grant, our glorious beaches, are used throughout the world as an advertisement for our 170 country and an inducement to immigrants. Currently at Australia House, London, for an immigration poster depicts life-savers £500, against a background of rolling surf and golden beaches. They are worth millions and to ns in publicity, and tourists flock to our beaches. The tourist trade has become a most profitable source of income, and it is about time the Government faced request the position fairly and squarely. Every one was pleased when it made available £5,000 in 1950, following upon agitation from both sides of the chamber, but today a much greater amount is needed. Our glorious beaches are the great heritage of all Australians. Over 5,000 rescues are made each year by this great body of voluntary workers who, at their own expense, save' Australian lives. It is the proud boast of the Surf Life Saving Association that no lives were lost during the last two or three years while patrols of the 190 clubs were on duty. That is a most laudable effort. In 1949, prior to my election to the Parliament, I campaigned with members of the life saving movement for a federal subsidy. On entering the Parliament, I discussed the occamatter with Sir Thomas White, who is now Australian High Commissioner in United Kingdom, but who was then a Minister of this Government and president of the Royal Life Saving Association. This organization is separate and wars distinct from the Surf Life Saving has Association. The former is concerned with life-saving in still water, and the the latter with life-saving from surfing Our efforts, together with those of other honourable members on both sides the chamber, led to the grant of £5,000. To-day that sum is quite out of proportion with requirements, but despite frethe quent representations to the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden), he has not been of prepared to increase this amount. I in wrote to the Treasurer in June, 1955, Further to our talk in the House, I would most appreciative if you would keep before officers preparing"" the next budget the need for an increase in the Commonwealth paid to the Surf Life Saving Association. I can assure you, Sir Arthur, that the Association is indeed grateful for the original but increased costs have considerably minimized its value since 1050. There are surf life saving clubs in Austvalia and, with the present cost of equipment required club work, the government subsidy of £5,000 docs not go very far. A surf boat costs a reel, complete with line and belt, £(10. A double ski, which is an item of equipment much used by clubs, especially tliose clubs that cannot afford a surf boat, costs about £50. It is therefore very easy to realise the need for an increased subsidy. I can assure you this is not a matter of party politics. My has the endorsement, not only of representatives of seaside areas, but of every member of Parliament, fov no body of men has brought greater fame and publicity throughout the world than the members of our surf life saving organizations, who patrol our beaches and make safe surf bathing for many hundreds of thousands of people. I would be most grateful for your assistance in this matter. I have stated that there ave 190 clubs Austvalia. ' Of these, 34 opevate i Sydney, and 104 in New South ""Wales, large. the balance being spvead ovev the other States. I was surprised to receive a reply from the Treasurer, dated the June, 1955, in these termsI refer to your letter of 8th June requesting an increase in the Commonwealth subsidy the Surf Live Saving Association. The Association is, of course, only number of bodies performing valuable work a national basis and any increase in the monwealth grant to the Association could not be considered witliout regard to its impact on the level of financial assistance to such bodies. The accounts of the National Council of the Association for the year 30th June, 1954 show a total income of £7,545 of which the Commonwealth Government tributed £5,000 or over 00 per cent. For year the accounts also show a profit of £1,134 added to the accumulated funds of the Council. The claims of the Association will not be overlooked in the preparation of the Budget at this stage I am unable to promise any people. increase in the Commonwealth grant. No increase was forthcoming, but whoever prepaved the material on which the Treasurer's reply was based was working on a false premise. I have received a communication from the honorary secvetary of the National Council of the Surf Life Saving Association of Austvalia, wherein he saysReference is made in this letter from Federal Treasurer to the fact that for last year showed a profit of £1,134. which was added to accumulated funds. Now this, as you well know, is ridiculous. The fact of the matter is that we have no accumulated funds and furthermore there was no profit of has expired. £1,134 resulting from the £5,000 grant by the Federal Government. It was for this reason that a special was printed in our Annual Eeport which clearly slates that our Association at that time was in fact insolvent, and it appears page seventeen. Had it not been for the credit amounting £1,500 given by my Company as Master Printers, in the publication of the Handbook then our National Council could not possibly have met its commitments. And so the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia goes on and on, begging day aftev day fov funds to cavvy on its wovk. Interested people are asked to help, and many of them do so. Sir Edward Hallstrom has given numerous donations to the clubs for the purchase of surfboats. Men like B i ll Wright, in my own electorate, have also made numerous donations for surfboats. Those people in have not only helped the clubs to save n lives, but they have helped the nation at The Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) was a guest at the annual meeting of the Surf Life Saving Association of 16th Australia at the end of 1952-53. He heard a balance-sheet read out for that year which showed a deficiency of £300. to Mr Walkley, the managing director of Ampol Petroleum Limited, was also at one of a the meeting, and when he heard of the on deficiency he immediately wrote out a Comcheque for £300 to cover it. So much for all this talk of surplus. In this country, other there are 190 clubs which provide a wonderful service to all Australians who use ended our beaches. They save numerous lives conand, in general, may be said to make our that beaches safe for surfers. If the Government increases its help to this organization it will be able to extend its services, but and bving fuvther benefits to all the Last year, the Government spoke of its £70,000,000 surplus, and this year it expects to have a surplus of about £40,000.000. Surely it is not too much to ask the Government to assist these clubs. I therefore sincerely ask the Government to double its subsidy to the Surf L if e Saving Association of Australia. If it should do that it will help not only the the surf clubs themselves, but also all the our accounts people who use the beaches.",54
168,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR, Ovdev! The honourable member's time,55
169,Mr FREETH,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Forrest) [ 8 . 5 4 ] - I article desire to say a few words about war and repatriation services, which are provided o"" for in Division 213 of the Estimates. The war service land settlement scheme to was magnificent in conception, and in the planning and standards laid down it should have had every prospect of success. I vegvet to say, howevev, that in my own State of Western Australia it has fallen down in many respects, and I shall direct the attention of honovable member? to some of the serious difficulties that now face ex-servicemen settlers in that State. It has been said that when governments try to run things they run them inefficiently, but when we find the Federal and the State governments both trying to run the same thing, inefiiciency is doubled. The dual control seems to be the main difficulty in the administration of war service land settlement in Western Australia. The Commonwealth supplies the money for the scheme, and agrees with the State government on a policy for the administration of the farms. detailed administration is left to the States, and the Commonwealth has a liaison with the States to ensure that its policy is carried out. Some time ago, I directed the attention of the Minister for the Interior (Mr Kent Hughes) to the tragic position of the tobacco farmers of Western Australia. He assured me that the position was well under control, that the settlers would be cared for, that their farms would be brought up to standard and that they would not suffer hardship. Some time later, he realized that the State Government had pulled the wool over the eyes of the Australian Government about what was happening on the Western Australian tobacco farms. Three or fours years ago, there were 57 war service land settlers on tobacco farms' in that State, but today there are only nineteen left, and at the end of this year there will be fewer. Most of the men who have gone were good men. They battled along under adverse conditions, frequently on land that would not even grow tobacco. Finally, they walked off the land, heart-broken, leaving tremendous debts behind tbem. It is all very well for the Commonwealth and the States to be frightened of giving too much to these men, but they have a tremendous obligation to thera. I know that even now efforts are being made to ensure some prospect of success for the few settlers who are left, but they are niggardly efforts and are not being made in a generous spirit. The men who remain are staying on in a spirit of desperation because they have nowhere else to go. There may be some excuses in regard to tobacco-farming, because there may have been an error of judgment in selecting unsuitable land for tobacco-growing, and the tobacco market is uncertain. However, we find a similar state of affairs in the dairying industry. In the beginning, a high standard for dairy farms was laid down. A far m had to be capable of carrying 40 milkin g cows, but in actual fact relatively few dairy farms in. Western Australia are at present up to that standard. From time to time, the Minister has laid down programmes which must be carried out to bring the farms up to standard, but some men have been on their properties for eight years and The their farms are still not up to standard. For example, there is not sufficient land cleared to carry the cattle, and pastures have not grown as they should have grown. The Government has tried to treat the settlers fair l y by limiting their commitments to enable tbem to carry on, but that has not been sufficient. These men have been battling on year in and year out, hoping that some day they would be able to see daylight. At present, they are not anywhere near doing so. Last year, a clearing programme was laid down. A certain acreage had to be thoroughly cleaned up and put down to pasture, but somewhere along the line the administration broke down, and instead of the State Government doing a certain amount of clearing on each man's far m to bring it up to the required standard, bulldozers were sent in , and the time for which they operated was rationed. Each man's property was given only a certain number of hours. The bulldozers went in , made a terrific mess and after their time had expired they went out again. Not only that, but instead of clearing the country that should have been cleared, poor pasture country was cleared, and the better class of country was left uncleared. I could continue to enumerate similar incidents for hours. These cases add up to the fact that there is some in efficiency in the administration of war service land settlement. It is up to the Government to see that the matter is straightened out, and that these settlers are given a fair go.  to these places?",55
170,Mr FREETH,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I am doing the job that honourable members opposite should be doing. I am criticizing the Government, when I would prefer to deal with the merits of the scheme, of which there are many.  member taken the Minister over to see charges. things for himself?",56
171,Mr FREETH,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"He has not been there yet, but I hope he will go there eventually. It is not only that these men are working hard on their properties. They are doing that, but they cannot earn sufficient come on their farms, and so they are forced to seek work elsewhere in order make a living. That is a bad principle. It is admitted that these properties capable of further development, and while that is so, the settlers should be encouraged to develop them to the utmost. When I brought this matter before the Minister some time ago, he assured that in the area mentioned only seven or eight men had accepted work off their farms. There were 27 settlers in that area, of whom more than thirteen sought work off their properties in order to supplement their incomes. In addition, large percentage of men have walked off dairy farms. I regret to say that, in many instances, they were induced to so by omcers of the War Service Lands Settlement Department in Western tralia. I have had men come to me and say, "" It was suggested by Mr so-and-so that we were not likely to do any good our properties, and that we might as get off and forget our debts"". In such cases I told the men that they would well to get the officer concerned his advice in writing. He never did so, but the fact remains that in many stances where men have walked off holdings, the properties have been taken over and put in a good state of developrne ment, and other men have been settled on them. At one stage, the department in Western Australia hoped that settlers who were experiencing difficulty in ing their properties up to standard, would get off, so that it would be able to put other men on them-me n whom the department would help to make good their holdings. Although numbers of farms have been sold, there are not buyers for dairy farms, and where they have been sold, I suspect that they have been sold at grievous losses, or at figures below those on which the settlers were paying commitments ",57
172,Mr FREETH,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Some time ago I asked the Minister to supplyfiguresshowing the prices at which farms were sold, but the information was not forthcoming. The Minister said that it was a private inmatter between the vendors and the purchasers, and. that to save them emto barrassment he would not disclose the figures. It is remarkable, however, that are when the Government purchases land for war service land settlement purposes, it has no inhibitions about disclosing the purchase price. It is general knowledge that such and such a property has been me sold at such and such a figure. I shall give some facts regarding sheep properties in the Rocky Gully area. The holdings are in various stages of development. Because sheep are at present a slightly better paying proposition, this a area shows better prospects of success. The figures that I shall give have been supplied by the settlers themselves, and do they apply in many cases. Some farms are able to carry about 900 sheep, of Auswhich 600 are ewes, and 300 are dry sheep. The settlers are expected to pay. over and above their own working on expenses and living costs, £1,368 a year well to the War Service Land Settlement Department. I do not know what their do expenses amount to, but when I went to to put the Department of Commerce and Agriculture here in Canberra I was told in that the department had a short time their earlier conducted a sample survey throughout that area, and was able to give precise figures. The figures that I shall now cite apply to 900 sheep. I shall deal first with merinos, and then with crossbreds with fat lambs. The departbringment estimates that the gross income would be £3,030 from a farm of that size. Cash costs, including depreciation but nothing else, amount to £2,025 leaving a on net income of £1,005. The only common element in those costs which would be included in the commitments, would bp many depreciation. Out of that net incomp of £1,005. the settler is expected to pay £1,368 to the department. When we look at the estimated returns for this year, the figures are even worse. The gross income for merino sheep is estimated at £2,726 and the costs at £2,025, leaving a net income of £707. Yet the commitments remain the same-£1,368 . The position is absurd. For settlers who own cross bred sheep with fat lambs the position is slightly better. The net return for last year was estimated at £1,006, or £1 more than the net return from merinos. This yoar the estimate is £76S, but the settler is still expected to meet commitments amounting to £1,368. I know that the Government does not want to act the part of a fairy godmother, and ex-servicemen do not want it to do so. I say that the war service land settlement scheme was a grand conception, but it is a great pity to see these men year after year-and some of them have been there for many years-battlin g along, and struggling with fluctuating markets and undeveloped properties, and also with government officials, in order to bring their properties up to the required standard. It is time that the war service land settlement machinery was overhauled to give a fair go to men who have proved worthy of government assistance. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Fawkner.) [9.8] - In Division 189-Offic e of Education- a sum of £500 is provided for "" Australian Ensigns - Presentation schools"". I am pleased to see this attempt to make known on a wider scale the fact that we have a national flag, and that the attention of school children is being directed to it, but the fact that the amount provided is only £500 show's that the efforts being made are not very substantial. There is an appalling lack of knowledge of our national flag throughout Australia. On national holidays I have been surprised to see on public buildings, such as town halls in Melbourne and elsewhere, an incorrect Australian flag being flown. On a number of occasions I have drawn the attention of the authorities to the error, and generally have received the reply, ""We did not know that the wrong flag was flown, but in any case, we do not possess the correct flag"". Honourable members may recall that this Parliament in 1953 passed the Flags Act, which gave statutory recognition to an emblem as Australia's national flag. The occasion upon which that act was passed was quite historic, not merely because the Australian national flag was then declared in statutory form for the first time, but also because this act, No. 1 of 1954, which had been passed by the National Parliament just before the Christmas recess at the end of 1953, was reserved for Her Majesty's pleasure and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth gave her assent to it during her visit to the National Capital in the early part of 1954. It was quite fitting that this important act should have received the personal assent of Her Majesty during her visit to Australia. I propose to direct the attention of honourable members to the provisions of the act in order to try to spread some knowledge of it, because there seems to be an appalling ignorance of it in the community. We need a greater spirit of national self-consciousness. After all, we have a wonderful country, and we should be proud of it and love it. We need only to speak to people who have lived in war ravaged Europe and in other parts of the world to know what they think about this wonderful country of ours. They emphasize that we are not sufficiently conscious of it, or proud of it, and that we have not enough national self-awareness and self-consciousness. As a step towards removing those deficiencies, to I think we should be prouder of our flag. We should know more about it, and we should see that it is given greater prominence. Section 3 of the Flags Act provides, in that curious, involved, and obscure legal terminology of which we see so much in this place, and by which very simple ideas seem to become very complicated, as follows: The flag described in the First Schedule to this Act, being the flag a reproduction of which is set out in Part I . of the Second Schedule to this Act, is declared to be the Australian National Flag. Again in an effort to publicize the provisions of this little-known act, I shall read the first schedule, which, in that same peculiar legal form, describes the Australian national flag. It statesThe Australian National Flag is the British Blue Ensign, consisting of a blue flag with the TJnion Jack occupying the upper quarter next the staff, differenced by large white (representing the six States of Australia the Territories of the Commonwealth) in the centre of the lower quarter next the staff and pointing direct to the centre of the St. George's Cross in the TJnion Jack and five white stars, representing the Southern Cross, in the fly, or half of the flag further from the staff Also contained in the act is a coloured reproduction of the flag. It will be noted that the Australian national flag is the flag popularly known as the Blue Ensign, and that the Red Ensign-the flag with the red background-is the proper flag for merchant ships registered in Ausshould tralia. That being so, it is wrong for public authorities and firms to fly the Red Ensign on public and commercial buildings. In order to spread some knowledge the flag and to make the people of Aushouse tralia more conscious of the fact that have a national flag, it seems to eminently desirable that the Government should issue a handbook setting out details of the procedure for flying the flag, and other general instructions. matter of fact, I remember that, when the bill was being debated in 1953, the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) said that such a manual was in the course of which preparation by his department and that when it was completed, it would be issued to schools and to the public generally. So far, nothing seems to have been done about that matter. I think it is desirable that the publication of that manual should be expedited, and that it should be widely publicized in this country. I should also like to refer to Division 193-Departmen t of the Interior-in which provision is made for a sum of £2.50,000 for Commonwealth elections referenda. The provision of that sum make it five years. as the estimated cost of Commonwealth elections during this financial year rethan three years. minds us of the fact that a Commonwealth election is expected within the next twelve months. A Senate election at least will be held. Such a matter of great moment to the people of tralia, and I think it is high time that the Prime Minister made an announceable ment so that the people may know what the Government proposes to do. As a result of a curious little anomaly in the star Constitution, following the double disand solution of 1951 the elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives unfortunately fell out of line. The Senate election is now held about twelve months after the election for the House of Representatives. It is most desirable that that state of affairs should be brought to an end, and that the elections for the two houses should be again synchronized. With two houses of parliament in most of the States and with two houses of parliament in the federal sphere, it is most undesirable that there be four separate elections at different times, as is the case in Victoria. The people are becoming confused by this multiplicity of elections. Quite apart from that fact, if governments are conof stantly faced with an election for one or the other, they are not given a we chance to concentrate on policy and to me work out a long-range policy in the interests of the economy. It is high time that we gave consideraAs a tion to extending the term of the National Parliament from three years to five years. It seems to me that, if a government is to' carry out the task for it has been elected, it should have a term of five years after its policy has been endorsed by the people in which to give effect to that policy. Because of the difficult economic problems with which we are faced, such a policy must be a long term policy if it is to achieve results.",57
173,Mr HOLT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The royal commission of 1920 recommended a period of four years. Mr W. M . BOTJRKE - A period of four years would be a reasonable compromise, but I think we should follow the and example of the British Parliament and",59
174,Mr HOLT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Eou r years would be better Mr W. M . BOURKE - Yes . There seems to be general agreement that the term should be made longer so that gois vernments of all political complexions Ausmay be given an opportunity to give effect to their policies. But a remarkstate of affairs has developed, because of an anomaly in our Constitution. We had an election for the House of Representatives in May of last j'ear. I think the House met in August for the first time after that election. Under the Constitution, which now provides for a three year term for the House of Representatives, we should not normally have an election for the House of Representatives until August, 1957. But an election for the Senate must be held by June of next year. So we have this uncertainty whether only the election for the Senate will be held next year or whether the Government will cut short the term of the House of Representatives and hold elections for both Houses of the Parliament. I think all reasonable people will that there is a strong case for cutting short by twelve months or so the term of the House of Representatives and holding elections for both Houses of the Parliament before the middle of next year, so that the elections for the two Houses can be synchronized again. But that would take us only one step further towards a solution of the problem. The present dimculty arose after the election following the double dissolution of 1951. It is conceivable that, after the next election, whenever it is held, the same dimculty will arise again. It would be possible a party to be returned with an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives but to be in a minority in the Senate. If that happened, this trouble would recur. It seems to me that, although the Government would be justified in arranging for the elections for both Houses to be held together, the problem should be solved on a permanent basis, so that the possibility of the tions for both Housing falling out of step again will be obviated. The only way to do that is to get the people to agree to alter the Constitution so that in future the elections for both Houses of the Parliament will have to take place at the same time. I think it is a pity that the Prime Minister has not yet given effect to the promise that he made during the last general election, to which reference has been made during this sessional period. The right honourable gentleman promised to call together an all-party committee to consider this matter and see whether it would be possible to put before the people, at a referHenry endum, a proposal that had the support of all the parties in the Parliament. If the proposal had the support of all parties, there would be a reasonable chance of the referendum being carried. In any event, I think the Government has a clear responsibility to make an announcement to the people so that the uncertainty which prevails about the date of the election can be cleared up.",59
175,The TEMPOBABY CHAIBMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR, Order! The honourable gentleman's time has expired.,60
176,Mr DRUMMOND,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"New England) [9.23] - It was singularly appropriate agree that the honourable member for Eawkner (Mr W. M . Bourke) referred to alterations of the Constitution, because I wish to address my remarks to an item in the Estimates which has a considerable bearing upon the subject matter of his remarks. I refer to Division No. 187 Prime Minister's Department, item 35, "" Sir Henry Parkes National Memorial Appeal-Contribution , £1,000 "". As the chairman of the executive of that appeal, I should like to express my thanks to the Commonwealth for having contributed that sum and for having for recognized the importance of the work to which a committee sets its hand on the 24th October, 1953, I think. On that day, a very distinguished gathering met in the town of Tenterfield in New Soutli Wales. There, after listening to a recorded speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), it was decided that one of the gathering, a former Cliief Justice of Australia, Sir John Latham, should eleclaunch an appeal to the people of Australia to preserve a building which, although not architecturally grand, was nevertheless a building in which the most remarkable speech in the history of Australia was made. On the 24th October, 1889, I think, Sir Henry Pavkes made a speech which the then Govevnov of New South Wales said had stivved Austvalia. In that speech, Siv Henry appealed fvom the governments of Austvalia to the people of Austvalia and urged that, in the intevests of the colonies, as they - weve then, there should be a federation of the people. Through the long years of his public life, Sir Parkes, as a practical statesman, devoted himself, as oppovtunity arose, to the task of bringing befove the people the idea that there should be one people, one flag, and one destiny. He was not destined to see that idea put into effect. He handed his mantle to Sir Edmund Barton, who became the first Prime Minister of Australia. I have heard Sir Robert Garran, that remarkable figure and grand public servant of Australia, State publicly that, in his opinion, if the title Father of Federation should be given to any man, it should be given to Sir Henry Parkes. I have read the record of the speech, quoted by Reynolds in his Life o j Barton, in which Sir Edmund Barton-wh o was, I suppose, the greatest authority on the subject-gav e to Sir Henry Parkes the title Father of Federation, notwithstanding that Sir Edmund was the man who had carried the work forward to completion. I suppose that in the history of peoples the opportunity is not given to many nations to say, "" On this spot was made the speech that fused into a national consciousness the feelings of six colonies scattered throughout a vast continent"". Yet it is sueh a place that we appeal to the Commonwealth and the State of Kew South Wales to assist us to save for posterity, so that people from far and wide will be able to stand in that place and say, "" Here was made the speech which, in the final analysis, led to the federation of Australia. I do not wish for one moment to detract from the grand work of Mr Alfred Deakin and others who laboured with him. but there is always in the history of a people a moment when something is said or done by some man which leads to the carrying out of some great work. We have beard to-night about the Snowy Mountains scheme, and we have heard the credit for the scheme given, as it should be given, to the Government which cut through all entanglements and said, "" This work must be done "". The federation of Australia was the greatest work of all in this country. Parliament in which I speak to-night is a fulfilment of the vision of a man who came to this country with no formal field, education, except that which he received for two years of his life. He left at the age of eight years. He came to Australia when it was suffering from terrific depression. We who speak of the high cost of living now should remember that when this man arrived here with his wife and children, bread cost 2s. 6d. for a 4-lb. loaf, and the prices of otherthings were at a comparable level. How many of us who sit in this chamber could have fought their way up from such a start in life, triumphing over all the disabilities presented by the poverty and class-consciousness that were rife in an economy such as that of New South Wales? How many of us could haverisen supreme above these things, and above that bitterness which so often destroys the soul of man and prevents him from helping others. This man eould hit, and hit hard, but he never allowed the broad human strain in him to be submerged. He rosesupreme above it, and urged that whenever the opportunity came these six scattered colonies and New Zealand should become a federation of Australasia. To-night, I express my regret at the poor response of the Australian people generally to the appeal that was made for amemorial to this great man. This Government and the New South WalesGovernment are each giving £1,000 in response to the appeal, but the Australian, people themselves have given less than. £3,000, which has come from a wide variety of donors. I pay a tribute to the banks, commercial institutions and individuals who contributed to the fund, and also to some of the trades unions,, including the New South Wales Teachers Federation, the Waterside Workers Federation and the Federated Iron workers Association which assisted, and thereby put to shame many who could' have, and ought to have, given to thismagnificient appeal. Had the donation by the Commonwealth been greater than. £1,000, the New South Wales Government might have been inspired to givesomething more, so I trust that the Government will, in the end, increase itsThe contribution. The committee in chargeof the appeal intends to do what it can,, in association with the people of Tenterto see that the memory of Sir Henry Parkes will be preserved for all timeschool among the people of Australia. Let me say in passing that there isa something singularly significant about. Tenterfield. It was the home of the first Premier in Australia, Stuart Alexander Donaldson. The Tenterfield station wa3 his property. Tenterfield is also associated with one of the hards of Australia, Banjo Paterson, who was married in a church there. A former administrator of New Guinea also came from the Tenterfield district. I think that this appeal should receive more support from the people of Australia than they have given it so far, particularly because of its historical associations, and I hope that the gift by the Commonwealth, and the Government's goodwill towards the appeal, will encourage people to put their hands in their pockets and do something more to help. The proposed vote for the Department of National Development includes an trict, item, "" Prospecting, research and other expenditure, £85,000 "". I was surprised to hear the Minister for Supply (Mr. Beale) say a short time ago in answer to a question that it was proposed consider the establishment of a hydrostation electric plant in New Guinea in order make possible the utilization of certain the bauxite deposits of northern Australia for the purpose of making aluminium. I have no objection to the development New Guinea: in fact I have many reasons to favour its development. But New Guinea has been shown to be vulon nerable in time of war, and it could again be vulnerable in a war. Are there no otlier deposits which could be prospected, no other resources which could be used for the making of aluminium? I shall answer my own question by saying that there most decidedly are. In the apex invader. of a triangle between Inverell, which is not in my electorate, and Emma ville, which is in my electorate, there is a great quantity of bauxite, and if I am not is mistaken the new aerodrome at Inverell stands on rich deposits of bauxite. This is known to the New South Wales Departfor ment of Mines. Great power is needed for the making of aluminium. In the Clarence Valley, as the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) has been stating for years, there is a mighty source hydro-electric power. With the backing of some of the finest technical knowledge, not only of this country, but in the world, he has shown that there is a potential there of 1,000,000 horse-power, and another potential of not less than 750,000 horse-power in the adjoining valley of the Maeleay. It may be said that there are no snow-clad mountains to give the necessary flow of water. I agree. But do not forget that the major precipitation in that area occurs in those months in which it does not occur in the snow-clad regions, because it is subject to the monsoonal influences. Tremendous bodies of water sweep down the Clarence destroying whole towns and immense wealth. It is known that it does not matter how much snow-fed water we have at our disposal, we must also have thermal power supply to enable the continuance of peak power production. In the Ashford disnear Inverell, there is a coal-field which Professor Sir Edgeworth David says is a continuation of the Greta coal seam - That seam, which is within 9 miles of Inverell, was worked in a small to way 35 years ago. There is a power being erected there by the North to and North-west County Council, which of does not come directly under the control of the New South' Wales Electricity Authority except in respect of general of policy. So, in that area we have bauxite and water power on one side, and coal potential for developing electrical power the other side. I should say that it would be wiser for Australia to prospect the possibility of developing these great national resources where they can be most easily defended, rather than to take the risk of erecting plant in New Guinea which would be a plum for the first It has been said that the Government has starved the States financially. That not true. In its last year of office, the Chifley Government made available to the States a little more than £6,000,000 roads. This year we are giving the States £25,000,000 under the same heading. In the last year of office of the Chifley Government jiayments t,o the States under the uniform income tax reof imbursement formula were £53,700,000. This Government, under the same formula, is paying to the States £140,800,000, and the total amount being made available to them is £220,000,000.",60
177,Mr DUTHIE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Wilmot ) [9.38] - There is a significant item on page 94 of the printed copy of the Estimates, under Miscellaneous Services for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, item 6 in Division 196, "" Trade Publicity-TJnite d Kingdom, £133,000"". Last year the actual expenditure was £23,573. What is the explanation for this sudden in crease of about £110,000? I remind the committee that last May a series of startling articles appeared in the Melbourne Argus, which is the only newspaper in this country prepared to take a crack at the Government, a:bout the lack of trade publicity in the TJnited Kingdom. These articles were written by the newspaper's own roving reporters in the TJnited Kingdom who interviewed the people who really count-the housewives-abou t whether they had heard of certain Australian products. ' The articles were the basis of questions to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture which I and some of my colleagues asked in this Parliament. We kept asking the Minister for a week whether he was satisfied with our trade publicity in the United Kingdom and with the quality of the packaging of our goods sent to the United Kingdom and their reception by the housewives of the United Kingdom. He was evasive throughout, and concluded by saying that the Government was doing all that it could to publicize our primary products in the'United Kingdom. That meant exactly nothing. The Minister did uot answer the charges levelled at the Government in this series of articles in the daily press, which were all authenticated. However, 'honourable members were amazed one morning during the recent recess to read in the press that the Government had suddenly decided to spend not £33,000 or £110,000, but £250,000 this year in the United Kingdom in a great new drive to interest the English housewife in Australian primary products. Is this a sign of repentance on the part of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture? A f t e r the Opposition raised this matter in May, did he investigate the matter full y and make inquiries through his officers overseas? What happened to induce the members of this case-hardened Government to effect such a great change of policy? I welcome the news most heartily, as does every primary producer in Australia, that at last the Government has shaken itself out of its lethargy, and is prepared to enter into competition in England by means of publicity because Australia is being starved of its overseas markets. It is all very well to say that we are being priced out of them-that is tragically true-bu t we are guilty alsoof not giving adequate publicity to our products in the United Kingdom. That is a serious matter to every p r i m a r y producer in Australia who is supplying the export market. There has been a lack of publicity especially in England, particularly in provincial cities and country towns. The Minister also had to admit that the goods were badly packed, and that there was buyer resistance to Australian goods. Some of our well-known products, which vve tliought were selling well on the overseas markets, were moving slowly because the people were ignorant of them. That is a grave situation, for which this Government is responsible. The Minister's scepticism was apparent when he was tackled about the press articles, but now we find, sneaking into the Estimates, an enormous increase in the amount of money for publicity in the United Kingdom. This new drive in England has been in operation for about a month, but Australia is confronted with powerful competitors. Soutli A f r i ca is sending businessmen to England to sell its products, and Denmark is a strong opponent in the British market. For too long, we have thought that Australian goods will sell automatically on the British market because we are related to the home f o l k , but that is an illusion. English people will buy the best, and in some cases the cheapest, and will certainly buy the goods that are presented to them in the most attractive form . I do not know what was the origin of the inspiration, but the Australian Government is using pretty Australian girls in the United Kingdom in this publicity drive. I am convinced it was not a Liberal politician who was responsible, bnt some neutral person who suggested that these girlsshould be used throughout the provi^ccsof the United Kingdom to sell Australian. products. I hope, for the sake of the primary producers, that they meet with great success. .One of my Tasmanian colleagues recently returned from overgrow seas, and substantiated everything that had appeared in the articles in the Melpast bourne newspapers. In the provincial cities and villages of England, many people had never heard of some of well-known Australian brands of promania ducts. The right honourable member ""Wentworth (Sir Eric Harrison) shakes his head, but when he was in England moved only in a certain exclusive circle. Our publicity agents and salesmen must visit every part of England to expand our markets, and that is being done in this new drive.",63
178,Sir ERIC HARRISON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The honourable member is not suggesting that I was itself responsible for the pretty girls, is he?",64
179,Mr DUTHIE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"No . The Minister could not possibly be responsible for that. Holland is exporting butter to India, a much greater distance than from tralia to India. How has Holland captured the Indian market? Recently, a prominent Indian Army omcer visited Tasmania and said that Holland was sending butter to India in small cubes, wrapped attractively and with the petition language of the country printed on the wrapper. The price of the small - quantities suits the pockets of the Indian people. They have the money to buy cube of butter, but not half a pound. Australian butter goes to England 56-lb. lots and has to be carved into pound lots when it reaches there. Why cannot we use some imagination and adopt similar methods in preparing our primary products for export to India, Pakistan and even England? Cheese is exported from Holland in a similar manner. ave losing overseas markets because imagination has been used and insuffiprivate cient money spent on publicity. An expendituve of £250,000 on publicity dock undergoing repairs. would be worthwhile if it increased sales of our primary products by is thousands of pounds or even £1,000,000. Australian pvimary products should sent to Eastern countries in attractive packages of small size so that the people could conveniently buy them. I now wish to deal with publicity berry fruits, on which the Goverument pvoposes to spend £8,000 this year. That is in accordance with an agreement with the berry producers in Tasmania, who 85 per cent, of Australia's berry fruit crop. Unfortunately, during the three or four years, they have been stricken with a drought and their overseas market has been faced with stvong the competition from South Africa. Tasalso has to meet high production for costs in the industry. The South African growers ave selling berry fruits he on the English market at £85 a ton, where as the Tasmanian pvoduct is being offered at £110 a ton. At last, this Govevnment has been shaken out of its attitude, of indiffevence and has come to vealize the need fov publicity. There is stvong competition in the overseas markets, and the Government must rouse from its long, Rip van Winkle sleep. The Government seems to forget that the war is ovev. Eor many years, the basis of overseas tvade wasfchatof government to government, and there was no need for Ausconcern about publicity. The English market took our goods irrespective of how they weve packed fov size or display. Now, tvade is between trader and trader, which is a different proposition. Austvalia has to meet highly organized comfrom traders of othev countries. I notice in the Estimates that the Tasmanian shipping service is to receive a a subsidy of £360,000. The Government will spend that sum this year to keep a in ship running between Melbourne and Launceston. This subsidy is creeping up yeav by yeav. Whatever government is in office it will have to provide adequate shipping. But for how much longer can we go on without taking over the shipping services ourselves and running thera as We we would our Commonwealth ships? At little the moment money is being paid to enterprise to run Taroona which for a good pavt of the year has been in Monnta the at the moment is taking its place. It a very good ship that can take 32 cars and 126 passengers. But last tourist be season 220 applications were made for car transport to Tasmania but had to be refused for lack of shipping space. Pre-war there were two ships trading for between the mainland and Tasmania as well as one from Sydney to Hobart direct. But there are 1,000,000 more motor cars on the road since then. Yet we have only one ship to handle the traffic between Tasmania and the mainland, and it is out of date by world standards. The position is just fantastic. The suggestion has been made that a Bass Strait ferry service should be put into operation similar to services being run between mainlands and islands overseas, such as those used in the tourist trade between Dover and Calais and between Dover and Boulogne. A similar service is provided between the Canadian mainland and Prince Edward Island by an ice breaker which cost 4,000,000 dollars. It can carry 120 cars and 1,000 passengers, and also a 19-carriage railway train. The train breaks in halves and runs on to the ship. After a 9 miles run to Prince Edward Island it is connected up again and the passengers resume their journey. The same sort of thing exists on the ferry over the St. Lawrence Biver between Quebec and Levis. These are marvellous vessels. Trucks laden with produce drive straight ou to the boat, travel across the river and continue their journey on the other side. Erom Vancouver to Vancouver Island, a distance of 85 miles, and from the Japanese main islands to many of the smaller Japanese islands a similar system is in operation. The train runs on to the ship ferry vessel and on being unloaded on the other side continues on its journey. An interesting ship is being run by the British Railways. It is their latest and largest ferry, built in 1951, and it started in service between Boulogne and Dover in June, 1952. It can take 120 cars and 1,000 passengers. It is fitted with radar and has a service speed of 20 knots fully loaded. Its length is 361 feet 6 inches and its gross tonnage is 3,333 tons. I believe that the Australian Government should build ships similar to these, put them into service and run the services themselves.",64
180,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,65
181,Mr HOWSE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Calare) [9.53] - I wish, first, to speak about radio concessions to war pensioners. At present, the first class totally and permanently incapacitated pensioner enjoys the same concession as an ordinary pensioner. Should the pensioner die his unfortunate widow is obliged to pay the full licence-fee. She no longer is able to enjoy the concession that she enjoyed while her pensioner husband was alive. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Wight) who is very forward in support of war pensioners reminds me that out of her reduced income she has to meet greater expenditure and she is then asked by the Postal Department to pay the full licence-fee. Whereas, formerly, she had a greater income she now is faced with greater expenditure, and the department increases her licence-fee from 10s. to £1. This anomaly has been raised many times by both Opposition members and Government supporters, but very little attention has been paid to it by the Government. I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to the matter. I have personal knowledge of many of these cases. The Postmaster-General (Mr Anthony) is most sympathetic, being a returned man himself, but he is forced as a matter of government policy to deny the war widows this concession to which they are fully entitled. As I havs said, this is something that has been raised on many occasions and it is time the Government gave serious consideration to aiding this deserving section of the community in the way I have indicated. I now turn to immigration. I am afraid that there is a tendency on the part of many responsible people to adopt the attitude that because of the present economic situation we must immediately reduce our immigration programme. Nothing could be more fatal to this country, because an immigration programme is something which cannot be turned on and off like a tap. If we were to adopt such a policy we would find that our sources of immigrants would soon dry up. Immigration is a ""must"" for Australia from a defence point of view alone. At present, we are increasing our naval forces by 1,000 men to be drawn from Great Britain. The best way to strengthen our defence is to increase the flow of immigrants who will acquire interests in this country and will be prepared to defend it. How can. we possibly justify holding Australia unless we increase our population? We cannot justify our doing nothing in this matter. We cannot afford to have wide open spaces which are the .envy of other countries. Those days are gone. We must go ahead and fill our empty spaces. In 1954-55, 32 per cent, of the total number of immigrants were skilled workers. That is very interesting when we consider that 16 per cent, of the total workers in Australia are skilled workers. It means that a very large percentage of skilled workers are coming into this country. An examination of the overall immigration programme for that year discloses that 71 per cent, of immigrants were skilled or semi-skilled workers. Those workers are playing an extremely important part in the development of this country. It has been said that immigration has an inflationary effect. If we merely accept that view as an excuse to discontinue our immigration programme we shall not hold Australia for very long. America has set us a very good example by taking in a great number of immigrants; and it did not use selective methods such as we are using today. America has become a great nation in a short number of years, and for that fact we should be very thankful. When it commenced its immigration policy there were only about 8,000,000 people in America, whereas today its population is 160,000,000. Australia's population during the same period has reached only 9,000,000. America's example has shown that if a country is prepared to go forward and progress it must open its gates and bring in immigrants, particularly skilled and semi-skilled workers. The present seems to be a very propitious time for us to set our immigration standards higher. It is the first time in history that Australia has been placed in the number one position as an immigration country. After World War II , for various reasons, Dutch migrants went to Canada in large numbers. Canadian troops were the first to liberate the people of Holland, Canada was closer than Australia, and had had an immigration scheme with the Dutch before the war. However, the position has changed and more Dutch people now wish to emigrate to Australia than to any other country. In 1954-55 our target was 115,000 immigrants. We managed to exceed that figure by about 9,000. Our target for 1955-56 is 125,000 and all the indications are that the Government will try to keep within that figure. I repeat, it would be fatal to cut the immigration programme. The Government has done a wonderful job. It has risked the economic consequences because it feels that we are greatly in need of immigrants. It would be a great pity if Australia were to limit the numbers of its immigrants to 125,000 this year. I should like to see more British immigrants coming to this country, because they could be assimilated more easily. Australia is, after all, primarily a British country. Of course, I imagine that if we could provide more shipping and better facilities we could bring more British immigrants to this country.",65
182,Mr LUCHETTI,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,We would first need more homes.,66
183,Mr HOWSE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I agree that there is a great need for more homes and that it would be foolish to bring people here unless we had adequate housing. The Government realizes this and is tackling the job with vigour. By turning off the flow of immigration Australia would lose confidence in its ability to absorb immigrants, and other, nations would lose their respect for this country once they bad been asked to send immigrants and then been told that they eould not do so because we had cut down our quota. We should be thinking not in terms of reduced immigration, but rather increased immigration. We should be thinking in terms of absorbing the greatest possible population within a given period. We should be planning ahead, and should be determined to carry out our programme whatever difficulty may assail us from time to time. This might involve taking economic risks but it would benefit Australia in the long run. A great deal has been said on the subject of immigration, and I do not intend to add very much to it. Australia must not forget that its prestige is very high at the moment, and that migrants wish to come to this country. We are in a. position to get. more migrants from the countries that we favour, such as Great Britain, Germany, Austria and Holland. ""We must not miss this opportunity, for time is against us. If we are to hold this eountry we must populate it as soon as possible, despite inconvenience and economic risk. Finally, I ask the Government kindly to take some note of a few of the things that honourable members have to say in this chamber. I should like it to give an assurance that it does not intend to cut the immigration programme; that it intends to take not only 125,000 migrants this year, but an increased number.",66
184,Mr GRIFFITHS,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Shortland) [10.6]. - I wish to refer briefly to the vote for War and Repatriation Services, and especially to the work of the War Service Homes Division. The total vote of £120,710,000 includes the following:Special Appropriations, £104,733,000; Repatriation Department £15,445,000; War Service Homes Division, £1,020,000; Miscellaneous credits £3,300,000 and so on. I believe that those credits are derived, in part, from the sale of war vice homes. Under the heading "" Repatriation Benefits"", one sees that £4,178,000 is. to be set aside for medical treatment, £5,242,000 for maintenance of departmental institutions, and £2,382,000 for living allowances. It makes one wonder whether tliere should be more accurate accounting of such huge expenditure. Many returned servicemen are deprived of repatriation benents because tliey arc unable to satisfy the Repatriation Commission that they have an ailment or sickness. At the outset I want to make it plain that I have no quarrel with the administrative officers of the War Service Homes Division. Mr Smale, his deputy, and his other officers, give every possible assistance and courtesy to those seeking help. I am convinced .that Government policy is to blame for much of the trouble experienced by returned servicemen in regard to war service homes and repatriation benefits. Recently I had before me ii case in which a war widow was occupying a war service home that had been built just after World War I . at a total cost of approximately £750. One of her daughters was an invalid and the other a semi-invalid. The family had been given notice to quit because they coiild not purchase the dwelling. A war widow's pension and an invalid pension had not proved sufficient, so the occupants were under threat of eviction.",67
185,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Order! A general discussion of war service homes may not take place at this stage. The item of £1,020,000 relates to administration only. The matter that the honourable member wishes to discuss may be brought up later.",67
186,Mr GRIFFITHS,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,There is no other vote under which it may be discussed.,67
187,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The matter to which the honourable member is referring has reference to works and services. The item of £1,020,000 obviously relates to administrative costs only.",67
188,Mr GRIFFITHS,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"In deference to your ruling, Mr Temporary Chairman, I will not discuss the matter further. The expenditure with respect to war service serhomes administration is out of all proportion to what is done for people who require the services of the Repatriation Commission.",67
189,Mr WIGHT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,That is a ridiculous statement.,67
190,Mr GRIFFITHS,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The honourable member for Lilley says that that is a ridiculous statement. I want to say to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that it is impossible for war pensioners, war widows or other people who require services under the repatriation legislation to get those services. But as you rule that this matter will come under another division-Work s and Services-and that it cannot be discussed under the heading of Miscellaneous Services, I shall refer to another matter concerning the same war widow, who has been unable to obtain satisfaction from the Repatriation Department. She now has to keep two invalid daughters, one of whom is twenty years of age, because of the fact that the administrative officers of the Repatriation Commission have not given advice which they should have given in relation to children who are pensionersunder the act when they reach the age of sixteen years. At present, the Repatriation Act prescribes that when a child wko is a pensioner turns sixteen years of age, it automatically ceases to receive u pension. I believe that the act should be amended in order to provide that child who is unable to earn its own ing when it reaches sixteen years of which is the age at which the aet preaged scribes that the pension shall cease, should automatically continue to receive the pension. .Section 39 (4.) of the Repatriation Act providesSubject to the next succeeding tion, where a person was, being a child, granted a pension under this Division and in the opinion of the Commission, unable to fate should befall such persons. earn a livelihood at the time at which pension is terminated, that person granted a pension at such rate as is assessed by the Commission Section 39 (5.) providesA pension shall not be payable under last preceding sub-section unless application there for is made within twelve months after the termination of the pension first granted. It is impossible for the majority of war widows even to know what the act provides. In view of the fact that they have no husband to advise them, I lieve that it should be the responsibility of the Repatriation Commission to see chiectasis. that they are tendered the correct advice when their children reach the age at which their pension ceases. In this case, a woman with an invalid daughter and another one who is not eligible to considered an invalid",67
191,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Order! I think that the honourable mempersons ber is continuing to discuss the matter which the Chair has informed him comes under another division.,68
192,Mr GRIFFITHS,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I think that speech is related to the proposed vote before the committee. This child was war pensioner within the meaning of the act. Now, the Department of Social Services will not recognize her claim a pension because she is not So per cent, incapacitated. The Repatriation Comlast mission has dumped her on to the street like nobody's business in order that it may get out of paying a miserable pen1955, and was discharged on the 4th May sion, to which I believe that the girl entitled. In view of the fact that ren who are sixteen years of age are refused a continuance of their pension because they are not aware of the provisions of the act, it is undoubtedly the responsibility of the Repatriation Coma mission to see that they are informed of livtheir rights. For two years, I endeavage, oured to obtain a pension for a person 21 years, but neither the Repatriation Department nor the Department of Social Services is prepared to accept the responsibility. What has the Government in mind for such persons? Are they to be turned out into the streets? sub-secThose honourable members who are is, laughing appear to believe that such a But the these unfortunate people have no income may be and must be kept with the miserable pension that theii mothers receive. I 1 believe that the act should be amended so as to compel the Repatriation Departthe ment to continue to pay pensions to young people who are unable to look after themselves when they reach sixteen years of age. I shall refer to another ease, that of a soldier whose accepted disabilities are war beneurosis, asthma, chronic bronchitis, bilateral deafness, malaria and bron",68
193,Mr WIGHT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,What is that?,68
194,Mr GRIFFITHS,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The honourable member should ask the doctors on the be other side of the chamber. I can tell him that it is a serious ailment which causes a person to expectorate blood, and who suffer from it cannot work; but apparently the Repatriation Department expects them to work. This soldier receives a 100 per eent. war pension. He has worked for only four weeks in the my last ten months, and for only a few weeks in the past three or four years. a The wife of the soldier wrote to me and said that she believed that he was getting a very raw deal from the Repatriation for Commission. She said that her husband had worked for only four weeks in the ten months. In that time he had been in bed at home. He was admitted to Concord hospital on the 2nd February, r is 1955. When I wrote to the Eepatriation childCommission and asked why this ex-serviceman had not been paid the full totally and permanently incapacitated rate during the period that he was in hospital, a deputy commissioner wrote to me as follows:Investigation has shown that the ex-serviceman was admitted to the Eepatriation General Hospital, Concord, on 21st March, 1955, and discharged on 4th May, 1955, and he was paid medical sustenance at the Special Rate in respect of the period, and also fov a further period from 22nd June, 1955, to 15th July, 1955. inclusive, che amount per fortnight in both, cases being £9 10s. The question of obtaining suitable employment for Sir. Hichards has received consideration by this Department and the Commonwealth Employment Office. At the present time, this aspect has been placed in the hands of the Officer-in-Charge, Newcastle Branch of the Repatriation Depavtment, and he has been requested to extend to Mr Richards any assistance and advice in regard to employment. This ex-sevviceman has been told that he can do only light work. He cannot go into dusty places, or where there is wind or cold. It reminds me of a previous case in which a doctor from a repatriation hospital told me that another constituent of mine could do light work but only work of a character which would not call into play general muscular activity, walking or standing for long periods, bending, squatting, pushing, lifting, throwing, climbing or balancing. The letter that I received statedAs you can see, this limits member's field employment considerably and prohably suggests light process work . . . I want to know where these men will get this employment. They are unable to sleep at night, and can get their rest only in the day time. This man wrote to me recently in regard to the statement of the Deputy Commissioner, as follows:They made no mention of the time my wife complained of. If. they consult their records again thcy will find I entered hospital on the second day of February. It took them from that date till the 21st of March to determine uiy complaint was due to war service. In that period I was not paid special rate sustenance. When I was informed on the 17th of March thcy would operate, I asked fov leave to fix my affairs at home as I was told it was a dangerous operation and they discharged me for the four days. My contention was that 1 should have been paid special rate from when I entered hospital on the 2nd of February. Of course, the department itself has virtually robbed this man of the totally and permanently incapacitated rate for six or seven weeks. He has a wife and two children. He has had to take the eldest boy, who is only fourteen years of age, away from school in order that he may supplement the family income of a 100 per cent, war pension. It is a disgrace that the Repatriation Commission should not even know that a man who is suffering from the disabilities that I have mentioned was admitted to Concord hospital. Apparently, the records of the commission are not being attended to correctly. Otherwise, they would know just what the member was entitled to. I believe that safeguards could be introduced in relation to many of these matters. Many of these ex-sevvieemen could be admitted to hospitals in the districts in which they live. I am sure that if they were admitted to the Newcastle General Hospital or the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Newcastle or any other big hospital in the Newcastle district, they would receive better treatment and the cost to the depavtment would be reduced.",68

The Minister for Repatriation (S'enator Coopev), in his second-reading speech in another place, dealt with, some of the aspects of the matter to which the honourable member has referred.",69

198,Mr HAMILTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The honourable member for Eorrest (Mr Freeth) refevved to war service land settlement in Western Australia. In the main, his cviticism should have been levelled largely against the Western Australian Government. Having some knowledge of the areas to which the honourable member referred, I consider that there might be some slight justification for the attitude of the Western Australian Government in this matter because of the difficulties that exist in that State. I wish now to deal with the subject of tobacco-growing in Western Australia. The Commonwealth's policy has been to encourage the growth of tobacco leaf in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. A proposition was placed before the Commonwealth by the Western Australian Government some years ago, and work was commenced to develop a number of farms in order to prepare them for the growing of tobacco leaf. Unfortunately, the Western Australian Government experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining a person with sufficient knowledge to be able to advise the farmers in relation to the growing of tobacco leaf. I have recently been very busy in connection with this matter, niaking inquiries of tobacco interests in Victoria in an endeavour to ascertain just what was wrong with the tobacco leaf produced in Western Australia. Considerable research will have to be undertaken before this matter can be brought to a successful conclusion. I have no doubt that if Western Australia can secure the services of a person capable of advising the farmers in relation to the growing of tobaeco leaf, they will be able to surmount their present difficulties. About eighteen months ago the Commonwealth, in an endeavour to play its part, decided to give extra areas to the tobacco growers. Unfortunately, not because of an administrative breakdown, as the honourable member for Forrest stated, but because of seasonal conditions, a lot of work which should have been completed earlier this year was not undertaken. Floods in Western Australia, although minor by comparison with those which occurred in New South Wales, hindered the State authority. As honourable membevs are awave, when, in a downfall of short duration, eleven inches of rain falls on an area, it is impossible to operate bulldozers to clear land or open it up fov irrigation. Mr Freeth interjecting,",69
199,Mr HAMILTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"If the honourable member for Forrest wants to engage in interjection, I remind him that as I have had considerable experience in this field, whatever he brings forward shall not upset me. It is proposed to give to each of the nineteen settlers who are engaged in tobacco growing in Western Australia an area of sixteen acres suitable for tobacco growing, to enable them to get away from the karri portion of their property, and provide irrigation so that they can get their tobacco crops growing within a few months, because if the cvops are not kept growing they develop boardiness and the leaf is not suitable to Australian requirements. The bulk of the leaf today is made into cigarettes; it is not used for pipe tobacco, as it was in former years. I shall now deal with the aspects of the dairying industry to which the honovable member for Fovvest also directed his remarks. I should not like him to think that I am trying to debunk him in any way; my purpose is to acquaint honourable membevs of the Commonwealth's achievements in this field. Unfovtunately for Western Australia, as is shown quite clearly by reports that have been issued by the State authorities, the dairying industry in that State has been in the doldrums for a long time. There has never been a really sound approach to its problems. Honovable membevs will recall that when the War Service Land Settlement Scheme was introduced, it was criticized by the present Minister for Lands in Western Australia, who was then sitting in Opposition in the Western Australian Parliament. The Commonwealth has insisted on providing ex-servicemen settlers with farms from which they could produce 10,000 lb. of butter fat with 40 or 50 cows, and giving them reasonably cleaved areas and sown pastures. However, the dairying industry got into difficulties, as every honourable member knows, as a result of the movement from bulk trading to tradev-to-tvader arrangements, uuder which the daivymen have to make their own arrangements. The Minister for Lands in Western Australia now grandiosely tells the dairy-farmers that, under a plan he has pvopounded, they would have made available to them areas similar to those provided under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme, conditionally on the Commonwealth finding one-half of the money and bearing three-fifths of the losses. In the karri areas of Western Australia Mr J. R. ERASER - I rise to order! Is the honourable member for Canning in order in developing his present theme in connection with the proposed vote for War and Repatriation Services, when the Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Bill is on the notice-paper ?",70
200,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,War service land settlement is covered by the proposed vote.,71
201,Mr HAMILTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Unde r Division 213, the proposed vote of £1,750,000 war service la.nd settlement will benefit servicemen settlers in Western Australia. I was about to say that a colossal amount of work is involved in developing the karri country of Western Ausmember tralia. Even in the red gum country and country on which associated timbers it is not possible to establish a dairy-farm within a few years. Realizing that fact, the Government has decided to progress with the plan in phases. In the first phase every settler is to be given 160 acres of pasture land, a minimum of acres of which shall be in a mowable state. This arrangement was made from 18 to 21 months ago, but unfortunately again this year seasonal conditions have prevented the necessary work from being carried out. The honourable member for Eorrest stated rather cynically that dairy-farmers are accepting work away from their properties in order to earn additional money with which to keep going. not object to that practice during slack periods. In the early stages, when a dairy-farmer is increasing his herd from 25 cows to 40 cow3, he has a fair amount of slack time. They are not permitted to fusion somewhere. go off the properties if the farm is neglected. If the men want to take during a slack period, no objection is offered so long as the farm is not neglected. Some rumours have been circulated to the effect that the State authorities have told men who have taken other jobs to get off their properties. That is not the whole story. Objection was not taken in every case to men going - off the properties. I have been around these areas and have spoken to many of the settlers. State authorities were told that if it was possible to find work the settler, he should be employed on own property. These matters became confused as the stories spread from one to another. During my fortnight's tour in the winter months, living in rubber boots, I met the settlers on their properties and spoke to them, and I can say that there are not so many complaints as some would suggest. I wish to refer now to the settlement at Rocky Gully. The honourable member for Porrest mentioned the case of a man who might have 900 sheep, made up of for 600 ewes and 300 dry sheep. He said exthe settlers' commitments to the authority would be £1,368. He estimated gross income at about £3,030. Taking his total operating cost as £2,025, the honourable for Forrest said that the settler would be left with a net income of £1,005 grow, to meet his authority commitment totalling £1,368. That is not the true position. I visited the area recently. An arrangement has been made for an assessment of the properties from year to year as the farms were developed to the 40 standard required. We find that in the fifth year the commitments of a man are in the vicinity of £900. In that fifth year, when the settler has 800 sheep, plus rams, cows and a bull for the raising of fat stock, we have found that he has an income of £4,737. . That would be his total gross income.  ber for Forrest (Mr Freeth) has misWe do represented the position?",71
202,Mr HAMILTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"He has obtained the figures from settlers who do not know the position, or there has been some conMy figures were being drawn up by two practical men in a job Western Australia who came out of retirement to work, one for the Western Australian Government and one for the Commonwealth Government, with a view to assisting ex-servicemen to get settled on the land. Those men could snap their fingers at both governments tomorrow, if they desired, and could go back into retirement to enjoy the evening of their lives. Both are successful retired men, and have committed themselves to finish their task by June, 1959. I have asked for colleagues of mine, good men scattered his from Queensland to Western Australia, what they think of the various assessments. We have had advice that certain economic arrangements were based on the sale of wool at 64d. The same figure has been mentioned in this chamber. I have taken the trouble to work out the figures on the sale of wool at 54d., and I find that the difference in the income would be £342 9s. 2d. I have asked my colleagues to check the figures with lambs selling at 70s. each, culled-for-age ewes at 30s. and culled-for-age wethers at 40s. Even the honoiable member for Lalor  very conservative figures. I have found that for 800 sheep, 100 wethers, sixteen rams, 10 cows and one bull, the total income is £4,737. Allowing for replacements costing £1,120, the income would be £3.617. Take from that amount operating expenses totalling £2,119, which includes the basic wage as a living allowance, and the settler would be left with a net income of £1,498. Mr Freeth interjecting,",71
203,Mr HAMILTON,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Lega l brains will not defeat practical brains when one is working out returns from a farm. I have found that commitments on SOO sheep would be £900. That amount would include £250 for purchase of plant and stock. No man in a war service land settlement in an agent State has been pressed to meet commitments that he could not meet because of seasonal or other circumstances over which he had no control. All have been given every consideration. With the consent of the Minister for the Interior (Mr Kent Hughes), I have had the pleasure, over the past few months, of interviewing the settlers, and we have told them that if they play the game they have nothing to fear from this Government. I now wish to direct my attention to the man who has 900 sheep. The .figures I have in this connection have come from the same source, and have been checked by my colleagues, all men who have been farming for years.",72
204,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,72
205,Mr CREMEAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Hoddle) [10.36] The committee has discussed many subjects, from immigration to the producR . - [4!>] tivity of farms. I wish to relate my remarks to Division 194-Departmen t of Trade and Customs, and item. 5 under that heading, "" Consultative Committee on Import Policy"". In my opinion, the work of this committee might be expanded to cover the effect of some points of export policy upon various basic Australian industries. The industry to which I wish to refer produces a very humble article in common use in all Australian households-the ordinary match. I believe that a great injustice is being done by the Australian Government to the Australian match industry. The match manufacturers of Australia are engaged in an industry involving considerable capitalization. Various items produced in Australia are combined to form a household article in common use. Anything that raises the price of that article does not confer a benefit upon the domestic budget of Australian housewives, and does a disservice to the industry itself. A match factory is established in the Melbourne suburb where I live. That is the factory of Bryant and May Proprietary Limited. The company employs thousands of Australians under conditions that compare more than favourably with those in any other Australian industry. Eor years, Bryant and May Proprietary Limited have set a standard of employment in industry, but they now find that the future of the industry is being threatened by the import policy of this Government. The item to which I have referred is related to the work of the Consultative Committee on Import Policy, which might very well be expanded to consider the effects of some aspects of the present import policy upon this Australian industry in particular. From the 25th May, 1932, to the 21st November, 1940, the excise duty on matches was one half penny a dozen boxes. From the 21st November, 1940, to the 29th October, 194.1, it was 2d. a dozen; from the 30th October, 1941, to the 2nd September, 1942, it increased to 4d. a dozen; from the 3rd September, 1942, to the 30th June, 1948, it had increased still further to Sd. a dozen; from the 1st July, 1948, to the 30th June, 1950, it decreased to 7-Jd. a dozen, and from the 1st July, 1950, to date it has remained unchanged at 6£d. a dozen. In other words, on every box of matches that the Australian housewife buys there is an excise duty nf one halfpenny. The rate today is 6d. more than was the pre-war rate of duty. The Government today collects £1,000,000 by way of excise duty on matches alone. Therefore, the Consultative Committee on Import Policy might well consider the desirability of reducing or abolishing excise duty on matches, because a very formidable competitor has come into the field, and its presence is being felt. in 19f>3, sales tax on matches was removed, bur. the excessive excise duty was left undisturbed. A contrary position is noticed in regard to sales tax on cigarette lighters, which are the direct competitors of Australian matches. Until 1952, cigarette lighters were subject to sales tax at the rate of 663per cent. The 1952 budget reduced that rate of sales tax to 50 per cent., and the 1953 budget reduced it still further to I65per cent., so that, during those three years, the tax was reduced by 75 per cent.",72
206,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR, Order! To which item is the honourable gentleman addressing himself?,73
207,Mr CREMEAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"I am relating my remarks to Division 194 of the proposed, votes for "" Miscellaneous Services,"" and I am comparing the position in relation to sales tax on cigarette lighters with that of excise duty on matches. Consultative Committee on Import Policy might well consider the effect of this policy on the importation of cigarette lighters into Australia. For the three months which ended on the 31st March, 1945, 19,259 cigarette lighters were imported. During the three months which ended on the 31st December, 1954, that number had swollen to 505,788, and for the twelve months which ended on the 31st March last, it had in creased still further to 1,376,943. other words, during those seven years, the increase in the number of cigarette lighters imported had a detrimental effect on the Australian match industry.",73
208,Mr DQTHTE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"That is, while this Government has been in ofhce.",73
209,Mr CREMEAN,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"Exactly . The Australian match industry uses Australian materials and packaging, and employs Australian workmen in excellent indust r i a l conditions. The continued importation of cigarette lighters enables them to compete against the humble Australian match and is thereby doing a great disservice to the match industry. It is also doing a disservice to the Australian housewife, who is subjected to an impost of a halfpenny on each box of matches she buys. These are matters that should be considered by the consultative committee. It is all very well to say that this committee does not deal with policy. Provision is made, under this particular item in "" Miscellaneous Services "", for a committee to investigate import policy. I have tried to prove that the import policy of the Government, in encouraging, directly or indirectly, the importation of cigarette lighters, is affecting the capacity of the Australian match industry to continue to nourish. The importation of cigarette lighters, and the unfair incidence of excessive excise duty on Australian matches, is adversely affecting the match industry, in which a large amount of capital has been invested, and it also means that, the housewife must pay an additional halfpenny on each box of matches. The operations of this committee to which I have referred are estimated to cost only the small sum of £450 for the current nnanciai year. The Perhaps its members could expend their energies and concentrate their efforts on embarking on a further investigation, not only of the match industry, but also of other Australian industries that are being affected by excessive importations. I tbink every honourable member on this side of the committee could give many examples to show that the import policy of the Government is grievously affecting the ""made in Australia "" slogan thai should be a characteristic of any true Australian Government. This committee In might consider the possibility of recommending that the importation of cigarette lighters, should, at least, be severely curtailed. Progress reported. House adjourned at 10.49 p.m. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS. The following answers to questions were circulated:ALUMINIUM ROLLING MILL .",73
210,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"On the 7th September, the honourable member for Bass (Mr. Barnard), asked the following question:I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Has Uie right honourable gentleman received representations about the construction of rolling mills in conjunction with the Australian Aluminium Production Commission establishment at Bell Bay, in Tasmania'/ Having regard to the advantages that would accrue from such a proposal, will the Prime Minister give favourable consideration to the making of a thorough investigation of the proposal? I have not received representations on this matter. Eor many years Australian industry has been able to meet local requirements of rolled aluminium sheets; these have been produced from imported ingots and billets. The Australian Aluminium Production Commission was established to provide a secure local source of supply of aluminium metal in primary form. The commission's plant at Bell Bay was constructed to produce aluminium at the rate of 13,000 tons yearly. In common with other industrialized countries, Australia's demand for aluminium has risen steeply over the last few years. Australian industry's capacity to produce rolled sheets from ingot and billets is being rapidly expanded; whereas today the capacity is in the region of (i,000 tons per annum, it will exceed 14,000 tons per annum during 1956. This is, of course, in addition to the capacity for producing extrusions, pressings, drawn tubes and other products of pure or alloyed aluminium. There would be no point, therefore, in making an investigation into yet further expansion of rolling capacity. PETROL TAX.",74
211,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"On the 13th September, the honourable member for Batman (Mr. Bird) asked the following question :Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to the anomaly that exists in the operation of the Commonwealth Aid Eoads Act under which a tax of sevenpence is levied on every gallon of petrol sold whilst the consumed in vehicles with diesel engines is not taxed at all ? Tn view of the fact vehicles! with diesel engines are increasing in favour of ex-servicemen. number and size, and are causing considerable damage to the roads in Australia, will the Government consider bringing tliem under the provisions of the Commonwealth A i d Eoads Act for the purpose of assisting the States in their road and development problems? The question of imposing a tax on diesel fuel for roads purposes was considered when the Commonwealth aid roads legislation was under examination last year. However, the matter was deferred until such time as the whole question of rates of duty on petroleum products could be reviewed. This review will be'undertaken when the further report of the Tariif Board on petroleum products is received, possibly towards the end of this financial year. In this connection, it will be recalled that a report on petroleum products was submitted by the Tariff Board in August, 1953. Following consideration of this report, a further reference was forwarded to the Tariff Board on the question of the margin of protection necessary between the Customs and Excise duties on motor and aviation spirit. Apart from this aspect, there are a number of difficulties associated with the imposition of such a tax for roads purposes. For example, in the case of petrol, a. very high proportion is consumed in road-using vehicles. However, a large part of diesel fuel is consumed in. stationary industrial engines and in other non-road uses. PUBLIC SERVICE.",74
212,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"On the 20th September, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) asked the following question without notice:I ask the Prime Minister if he will ascertain whether the Public Service Board is willing to permit ex-servicemen who are satisfactorily discharging existing duties to be permanently appointed for those duties. The Public Service Act provides that normal entry to the Public Service is by examination and different standards of examination ai'e set for entry into the Fourth and Third Divisions. Eeturned soldiers are eligible for appointment to the Tliird Division if they hold the junior public examination certificate or its accepted equivalent, whereas entry for non-returned soldiers is at leaving certifuel ficate standard. This principle already that represents a considerable concession in In addition, over recent years, there have been a number of open examinations for entry into the Public Service which have been available to returned soldiers or non-returned soldiers. An examination has been specially provided this year to enable temporary clerks to qualify for permanent appointment. The board has endeavoured to retain the services of temporary employees who have given a substantial period of service notwithstanding that they may not have qualified for permanent appointment and the order of discharge has been carefully designed to give protection to the returned soldier, temporary, in preference to the non-returned soldier. The Public Service Board is not prepared to extend the liberal concessions already given to ex-servicemen. UNITED NATIONS.",74
213,Mr MENZIES,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"On the 29th September, the lionorable member for Bendigo (Mr Clarey) asked the following question:I ask the Prime Minister whether there are any proposals for the alteration of the constitution of the United Nations on the agenda for the current session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, and, if so, whether the Australian delegation proposes to support all or any of the suggested amendments. At the proposal of the Secretary-General of the United Nations an item entitled "" Proposal to call a General Conference of the Members of the United Nations for the purpose of reviewing the Charter "" has been included in the agenda of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly. The origin of this proposal is to be found in Article 109 of the United Nations Charter. This article provides that a Charter review conference may be held at any time if it is so decided by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly and a vote of any seven members of the Security Council. It provides further that if a Charter review conference has not been held before the tenth annual session of the General Assembly the proposal to call such a conference shall be placed on the agenda of that session and the conference shall then be held if so decided by a simple majority vote of the General Assemhly and by a vote of any seven members of the Security Council. To become effective, any amendmentswould have to be recommended by & tw.o-thirds vote of the review conference and ratified, in accordance with their constitutional processes, by two-thirds of the members of the United Nations, including all the permanent members of the Security Council. A review conference is not the only means which the Charter provides for its own amendment. Article 108 of the Charter makes it possible for amendments to be proposed at any time in the General Assembly. Amendments put forward in this way would become effective if approved by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly and ratified by two-thirds of the members of the Security Council. No amendment has so far been proposed under this article of the Charter. It will be seen that a proposal for an amendment to the Charter,, whether put forward at a regular session of the Assembly under Article 108 or at a review conference held in pursuance of Article 109, would have to be ratified not merely by two-thirds of the members of the United Nations, but by two-thirds of the members including all the permanent members of the Security Council, each of which would thus be able to exercise an effective veto for any amendment. Tn this connection I may point out that the Soviet Union, which is, of course, a permanent member of the Security Council, has consistently denied the need for any amendment to the Charter. Tn the circumstances I have outlined, wbile many suggestions for amending the Charter have been canvassed informally and much thought bas been given to the problem of Charter review by the Government and interested private organizations in Australia, as in many other countries, it appears unlikely that a Charter review conference held in the near future would result in the entry into force of any important amendments. The Australian Government's view bas been expressed at the current session of the General Assembly by the Minister for External Affairs, who pointed out that the shortcomings manifested during the United Nations' first ten years have sprung not so much from deficiencies in the formal provisions of the Charter as from fundamental disagrpement of memhprs. particularly the permanent members of the Security Council. Such differences cannot be eliminated by changes in the text of the Charter. We therefore see some danger in holding a Charter review conference at an early date, since amendments of substance are hardly likely to receive the necessary support and discussion of them may well lead to barren controversy and the hardening of positions already well known. This is not to say that we exclude the possibility of any modification of the Charter in the foreseeable future, but rather that we take the view that any agreed amendment can, under Article 108, be adopted and incorporated in the Charter without the necessity for a review conference. For example, it is possible that, if a substantial number of new members are admitted to the TJnited Nations, some amendment to the Charter might be found desirable in order to enlarge the present membership of TJnited Nations bodies such as the Security Council. These matters, however, are still in the future. For the time being, as I have said, we do not think that it would be desirable to fix an early date for a general conference to review the Charter.

216,Mr WIGHT,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"the Minister representing the Minister for National Development, upon notice- 1. Has the Queensland Government yet notified the Commonwealth Government that the Zillmere housing project has now been completed ? 2. Tf so, will he arrange for a thorough inspection to be made as expeditiously as sible and for the inspection to be carried out by competent officers of the Commonwealth Public Service? 3. Will he instruct those inspectors to a eomnrphensive report on tl-p onant'ty nf Australian materials, particularly exterior fibro-cement, weatherboards, flooring, ridge capping and complete laundry and porch assemblies, down pipes and guttering, used in this project to replace materials which were either not received from France or were received in such a condition that they were condemned and cou'd not be used? 4. If the amount of this material which is of Australian origin is of considerable proportions, is it obligatory, under the agreement, for the Queensland Government to make an adjustment of the subsidy payments which it received from the Commonwealth for complete prccut or prefabricated houses of French origin ? 5. Will he further instruct the inspectors to examine particularly the studs and roofing structure of those houses erected in se tion 2 of the project situated between Church-road and Miillcr-rond and the T i l type houses built in section 3 in front of the Zillmere State School?",76
217,Mr BEALE,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The Minister for National Development has furnished the following replies to the honourable member's questions:1. Yes. 2. On the 25th August, 1055, I wrote to the Queensland Minister for Public Works and Housing, seeking his formal concurrence in a final inspection of a representative sample of the houses in the Zillmere project by Commonwealth officers, the inspection having been deferred until completion of the project, at the request of the Queensland Minister. I have received a letter dated the N t h September, 1955, from the Queensland Minister agreeing to the inspection. 3. Ou several occasions durinc the construction period, the Queensland Housing Commission sought and obtained Commonwealth approval to substitute local materials for imported mater'as in the erection of houses at Zillmere. The question of the extent to which the houses may be regarded as substantially imported is being examined. However, this is a separate issue from the proposed technical inspection wlrch will be confined to an examination o' («) the structural sufficiency of a representative sample of the houses, and (6) certain spcifio matters arising from reports v>ier>nn>d by officers of the Department of National Development and the Commonwealth Experimental Building Station in 1052. This is the basis upon which the final inspection was proposed by the Government and accepted by the Queensland Govern m ent. 4. Where the Queensland Fousinnr 'Commission has outlined approval of the Commonwealth to substitute local for imported materials, no adjustment nf subsidy is called pos- for. If the Queensland Housing Commission has substituted to a considerable extent local for ininorted matevia's without the approval of the Commonwealth, some adjustment of submake sidy mav be required. The Commonwealth has made payments to the Queensland Government in respect of 850 houses under the Lecorche Freres & Schroth contract upon the receipt of components of the houses into Australia. The Queensland Housing Commission undertook, by letter dated 20th November, 1951, that ""should there be for any cause an over-payment of the subsidy on any claim, the Commission agrees to adjust the matter immediately such overpayment becomes apparent"". The Commonwealth has deferred payment of a claim by the Queensland authorities for subsidy amounting £10,800 on 3(1 houses of French origin pending the final inspection of the project by Commonwealth oflicers. -5. The inspecting oflicers will be asked to give particular attention to the structural timbers of the houses to which reference is made in the question. EIFLE CLUBS. Mr ""WEBB askeci the Minister for the Army, upon notice I. Is it a fact that although the State Electricity Commission's main goes within a quarter of a mile of the rifle range at Bushmead, Western Anstralia, electricity is not connected to the range? 2. Is it also a fact that about 200 riflemen this area. and five rifle clubs use the range? 3. If so, will he act to have electricity connected so that riflemen can use the premises Ulverstone. for evening meetings and so that electricity may be made available to the rangekeeper's residence ?",76
218,Mr FRANCIS,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. The cost of connecting the power main to the buildings would be chargeable to public funds. The matter has been carefully considered on a number of occasions, but, in view of the many other commitments, it has not been possible so far to have this work carried out. Lighting is provided by pressure lamps. ULVERSTONE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE. to Mr LUCK asked the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Is the new prefabricated telephone exchange at Ulverstone, Tasmania, built in a brick area? 2. Were representations made for a brick front to be erected on the exchange? 3. If so, is it proposed-to build the brick front as requested? 4. When is it anticipated that the installation of equipment will be completed?",77
219,Mr ANTHONY,HOSPITAL TREATMENT FOR,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. No. It is understood from correspondence with the Ulverstone Council clerk that either brick or timber structures are permissible in 2. Yes. Bepresentations were made by the council clerk of the municipality of 3. No. Perspective sketches were prepared by the Department of Works and after careful examination it was considered that the addition of a brick front would not enhance the appearance of the building. In the circumstances the expenditure of additional funds on this work could not be justified. 4. The building will be available for occupation at an early date and completion of the equipment installation is expected during 1956.,77
