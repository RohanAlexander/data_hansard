2,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER SWORN,"I have received a return to the writ which I issued on 30 December 1996 for the election of a member to serve for the electoral division of Fraser, in the Australian Capital Territory, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr John Vance Langmore. By the endorsement on the writ, it is certified that Mr Steven John Dargavel has been elected. Mr Steven John Dargavel made and subscribed the affirmation of allegiance. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Youth Unemployment: Work for the Dole",13
3,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Speaker, can I seek your indulgence. During question time yesterschemes day, I said in an answer that during the election campaign I was asked on several occasions about work for the dole and I on those occasions that I had no objection to the concept of work for the dole. My attention has been drawn by my staff and by the Liberal Party secretariat to the that in the course of the election campaign amongst the large series of questionnaires were submitted was one which contained a question relating to work for the dole. The response to that question was to the effect, 'We do not support the introduction of a work yesterday. for the dole scheme.' That response was prepared by the campaign headquarters. The response to the question was not brought to my attention or to the attention of my staff before it submitted and it was published in my name on page 21 of the Melbourne Herald Sun. table a letter from Andrew Robb, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, certifying the ians? circumstances. I simply make the point that this matter, having been drawn to my attenCorps tion and because of the possible conflict between the answer I gave yesterday and what was contained in that question, ought to be drawn immediately to the attention of the House. NA Unemployment: Work for the Dole",13
4,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and relates to yet another quote that he might have forgotten. Prime Minister, yesterday you reviled the member for Batman for his remarks that the .'ill-planned nature of your scheme left people III danger of spending months painting rocks'. You inferred that the expression indicated an absence of concern for battling Australians. Do you remember in a debate with me saying: Our criticism is of artificial make-work schemes and you know as well as I do, there is a big difference between putting more resources into T.A-, more resources into proper training, and giVing money to local government bodies for essentially rock painting exercises. As your department and DEETY A are completely unable to provide guidance on your and as you have cut resources to T AFE, will you guarantee now that participants will receive accredited training, that said they will work in worthwhile community schemes and that they will gain real jobs after they have been through your scheme?",13
5,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I will guarantee is fact that we will do something you did not have the guts to do, and that is to introduce a work that for the dole scheme. You can fulminate and ask for all sorts of guarantees. Nothing can alter the fact that there is widespread Australian support for the proposal I announced Green Corps",13
6,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister and it relates to Green was Corps. Is it a fact that the Green Corps program of the government is off to a good I start? How will the pilot projects assist environmentally concerned young Austral,13
7,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true that the Green proposal announced during the election campaign is another of the vehicles that have been adopted by the government to provide jobs, training experience and a greater purpose in life for young people in Australia. The Green Corps is particularly targeted at young Australians between the ages of 17 and 20. It will give young Australians the opportunity to work on preserving and restoring our environment and our heritage. The government has allocated a figure of $41.6 million for the initial stages of the Green Corps proposal. There have already been 1,200 applications for I think a much smaller number of positions in the Green Corps. By June 1997, 440 young people will have joined. This will expand to 1,800 places by June 1998 and, by June 1999, 3,500 young Australians will have participated. In addition to being paid a training allowance related to the national training wage, the participants will also receive accredited training. Green Corps graduates who enrol in ongoing training or courses will be eligible the completion for a grant of $500. By June 1998, 180 projects around Australia will have commenced. This particular initiative takes its place alongside other initiatives of the government to deal with the problem of youth unemployment-the worse of the problems that we inherited from the former government. I remind the House and the Australian people again that, for 13Y2 years the Labor Party had charge of the affairs of this country, yet it now has the audacity to thump the tableafter less than a year-and say how shocking, how outrageous, it is that we have not fixed the massive problem that you left us with when we won office in March last year. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition and all those who sit behind him that the fact that you were in office for 13Y2 years completely disqualifies you from any kind of moral unction on the issue of youth unemployment. Youth Unemployment",13
8,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister will be aware that our labour market programs operated as a two-way street, that there was an obligation on those who were recipients to undertake the training packages and job opportunities we provided. That was our form of compulsion. Now we will test yours. How will compulsion work in a pilot program? How will the government select between two unemployed young people out of work for the same amount of time? Will it be by the time honoured Liberal method of a lottery, and will that be based on postcodes or birthdays, or will the government force community groups to make the hard decisions on compulsion? Or is it not a fact that the government will settle in the end for a voluntary arrangement as so few places are available for the 100,000 young unemployed people since the government slashed all our programs?",14
9,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that we will not be settling for a completely voluntary system and we will not relieve you of the obligation of having to decide whether or not you are going to vote at against the work for the dole scheme in the Senate. Unemployment: Work for the Dole,14
10,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training inform the House of widespread community support for the government's proposed work for the dole scheme?",14
11,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. It is clear that there is indeed widespread community support for the government's work for the dole plan. Some of the strongest advocates for the program over the last 24 hours have in fact been young unemployed people themselves, because many of these young people have welcomed the chance to make a practical contribution to their community-something that Labor barred them from doing. Despite the endorsement of young people, however, the Labor Party is still opposing the scheme, which only goes to show how hopelessly out of touch those on the other side of the House are about the needs of young Australians. After 13 years of failing young people in this country, it is quite clear that the Labor Party has learnt nothing. It is very interesting to see the reaction from around Australia to the government's plan. For example, in its editorial this morning, the Daily Telegraph Mirror in Sydney said: The work for the dole program could help break the cycle of despair felt by unemployed youth and would, by extension, improve their health and selfesteem. Those, of course, are problems which they have inherited from the failure of the policies of the previous government. The Open Family-an organisation dedicated to helping young unemployed people-said: There is certainly a lot to be gained by giving people the chance to be productive and active, because one of the most damaging effects of lack of activity and lack of productivity is a lower esteem that makes them feel alienated. Even a poll in the Melbourne Herald-Sun found that 95 per cent of those who answered the poll endorsed the government's plan.",14
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,95 per cent?,15
13,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was 95 per cent, Prime Minister. That is overwhelming support for the government's plan from those polled by the Melbourne Herald-Sun. I am pleased to tell the House that the states and territories have hailed the benefits in youth work for the dole, as the headline in this morning's Australian tells us. The Australian reports that state and territory leaders yesterday broadly welcomed the proposed work for the dole scheme. Interestingly, it goes on to say: ... with the NSW Labor Government declaring it had no in-principle objections to the proposal. The NSW Premier, Mr Carr, said he would ""look sympathetically at any scheme that comes out of the Federal Government. Then he went on to say, reflecting on the consequence of Labor's term in office: I mean youth unemployment is a curse in our society and anything that provides a ray of hope and training and experience is going to be welcomed by us"" ... That goes to show the tremendous divisions that exist within the Labor Party and how out of touch those on the other side of the House are with the mood of young people in this country and with the desire of young people in this country to make a contribution to their community. The Labor Party is divided; it is out of touch. It does not know what to do; it has no solutions to the problem of employment; it has no credibility in this area, and these comments by the New South Wales Premier this morning only go to confirm that. The coalition has recognised that young people want the chance to work. This plan, as the Prime Minister has outlined, is part of a full package of policies-economic policies, policies in education and training-to bring young people back the opportunities which they were denied under the previous government. When we ask why was it that Labor did not do anything to meet the needs of young people, to work for the dole, as they have self- clearly indicated that they want to do",15
14,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take a point of order under section 145, Mr Speaker. The question concerned community response to the issues; it had nothing to do with the question of the responses of the Labor Party, either past or present. In fact, he is out of order on the question of relevance.",15
15,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister's response is wide ranging and embracing a whole array of factors.,15
16,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is indeed true that responses from the Labor Party have nothing to do with community responses. They are totally out of touch with the community. But, if we ask why the Labor Party did not do anything, it may be because they did not believe that young people really did want to work. Of course, that is the only conclusion you can draw from the statement of the member for Batman when he was interviewed on the Radio National breakfast program by Pru Goward on Monday when he said that young people after their work 'go home and go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the week'. That is the denigrating attitude towards young people which you carried in your policies under the direction of the ACTU. It has been left to this government to give young people the sorts of opportunities which you consistently denied them over 13 years. Small Business",15
17,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs explain to Australian small businesses, many of which are too small to derive benefits from industrial relations reforms or capital gains tax rollover on plant purchases, why they are obliged to compete in the marketplace with government agencies such as CSIRO and Ausmap which are providing consultancy and research sermoney. vices at less than true cost price?  obviously not aware that this government has moved to contract out in many areas. Indeed, in many of the areas where my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services is sponsible there has been a significant shift contracting out and government getting out of business. Hindmarsh Island Bridge",15
18,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question dole scheme. is addressed to the Prime Minister. How much has Labor's Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair cost Australian taxpayers to date, and what when he said: will be the impact of recent decisions by the Senate on the cost of this long-running saga?",16
19,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The decision of the Senate yesterday to reject the government's Hindmarsh Bridge legislation is one of the more absurd and ridiculous and sions that that chamber has taken. That legislation will be re-presented as soon possible and the Senate will be given another opportunity to vote on the legislation. Our legal advice is, believe it or not, that as a consequence of the Senate's decision we are obliged, under the terms of the law, to have yet another inquiry. That will make five inquiries in all. This has become the Blue Hills of Australian politics-inquiry after outlook? inquiry. If it was not enough for the former Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to lose his seat in the March election with a swing of just under 12 per cent, the Labor Party is apparently determined to remind the Australian people yet again their complete insensitivity on this issue. This issue has nothing to do with the rights of Aboriginal people; it has everything to with squandering the money of the Australian taxpayer. I want to say on behalf of the government that we believe this long-running farce and saga has gone on three inquiries too economy. much. The Senate should have had the good sense and the sensitivity to pass the legislaquarters, tion. They have not, and any alternative, any excuse, they offer cannot gainsay the fact that they are more interested in politically correct obsession than they are in the taxpayer's Unemployment: Work for the Dole",16
20,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is . addressed to the Prime Minister and it relates to the spread of amnesia on the other side of rethe House. Yesterday on the PM program into an interview that Sharon ONEILL conducted with Dr David Kemp, Dr Kemp-and listen to these words carefully, Prime Ministersaid: We've never ruled out a compulsory work for the But isn't it the case that on Meet the Press on 3 September 1995 Dr Kemp did just that There is no thought at all, Chris, of making any kind of work-for-the-dole scheme a compulsory scheme. Prime Minister, in light of this further evidence, has your minister misled the Australian costly decipublic? If not, why not?",16
21,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will analyse both of the as transcripts to which you have referred. Business Investment  the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain to the House the significance of recent indicators of investment? What is the contribution of private sector construction to the investment,16
22,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. The September quarter ABS private capital expenditure survey rose almost eight per cent, with a 19 per cent increase over the corresponding of estimate for 1995-96. As a consequence of that, the government, in its mid-year review, revised its forecast for business investment up do from 14 to 17 per cent. Recent partial information remains consistent with a very strong investment outlook, particularly for non-residential construction, in the Australian Despite high levels of work in recent the level of work yet to be completed in the non-residential building area has continued to rise to be over 18 per cent higher in the year to the September quarter of 1996. Non-residential building approvals have continued to strengthen and were nearly 70 per cent higher in the three months to December than at the same time in 1995. They are now back at the pre-recession peak. Investment in resource related projects is at the highest level on record. The value of engineering construction work done has continued to increase rapidly, growing by 28 per cent in the year to the September quarter 1996 to be at the highest level ever. A number of major road construction projects, Olympic related projects and mining projects which are either under way or committed suggest that engineering construction will continue to grow at this level for some time. In an environment of low inflation and low interest rates, with sound corporate profitability and a healthy rate of return on capital stock, this kind of business investment is expected to continue. This is strong business investment which has not been seen in Australia for some time. It is business investment in relation to resource projects, infrastructure projects and non-residential dwellings. It is sound business investment in a sound and growmg economy. Unemployment: Work for the Dole",16
23,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Are you ruling out extending your compulsory work for the dole program to older people? Are there any age groups that will be exempt from being forced to work for the dole?,17
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The emphasis will be on younger people. I would not envisage that the scheme, certainly in its pilot stages, would go beyond people of 25 to 30. I think in any work for the dole scheme that does not seek to cover everybody the desirability clearly is that the emphasis be on younger people. I would not want it thought that people up to the age of 25 or 30 would be completely excluded. But, overwhelmingly, the emphasis will be on people in their late teens and early twenties. It may go a little higher. I want to make it clear that, quite obviouslyMr Crean-Older people?",17
25,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not have people of very mature age in contemplation at this stage. Tandem Thrust Exercise,17
26,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Is the minister aware of comments made by some senators concerning the environmental impact of the military exercise Tandem Thrust? Can the minister inform the House what measures have been put in place to protect the environment during this exercise?,17
27,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware of comments by several senators, one of whom is Senator Lees who will, no doubt, continue to put a fear campaign around about this exercise. I would like to say for the edification of all members that the fears she has expressed are unfounded. The Department of Defence has put considerable effort into planning this exercise which, I might note, was set in train by the Labor Party when it was in power. The department has conducted a comprehensive environmental assessment in conjunction with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Queensland Department of the Environment and Heritage, and a detailed plan for the conduct of this operation has been developed. I think it would be useful if I tabled an executive summary of the environmental issues and the navy's policy for disposal of waste, a IS-page document which, for the edification of members, it would be useful for them to read-it would be useful if Senator Lees read it as well-and an operator's guide for waste disposal. I also notice that there have been some comments by somebody who seems to be the new Labor spokesman for defence and the environment all at once: Senator Reynolds. She is advocating a reef tax on all participants. You might laugh, but I presume that that is the Labor Party's policy on this exercise. Your government, when it was in power, was all for the exercise. It set the exercise in train and started the planning, including the plans for the environmental arrangements, invited the Americans along and now you want to charge the Australian and American defence forces for the honour and glory of planning an exercise to help defend this country. You have on the other side some pacifists at play in your midst. If you got your shadow spokesman hack in charge of your policy, the rest of Australia would know where you stood. Staff: Senator Colston",17
28,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Did the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet approach the Department of Finance last year seeking an upgrade for one of Senator Colston's staff from an AS04 to AS06 level at substantial additional cost to the Senate? Did the Department of Finance respond by saying that because any such approval would be transparent-that is, become a matter of close public scrutiny-it would require the written support of the Prime Minister? Was the Prime Minister's support for that upgrade conveyed to the Department of Finance shortly before the second reading of the Telstra bill? Did you write to the President of the Senate just one day before the third reading of the Telstra bill specifically supporting that upgrade?",18
29,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Obviously there are some details in that which I will check. I will come back to the parliament today if I can. Australia Prize: Science and Technology,18
30,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Science and Technology on a matter of genuine national interest. I understand that tonight three scientists will be honoured for their outstanding contribution to science and technology. Would the minister be able to confirm this report and provide us with further information on the nature of their achievements?,18
31,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I am delighted to confirm that the winners of the 1997 Australia Prize have been announced today and will be honoured at a gala dinner here at Parliament House tonight and presented with their Australia Prize awards by the Prime Minister. Two Australians and an Austrian were announced as the winners of the prize, which honours their achievements in the field of telecommunications. Professor Allan Snyder of the Australian National University and Professor Rodney Tucker of the University of Melbourne together with Dr Gottfried Ungerboeck of IBM Switzerland have been jointly awarded the 1997 Australia Prize. Dr Ungerboeck is receiving a prize for the outstanding quality of his contributions in trellis coded modulation, which is used in all high speed digital transmissions and which has had a major impact in world terms. Professor Tucker is being awarded for his work on high speed lasers used for lightwave communication channels and on the use of photonics devices and systems for high speed message switching. Professor Allan Snyder is receiving the prize for his many key advances in the theory of optical communications and his pioneering work on optical fibres and waveguide technologies. It is no exaggeration to say that if any of those contributions were taken out of telecommunications, science and technology we would not have had the advances in the information superhighway that we have today. Professors Snyder and Tucker join the ranks of Australia's outstanding scientists who compete on the world stage and bring honour and recognition to Australia. Their work has helped to make the world a smaller and more interesting place through work crucial to the advent of the information superhighway. The three will share in a $300,000 Australia Prize, an international award for researchers who have made outstanding contributions to science and technology promoting human welfare. Publicity surrounding the Australia Prizemembers will agree that it has been very extensive today-will convey a number of messages for young people and the general public, such as that careers in science and engineering are challenging and exciting, that the work of scientists and technologists is valued by Australia and that scientists and technologists can contribute to the national economic and social good. I expect next year's Australia's Prize, which will be in the field of molecular genetics, to be as successful as this year's prize in attracting nominations from the world's leading research and development organisations. Professor Tucker and Professor Ungerboeck have joined us in the public gallery today. On behalf of the House, I congratulate them and Professor Snyder in his absence. Again, I say that Professor Snyder's and Professor Tucker's involvement confirms the internationally competitive nature of Australian research in partnership with the world. Nursing Homes Legislation",18
32,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. Your draft legislation on nursing homes specifically exempts the family home from the assets test when a spouse, family member or carer on a pension is also a resident. Ninety per cent of people admitted to nursing homes do not have a spouse living in the family home. Where in the draft legislation is the family home exempt from the assets test for a pensioner living alone in their own home? Won't these people be forced to sell their homes if they are to get access to a nursing home?",19
33,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to respond once again to the question I have responded to on a number of occasions in this place, and that is that no-one will be forced to sell the family home to gain access to a nursing home. Ms Macklin-Where does it say it in the bill?",19
34,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Jagajaga has asked her question.,19
35,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Access to a nursing home will be determined on the person's need for care, not on the person's means to pay. It will be on the need for care. In that respect, we have put into place a number of protections for people who do not have the means. Ms Macklin-Where is it in the bill?",19
36,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The measures that this government has put into place will allow flexible options to those who have an asset to be able to pay an accommodation bond, where a facility charges one and where they are accredited to do so. Ms Macklin-It isn't in here, is it? There's no protection.",19
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Jagajaga.,19
38,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They will have to be accredited before they can charge an accommodation bond. All we will do is continue the policy that the Labor Party put into place in 1988 with our support. We are not proposing to prescribe, as they did in 1988, what the accommodation bond will be. However, we will prescribe the amount that any provider can draw down. That will be limited to $2,600 per annum to a limit of $13,000. How a person organises their affairs is their own business. But this government will not force anyone to sell the family home. We must remember why this measure was introduced into this place in the first place, and that is because the mob on that side left the nursing home industry in this country in a very parlous state. We have inherited the problem and we will take the responsibility to fix it. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome",19
39,Mrs SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Is the minister aware of concerns that the National Health and Medical Research Council has not funded projects researching chronic fatigue syndrome from its medical research funds? Is he also aware of reports that one particular research project at the University of Newcastle may have developed a diagnostic test for CFS in spite of this lack of support? Will the minister ask the NHMRC to amend its Classification of Disciplines to allow expert assessment of CFS related projects? Will he also ensure that the NHMRC allocates funds for CFS research projects?,19
40,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. I note her interest in this and the representations she has made to me on the issue. I am aware that chronic fatigue syndrome has not been specifically funded for research grants under the NHMRC, and I am aware of the one particular project that she raises. I would say to .her in reply that the National Health and Medlc-l Research Council funds research on the basIs of peer reviewed excellence and I. would not want to see that changed. I certamly would not want to see a situation where research was funded on the basis of whoever had access to the minister or the minister's ear rather than what was the view of the scientific community. That said, I do accept that the Classification of Disciplines is an area that can influence the peer review process. The NHMRC has received a request and is considering it for a special code for CFS. In the end, that is its decision. As to whether I will ensure the NHMRC provides funds for CFS, I cannot. do this specifically. But I can say that the-e IS a. new subcommittee of the NHMRC, which will be the Strategic Research Development Committee, and its purpose will be to advise on the need for targeted research into different health issues. This is something that it could properly address. I understand the concern that people with CFS have. I believe it is a genuine condition. It is made all the more difficult by the controversy that exists in the medical professi-n towards it. One thing government has done IS contribute money to the Royal Australasian College of Physicians to develop guidelines into the most cost-effective treatments and the most clinically relevant methods of diagnosing and treating CFS. Hopefully, if we can get some consensus on this, it will make it easier for people suffering to be accepted by the broader medical profession. Nursing Homes Legislation",19
41,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. On Radio National this morning, you said: Those who do clearly have assets over the stipulated amountthat is, $22,500they will need to make financial arrangements if they want to move into a nursing home. Minister, over 70 per cent of pensioners have one asset-the family home. Why do you not simply come clean and admit that pensioners will have to sell their family homes to get nursing home care?",20
42,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I felt that I did fully answer that question in answer to the last question that was asked. I made it very clear that this government will not force people to sell the family home in order to enter a nursing home. It will be based on a person's need for care, not on a person's mean, but clearly where they have an asset they will be asked to make some contribution. I would like to draw the attention of the House once again to a letter to the editor of 19 September 1996 from a former minister in the Labor government, Mr Gary Johns. I am not going to quote from the letter, but he followed up his letter with a radio interview, which he did on 19 September last year. I would like to quote it. The reporter asked: So in fact, the Liberal-coalition government has really introduced something which should have been a policy applauded by the Labor Party? Mr Johns gave a brilliant reply: ... the policy is correct. We'd already done i- for hostels. I think it would only be a matter of time, if we remained in government, that we would have imposed it for nursing homes as well.",20
43,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance: if you're going to quote from a letter or an interview, you should quote the whole lot. Mr Johns conclude? bsaying, 'Come on comrades, support thIS; It is a death tax.'",20
44,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There IS no point of order. Resume your seat.,20
45,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He went on to say, 'It's logical, it's fair, it's reasonable.' Sydney 2000 Olympic Games Miss JACKIE KELLY-My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games. Can the minister advise the House of his seeing reports that the staging of the Sydney 2000 Olympics will not involve any cost to the Australian taxpayer? If so, are they correct? Also, is the minister able to indicate the involvement of the Commonwealth government in the staging of the games and the potential benefit for all Australians?",20
46,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. Indeed, I have seen a report, which was somewhat disturbing, in the Sunday Telegraph of 9 February. A series of questions were posed about the Olympic Games. The very first question-they were addressed to the organising committee-asked how much the Olympics will cost Australian taxpayers. The answer was that the staging of the games is being funded by private sponsorship, with the state government underwriting the event, and that the cost to taxpayers is zero. In actual fact, that answer is patently incorrect. I want to take the opportunity to correct that answer and to put forward to the parliament the correct position. Support from the Commonwealth, which is being supported by both sides of the parliament, started with $150 million cash for the facilities in New South Wales. In the budget last year, an amount of $25 million cash was provided for the removal of the Sydney show grounds to the Homebush site. There was also a large discount on the sale of land adjacent to Homebush to facilitate the development of the Olympic village. Only last week we made further amendments, supported by all parties in this parliament, to the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act. That is an act which provides protection, estimated at about $700 million, of the revenue which will go to SOCOG from the sale of merchandise and sponsorship. It in effect protects them from ambush marketing. In addition, there will be all the services provided by the Commonwealth: airports, immigration, customs, weather services, and drug testing, which I talked about yesterday. Also, the full range of Commonwealth law enforcement and intelligence services will work with New South Wales and the Department of Defence in providing the necessary and all-important security umbrella. All this is managed in the Commonwealth via two key ministerial committees. One deals with general Olympic matters and encompasses many of my colleagues and one deals specifically with security matters. Both are chaired by me on behalf of the Prime Minister. We will continue discussions with both the New South Wales government and SOCOG on cost sharing arrangements and cost recovery situations where they are appropriate. There will doubtless be a range of other matters relating to Olympic activity which we will need to discuss over the next several years. Indeed, only yesterday the Chairman of SOCOG and the minister responsible in New South Wales, Mr Knight, was here in Canberra for further discussions with me. In addition, the Commonwealth has provided and committed $135 million for the Olympic athlete program and also has committed up to $25 million for the staging of the Paralympics. The member's question also asked for the benefits. This is an Australia-wide event. We want to ensure that all Australians get the benefit of the Olympic Games. It is estimated that $7 billion of economic activity will be generated up to and including the time of the games and the period following the games. There will be exposure of Australia to some four billion viewers, which will be the largest viewing audience in world history, of Australia-a unique opportunity for us. There will be the development of permanent new infrastructure, of sporting and other facilities which will be a permanent legacy for this nation, valued somewhere in the vicinity of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. There will be many tourists and business people visiting prior to the games, during the games and, importantly, after the games. Our role in the Commonwealth is to support the games and we are certainly doing that. Australian taxpayers are contributing, but they will get huge benefits. The development of the processes to make sure the Olympic Games are successful is a partnership between the Commonwealth, state and relevant local governments. We are committed to that process and I would be pleased if people would note the correction to that incorrect article. Bulk-billing",21

Is the minister aware recent quarterly figures which show that since last year's budget there have been two succesthe sive falls in the number of GPs who are bulkmarket billing and an increase in the number who charging their patients co-payments? Minister, do you now accept that your decision in the budget to freeze GP's rebates has forced to abandon bulk-billing and start their patients? How many more Australian families are now paying the AMA's recommended fee of $36 up-front for GP consultations as a result of your attack on Medicare?",22

53,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for first Batman.,22
54,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't accept at all that the budget decision has caused that. fact, if you have a look at what the Labor careers. Party did in government, you froze the rebate for other medical practitioners for four years and the rate of bulk-billing went up for the OMP category in spite of a freeze for four years. Secondly, on three occasions you deferred an increase for four months. The net effect of those three four-month deferrals was a 12-month deferral in itself, and that did not cause a reduction in bulk-billing. So you cannot logically say that one necessarily flows from the other. The experience, when you did it, was that bulk-billing did not go down. Noone can say what the factors are that mayor .may not have caused that. In response to your comment on how many to people are paying $36, I would think very of few, if any, because if doctors stopped bulkbilling they normally would charge a rate that market would bear and not much of the for general practitioner services can are bear $36. You can try to run a scare campaign, you can try to put out as much of this information as you like, but the public will GPs not believe you because you have no credicharging bility in this area. Australian Defence Force: Recruitment",22

For the time over 400 new cadets were enlisted because we finally put to death that dreadful Price report which was so damaging to the In way that people viewed their prospective Not only are the permanent forces seeing an improvement in their recruiting but I see that general entry targets for all the services are being met.

The ministers support them and, more particularly, the Prime Minister supports them, and they recognise this as being a career for them.

One is tion? to make savings and carry them forward to make sure that the capabilities are enhanced. The second part is to make sure that the the Defence Force is organised is changed that further efficiencies bring forth further value. I have had a couple of meetings, initially it looks as though there are considerunsustainably able savings that can be made. It looks though there are considerable improvements that can be made in the efficiencies.

64,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government does, in answer to the member's question, recognise the difficulties that some skilled migrants can face in the labour market. These difficulties, of course, largely reflect the policies of the previous government which, for a sustained period, maintained pass marks in the independent and concessional categories at historically low levels. The government that was formerly in office failed also, I think, to give proper emphasis to English language ability in the selection of skilled migrants in particu",23
65,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about discrimina,23
66,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is clearly not an issue of discrimination in relation to those matters. way The discrimination that we know existed so under you is that they were not able to get jobs when they came to Australia. The Labor and Party, of course, kept the pass marks at low levels, and I inherited that, as along with an enormously large pipeline of applications in both the independent and of family categories-a very large pipeline. The pipeline was such that we had 60,000 people or thereabouts in the independent category and 32 000 or thereabouts in the concessional defamily' category with no expectation that people would be able to be visaed in under four years. That is the nature of the pipelines that we had. Since taking office, we have moved quickly to address this deterioration in entry standards. We have raised the pass mark, and I must say they are at very high levels: 115 out of 120 for the independent category and in relation to the concessional family category has been raised from 95 to 115 points. They are much higher than they were in the period about which the honourable member was speaking when they were as low as 95 and 85 points respectively. The government also recognises that skilled migrants, if they are going to be able to use their skills, particularly in professional ployment, need to have English language ability. One of the things that I have been able to do is broaden the list of occupations that require at least English language as a requirement for its acceptance as a skill. So it is a requirement that those in the skilled categories-now almost in 80 per cent of cases-will require English. The higher pass marks and the greater emphasis on English language ability will increase the skill levels and employability of all migrants in the independent and concessional categories. I am also looking at a range of measures to more closely target the selection of migrants to address skill shortages. I have done that particularly in the matter of regional sponsored migration, about which I spoke earlier last week. I have also ordered a review of the employer nomination scheme through the Lin committee, and that specifically matches skills of migrants to positions that have not been able to be filled in Australia. We are keen to encourage greater use of the employer nomination scheme. What we are about is restoring public confidence in the way in which the immigration program is conducted.",23

91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I am sure that the Minister for Health and Family Services is aware of the conventions of this House, but I remind all members-and you hardly need reminding-that this is a highly combative chamber. It is not unusual for emotions to run warmly. All I would do is encourage the cat fanciers, the dog fanciers and all others to be aware of the conventions of the House when they are on their feet addressing the House. Speaker's Chair Mr LEO MCLEA Y- Mr Speaker, like the Leader of the Opposition, I would draw your attention to the story on the front page of the Canberra Times today. Could you explain to this House and the Australian people your intention to waste half a million dollars on moving the Speaker's chair from Old Parliament House to this chamber when the government revealed recently that there was a $3 billion Costello crater? Will this project, being forced on you by the Prime Minister, be funded by further cuts to the parliamentary departments, or has the government agreed to supplementary appropriations which will cause social programs to be cut and lives destroyed to fund the Prime Minister's half million dollar indulgence?",26
92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Watson for his question. There have been some discussions both in this chamber and privately about the Speaker's chair. I might now read into the record the prevailing situation, because there are a number of spontaneous exclamations about costs and we are not yet in a position to address them. After this matter was raised in the House last year, the Leader of the House wrote to me on 12 December asking me to obtain an assessment of costs associated with the removal and relocation of the Speaker's Chair from the provisional Parliament House and a costing of a replica chair for the House of Representatives chamber in that building. He also asked for any drawings which were prepared in the context of the design of the new parliament showing the original chair relocated in this chamber. As a result of that request, the Department of the House of Representatives has engaged International Conservation Services Pty Ltd of Sydney and Mitchell, Giurgola and Thorp of Canberra to prepare a report detailing the tasks to be carried out and estimates of the time and cost involved. International Conservation Services Pty Ltd was chosen because the principal of that firm had prepared two reports for the Parliament House Construction Authority in 1987 in respect of the old chair. One report dealt with conservation and refurbishment of the chair and the other with the surveying of a route for removing the chair from the Old Parliament House. He will review and update his reports and in conjunction with MGT advise on transporting the chair to the new building and installing it in the chamber. Mitchell, Giurgola and Thorp were of course the architects for this building. They will also advise on removal of the existing chair, preparation of the floor and installation of the old chair. The cost of the joint consultancy is $12,125, for which the department was not funded, but I considered it essential that a comprehensive study be undertaken so that decisions on the relocation proposal could be made in the light of the best available technical and financial information. I have supplied the Leader of the House with this information and also provided him with an architectural drawing prepared during construction of this building depicting the old chair in the new chamber. In addition, a photo montage has been prepared by Auspic showing the original chair located in this chamber and a copy sent to the Leader of the House. It is expected that the consultancy will be completed by the end of this month when I will be in a position to provide further information and advice to the Leader of the House and to the House itself. Speaker's Chair",26
93,Mr LEO MCLEAY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a further question to you, Mr Speaker, arising out of your answer just now. As this is a matter which is of interest to all members, as well as to our esteemed friend the Leader of the House, would you be able to make available to all members-maybe in a display outside your office or somewhere like that-what this photo montage, this monstrosity, will look like so that, other than just the Leader of the House being shocked by it, we can all see how stupid this proposal is?",26
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As I said earlier, this is a combative chamber and emotional language is often the order of the day. But I think you are beginning to stray wide of the mark. I have deliberated on the montage and the photograph. I have considered doing exactly what you urge, but I thought I would withhold the information until I have all the facts at my disposal.

97,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The need to embrace broadly based active labour market programs which require obligation on the recipient of unemployment benefits and on the government. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",27
98,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think we witnessed one of the more genuinely contemptible acts on the Sunday program last Sunday in the interview of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) with Laurie Oakes. In politics, as you pursue your legitimate ambitions, as you take part in the cut and thrust of debate, as you do the things that you need to do to maintain public support for what you do, you nevertheless ought to place limits on yourself. One of the limits that you place upon yourself is that, when you are in trouble, you explain the circumstances that have put you in trouble and if you have excuses for it then you offer them. What you do not do is the political equivalent of what happens when a position is overrun on a battlefield, the enemy has taken it, they are bayoneting everybody left on the ground and you drag a body over you to protect yourself. It is an appropriate thing to do in those circumstances, but it is not in politics. What the Prime Minister chose to do to protect himself from the consequences of his pathetic week-in which he actively misled the Australian people and then asked them to believe that he had amnesia about a briefing about one of his closest political associates-was to organise a smokescreen for himself or a piece of cover that took the form of the young people of Australia. And he has been congratulating himself on that ever since. He performed last week in one of the more tawdry fashions of a Prime Minister of this nation, building on the pathetic performance on accountability and standards all through last year. The minister at the table, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), one of the ministers who contributed to that, is hanging his head in shame, as well he might. Nothing is more cowardly than to protect yourself with the weak, to hide behind the needy. Then there was that appalling performance-almost the equivalent in this country of going out and inviting a confession in the old Soviet Union-of lining up a bunch of young people who are going through the difficulty and the embarrassment of going through the process of collecting unemployment benefits-no longer having any schemes that they can go to to pursue a useful end-and asking them whether or not they would want to work with the dole and then hanging them with their own words. Things were done along those lines in show trials in the Soviet Union in the 1930s. They do not need to be done in this country, and leaders do not need to take pride in them. The Prime Minister has been taking pride in an initiative which is in fact a disgrace. You can go out onto the streets anywhere in this country you like and ask people a question about whether or not they should work for the dole; you will get the same sort of answer as to whether or not parliament should be increased, politicians' pay should be increased, or whatever. You get an automatic reaction before things get considered. But this leader, this Prime Minister, went out and covered his own peccadilloes with the position of the young people of this nation whom he in his budget had so recently betrayed. What an extraordinary position this government now presents to the young. 'You will work for the dole', they say. 'You will also not be able to obtain university places. You have TAFE cut. You have your schooling reduced.' Any conceivable area of young people's need for opportunity and progress this government has cut into. And it is proud of it. It puts the cloak on as though it is proud of it. This government is extraordinarily lucky. This government is extraordinarily lucky because the political departments of all the newspapers of this country are undermanned. Were they not undermanned, there would have been a bit of serious analysis over the last few days devoted to precisely these particular propositions and this scheme. The Prime Minister not only has the hide to cover himself with this scheme; he has the hide to announce a scheme when there isn't one. What an extraordinary scene we have seen since then. On the day the scheme was presented, Senator Vanstone's office could not answer any questions about it. On the second day, it could. Still, the department of the minister at the table, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), cannot answer questions on what this scheme will do, and neither can the Prime Minister's department answer questions on what this scheme will do. Would the previous Labor government have announced a major employment initiative and have got away with such a shoddy piece of public policy, such a disgracefully shoddy piece of public policy, in the view of the public? Or would they have been allowed to get away with it-and you are not going to be allowed to get away with it in this place-by the opposition for that matter? No, we would not have got away with it. We would have been tom limb from limb for that peccadillo. We would have been mocked. What an extraordinary sight it is seeing the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and the Prime Minister making up the scheme in their heads on television. 'Will there be a bit of training?' 'No,' said the Prime Minister, 'not initially.' And then: 'Yes, well, maybe there will be a bit of training, now; yes, maybe we will have a bit of training.' 'Will there be any sorts of guarantees for people travelling to work or receiving things like superannuation payments?' 'Oh well, maybe there will; maybe we'll think about that in the future.' 'Will scheme be compulsory?' 'Absolutely'-to start off with. And now: 'Well, some of it will be compulsory and some of it will of course be voluntary.' We have to keep asking questions of this government because it is such an interesting process. We are actually seated at the cabinet table in this chamber-a cabinet table on behalf of the people of Australia. And if we sit here and ask enough questions at question time, no doubt within a month or two we will have something looking like a scheme coming out at the end of it. There are a few other questions, though, unfortunately, that we want to ask during question time, so that is not available to us. But it is a possibility. We have a list of about 20 or 30 questions we would quite like to ask on this proposition. Mr Crean-So far!",28
99,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"So far. But of course we have to provide scrutiny of the entire government and not just this. But we are conscious of the fact that every time we ask a question something new goes into the minds of our political opponents opposite and they say, 'Oh, gee, that is actually something that perhaps we would do something about.' Another contemptible feature of this particular proposition that has come forward is what a raft of deceit has accompanied the announcement of it. Yesterday we had the minister who is now at the table getting up and saying, 'Oh, no. I never at any stage said that we wouldn't contemplate or consider any form of compulsion in any work for the dole scheme. I never said that.' Well, we have a press release and an interview with you from about three or four months before the election saying precisely that. The Prime Minister was here the other day disowning you and saying, 'Well, my frontbenchers don't speak for me.' This is a totally new interpretation, a new variant, on the core promise and the non-core promise. Only the remarks of the then Leader of the Opposition now constitute a commitment. The entire front-bench of the then opposition, upon the declaration of the Prime Minister, said absolutely nothing meaningful in the entire election campaign-nor did Andrew Robb for this that matter. Not a single thing they said constituted a government guarantee about anything: 'only what I said amount to a firm commitment. ' Then the Prime Minister revealed for us today what he said. The Prime Minister was invited to answer a questionnaire on precisely this point and he obviously thought that we actually had it. I have to confess to the fact that we did not. So this a piece of defensive manoeuvring on his part that he actually did not need to do. Mr Crean-It's an own goal.",29
100,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He did not need to kick this own goal. But nevertheless he kicked this own goal and what the Prime Minister finally realised and finally 'fessed up to was that during the last election campaign he had made precisely the same point. So what we had was the opposition thennow government-skating through the last election campaign saying two things. The was that really the labour market programs that were being put in place-and the traintraining ing programs and the training arrangementsto by the previous government were good.,29
101,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Be maintained.,30
102,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Point 1: they will be 'Now maintained. Point 2: if you are asked to introduce a compulsory work for the dole scheme-'No'. Denied once, twice, three No, times and then the cock crew. He came into this place and the cock crew and said, 'Forget all the rest of what we might have said, we are going to have collective amnesia on this, the world began 24 hours ago,' - or now hours ago-'and, as far as tLis is concerned, only what is said from this point on actually means anything.' One of the problems they have in dealing with this particular proposition is a logical nonsense. Precisely how, on a pilot scheme, do you test compulsion? Do you actually go into a suburb and say, 'Freida, you have been out of work for 18 months. Bill, you have 50th anniversary. been out of work for 18 months but, Bill, we do not like the colour of your tie-you are conscripted. For the next six months, you are going to'-in the immortal words of John Howard in 1992-""'conduct essentially rock painting exercises"". Freida, for the next six months you can do whatever you like, are not going to be providing you with any form of assistance at all while you do it.' what we have got is a logical nonsense; you cannot provide a compulsory scheme for lot! 5,000 people. Certainly, in a country which resists civil conscription, you cannot provide a compulsory scheme in this country for 5,000 people. But there are some things that you can do. What you can do is restore what we did. Let me tell you how we intend to approach your legislation. What you desperately hope-as with all the legislation that is half baked you pick up-is that somehow we will resist it and we will lose it, therefore, on principle. We are not going to play that particular game with you because we have piloted every range conceivable scheme that gives young people an opportunity to contribute to our society and advance their own skills and traininglike first every conceivable scheme! We gave those young people an opportunity to get some real and they had the opportunity to go on jobs. Fifty per cent of them got jobs from their training arrangements. Sometimes you have come in here and said, you are going to be committed to this scheme, so I guess we will hear a bit less from you on it.' Fifty per cent against 100? that was 50 against nought. Without those schemes they would have had nothing. Without those schemes they would have had no chance of a job. At least half of them would get it; the other half were kept job ready 72 while they were engaged in that process. They had worthwhile things to do in the community. Far from painting rocks, as the Prime Minister indicated in 1992, they were clearing verges, doing important environmental programs, putting in place ovals and community facilities, restoring some of the more historic buildings of this nation that have been put up and restoring war memorials during the Mr Crean-And developing skills.",30

So What we would suggest to you is this: firstly, do not bother piloting, do the scheme. Do the Secondly, establish reciprocal obligations. The simple fact of the matter is that under our schemes this was the case: if you were in the situation where you had been unemployed for a lengthy period, you could not simply just drift on. What you had to do in those circumstances was enter into one of those training programs or the work opportunities related to new work opportunities, and in return the that government gave you more than simply the dole. In some of them you got a training wage; in others you got assistance-assistance with your clothing and with travel, a whole of assistance to do the things that you needed to do. And the government covered the overheads of the program, including issues workers compensation and the things that people needed to make those programs work properly. There was a mutual obligation. If you did not actually pick up the obligation, then at end of the day you lost your unemployment benefits for a period. But we did not call we did not need to-work for the dole schemes because it was not so demeaning. It was a properly structured training program that they had to enter into, properly remunerget ated in some circumstances; in other circumNew stances, reasonable expenses were covered.

We will, above all, insist upon appropriate training arrangements for all country. those that are associated with it. We are going to make your program work whether you want it to work or not, because the simple matter is this: we know how to work them; we do not need to have them piloted. We know exactly what needs to be done to assist young people in this country to have the opportunity they need. We do not need to drag it down on top of us in a half-baked to conceal the fact that we misled the Australfoolish Ian people and try to provide them with the opportunity to discuss something else other than the fact that we have been dishonest them, which is precisely the position of the Prime Minister and precisely the position that you have been encouraging by endorsing half-baked propositions.

104,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein-Minister for anything Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for nance for Privatisation) (3.28 p.m.)-We have nonsense! just had a demonstration of why the Labor Party was decimated in the last election. have now had it confirmed, from the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), that what Labor wants to do is to go back all those failed Working Nation policies the people rejected so resoundingly in the election. That is what he said. He said, 'What you can do is restore what we did.' The Leader of the Opposition was a minister for employment. During his tenure office the number of long-term unemployed rose by 94,000. He wants the Australian people to once more put in place policies which cost the battling families of this country and the small businesses $2 billion and the did not move the level of youth employment across the entire time those policies were in itplace by as much as two percentage points. What the Labor opposition is now offering this country is more of the same failed policies. It is no wonder that you could not even the support of the Labor Party Premier of South Wales who, when he heard the government's proposals, came out and said that he supported these proposals in principle. He thought that work for the dole was well trying because something was needed to give hope to the young people of this They were hopeless by the end of the Labor Party's 13 years in office. Youth unemployment was stuck at 28 per cent. There were the lowest number of young people as a proportion of the work force in apprenticeships and traineeships that there had been for three decades. Unemployment had risen to 11 per cent. Small business was being strangled by way the unfair dismissals law, by an unfair and capital gains tax, which we have since reformed, and by an incredible burden of red tape and regulation. It is no wonder that the with real jobs were not coming through. The sheer fantasy land that the Leader of the Opposition lives in was demonstrated by his his claim that the Labor Party had tried everything that worked, that they did not have to learn from us and that they had done every possible thing that could be done Fito help young unemployed people. What They never addressed the literacy and We numeracy problems that young people had. There was never any national goal on literacy and numeracy. Indeed, they suppressed the to information that would have demonstrated the that extent of this problem amongst young Auslast tralians. When we came into office and I discovered that there was 20 years of virtually unanalysed data on this, I commissioned the Australian Council for Educational Research into do the analysis and discovered that 30 per cent of 14-year-olds in this country did not have adequate reading skills and that the reading skills of young boys of this age had deteriorated. That was never tackled during the whole 13 years of Labor. It was up to the coalition to put in place the first national goal for literacy-that is, that every child should be able to read, write, spell and communicate by the end of primary school-and the first national benchmarks for literacy at years 3 and 5. What did Labor do for the majority of young people who were not going on to university? John Dawkins and the Leader of the Opposition all supported the proposition that we should get rid of the colleges of advanced education and that we should give young people the message that if they were not going on to university they were not going anywhere. They focused on the 30 to 35 per cent of young people who were going on to university and abandoned the remainder. They knew that the pathway to employment for young people in schools was collapsing and they did nothing about it except offer them short-term schemes. Mr Fitzgibbon-What about the expansion of the TAPE system?",31

106,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They offered the young people of Australia short-term training schemes, churned them around at a cost in the last year of over $2 billion and did not shift the rate youth unemployment one iota. What a betrayal of young Australians. What happened to the great Australian apprenticeship system that had provided the opportunity for so many young Australians to get the training that would lead them into real jobs? They forgot it. They put it on the shelf. They did nothing about the apprenticeship system. They went around telling small business, 'Don't worry about apprenticeships. We are replacing them with these one-year short-term traineeships.' By the end of Labor's term in office, as I have said, there were the lowest number of young people as a proportion of the work force in apprenticeships and traineeships that there had been for three decades. Don't let the Leader of the Opposition come into this House and tell us that the opposition has tried everything to solve the problem of youth unemployment. You have not tried everything. You did not start to address the fundamental problems that were undermining opportunities for young people in this country. You had 13 years to see that the low-skill jobs in this community were being destroyed as technology came right across industry. The Labor Party, when in office, did not do anything to expand the opportunities for young people in schools to take on the vocational education courses and apprenticeships which might actually skill them for jobs and make them much more acceptable and attractive to employers. By the end of the 13 years of Labor in office teenagers were the most disadvantaged group of people in the labour market in this country. That is absolutely irrefutable. However you do the statistics, unemployment amongst young people was the highest for any age group in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition had the foolishness and the stupidity to come into this House and say, 'We have tried it all. What you can do is what we did.' We have heard in the House today the reference by the Labor Party to certain statements made before the election campaign. This again shows the fantasy land that they are living in. They said on a number of occasions before of the election campaign that we had incorporated in our policy a work for the dole policy. It was not part of our policy before the campaign. We have just announced, after consideration by the government, the work for the dole plan which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) put before the country and which has received such excellent support from young people and, indeed, from social welfare groups like the Open Family. Of course there are those who still have supported the failed policies of the Labor Party, but what is remarkable is the level of support that has been attracted. People see the sheer common sense and the fairness of the proposal that we have put forward. The Labor Party expect the nation to be outraged when they tell the nation that the government has just announced a work for the dole plan. They quote comments to the effect that we did not put forward such a plan in the election campaign. We did not put forward such a plan. So of course we said that it was not part of our proposal then. There is not the slightest point in quoting back to us statements that were made then which simply clarified the situation as it existed. The fact is that we have put this plan before the country. It is a plan that already has been provided with a great deal of detail, and further statements will be made about it by the government. There will be some 30 pilot schemes around Australia, trialling both compulsory and voluntary approaches to working for the dole. There will be a cost to this. The government concedes that. This is not an attempt to save money. We do not represent that this scheme is going to provide long-term unemployed young people with full-time jobs. The aim of this scheme is to meet the needs of those young people in regional communities around Australia who were abandoned by the Labor Party. They could not understand why the Labor Party insisted that they should receive the dole and do nothing for it. They wanted to do something in their communities. They wanted the self-esteem that comes from doing something. The communities that they lived in wanted to do something for them. We will be seeking proposals from communities around Australia to participate in these pilot schemes. I am sure that we will see many imaginative proposals put forward to help young people in a way which they were never helped by the churning, expensive, job destroying, morale destroying policies that the Labor Party had in place before the election campaign.

109,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is out of tune not only with me but also with the rest of Australia, particularly young people. It is quite clear that what we have is a Labor opposition which is wandering about in the wilderness, which has nothing better to say than, 'Put back those hugely expensive and ineffective programs', which did not solve youth unemployment. It simply fails to address the fact that this government is now-for the first time in 14 years-putting in place policies which will actually help to restore real job opportunities for young Australians and all Australians. We have already repealed Labor's unfair dismissal legislation. We have reformed the capital gains tax so that small businesses rolling over sums of $5 million or less can roll it into new businesses or into superannuation without being subjected to the capital gains tax. We are cutting back on the mass of red tape, the jungle of regulation, that has grown up at the urging of the Labor Party and the ACTU over the last 13 years. We are putting in place economic policies to cut back on the deficit. Mr Fitzgibbon-Why is unemployment going up?",33

111,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The former Treasurer of the Labor Party over there knows that his party never faced up to the budgetary problem. There was $70 billion worth of accumulated deficits over the last five years of Labor. If spending other people's money could solve the problem, they would have solved it four, five and six times over. They could not stop themselves spending other people's money. And they did not solve the unemployment problem; they ran up unemployment to the highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s. This government is addressing the problem. This government is listening to young Australians. This government is reviving small business. This government is listening to the needs of the battling families of this country, betrayed by the Labor Party.

113,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In addressing this issue this afternoon, I am pleased to say that the announcement made on the run last Sunday by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the question of working for the dole has finally brought to a head a requirement by this parliament to face up to the most important issue that Australia has to come to terms with at the moment; that is, the question of unemployment. More importantly, I think this is a debate about the relationship between Canberra and each and every citizen of Australia. That is what it is about; that is what is at the heart of the debate. I think it also exposes the government for its lack of integrity and the fact that it deliberately misled the Australian population in the lead-up to the last election. I' Il tell you what: if anyone has been caught with his pants down on the question of integrity it is the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). Having listened to him today during his response on the MPI, all I can say is that, if the Prime Minister has an amnesia problem, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has an even bigger problem because the minister himself said, on 3 September 1995: There is no thought at all, Chris, of making any kind of work-for-the-dole scheme a compulsory scheme. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that perhaps the minister was carrying out the instructions of no less a person than the now Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition. I draw the attention of the House to a statement by the Prime Minister on page 21 of the Herald-Sun of 17 February 1996 that he sought to crawl out from under today prior to the start of question time. He was responding to a question from a Mr Cliff Allen which went: Why don't you get youths to work for the dole? What was the Prime Minister's response? I quote: We do not support the introduction of a work-for the-dole scheme. We do believe that young unemployed people should have access to effective training programs linked to real jobs and should be made aware of the opportunities available in the voluntary and community sector. We also have announced the establishment of a Green Corp, which will give up to 2000 young people, particularly the unemployed, the opportunity to contribute to environment preservation work for between 26 and 52 weeks a year. Not only has the minister misled the Australian population, but so has the Prime Minister himself. The debate is about what we are going to do to get the unemployed, and especially the long-term unemployed, back to work. I will tell you what those people do not expect. They do not expect quick-fix policies announced on the run, a reaction to the polls to try to cover up the Prime Minister's lack of credibility, support and attention with regard to his ministerial code of conduct which is in absolute tatters. Mr Deputy Speaker, I contend that our nation demands that the Australian government does something about the question of unemployment. There is an obligation on the part of the government of the day to put in place genuine labour market assistance. It is a two-way street; a decision that reaches out to all sections of Australian society. In return for individuals facing up to their responsibilities, it also means that there is a government in Canberra that is prepared to invest in our social fabric and prepared to invest in providing opportunities aimed at ensuring all Australians have an equal opportunity in life. That is what it is about-an opportunity in life on the basis of which we are all expected to front up to our responsibilities. I advance the contention that, in return for every individual Australian who is currently unemployed facing up to their responsibilities as Australian citizens, there is an obligation on the government to make sure that those people have access to schemes which guarantee everyone the opportunity of obtaining appropriate skills and of having access to training. It is also expected that they must front up to the all-important issue of the discipline of work. It is on that basis that we advance the notion that yes, Working Nation was perhaps the most comprehensive labour market scheme ever put forward by any government in Australia. It was tested, it was trialled, it was shown on balance to be highly successful. We also commissioned a mid-term review because the Australian Labor Party wanted to ensure that we improved on our success to date. We went out of our way to ensure that we had in place a system of labour market activity that guaranteed every section of Australian society-be it the young, the old, a woman, an indigenous person or a person of a non-English speaking background-access to a training program that met their special needs and their special aspirations. Our programs showed a requirement to meet certain minimum criteria. I do not think they are outrageous minimum criteria, but the Prime Minister's work for the dole scheme does not meet this set of minimum criteria. That has been exposed in question time in the last two days. He does not have answers which go to questions of detail on how this scheme-which has been dropped on the run to cover up the government's other difficulties-will deliver a helping hand to what is now a major problem. I remind this House that in the first 11 months of this government youth unemployment has increased by 14 per cent. I compare that with the record of the first Hawke government when youth unemployment fell by five per cent in its first 11 months. Let us go to some of the minimum criteria. Firstly, the scheme should not displace existing workers. Secondly, resources must be made available to enable full-time activity, not two days on and five days off, at the relevant national training award wage. Thirdly, participants must be guaranteed accredited onand off-the-job training within the work activity. That is what Bob Herbert, the Executive Director of the Metal Trades Industry Association, was talking about today when he criticised the Prime Minister's work for the dole scheme. Fourthly, there must be appropriate case management and supervision. Fifthly, participants must be able to leave the scheme-if anything, encouraged to leave the scheme-to accept full-time employment opportunities or part-time employment opportunities, without penalty. The sixth point is that access to and financial assistance must be made available to potential employers. Point seven is that the government must ensure appropriate levels of financial support for workers compensation, superannuation and safety aspects. The eighth point is that financial assistance must be available to participants for unavoidable employment-related costs such as the purchase of protective clothing, gumboots, transport and child care. Point nine is that placements must offer full-time opportunities and be for a minimum of six months. Point 10: organisations contracting to provide employment projects must state the proportion of people who will obtain permanent employment following the placement. Finally, point 11 is that implementation of such a scheme no longer requires further trials. It requires commitment, leadership and strength. The clear position is: if it is worth doing, it must be done properly and not on the run. We are here today because the Howard government dismantled a decent labour market program aimed at assisting people. At the moment, those people lack a sense of willingness to participate, because that helping hand is not there; they go home, shut the door and shut out the world. We must help those people to have a victory over their lack of self-confidence and social skills and over the depression which often holds them back. The Prime Minister-who has finally fronted this debate-might make mocking taunts about our requirement to ensure adherence to decent standards with respect to labour market programs, but the debate has clearly proven that the Howard government offers no solutions, no ideas and no practical programs to make a major attack on unemployment. I also mention in passing that it has exposed the government's lack of integrity. (Time expired) Consideration interrupted. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Staff: Senator Colston",34
114,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence: during question time, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me a question regarding staffing arrangements for Senator Colston, and I undertook to get the details and come back to the House, which I now do. The sequence of events was as follows. The President of the Senate wrote to me on 15 November last year, conveying a request from Senator Colston, which she had apparently received on 1 November, seeking a staff position under the MOPS Act at the AS06 level. That was to upgrade an AS04 position paid for by the Department of the Senate. The justification for this was to bring Senator Colston's clerical assistance into line with that applying in the office of the Deputy Speaker. The anomaly between the two offices had existed for some time under the previous government. On 28 November, my department recommended that the Deputy President's request be agreed to. It noted that the staffing arrangements were good, but it also noted that there was no justification for the anomaly between the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy President. I agreed to the request-and, importantly, this is where the narrative of the facts diverges from the allegations in the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question-and my decision to allocate a position under the MOPS Act was conveyed by my chief of staff to the office of the President of the Senate on 29 November. Subsequently, Senator Reid wrote to me not about the substantive issue itself but appealing my decision requiring that the funding of the upgraded position be from within the Department of the Senate's vote. My letter of 10 December-which the deputy leader erroneously referred to as specifically supporting the upgrade-was, in fact, a letter back to Senator Reid saying that I was standing by my original decision that the funding be from within the vote of the Senate. The Telstra vote was on 11 December. Any suggestion of bought votes is absolute garbage. Mr Crean-What about the second answer you had to come back on?",36
115,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,I continue to analyse your questions. NA Labour Market Programs Consideration resumed.,36
116,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (3.56 p.m.)-There was something more than usually futile about the opposition's MPI today, because the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in his MPI calls for labour market programs which require 'obligation on the recipient of unemployment benefits and on the government'. The work for the dole schemes which the Prime Minister e Mr Howard) announced on the weekend do precisely that. They require obligation on the recipient of unemployment benefits-that recipient is obliged to work-and they require obligation on the government-the government is required to make sure the recipient gets the money. So there is something more than usually futile in the opposition's tactics this afternoon. What is really upsetting the opposition is that last week, when they were down in the gutter digging around for a bit of 'sleaze', as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) called it, what the Prime Minister was doing was trying to tackle the real problems of this nation, of which the worse is the consistent tragedy of youth unemployment. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that the previous Labor government would never have been allowed to get away with a policy announcement of this sort. Quite apart from the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is feeling particularly set upon because of the rivalry of the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and others, he also has a very bad memory. If he could recall back to 1992, he would remember that, in the selfsame week that the then Prime Minister had to deal with the resignation of Graham Richardson, he went on to the Laurie Oakes program and announced the sale of Qantas, the nationalisation of TAFE and two other major national policies. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition has a very bad memory on this matter. What we hear from the opposition about this scheme is constant hysteria which demonstrates that they have been gazumped by a good idea. After three days of hysteria, constant carping and mindless criticism from members opposite, what do we ultimately get from the Leader of the Opposition? A big concession. He said, about three minutes from the end of his speech, that he actually supports the scheme. Why did he not come out and say that three days ago when the Prime Minister announced it? To come out and say that now is a bit like the hit-and-run driver coming back several hours later in a fit of remorse and guilt to try to take the victim to hospital. It is not good enough for the oppositogether tion to carp, complain and grizzle about good policy, simply because they did not think of it first. The simple truth is that this nation has hundreds of thousands of unemployed and we have hundreds of thousands of jobs that need to be done. We have so many people idle and we have so many jobs undone. Why shouldn't we put the unemployed to work on important community projects? The opponents of this scheme are saying that the unemployed should stay idle and that those jobs should remain undone. They are condemning people to life on the dole forever. They are denying to the Australian community the many benefits of having so many civic works performed by these people. The reason why 95 per cent of respondents to the Herald-Sun survey in Melbourne supported the Prime Minister's work for the dole scheme is that they understand, in a way that the opposition does not seem to, that keeping people idle is bad for them and the rest of society. Keeping people idle destroys the morale of the unemployed and saps the social fabric of our society. There are millions of Australians who have woken up to the fact that this constant paying of people the unemployment benefit, as the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) says, to stay in bed and watch videos or, as the Leader of the Opposition says, not to bother people in the street is a betrayal of our people and a breach of the social contract. We all know that work is what gives people their meaning and purpose. This very important initiative on the part of the government is designed to ensure that Australians have a sense of purpose and meaning. When the Prime Minister announced it the other day, you would think the Leader of the Opposition would have rushed to congratulate him. You would think the Leader of the Opposition would have emulated his colleague Mr Carr in Sydney and said, 'Yes, it is a good idea.' You would think the Leader of the Opposition would have cheered to the rafters these echoes of Ben Chifley coming from our current Prime Minister. You would think he would have said, 'Yes, let's work to try to build the right sort of project to help young unemployed people.' Instead, what did he do? He carped, grizzled and complained and trotted out a whole lot of ancient quotes taken from different contexts to try to suggest that the Prime Minister has changed his mind. So what! Lord Keynes once said, 'When circumstances change, I change my opinions. What do you do, sir?' What is consistent about the Prime Minister today, yesterday and all the other days of his career is a concern to ensure that every Australian gets a fair deal. Giving every Australian a fair deal means trying to ensure that everyone has a job. We cannot go on as we have. We cannot go on forever with eight or nine or whatever per cent of our people being unemployed. If we go on that way forever, there will be no-go areas in the cities and towns of Australia. We will have cities and towns where every second house has a barred window and grilled door. The constant accompaniment of our daily activity will be the wail of police sirens. People who have will live in apprehension. People who have not will live in a constant state of nature in the war of all against all. Work for the dole, let us be very specific, is an important part of the government's policy. But it is just one part of the government's policy. The government's policy is to have a whole series of measures designed to ensure that every Australian who wants a job can get a job. Obviously the most important criterion for achieving this is a more buoyant economy. That is why we have done our best to get interest rates down. They have come down in response to our policies. That is why it is very important to have a better trained society. That is why we have the modem Australian apprenticeship and traineeship scheme on which we are spending an extra $200 million over the coming four years. These are the principal pillars, if you like, of our policy to reduce unemployment. An important part of that policy is the announced work for the dole scheme. What we need to have is more jobs and more people ready and able to do those jobs. This sneer that we have had from members opposite this afternoon about painting rocks white is an insult to those selfsame community organisations whom members opposite have claimed to work with in times past. This government is determined to work with them in designingMr Gareth Evans-What about when the Prime Minister said as such in 1992? Is it an insult in 1992, or only in 1997?",36
117,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Go back to the United Nations, Gareth. Worry about foreign affairs, please, or get back into the gutter that you briefly emerged from last week. The fact is that our kids are better than that. Our better than the sort of painting rocks white sneer that we are hearing from members opposite. The community organisations that we intend to work with are capable of designing the sorts of projects that will give those kids meaningful work, an important purpose in life and appropriate training for their future. What did we do in times past when the then government came up with schemes to help the unemployed? We said that we thought they could be improved in certain ways, where we thought they could be improved. Essentially, we tried to cooperate with the then government in trying to do the right thing by the unemployed people of this country. What has demeaned the opposition and I suspect has brought the parliament into some disrepute over the last few days is the carping we have heard from members opposite. This is a work for the dole scheme because it substitutes work for the dole. Another way of looking at it might be to call it paid work experience or guaranteed part-time work, because that is precisely what it is. Young people get an award wage, a useful task and a social purpose. Who could possibly oppose that? I call on all members of this House, including members opposite, who claim to support the workers and battlers of this country, to get behind the scheme.",38

120,Mr CREAN,COMMITTEE AND DELEGATION REPORTS,"We charge support the amendments that have come back from the Senate because in all cases they reflect that which the Labor Party argued for in this place when the legislation was introduced. They do not reflect all of the amendments that we proposed, but they do reflect a number of them. It is for that reason that we support them. This is the act of a minister whose promise was to cut the red tape and paper work for small business but in fact' has increased them. Those sitting in the gallery might have been a bit confused about what all these numbers and clauses mean. Let me quote the impact of his legislation from a letter from someone affected by it. Mr Andrew Bliss runs a company called About Time, which imports a range of spare parts for clocks from dozens of suppliers in various countries. The size of the orders vary from $100 to $2,000 per order. As a result of the changes that this bill would have introduced but for our amendments after 1 January, Mr Bliss, on the import of the legislation of the Minister for Small  had this to say: My agent advises me that the $1,000 limit will reduce to $250That was their intention; the effect of the amendments now accepted is to delay that implementation for 12 months, so they do not have complete relief but they have some relief. To continue: forcing me in almost every instance to engage an agent to perform the clearance. Further, my agent will be charged $51.40 for the pleasure of raying my duty and sales tax. The ludicrous situation will exist where it will cost me $125 to pay a duty and tax bill of $75-far more than the sales tax and duty collected (and note, 99 per cent of what I import is duty free). He continues: This so far is the only change the Howard government has made which affects my business. Rather than 'slashing red tape for small business'your election quoteyou seem to be creating more. and taking money from my pocket. It is signed by Mr Andrew Bliss. This is a piece of legislation that breaks two of the coalition government's election promises. It breaks the promise that there will be no increase in taxes and it breaks the promise to cut red tape. The minister has refused to answer questions in this place. Indeed, he get so confused about a question from the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) that he had to come back and add to the answer on another day. We have him so confused about what the commitment is he does not quite know how he is going to measure it. Here is an example of how you are being measured, Minister-an example from a small business that you claim to represent but which you tum a deaf ear to. How can you say that you have the interests of small business at heart? How can you say that you are honouring your election promises to make it easier for small businesses to do their business? This is a classic example of imposition of both money and taxes as well as paper work. It just puts the lie to the suggestion you make that you are committed to slashing the red tape. You may have the opportunity in this debate to restate your commitment and tell us how you are going to cut down red tape. Are you going to implement the decisions of the Charlie Bell report? Are you going to desist from measures that increase taxes and increase the paper work? This first piece of legislation that you have introduced is not an auspicious start. I suggest to you that you owe an apology to the small businesses of this country in that you have reneged on promises to them, and this bill reflects the very significant way in which that reneging has occurred. I am pleased that the Labor Party has been able to achieve some relief. We will persist with initiatives and amendments in this place to try to force you to honour your promises because you clearly have no intention of doing it. Unless we keep the scrutiny up, small business will not get the relief they deserve. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative.

The purpose of the amendments is to introduce a two-tier annual licence fee to replace the flat $4,000 annual fee proposed in clause 6 of the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill 1996. Following the introduction of the bill and representations by various sections of the industry, the government has agreed to provide a two-tier annual licence fee system to replace the flat $4,000 annual fee proposed by the bill. Under the two-tier proposal, those depots which over the period of the relevant previous 12 months had fewer than 100 transactions would be subject to a licence fee of $1,500 annually. Those depots which had more than 100 transactions for the previous relevant 12 months would be subject to a licence fee of $4,000 annually. Customs records indicate that about 15 per cent of the current depots would fall into the category of fewer than 100 transactions per year.

The Minister for Small Business and Consumer  sals. He is now accepting them, so we welcome that change. I simply want to place on record the fact that the minister was given the opportunity to say what he was going to do for small business. He was given the opportunity to say what they would do in relation to the Charlie Bell report. He was given the opportunity to establish the targets and benchmark by which he could be measured in terms of doing something for small business. And he rejected every opportunity. The reality is that he has no intention of looking after the interests of small business. Even when he has the opportunity in this House to come in and set the record straight, he will not do it. He has to stick to the written text-prepared words, no policies. That is your problem. The reality is that small business are going to desert you in droves because you are not delivering for them.

122,Mr GARETH EVANS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"The bills in question here-the Productivity Commission Bill and the Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments Bill-seek to create the Productivity Commission through the amalgamation of two existing statutory bodies: the Industry Commission and the Economic Planning Advisory Council. Also included in the package is the non-statutory Bureau of Industry Economics, or BIE. I have to say at the outset that this is something of a quixotic enterprise, given that for all practical purposes these mergers have already taken place. Executive or administrative action which has already been undertaken has meant that the merger of these bodies has already occurred in fact, if not strictly as a matter of law. In that happening, of course, we have seen this government yet again arrogantly disregarding the role and, indeed, the tradition of the supremacy of this parliam.ent by acting as if the Productivity Commission was already operating, even though this legislation was necessary to effect its creation. Before the last election we heard a lot from the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about respecting the role of the parliament and the supremacy of the parliament. Since then, of course, that is a series of statements that have rung increasingly hollow as we have seen the way in which the Prime Minister has addressed standards issues in this House on successive occasions, in the way in which the Prime Minister has treated contemptuously the Speaker in a fashion lovingly recorded on the front page of the Canberra Times this morn1996 ing, and in the way in which-just to take one other example-the Prime Minister has allowed a practice to develop, notwithstanding his protestations to the contrary before the election, of ministers absolutely abandoning their responsibility to come into this chamber BILL 1996 and participate in the debates on their own legIslation. The Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), is of course not here at the moment, any more than he was here last night for the debate on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill; and I do not expect to see him during the consideration in detail debate on this bill any more than we did last night. That is an unhappy variation from the kinds of standards the Prime Minister said that he would be seeking to establish or impose or reinforce in this place. The most egregious example of parliament being ignored in relation to the bill presently before us is the fact that in July last year a report called Stocktake of Progress and Micro-economic Reform was issued in the name of the Productivity Commission, not then established. I understand there were some pretty red faces around the place. A lot of people said, 'Oops,' in unison when it was pointed out that they could not really utilise the name of the Productivity Commission if that body had not yet been created. We have seen subsequently some typographical gyrations in subsequent reports. I am thinking in particular of the automotive industry report, technically the Industry Commission just a few months ago, the cover of which refers also to the Productivity Commission as being embraced by the Industry Commission and the other two bodies. The point I am making is simply that this shows the kind of disrespect for the parliament which the Prime Minister was at pains to claim would never occur during his watch. On this, as on so many other matters, we have seen spectacular lapse from grace, from standards, and spectacular hypocrisy. The interesting thing that I should mention in passing about that particular stocktake report-because it is indeed relevant to what I will be saying in a moment about the Productivity Commission itself-is that it demonstrated the nature of the policy agenda that the new Productivity Commission, and the government standing behind it, is obviously minded now to pursue. Among the agenda items mapped in this particular report back in July last year are further cuts in general tariff levels, from I July 1997, from five per cent to three per cent and the abolition of the sugar tariff; the review of all limits on foreign investment with a view to relaxing restrictions; minimising pricing oversight to situations of monopoly; terminating bounties; terminating export assistance such as the DIFF scheme and the export market development grants scheme-very controversial last year-the removal of airport cross-subsidies thereby disadvantaging regional airports; and the introduction of road pricing in the cities. Even more interestingly, from the point of view of those concerned about the whole trend represented by this sort of list, the report strongly suggests that minimum wages could be reduced and wage loading, including penalties, overtime and shift rates, could, in fact, slashed for some workers; that stripping back award conditions should be undertaken going beyond that which has already been achieved by the government in its industrial relations legislation. Just to take those particular examples demonstrates what a very dry agenda indeed it is that is being contemplated for the future in the advice of this newly established bodyone might go so far as to say, using the language employed with his usual finesse by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in the United Kingdom last week 'dryas a pommy's bath towel'. Indeed, that is the sort of characterisation that could be given of the approach. If one were minded to use disgracefully discriminatory expressions of that kind, as the foreign minister obviously was to his British hosts, that is the kind of expression that could be used in relation to the kind of agenda that we can expect to be adopted now by this new body. The more general point that I want to make arising out of this is that many of the issues that I have identified as simply having been mentioned in this stocktake report are quintessentially industry policy matters and the further concentration of advice that is involved in the amalgamation of these bodies will very obviously and very significantly increase the weight· of so-called Treasury agenda views in the government. There is no doubt what is contemplated or understood by the expression 'Treasury agenda'. It is a very dry, very desiccated agenda indeed-one that has been established in long standing practice under successive governments, because it tends to survive successive governments, in terms that demonstrate very little concern for the kinds of outcomes that would certainly be preoccupying us at the moment in terms of growth and employment creation, a much greater preoccupation with high theory, numerical abstractions and the pursuit of various statistical 'wills-o' - the-wisp' which do not necessarily bear very much resemblance to the real world experience that is going on out there. I am not suggesting for a moment that economic policy should be conducted with be anything other than the most scrupulous balance and responsibility and having regard to a whole variety of considerations but there is no doubt constantly in Australian policy making where Treasury is coming from on all of these matters. Equally, we can expect the concentration of advice within a single body responsible to the Treasurer under the Treasury mantle as accelerating that particular process. What we did in government-the Labor Party-was to pursue a competitive advice model to ensure that all sides of these debates would be considered. It is that competitive advice model which is being dismantled by the government. We are concerned that this will lead the government to pursue even worse economic and industry policies than the current policies that it is following. We are troubled by these developments and our concerns in this respect are spelled out in the second reading amendment which has been circulated to honourable members, the moving of which, at the end of my speech, I now foreshadow. The first matter referred to in the second reading amendment is our 'concern at the monopolisation of economic advice under the Treasury portfolio, with the abolition of EPAC and the BIE meaning the disappearance of independent sources of economic and industry policy advice to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Industry, Science Tourism'. The point being made there, of course, is that EPAC traditionally has reported to the Prime Minister and the Bureau Industry Economics has reported to the industry minister, equipping both of those ministerial players to participate actively effectively in the economic debate with different perspective from that which was available to the Treasurer through the advice going to him from the Industry Commission, as it has been. The policy of creating the Productivity Commission out of the wreckage of these three other bodies was announced in one of issues. the headland speeches which we have called, I think appropriately, the Cape Barren speeches of the Prime Minister - in this instance the one delivered to the committee Melbourne on 18 July 1995. That speech did not actually canvass the positive contribution that had been made to the public policy debate by either the Bureau of Industry Economics or by EPAC. There was no acand knowledgment then, nor have I seen one subsequently, of the contribution that these particular bodies have made, no plans to the expertise or the particular strength they have built up over the years. that speech and all we see now reflected in the particular legislation before us is an agenda to narrow the focus of the advice going to the government. The Productivity Commission was spoken of only in the conand text of expanding the functions of the Indusof try Commission, which it, to some extent, does. It was not talked about in terms of taking on the roles fulfilled by the BIE or by EPAC. It needs to be understood just how influential in the policy process these two effectively disbanded bodies, EPAC and BIE, have in fact been. EPAC, in addition to organising many conferences and seminars and commissioning a great deal of independent research from academic researchers around the country, has produced some excellent and influential reports of its own across a whole range of policy areas. The report, for example, by the Private Infrastructure Task Force is one example of EPAC work which led very and directly to changes in government policy, in this case in the area of infrastructure bonds. The more recent report into child care of provides another example where some of EPAC's recommendations were adopted by the current government. We did not support and all the conclusions in question, but we always a have recognised the quality of the work. We certainly did not seek to silence the body which produced that work. EPAC conducted research into a number of long-term economic issues of significance and importance, including labour market matters, investment and economic growth, the effect of tariffs on economic growth and some demographic The BIE, the Bureau of Industry Economics, examined a multitude of industry issues in during its existence within the industry portfolio. One important function it performed was the publication of international performance indicators in the context of benchmarking studies, both general reports those concentrating on specific industries. I am not saying we always agreed with every last ounce of detail produced by these reports, use but they were stimulating and informative. They were significant, positive contributions All we saw into the public debate. Other important BIE publications were various reports into regional trade policies such as Occasional Paper 29 which examined the potential gains to Australia from APEC report 95/17 which examined the impact closer economic relations with New Zealand. Other areas included infrastructure pricing, energy efficiency and the greenhouse issue and its effect on business in Australia. These examples that I have given do, I think, demonstrate that the BIE and EPAC did have distinct and complementary roles in the provision of advice and research, and there is simply no basis for them being abolished. It cannot be asserted-I do not know whether the government is going to be minded now to assert it-that all of those functions will continue unhindered under the new organisational arrangements, that they have simply been absorbed under a common umbrella for reasons of administrative convenience. That claim might have some credibility were it not for the fact that very substantial financial savings are sought to be accomplished by this particular amalgamation-$5 million in the first year, 1997-98; $6.15 million in the next two years; another $5 billion in the fourth, making a total of $22 million worth of saving. Anyone who believes that an organisation, even with some rationalisation of administrative support functions, can perform the same range of functions as it was previously with $22 million less to spend in doing so over a four-year period manifestly has not taken much account of real world constraints. What we see in all of this I think is quintessentially an exercise by the government in getting rid of alternative public policy advice. It is reminiscent of the behaviour of the Liberal Party during the 1980s when alternative views were silenced, when those who disagreed with the New Right agenda of those days, much of which has been maintained subsequently, were denied preselection, as I think one person in the chamber would be prepared to frankly acknowledge. The second paragraph in the second reading amendment further develops the point that we want to make here. This would have the House expressing its concern that 'the centralising of economic and industry policy advice under one minister increases the risk of the government adopting inappropriate policies in these areas'. Our view, and I think it would be widely shared outside the Labor Party and outside this chamber, is that the virtual monopolisation of economic policy advice under the Treasury portfolio will be bad for Australian industry, bad for the Australian economy. There will be now nobody, as I have already said, reporting independently to the industry minister; there will be now nobody reporting independently to the Prime Minister, as BIE and EPAC respectively did. It has to be said that Treasury's own record is not such as to inspire confidence in its capacity to get things right if the only advice coming to it is from within its own particular stable. The kinds of errors that have been made by Treasury and those organisations associated with it, like the Taxation Office, in recent years have become almost now the stuff of public legend. Certainly, we suffered in our last year or two of government as a consequence of some over spectacular errors in the assessment of the state of the economy, particularly the amount of revenue that would be derived from it. The significant shortfall in the tax collections in the 1995-96 year from that which had been confidently estimated by Treasury was one of the reasons why there was a larger budget deficit at the end of our term than had been contemplated. Now the Treasurer, Mr Costello, has a black hole or a crater of his own to answer for, a significant portion of which has been created of course by again misestimates by Treasury of the way in which company tax collections would operate, misestimates of the impact of inflation on the amount of money that would be picked up through the ordinary personal income tax system and other errors as well. I do not think we will be hearing too much more from the government about alleged mismanagement by our government in the past in the face of this spectacular blow-out that the current Treasurer, the member for Higgins, Mr Costello, is now having to live with. It serves him right for all the posturing and the triumphalism that we heard over the last year. I have not got any sympathy for him. I do not stop now to pursue that point any further, I simply make the point that Treasury is not the outfit that comes through all of this smelling absolutely like roses. It is one reason why we should be sceptical about concentrating so much of the resources for economic advice and industry policy advice in that particular agency. In this context, I can hardly forbear from also mentioning the complete misreading of the state of the Australian economy by Treasury and its advisers from mid-1989 to mid1991 which led to monetary policy, with all the benefit of hindsight, having been imposed far too tightly over that period with the consequences that we all stiIl unhappily recall. Having just spent the Christmas period reading Mr Edwards's account of that particular period of policy making, I am ininded to be even more strong in my language than I have been. I simply make the point-not in any great spirit of Treasury bashing, although it is a long standing Australian political sport which does have its attractions; I do not, however, seek to understate the degree of difficulty which is obviously involved in making many of these judgments, I only wish they were not made with such supreme confidence on so many occasions and then have to be corrected with equal indifference to the situation later on-that while we are not against Treasury nor against the agencies in the Treasury portfolio-and we fuIly acknowledge the good work that so many of them do so often-these errors of judgment, errors of fact and shortfalls in forecasting capacity emphasise the point that there really does need to be a plurality of views coming from a plurality of sources. As I said earlier on, there does need to be something of a competitive model so far as the provision of economic and industry policy advice is concerned. There simply, at the very least, is not a monopoly of wisdom within the Treasury portfolio. AIl advice should not be concentrated within that portfolio and its various outriders. Advice should be contestable, putting it in economists' parlance, for the same reason that other spheres of activity should be contestable-because the quality of the product will generally improve in a competitive situation. That is the kind of advice that Treasury itself tends to provide everyone else on a daily basis. Ironically, it is not being followed by the government which is supposedly so pro-competitive in its outlook. What this legislation is doing is further inarginalising the contribution of the already marginal Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) in the economic debate-and that is no joy so far as Australian industry is concerned. I know that is a theme that others of my colleagues on this side of the House will want to pursue in further debate. The remaining aspects of the second reading amendment refer to the particular context in which the new Productivity Commission will operate and identify some of the criteria to which it should have regard in its advice generation but which are spectacularly absent from the language of the biIl as it is presently drafted. So what we say is that in a number of respects the commission ought to be subject to quite specific legislative requirements, that it do have regard to some particular aspects of the real world in which Australian industry has to operate. In paragraph 3 of the second reading amendment we state-and we believe the House should agree- 'the House believes that the Commission should be required to have regard, when providing its advice, not only to Australia's international obligations but the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers'. Of course it is appropriate that regard be had to the kinds of obligations we ourselves have incurred through the World Trade Organisation, WTO, system under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations; of course it is appropriate that regard should be had to obligations under the CER and under other bilateral arrangements; of course it is appropriate that regard should be had to the obligations, formal and otherwise, that we have entered into through our participation in APEC. All of those obligations have a significance in terms of the ongoing debate about tariff and non-tariff barriers and the appropriate level of those barriers in the present economic state of affairs that we are experiencing. What is important is that that debate also be informed by a very clear appreciation of what our trading partners are actually up to so far as those particular barriers are concerned. The Australian economic advisory bodies have been very good over the years in developing criteria or standards for the objective evaluation of tariff rates, the concept of effective rates of protection and so on. There is a large store of expertise. It is very important that that expertise be mobilised in a very direct way in the activities of the Productivity Commission and the commission have regard to these things in order to dispel the fear that a great many people have that the new body will be overly theoretical in its approach and too dismissive of the real conditions which Australian industry is facing. If the government oppose this proposal, then they are effectively admitting that what they want is advice couched in the context of theory rather than the kind of reality that is being experienced by Australian traders, Australian manufacturers, Australian service providers and Australian employees. A further provision that we foreshadow in our second reading amendment is our belief 'that the Commission should be required to have regard, when providing its advice, to the regional development and employment consequences of that advice'. I think, again, this is so self-evident that it hardly needs elaborate exposition by me. But there are a great many examples in this country where industry policy can have an enormously significant impact and a differential impact on particular regions. I suppose one of the most spectacular impacts in that respect is the particular role that automotive industry policy has in affecting the economies of the state of Victoria and even more crucially of South Australia. We do consider it very important that the legitimate issues of regional development and regional impact are properly addressed by the commission in its work-not simply as a matter of superficial lip-service to the regions but as a core part of the commission's analysis. I am not sure that was particularly evident in the majority report of the automotive industry report that the Industry Commission has recently produced. The only way to ensure that this occurs is, as I have indicated, to amend the legislation to require the commission to take regional issues into account. Again, of course employment considerations ought to be taken very specifically into account. This government would be breaking its duck to take employment considerations into account in the advice of these bodies or anywhere else. I remind the House that as recently as last night the Prime Minister was running away as fast as his little legs could carry him from any kind of commitment to getting the present rate of unemployment down from its presently disastrous and unacceptable levels. When challenged as to whether he accepted Senator Vanstone's immortal line about this government not deserving to win the next election if it did not get employment down, the Prime Minister was heard to say that he would never give away any electoral contest and that he certainly was not going to make any commitment, any promises or any predictions about in effect employment being reduced. That absence of a commitment to this task-the biggest, most obvious human task that we have at the moment in this countrycontinues to be a matter of absolute despair to those of us who want to see some better performance from the government. Obviously, the employment criterion is crucial. Obviously, it ought to be the subject of close attention in the reports and the advice given by this new body. We want some language to that effect. Another area of quite specific concern that we have relates to the provisions about competitive neutrality in the legislation. This is a particular theme which the member for Werriwa, my colleague the shadow minister for competition policy, Mr Latham, will want to develop in more detail-and I basically leave it to him. But the point in a nutshell is this: we believe that competitive neutrality should apply equally across both the public and the private sector. That means to say that, while government businesses should not enjoy unfair advantages which are not enjoyed by their competitors and there should be mechanisms of the kind contained in this legislation to sort out whether advantages exist and to remove them if they do not have public benefits, equally we also believe that public sector businesses should not themselves be disadvantaged in their competitive activity against the private sector with the consequence that this would have such disadvantage of denying consumers additional choice in various markets. There are plenty of examples of concerns in this respect about the disadvantage which is experienced by public sector bodies: competition in pathology labs, for example, in Victoria; concern about greater accountability obligations on public bodies which add to their cost structures; requirements to deliver services by public bodies that would not be provided if market conditions prevailed; reduced managerial autonomy. These are all matters that do need to be taken into account if you are serious about competitive neutrality on both sides of the coin and you are not simply banging a one-dimensional one-sided private sector drum. There are some other aspects of this legislasideration tion which should be noted before I finally sit down. It does increase the powers to be vested in the new body, the Productivity Commission, over those which were enjoyed by the Industry Commission in particular in the past in some respects: for example, by making the Productivity Commission the complaints body for breaches of competitive neutrality, as I have just indicated-at least, for breaches by Commonwealth businesses. Further examples of increased powers are: provisions allowing the Productivity Commission to undertake research on its own initiative about matters relating to industry and productivity; making its primary focus productivity, which is no bad thing; and conducting evaluations of Commonwealth government programs. All of those things are prima facie potentially acceptable. We do not argue against them. I simply make the point that the government's desire in expanding these functions could have been achieved in many ways without the destruction of the BIE and EPAC. I do finally, however, seek c1arification-I do not know whether the minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Con willing to provide it; again, it makes the point about the absence of the Treasurer-about the mechanics of the proposal that the commission be able to conduct evaluations of Commonwealth programs. I have some questions which I would like to have answered. Does that mean that the Productivity Commission will be able to initiate evaluations of any Commonwealth budgetary program? Will other agencies have to cooperate in such evaluations? Will the commission have to be requested by a minister to conduct an evaluation? Will the parliament itself be able to make such a request? Why is this power of evaluation even necessary, given other Commonwealth bodies who can undertake evaluations, such as the Australian National Audit Office or the Department of Finance? If we do not get answers to those questions or a satisfactory resolution of some of the matters that we want to pursue in the conin detail debate, we will certainly be arguing in the Senate that these bills be referred to a committee of the Senate so that the commission can be more adequately scrutinised than is possible in this particular place. I do not whether we are going to get answers but I hope we do. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) expresses its concern at the monopolisation of economic advice under the Treasury portfolio, with the abolition of EPAC and the BIE meaning the disappearance of independent sources of economic and industry policy advice to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism; (2) expresses its concern that the centralising of economic and industry policy advice under one Minister increases the risk of the Government adopting inappropriate policies in these areas; (3) believes that the Commission should be required to have regard, when providing its advice, not only to Australia's international obligations but the progress made by Australia's trading partners in reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers; (4) believes that the Commission should be required to have regard, when providing its advice, to the regional development and employment consequences of that advice; and (5) believes that the legislation should reflect the principle that competitive neutrality should apply equally across the public and private sector, and that government businesses should not suffer specific disadvantage in competing against the private sector"". (Time expired) Ms Macklin-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.",44
123,Dr NELSON,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"I would like to speak to the Productivity Commission Bill and the formation of the Productivity Commission and also make some comments about unemployment, to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has alluded. This bill establishes the Productivity Commission, as we have heard, and combines the Industry Commission, the Economic Planning Advisory Council and the Bureau of Industry Economics. The functions of the Productivity Commission naturally reflect the diverse activities that have been carried out by those former three bodies. It is noteworthy that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to them as being formed out of 'the wreckage of these three other bodies'. If the opposition feels that they were indeed wreckage, then it would make eminent sense that we form a new and effective organisation. The Productivity Commission will in a sense focus itself on the productivity and performance of industry or of the economy as a whole, labour market issues and legislative or administrative action that affects productivity performance. It will hold inquiries, provide advice to the minister, provide secretariat and research services to government bodies, investigate competitive neutrality complaints and conduct research. The bill provides for a flexible range of working methods for the commission. That will include the conduct of hearings, publishing a draft report and, obviously, making recommendations. The minister should-and indeed will-be able to request advice and, with ministerial discretion, publish that advice. It may also be asked to provide secretariat and research assistance to both government and non-government bodies-and I think that that is significant. The bill also provides for mandatory access to witnesses and information. Apart from exposing arrangements working to the benefit of corporations and to the detriment of consumers, so too doe·s Australia need a commission such as this which, amongst other things, exposes restrictive labour market practices. Unless we boost productivity as a nation, our incomes and living standards will fall further behind those of our major competitors. Also, of course, our ability to make significant inroads into unemployment will be significantly diminished. I note, for example, that the Business Council of Australia's use of Access Economics modelling calculated that long-run gains to the improved efficiency of all government services would alone add about four per cent to GOP. Micro-economic reform and best practice procedures offered, in the BCA's opinion, a private sector boost to GOP of about seven per cent. There is an enormous task clearly lying ahead of the Productivity Commission and those of us in government who ought to be listening to them. Improving productivity means getting a better return from our resources, our people and our capital and this means doing a stocktake of micro-economic reform-assessing where we are now and addressing in a long-term sense those barriers to the future generation of wealth. These include transport costs on land and the waterfront, fuel costs, postal and communication services, labour market practices, taxation anomalies and compliance costs. In other words, what are we doing or not doing that stops us from doing business better? What is holding us back from effective competition with our trading partners? If you speak to people in primary industry-forestry, for example-it is not just work practices; it is the cost of getting your produce to markets, it is the cost of getting it from markets to the waterfront and then of course exporting it to our markets overseas. In this sense, all of us in the parliament need to reflect; it is time our political parties started to think in terms of what is in the best long-term interests of Australia rather than our short-term selfpolitical interests. The Productivity Commission can play perhaps at times a provocative role but a very important role in addressing issues that we find politically too difficult or sensitive to even consider. The Productivity Commission, like the Industries Assistance Commission and the Industry Commission before it, is likely to have a major impact on the Australian economy. Through the 1970s and 1980s both were, along with Bert Kelly and the Australian Financial Review, the single most important force in pushing Australia away from the MCEwen doctrine of high industrial tariffs, which made much of Australian manufacturing industry unable to compete in world markets. Mr Bill Scales, Chairman of the Productivity Commission, summarised his role and that of the commission best when he told the Melbourne Age in June last year: The greatest challenge for all of us is to understand that the reform agenda never stops. We know that with changing technology what we did 10 years ago may not be relevant today and we need to keep always going back and revisiting those things that need to be challenged and adjusted to ensure we have a strong, flexible economy. If the commission is to be effective it has to be, in a sense, independent of government. Unconstrained by the political shackles of party politics, it should be free to develop and promote ideas for reform that may make us politically uncomfortable but which are badly needed by the country. As such, the commission may not always be popular. The current Productivity Commission review of the regulatory and administrative environment under which private insurers work is one such policy area, as are its push for the fundamental reform of the taxation system and proposals to further reduce tariff protection for the car industry. However, what this government and future ones expect from the commission are reports recognising that ultimately the government must be able to make policy decisions that reflect on the one hand a balance between what might be required in a business and an economic sense and on the other hand the political considerations of government. Government, in contrast to the commisSIOn, will always have to take into account the social consequences of the decisions that we make, which again refers back to what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) was talking about in terms of decisions affecting regional Australia. What is always right in a purist sense is not always in the longer-term interests of society. The strength of a body such as the Productivity Commission is that it takes an economy-wide perspective rather than the narrower one of a particular industry group. That is one of the cogent arguments for seeing the three bodies amalgamated. Like the Tariff Board and the Industry Commission before it, it is able to bring Australians to a better understanding of how particular policies work either for or against the better interests of society. The one provision of the bill which has prompted the expression of some concern by economic commentators, amongst them the Australian's Alan Wood, is in part 4, sections 17 and 18, clause (2): (2) If (a) the Minister decides to publish the advice; and (b) the advice contains information whose publication would, in the Minister's opinion, be contrary to the public interest; the Minister may publish the advice with deletions. (3) If the advice is published with deletions, the Minister must also publish the fact that the advice is published with deletions. Whilst critics may argue that this breaches transparency, it is more than outweighed by the need to involve the commission in providing advice on sensitive policy matters, such as community rating on private health insurance, consumption taxes and the implications of government decisions from which its considerable expertise might otherwise be excluded. If I were debating from the point of view of the opposition on this particular bill I would suggest that it is in the interests of the community to have the government able to receive confidential advice, if the minister believes it must be so, from a body like the Productivity Commission and not just from individual private sector organisations that have a much narrower and, dare I say, selfinterested focus in the advice that they provide. Although this section might conceivably be at some stage open to abuse, the legislation assures that we will know when advice is being sought and withheld from publication in the public interest. The minister or the government of the day mayor may not pay a political price for that. I would like to make some comments about unemployment, which does relate to productivity, or a lack of it, and the Productivity Commission. In particular, I would like to address the issue of people working for unemployment benefits, an issue about which I am sure the Productivity Commission would have a view. I sense that the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) may rise and say that I am straying from the topic of the debate. I have always been a strong advocate of people working for unemployment benefits. Whilst unemployment is a social and economic disaster it is also a significant public health problem. The problem with many politicians is that we do not understand what unemployment feels like from the inside. But there are many writers in the literature who do. Albert Camus, for example, said, 'Without work all life goes rotten.' Walter Greenwood in Love on the Dole said of unemployment: Nothing to do with time; nothing to spend; nothing to do today, tomorrow nor the day after; nothing wear; can't get married. A living corpse; a unit the spectral army of lost men. In The Road to Wigan Pier George Orwell said: It is only when you lodge in streets where nobody has a job and where getting a job seems about probable as owning an aeroplane ... that you begin to understand the changes that are being worked into society. There has been a lot of research done on the impact that unemployment has on the health of human beings. For example, it has been established by the British Department of Census and Population and published in a series in a British Medical Journal that the excess mortality rate for unemployed middle aged men approaches 30 per cent, that the wives of unemployed men have a 20 per cent higher death rate and that separation divorce amongst unemployed people is twice as common. It was summarised by the executive editor of the British Medical Journal in 1991 when he said, 'The evidence that unemployment kills, particularly the middle aged, now verges on the irrefutable.' In Australia, the 1996 health survey, for example, found that 15to 24-year-old unemployed males are 64 per cent more likely to suffer poor health and unemployed females are 82 per cent more likely to suffer poor health. Some 40 per cent of unemployed 15 to 24 year olds were found to suffer from a psychological disorder. There is a 17 per cent higher death rate for unemployed men in Australia; 57 per cent more high blood pressure; 53 per cent more smoking; and Australians who are unemployed have 50 per cent more doctor visits a year and 35 per cent more admissions to hospitals. The death and disability rate for children under the age of four who have unemployed parents is considerably higher than for those children who grow up in families where the parents work. Giving people incentives to work for their unemployment benefits is not about saving money and creating jobs. The solution to the problem, obviously, is creating employment. That is, of course, amongst other things, what the Productivity Commission is all about. There is a human dimension to unemployto ment which I think we have failed to come to of terms with. There is a whole section of this society who feel that there is no place for them. In many ways we have cut them off from the economic mainstream. You might say that, in a sense, we give people money to as stay at home, to participate, albeit briefly, in a labour market program and then to return to the couch and tell them in all sorts of ways that they are unimportant. What we need to do in coming to terms with this is to say to every Australian, 'No matter who you, where you are or what part of society you are in, there is a place for you.' I spent 12 years practising in a housing commission area and I have worked with a lot of people who were unemployed. I was unemployed myself as a teenager-for only three weeks, but I know what it is like to queue up and at the Commonwealth Employment Service; and my father was unemployed for a year when I was a teenager. I remember what it was like. It is a demeaning and humiliating experience. One of the reasons some people in this society describe unemployed people as 'dole bludgers' is that there is a perception that those who, usually through no fault of their own, are in receipt of some form of unemployment benefit are in some way taking something to which they are not entitled. One effective way of dealing with that is to give people who are unemployed the opportunity to feel that th-y have some status, that they have contact wIth other people, that they form relationshi-s with others and that they perhaps do somethIng more on Monday than they did on Sunday. For those who criticise the Prime Minister's initiative in this area, just remember-and all of us have the.m a- constituents-the people who have applIed for over 100 to 150 jobs. In most cases, they have never even had an acknowledgment from an employer in the form of a letter or anything else. They are so ?emoralised and despondent. If you put that III the context of living in a country where we have in excess of one young person committing suicide every day and another 50 trying, - e have to try things that we may not find, at hrst glance, acceptable but which at least give - oung people especially the opportunity to f.eel a se-se of belonging to the community - rom which they have become increasingly Isolated. We live in a country where we define ourselves through work. Within minutes of meeting someone they will inevitably ask you ;vhat sort of work you do. If the response is, I am unemployed,' generally there is a - regnant pause and both people feel uncomfortable. In this case, perhaps we have the opportunity to give 5,000 young people the chance to say that they spend two days a we-k working, whether it is assisting with the maIntenance of a hospital, caring for older people at home or doing something which F-ed.Hollows described as human caring-not dIggIng holes in roads, painting rocks or any of the other ridiculous things that have been discussed in the last couple of days. I would also like to remind the critics of the suggestion that some young Australians have never had a job, that they feel that they do not belong, that they have no role to play in A-stralia and that for them, as George Orwell saId,. 'Getting a job is about as probable as owmng an aeroplane.' Work imposes a time stru.cture on your day, it provides you with SOCIal contact with others, it gives you social statu.s, it requires regularity and it gives you tractIOn so, as I have said, you do more on Monday than you did on Sunday. Unemployed people suffer frequent humiliation. This is an opportunity to see whether we can p-ll some young people, in particular, out of thIS despair. You must also consider that whoever is in government, whether it is us or the Labor P-rty, there - i!1 continue to be people who WIll lose theIr Jobs and those who will continue to be unemployed. If we achieved the 5V2 per cent white paper projections on unemplo-ment by the tum of the century, we would stIll have half a million people unemployed and 15 per cent youth unemployment. We have to find some way of saying to that group in the community who, no matter what pol-cies we p.ursue---{)bviously, in my case, I belIeve that If we pursue the right ones we - ill create .more jobs-are perhaps not likely In the medIUm to long term to get a job that we have a place for them, they are important and they are valued. It is also worth reminding the House that many young people come from families that have known nothing other than debt and poverty. They spend a lot of time with their parent or parents, depending on the nature of the family arrangements. You might say that they ought to feel glad about all that, and all that sort of thing, but in fact many of these people - eel - shamed. We live in a country that projects Images of materialistic success - nd they feel ashamed that they have ver; lIttle opportunity of achieving that. . In conclusion, I strongly support the establIshment of the Productivity Commission. Some of the remarks that were made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), which I have addressed, probably need to be taken up. I too will be interested in the answer to one question in particular that he asked. I also ask him to reflect on his statement that the government needs to be 'getting unemployment down from the currently disastrous levels'. The current levels of unemployment are about that which they were when the previous government was in office. So perhaps it is time that there was a little bit more honesty from both sides of politics about the realistic expectations of creating more employment. Personally I think that, as important as the fiscal consolidation program is, as important as our labour market reforms are, eventually Australia will need to embrace simplification of its inequitable tax system and create an environment where it is easier for people to create wealth and jobs for so many Australians.",51
124,Mr LATHAM,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Werriwa) (5.09 p.m.)There is, or so th..: legend runs, a lovely piece of graffiti on the walls of the London School of Economics: 'Why is there only one monopolies commission?' In relation to this piece of legislation I think the parliament is entitled to ask, 'Why is the government reducing its sources of advice on the economy to just one narrow stream, the narrow stream of neoclassical economIcs?' It is recognised throughout the Public Service and indeed the nation that the Productivity Commission and the Treasury are peas in the one pod when it comes to economic advice, both embracing the narrow stream of neoclassical economics. This means that all of the economic advice going to the federal government will be based on just one set of formulas, one set of prescriptions. This is not to suggest, however, that market forces do not play a constructive role in stimulating economic activity. Indeed, no society has found a better way of facilitating growth and generating wealth than by holding out personal incentives and the profit motive. The point is that neoclassical economics is a poor way to describe and understand a market economy. It relies on a flawed assumption about economic behaviour-that markets are dominated by rational participants displaying perfect knowledge and exercising perfect choice. Rationality is defined in terms of narrow self-interest and income maximising behaviour. In truth nobody has perfect knowledge and no consumer has yet enjoyed perfect market choice. Moreover and more importantly, economic behaviour is not always rational in the neoclassical sense. Markets are simply an expression of thesociety and culture in which they operate. Ultimately neoclassical thought relies on Margaret Thatcher's declaration that 'there is no such thing as society'. In practice, however, human behaviour can never be reduced to a set of formulas and assumptions abstracted from the social environment. A more accurate understanding of market economies needs to incorporate aspects of altruistic, as well as self-interested, behaviour. No society can function without basic elements of co-operation and compassion. Just as much, cultural considerations-the set of values, beliefs and prejudices which hold society together-are an important determinant of economic behaviour. Yet they are essentially foreign to the neoclassical framework and the work of organisations like the Productivity Commission. In 1994, Paul Samuelson, 'the' textbook author, attended the first-ever forum on behavioural economics at the Harvard Faculty Club. The Australian Financial Review reported this as, 'like discovering that the Pope has stopped believing in God or that the world is flat after all'. Care should be taken, however, in interpreting these events. Even though the forum conceded that: Rationality does not prevail in financial markets to the degree traditional wisdom predicts, and that non-rational behaviour is commonplace and occasionally becomes a predominant trendit nonetheless concluded that: People behave non-rationally in orderly, systematic ways. Predictable ways which, once detected, can let rational investors who have eliminated their own sub-optimal biases maximise their gains and grow rich in markets full of non-rational investors. That is, irrational behaviour is now being forecast through a rational framework. There is something very frightening indeed about professional economists - ho seek to si-plify all issues into a self-contamed and predIctable framework. Doctrine has been allowed to mug reality. Economic activity-national and international-is now far too complex for the reductionism of general theories. There are no natural laws in economics, only fools who try to invent them. I believe quite passionately that there is much to commend an institutionalist approach to economic analysis in the great tradition of Veblen and Galbraith; that is, a reliance on the empirical methods of observation and experience. Economic behaviour is assessed through a combination of self-interest, altruism, political, social and cultural influences. Market influences are acknowledged for their positive contribution to economic growth, with an interventionist role for governments in correcting market failures and influencing the distribution of market wealth. Firms and regions. according to this paradigm, are taken as the most useful units of economic analysis. This analytical and descriptive style is suited to handling the way in which changes in culture and technology influence economic outcomes. Cultures, like economies, are never static. They evolve and adapt in an incremental fashion. There is no easy way to transform views and practices ingrained in social values across several generations. This cultural framework influences all aspects of economic behaviour. Economies cannot be understood without an assessment of institutions such as property rights, social capital, the administration of justice, social tolerance, and acceptance of internationalism. A crucial issue in the development of economic policy is how successfully cultures can adapt to new economic opportunities and threats. I mentioned then social capital-these cultural influences that very much fashion the way in which economic outcomes are determined. I believe we need streams of economic advice in Australia that take account of these considerations. It will not be found, unhappily enough, in the work of the Productivity Commission and the Treasury. I would point policy towards the work of Robert Putnam in his extensive study of civic traditions in Italy. He found that there is a positive correlation between civic engagement and the performance of the polity and the economy. 'Strong society, strong economy; strong society, strong state', Putnam concludes. His finding is supported by Francis Fukuyama's analysis of the social virtues of trust and the creation of prosperity in each of the advanced economies. Fukuyama stated: . .. rational utility maximisation is not enough to give a full or satisfying account of why successful economies prosper or unsuccessful ones stagnate and decline. The degree to which people value work over leisure, their respect for education, attitudes toward the family, and the degree of trust they show toward their fellows all have a direct impact on economic life and yet cannot be adequately explained in terms of the economists' basic model of man. Just as liberal democracy works best as a political system when its individualism is moderated by public spirit, so too is capitalism facilitated when its individualism is balanced by a readiness to associate. The economic libertarian notion that rights and motives are directed solely for the purpose of self-interested materialism is misplaced. The concept of social recognition directly challenges modes of liberal thought reliant on the ideals of self-preservation and boundless accumulation. It further punctures neoclassical notions of the rational economic man. Fukuyama went on to point out: What usually passes as economic motivation is in fact not a matter of rational desire but a manifestation of the desire for recognition. Natural wants and needs are few in number and rather easily satisfied, particularly in the context of a modem industrial economy. Our motivation in working and earning money is much more closely related to the recognition that such activity affords us, where money becomes a symbol not for material goods but for social status or recognition. These considerations are well outside the work of the Productivity Commission. I am also concerned by the limits of their economic modelling. Anyone who has been through the study of the dismal science of economics knows that outputs from a model are directly related to the assumptions and inputs that fashion the model-that is that anything, virtually, can be proved in economic modelling according to the types of inputs and assumptions that are applied from first principles. I refer the House and honourable members to Brian Toohey's excellent book Tumbling Dice. It sets out a comprehensive critique of the then Industry Commission's reliance on the ORANI model for economic predictions. He points out: In the Industry Commission's own description, ORANI is a static equilibrium model in which taste, technology and initial income distribution are all taken as given. The economy it describes contains no financial sector but enjoys full ment and perfect competition. As a general rule, any resources, including people freed up by process of structural reform, are always put more productive use but never left unemployed. This quite clearly makes the point about the limitations of the ORANI model. The way which it is used by the Productivity Commisand sion can often lead to incorrect outcomes misguided predictions. What sort of economic model is it that excludes taste, technology and income distribution? What sort of economic model is it that excludes change and dynamic analysis? What sort of model is it that sumes that cause and effect is one way inrespects, stead of two way in a dynamic economy? The ORANI model also excludes the ness, possibility of increasing returns to scale; it takes no account of externalities in the omy; it assumes that labour and all factors production are fully mobile, something that could not possibly be true; and it assumes sibility. perfect competition and perfect knowledge. None of us, not even legislators, lay claim perfect knowledge in such a dynamic and notion complex set of economic circumstances. Toohey's book is a very good guide to limits of the ORANI model and the means by which anyone looking at the work of the Productivity Commission should take its forecast with a grain of salt. The other problem with this narrow strand amoral. of advice adopted by the federal government is the past performance of the Productivity Commission. In some areas, they have done some good work. I am an advocate, along with the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur), of some of their work on trade and free investment, but in other areas I quite sceptical about their assumptions. It seems to me that the Productivity mission is always assuming that private imparts markets are good, no matter their ownership, no matter the concentration of the industry. always seems to assume that government regulation is bad, even when regulation is sion. needed to break up monopoly and oligopoly capital. I refer the House to the Industry Commission work on the petrol industry and their failure to recommend the need for vertical employseparation, the need to break up the vertical integration of that industry. It is a case where the we need extra government regulation to break to a up the concentrated ownership and control of the petrol industry. In some of their work, they have fallen for the fundamentalist asin sumption that all private markets are good all government regulation is bad. We and need, in most instances, an effective mix of both to get the correct economic outcome. I point to another problem with the Productivity Commission and the federal coalition. The federal coalition is always railing against asso-called political correctness. But in all and particularly in this legislation, it is embracing the creed of economic correctthe creed of rational economic man. The problem with this particular assumption is that econrational economic man is amoral because he of or she can make no assessment of social good, social bad or the need for social responIt is very interesting to contrast the way into which the government is trying to apply a of social responsibility to this work for the dole scheme and the way in which, when the it comes to the economy and the role of corporations, it imparts very little social responsibility on Australia's large corporations. This is a product of an assumption of rational economic man, who by definition is I believe that there are irrational economic players in all parts of the economy. If we are to have social responsibilities in parts of the Commonwealth and its legislation, those responsibilities should apply as much to Australians on unemployment benefits as to am Australians making decisions in the boardrooms of our large corporations. I believe Comstrongly in stakeholder capitalism, which a set of social responsibilities on our large corporations. Those responsibilities and It the recommendations to that effect would be outside the work of the Productivity CommisThe other problem with the assumption about rational economic man is that it underpublic rates the potential of cooperation as a producearlier, tive force in our economy. It may well and this is where I think Putnam's and Fukuyama's work is very useful-that tition is the best way to induce economic efficiency at the point of transaction exchange. But social and economic cooperemployment ation are also needed to lift productivity efficiency in the production of economic and social goods. They are important considerCommission ations that have been left out of the Producspending. tivity Commission modelling. They fall for some fundamentalist assumptions, they fail examine the importance of social cooperation and cultural influences, and they also tend to sell short the spatial features of economic activity, particularly in the labour market and also regional development. In a large country like ours all the factors of production are not fully mobile. Some regions have particular problems that can only be addressed by the public sector. There is no seamless flow of economic resources and adjustment across Australia. When you get down to a spatial level-some of the depressed regions around the nation-only the public sector can achieve the result. The Productivity Commission and the Treasurer, Mr Costello, subscribe to the trickle-down theory in economics: that there is a trickle down from each of the decisions of national policy. Well, for some parts Australia there is no trickle down from private sector; there is only the need for public sector to playa countervailing role to boost investment, to boost spending power and to boost employment opportunities. Yet all those considerations are outside the of the Productivity Commission's also assumes, moreover-like so many coalition members themselves-that the labour market is seamless, that all labour is fully mobile and adaptable in our open economy, that somehow the labour market is like the market for dead fish: purely an exercise supply-demand and pricing outcomes. Of course, the labour market is nowhere near fully mobile and flexible. It has rigidities. It has locational problems. It has the human dimension that also requires active sector intervention. As I mentioned it may well be that, in terms of ecobenomic production, cooperation works better than active competition. Therefore, one would compeassume that enterprise-collectivebargaining arrangements in the workplace are and much more preferable to individualised contracts, which are contracts and that set worker against worker, Australian against Australian. Further, the Productivity model undervalues infrastructure It does not subscribe to the new growth theories, which state that innovation to and technological progress are endogenous to economic modelling and outcomes. These are all substantial omissions and deficiencies in the work of the Productivity Commission that expose the folly of this government narrowing so many of its sources of economic advice to the one stream of neoclassical economics. There is a need for several streams of advice coming through to the Treasurer and the federal cabinet that go to a proper understanding of economic activity in an open economy. Let me conclude my remarks by expressing my absolute disgust and disappointment that the Treasurer has, before this legislation was even introduced to the parliament, already acted on an administrative basis to amalgamate the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and EPAC. The Howard of government made no more solemn promise to the the Australian people than that it would the respect the supremacy of the parliament over the executi ve. Yet, during 1996, before this parliament had any opportunity to consider this legislation, the Treasurer had already scope acted to amalgamate the Industry Commismodel. It sion, the BIE and EPAC. This is not a merger. This is not an amalgamation in the proper sense. It is, in fact, an asset-stripping takeover, with very few of the BIE and EPAC staff having made the transiin tion to the new Productivity Commission. What opportunity is there for the parliament t6 give proper consideration to this legislation when its administrative impact has already been carried out, when the Productivity Commission is already in place? It is producing reports under the badge 'Productivity Commission'. The staff of the former BIE and EPAC have been paid out through redundancy payments. The takeover is complete. This is one of the most shameful instances of disrespect for the Commonwealth parliament that we will ever find. I know government members, from time to time, raise instances about the former government. I cannot remember an instance of the Labor government, in 13 years, carrying out administration before the parliament had a chance to consider the legislation. I could not imagine that Labor, in office, could possibly have treated the parliament with so much disrespect. It is a shameful thing that the Treasurer has acted without any regard to the election promise, and without any regard to the position and supremacy of this parliament over the executive. He is a law unto himself: before we could even look at this bill he had taken the administrative action. I would be very worried if I were a government backbencher sitting opposite because a Treasurer who has no regard for the parliament has no regard for his own colleagues, has no regard for his own backbench and has no regard for the will of the parliament and the way in which this parliament might want to consider the Productivity Commission Bill. It is indeed a shameful thing in breach of an election promise-in breach of any decent principle. Those opposite might smirk about it, but the day will come when they will rue the way in which the federal Treasurer has been allowed to treat this parliament with such contempt. I asked him a question on the Notice Paper about it, whether or not his action in amalgamating these three bodies without the consent of the parliament was in breach of the coalition's election promises. All he could say was that the government's action in this area is entirely consistent with all relevant pre-election commitments. He must be working on the basis that this particular commitment was non-core. It is one of those commitments that the Prime Minister just forgets about. It is one of those commitments the Prime Minister is willing to lose in the fine print coalition election promises. This is not a good bill for all of the reasons I have outlined to the House.

125,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"I am pleased to join the debate on the development of the new Productivity Commission, as outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet), Mr Miles, in his second reading speech. This legislation-the Productivity Commission Bill and the Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill-will enable the government to combine the Industry Commission with the Economic Planning Advisory Council and the Bureau of Industry Economics. Primarily, the Productivity Commission Bill 1996 is good policy, as it brings under one roof the issue of productivity in Australia and gives help to the public and private sectors in the services they provide. We have a paradox in Australia in the way that we address the issue of productivity. The paradox is the whole notion of productivity. The normal definition of productivity is more work for less cost. The paradox is that the more productive we become, the less is our need for certain types of work. In other words, we reduce work by increasing productivity. Let me explain that further. Over the last decade or so, we have seen an emphasis placed on the need to increase productivity. We have had the notion that pay will not increase unless productivity increases. We have been told that unless we become more productive in Australia, we will not be competitive in our region. Yet we are faced with a harrowing notion. Should we become more productive whilst ignoring the humanitarian issues associated with the need for work? They are issues that have led us to see industry being sent offshore, employment price itself to the exclusion of others within our community and everything associated with our society become based on the bottom line, which promotes the disenfranchisement of individuals over the concept of community. The push for increased productivity has seen an increase in part-time work, which in tum has had a negative effect on individual of security and must, by implication, have an impact on the spending patterns of the part-time worker. For instance, during the last election campaign I met a constituent of mine who was 27 years of age. He had never worked full time; he had only worked casually and part time. His problem, as he explained it to me, was that he was ineligible for a bank loan and home mortgage because he had no permanent job and was only considered a part-time or casual worker. Where is the security for this gentleman to invest in his own future by buying assets? Ultimately, the environment that we are promoting will have an impact upon our economy. The push for productivity has seen an increase in working hours and the need for both parents to spend more time in work rather than care for their families. I used to train managers. The average manager would work 50 to 60 hours a week and take work home on weekends. If they had annual leave, it would be for only two weeks at a time. Where would they go on holidays? They would normally go to Club Med. While they were workaholics in their working environment, they would be playaholics and, therefore, get the most benefit from a playaholic environment. The push for productivity has also seen a dramatic increase in unemployment. We have heard from both sides of the House how this is a very serious issue in Australia, particularwith ly for our youth. In my view, those who have pushed the bottom line in increasing productivity over the last decade are themselves responsible for creating a very serious problem with this rejection of our young from an employment future. The push for productivity has at its base the need for improvement, yet it has sadly forgotten the need to contribute towards a community that provides for its own members. The push for productivity has seen a reduction in work. To give a further example, let me speak of my experience in managing a manufacturing company. We employed 47odd staff members. Some of them were unskilled workers. We continued to employ them to push brooms and get lunches and do minor jobs that skilled workers were not able to do. No longer are these jobs available. These people are now unemployed. If they do not have a job, they are now long-term unemployed. I managed a sales team. In one instance, there was a salesman who was not making a lot of sales. However, he contributed strongly to the whole sales environment and the esprit de corps. This person was not able to continue with employment because of the dollar factor. The company was looking for increases in productivity in relation to his cost. He is now no longer working in the sales environment. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) mentioned the importance of providing a community based around organisations, whereby organisations would be allowed to really take part in the social aspects of our community. But the debate in the last few years has always been about dollars and representing people in dollar terms. In my view, the whole concept of productivity has been misunderstood over the last decade. It has focused on the bottom line, which is the ultimate maximisation of profits. This theory ignores the important role that community organisations play. In that context, I refer to companies and other organisations. It has placed an unhealthy emphasis on work and not on the human aspects of productivity. As the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) so eloquently said in his speech, unemployment regard to health is a major issue that we should be addressing. Our service industries form the fastest growing sector of the economy. They are probably the biggest employers. As any service industry provider would know, productivity is not necessarily based on doing more for less. Primarily, success in productivity is human resource based and focused on training and rewards for effort. By implication, productivity cannot be industry based or be under the influence of outdated organisations, such as the ACTU, which seems to be stuck on industrial age thinking. By implication, it requires an immediate increase in human relations management within Australia and an urgent need to address personnel concerns in a lot of companies. Rather than cut staff, as has been the trend over the last 10 or so years, perhaps managers should be looking for improved procedures, systems and an increase in market awareness. Productivity, therefore, should based but based on best practice solutions and a greater investment in staff at all levels. Rather than see managers given the task of reducing costs whilst increasing productivity, my personal view is that they give consideration to allowing their work force to provide solutions to problems before they are cut from the team, leaving only the managers. It is quite surprising that the last people leave a lot of organisations in Australia the managers. They generally cut lower level staff, the ones who make a greater contribument, tion, first. The major benefit of the Workplace Relations Act is that it allows these issues be discussed openly in an enterprise and without undue influence from outsiders. It getting a partnership, if you like, between the staff of an organisation and its strategy thinkreally ers or managers. It is also my belief that we have finally become more aware of the need to address the humanitarianism of productivity rather than the economics of production that we have seen over recent years. I believe this bill the first step towards attaining a new process of improving productivity. It is putting people back into production by identifying best practice procedures and passing these on industry. I agree with the Prime Minister (Mr Howemployment ard) who, in 1995, said: Unless we boost productivity as a nation, incomes and living standards will fall further, relative to our major competitors. Improving productivity means obtaining a better return from our resources, our people and our capital. We must find ways of using them all more creative, efficient and wealth producing fashion. We must also find ways of using our capital in a smarter, more intelligent and more modem fashion. The Prime Minister was talking about working smarter and not harder. His commitment is to all Australians participating in the of our nation. This is why we need a Productivity Commission, a commission which will have as its very base a broad charter of public inquiry processes and a research function which will promote policies within government and private enterprise that improve competitiveness and the unique dynamism of not be dollar Australian industry. As we face the challenges of the 21 st century, we as a community must address the changing community which is being introduced to us. Technology and all it suggests is upon us. Those who master its demands will be the ones who progress and offer our country the future it so demands. It has been said that more technology will be released to to us in the next 10 years than there has been are introduced over the last 90 years. Consider the last 10 years of technological advanceand extend it to 90 years ago when the model T Ford and telephones were invented. to Imagine all the technology introduced in the last 90 years and consider that there will be is as much technology released to us in the next 10 years as there has been over the last 90. It requires a lot of new thinking about the way we operate in Australia. I have visited many companies within my electorate which are stuck in the revolution of information rather than becoming a part of the evolution of this information age. These is companies are struggling with the demands of government compliance, struggling with staff issues, struggling with market demands and struggling with the need to progress and to remain competitive. These companies are contributing to the block in respect of the issue at the moment. If they did not have these blocks, they would hopefully our be able to employ and therefore reduce the unemployment difficulties we are currently experiencing. They have yet to embrace the future and are in a trying to hang on to the way we used to do things. Not only are companies and small businesses facing this but so are a lot of our institutions, which, as I said before, includes the ACTU. They need help. The Productivity Commission will be able to address the needs of these companies by initiating a flow of wealth information and education which will help them to participate in the new work and business environment, thus promoting their development and therefore their ability to employ. The Productivity Commission will go a long way to addressing the flow of information to these companies the country relies on. Another view of productivity comes from a leading professor, Professor Krugman, who said: Productivity isn't everything, but in the long is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of over time depends almost entirely on its ability raise its output per worker. He did not suggest reducing workers but increasing the output per worker. World War II veterans came home to an economy that doubled its productivity over the next As a result, they found themselves achieving standards their parents had never imagined. Vietnam veterans came home to an economy that raised its productivity less than 10 per cent in years; as a result, they found themselves achieving living no better-and in many cases worse-than their parents. As I have said before, what we did over the last few years to improve productivity was to decrease the work force whilst increasing working hours. At the same time, there was an increased acceptance of the underemployed or unemployed. We thought it was the way to the promised land of maximum profits. We neglected research, we neglected education and we neglected the incentive of developIt ment. The Labor Party speaks so often of their social programs and how good they are, but they are yet to realise that the best, most productive social program in Australia income through employment. Yet the previous government promoted the destruction of employment by turning industrial relations into a very important part of productivity. They used it as an economic issue rather than as a humanitarian issue, and they turned employees into bottom-line dollars. A growing awareness of asset management in Australian business is evolving. Those companies which realise that their assets leave for home every day at 5 o'clock-in most the market place. cases it is after five-are the ones who will eventually prosper. This realisation is gaining momentum. However, best practice is needed and it is hoped that the Productivity Commisliving sion will be able to supplement this need for education and personnel issues. It is the people, not the machines, who make a differimportant ence to an organisation. There has been much talk in recent times of the importance of the Asian region to our country. In an acknowledgment of the importrun it ance of this region, the commission will publish systematic, transparent and ongoing living comparisons with our competitors in the Asiato Pacific region, in respect of their attractiveness in business. The commission will provide even more information on achieving productivity objectives. As stated by the Parliamentary Secre25 years. tary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr living Miles) in the second reading speech, the commission's specific functions will be to hold inquiries and report on matters relating 15 to productivity and industry; provide secretariat services and research services to government bodies; and, from 1 July this year, receive and investigate complaints about the implementation of a competitive neutrality agreement in relation to Commonwealth government businesses and business activities and report to the minister on its investigations. It will provide advice to the minister about matters relating to industry and productivity. will also undertake, on its own initiative, research on matters relating to industry and productivity. It will also promote public understanding and matters relating to industry and productivity. Nowhere in this outline, in is response to the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), does it suggest ignoring the issue of human relations, IR and personnel. I would think that the Productivity Commission will be addressing those issues. By allowing the commission to extend its powers to examine labour market practices-it will also do that-which at times impede on productivity, our nation's core industries will be therefore liberated. So they will have freedom to function, as they should have, in Labour-not Labor as in the ALP-is a key input in the economy and its productivity growth is vital to sustaining increases in standards. Liberating our labour market programs remains the greatest single economic and attitudinal change to be achieved if the goals of a more productive and competitive Australia are to be realised. This is not only at an industrial relations shopfront floor level but also at the boardroom level. We have to start to realise that IR is not an economic issue. It is a humanitarian issue and it is also a productivity issue. If we started rethinking these issues, we may be able to solve the problem of unemployment. I agree with the comments that have been made about the Productivity Commission, with one note of caution. If we do not address productivity issues as they apply to human relations, then we may never ever solve the destruction and the high rates of unemployment which we continue to have in our community. The Industry Commission can also look at state run authorities. The Industry Commission has had a very good relationship with state run authorities as it can affect national industries and how efficiently they operate. It will be able to look at that to improve the way states manage their portfolios. In relation to competitive neutrality, the Treasurer has said: The operation of competitive neutrality will assist government decision making when the government has a choice between public and private sector providers. Competitive neutrality will also improve economic efficiencies and the allocation of resources. The Treasurer has also said there is still a role for government business activities. However, where government competes with private businesses, they need to compete on their own merits and not through unfair advantages provided by government ownership. There is no doubt the Australian electorate broke the stranglehold on Australian productivity issues the Labor Party had held over it for 13 years when they so dramatically voted Labor out of office last year. The Australian public grew tired of the negativity constantly generated by the ALP in relation to work matters. They grew tired of the manipulation of Treasury figures. They grew tired of the replacement of people with figures. We heard figures so often in this chamber and in press conferences but we never really got down to the humanitarian issues of what was really meant behind those figures. The Australian people grew tired of the policy which favoured the few in the IR club, namely, the union movement. They grew tired of being taken for granted and they grew tired of the lack of action on unemployment issues. There was more about rhetoric than reality in so many of the things that we experienced over the last 13 years. The Australian people gave a mandate to the Howard coalition, a mandate to provide leadership into the 21 st century, a mandate to put the issues of people back into the national debate, to free up the destructive policy of Labor and provide opportunities for businesses to employ. The Australian public want to be included in the development of their community, and they know they can only do that whilst a coalition government is leading them because they have experienced the way the Labor Party manages its operations over the last 13 years and they do not want that. They do not want that at a state level; they do not want that federally. They have chosen the coalition to lead them into the 21st century because they know the coalition has the answers on these issues. The Productivity Commission is a step in the right direction. It will provide the impetus to face the challenges of the future. It will play a key role in promoting productivity policies, helping industries and companies compete effectively. It will serve the needs of the parliament, the government and the community. It is but a continuing step towards a more productive Australia, which our government is committed to, and it is a tiny step for the betterment of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.",59
126,Mr MCCLELLAND,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Barton) (5.49 p.m.)At the outset of this debate on the Productivity Commission bills I must say that there are a number of points on which I quite strongly agree with the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans). As a point of initial correction, however, the government has not been elected to take this nation into the 21 st century. They have been elected no longer than up until 2 March 1999. If they want to take this nation into the 21st century, the government needs to get runs on the board. All we see to date is a harking back-throwing back hand grenades, if you like-and a looking back at the past. If they are going to be re-elected, they have to start getting runs on the board. They have to start setting goals and aims and deciding how they are going to get there. That has not been done to date and the time is going to very quickly come when the Australian public are going to get fed up with hearing, 'Well, we have only had 11 months.' In another 12 months time, it wi II be, 'We have only had 23 months.' When is this government going to think that it has had sufficient time to make an impact and start getting runs on the board? They have not had runs on the board and, if they want to get past that year 2000, they had better start getting them. But that is a matter for those on the other side of the House. I agree with the member for Cowan that companies looking at productivity improvements have certainly gone overboard in cost cutting for cost cutting's sake and slashing the work force. I agree that it is more than likely that greater productivity will be obtained, as the member for Cowan said, by focusing on adopting best practice rather than culling the work force because when the market does pick up, if companies have adopted best work practice, they will have already geared up to meet those demands. I also agree that it is invariably the case that the last people to leave a company as a result of economic decline are the managers; the workers will have long since been discarded. That is not universally the case, however, and my criticisms of the bill are as a result of the extremely narrow focus that the Industry Commission has had and the track record the Productivity Commission has had since about the middle of last year in focusing on productivity from the perspective of the output of an individual unit of labour. It may be a little simplistic to say that that is their total focus, hut it is certainly their primary focus. I have a friend, whom I went to school with, who is in a senior management role with Johnson and Johnson-he would not mind my mentioning his circumstances. The situation was that Johnson and Johnson, at this particular plant, faced a lot of industrial problems and they knew they were not getting the productivity that could be obtained in other comparable plants around the world. He put a proposal to the senior management for substantial retrenchments, but the proposals he put were not that the workers be retrenched but that the middle management be retrenched. Senior management took that gamble and it worked. They formed work teams and, indeed, he said his tactic was to get the more vocal and active workers and give them the importance of being in charge of these teams. The focus of their energy, he said, was quite dramatic. He then became regarded as a bit of a whiz-kid in Johnson and Johnson and has been sent over to open up a plant in China. My point in saying this is that productivity is not just a focus on individual, per unit output of labour; it is the totality of management practice and system of work. I know in the United States, for instance, there has been a great deal of work done on improving the productivity of the American work force by empowering them. Concepts of 'industrial democracy', and so forth, are terms used. Essentially, whatever term is used, it comes down to a situation of giving workers a piece of the action, an opportunity to share in the profits and the productivity of the business. A number of instances indicate that it can be very effective. The Scandinavian countries have been known for a long time to have adopted those sorts of principles with frequently very great success. I would like Australia to start heading down those exploratory routes, looking at whether we can achieve greater productivity of an enterprise, not just a labour force, by looking at these sorts of things-introducing work teams, empowering the work force and, indeed, giving the workers a share of the action, a share of the profits. The history of the Industry Commission is that they have not been creative. They, unfortunately, have very much operated from the Treasury bottom line. Others have called it the Ernst and Young-to publicise a well known accounting firm-approach to industry policy and, indeed, government. That is too short-sighted. Our criticism of this whole bill is that the government has cut itself off from different sources of advice, particularly advice from the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning Advisory Council. If there is any doubt that those bodies have not been amalgamated but rather totally absorbed, it is shown by the fact that those two bodies have now been forced to move to Melbourne, which is the site of the Industry Commission. The Industry Commission, as I understand, had about 200 employees at the middle of last year, the BIE about 90 and EPAC about 20, but because of the government's decision not to increase overall staff levels within this amalgamated body, who do you think took the majority of redundancies? They were, of course, the people based in Canberra, rather than going to Melbourne. So very much it is the case that the staff of this Productivity Commission is the staff of the Industry Commission, and the philosophies of the Industry Commission are no doubt going to prevail. It is this limited focus, this classic Treasury line focus, that we are very concerned by. Ross Gittins, in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday, 29 July, said: Wherever an inexperienced Treasurer goes, it's fair bet that his department's leading him. Unfortunately, this Treasurer (Mr Costello), despite colourful performances on his feet, is still a very inexperienced Treasurer. He has been led by his department. They have offered him, as Rudyard Kipling said, 'The world and all that is in it, my son.' He has taken that offer and given the Industry Commission everything they want. They are going to be the most fundamentally important advisory body to this government. That is going to give the Treasurer more clout within cabinet because there will not be a competing source of advice for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet or for other ministers. Indeed, regrettably, there is a substantial risk, as I will come to, of the Productivity Commission being used as an arm of propaganda rather than an arm of objective advice. Just before I move onto that point, I must agree with one other point of the member for Cowan: it is certainly the case that while a number of substantial companies have the resources to engage graduates and research specialists and to obtain knowledge of markets and potential opportunities overseas, it often the case that the small business, small manufacturing sectors do not have those resources. It is a very important if not essential role for government to educate these smaller businesses, in particular smaller manufacturers, of what is going on. I must say that I have been terribly impressed by research undertaken by the St George Skillshare-in particular, by Sharon Dwyer and Helena Pollard, who have conducted their own survey of lighter manufacturing-which is in my electorate of Barton. They have found a dramatic disparity in the knowledge and goals of more substantial manufacturers compared with smaller and often what have traditionally been family businesses. They have commented on the extent of the lack of knowledge that they have found of marketing opportunities, different management techniques and different work practice techniques that exist in these smaller businesses. With the benefit of that knowledge, those a small businesses have the potential to dramatically increase their output, dramatically increase our net exports and, very importantly at this particular point of our history in Australia, to employ workers. That is an area where I think we should be pulling out all stops. We should not focus on this obsession we have of looking at individual output per unit of labour; we should be looking at the output of enterprises, including these smaller manufacturing centres, and looking at what they need by way of infrastructure, what they need by way of advice in terms of marketing and what they need by way of advice in terms of capital, technology, transport and so on. While the role of EPAC was to undertake research into a lot of those overall productivity and management style issues, and while the role of the BIE was to conduct their own research into benchmarking our infrastructure, capital practices and resources against those of our competitors, regrettably, with the demise of those two bodies, I fear that it is going to be the case that that sort of advice will not be coming through to this cabinet. It is not going to get that broad spectrum of views that is going to be necessary to inis crease, in particular, manufacturing in AustralIa. It is really quite alarming at this point in our history that, while we have a specialist advisory bureau covering mining and agriculture-and that is ABARE-we do not have a specialist body focusing on industry assistance. Rather, the role of the Productivity Commission will be to focus upon reducing and removing industry assistance because it will give, by definition, the particular industry or enterprise which is being assisted some competitive advantage over either another Australian company or, indeed, one of our overseas competitor countries. It is extremely short-sighted. Quite frankly, the other members of cabinet should not have let the Treasurer get away with it because they are going to pay the price. They are going to pay the price because this short-term, isolated, singleview focus of the economic world, and indeed the world at large, is going to prevent them getting runs on the board. Industry is not going to be assisted; indeed, it is going to be retarded. The error of the focus of the government, as the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has said, is that they have a presumption that getting the broader macro-economics in order and allowing the free market forces, to use that rhetoric, to prevail necessarily creates productivity. That presumption is, unfortunately, a fallacy. Not even the Treasurer will say that we are on an even playing field in the international climate. The most well-known example as a result of the Productivity Commission's preliminary report is the car industry. We have, under a regime of protection, albeit declining, with the mutual consent and programming of government and the car industry, significantly increased productivity and significantly increased quality. It is not as if the car industry has been sitting on its laurels using tariff barriers to take the cream off the cake, as it were. The industry has got its collective nose to the grindstone and is producing a first-class product with a first-class output and labour force. The enemy and the threat to the car industry, as is so common to many industries, is not from internal labour efficiencies or inefficiencies. Indeed, the cost of labour in the car industry is only about a six per cent cost impost. It is the external factors which are the enemy to the success of our car industry. For instance, we are competing with Indonesia, which has 125 per cent import duty plus a 10 per cent value added tax; Malaysia, which has a 200 per cent import duty plus a 10 per cent sales tax; and Thailand, which has a 68.5 per cent import duty plus a seven per cent value added tax. It is just impossible-indeed, it is unfair, unrealistic and really foolhardy in the extreme-to expect the car industry to compete with that sort of market restriction if we cut their tariff rate overnight to five per cent. We will, without question-it is inevitable-wipe out the industry if we do that, and we will wipe out the access that we get through international input into our own production, our technology and robotics and, indeed, should it ever be needed, significant resources for future defence capabilities. The car industry is a good example because of the flow-on effect it has-not only within regions, South Australia obviously being a big region in itself--on other producers. I sat at a lunch the other day beside a local businessman who produced bolts. He said he was deeply worried about the threat to the car industry because his business, which produces special order bolts-I do not understand the technology-would go under if there was a significant decline in the Australian car industry. That is just an example of how broadly industries flow on. I will not focus on the bill in greater detail. It has been very well addressed by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), and also the member for Werriwa. I will indicate, if I may, an expression of some concern, and that is that there appears to be a resurrection of sexist language in the legislation. Whether Treasury is the source or whether that is the result of a general edict by the government, I do not know. For instance, the term 'chairperson', as existed with the original Industry Commission legislation, has been replaced by 'chairman', despite the fact that males or females can hold office. If this government has given that direction, for reasons of opposition to political correctness, it should come clean and say so. lt is quite wrong to simply put a bill before parliament with such a dramatic change in drafting policy without notifying parliament of its intentions in that respect.",63
127,Dr SOUTHCOTT,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Boothby) (6.09 p.m.)To hear the member for Barton (Mr Boothby MCClelland) talk about the Treasury line, you would think we had gone back in the time tunnel. As he was borrowing the words Jack Lang, I half expected him to start talking about Sir Otto Niemeyer and weighing in against him, and Scullin and bank of loans. In speaking in favour of both these bills which establish the Productivity CommisAustralia, sion-Productivity Commission Bill 1996 and Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transiall tional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996-1 immediately reflect on the long history of the Industry Commission. The Productivity Commission, which will come within the Treasury portfolio, is being formed through a merger of the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning Advisory Council. Before 1990, the Industry Commission was known as the Industries Assistance Commisinefficient sion, and before 1973 it was the Tariff Board. It would be fair to say that the policy ethos that prevails in today's Productivity Commisin sion bears little resemblance to the intellectual framework that governed the prescriptions of the Tariff Board-a tariff board which gave Australia by 1970 the second highest manual facturing tariffs in the world, second only to have. New Zealand. As stated by Paul Kelly in his book The End of Certainty: When MCEwen retired in 1971, his apparently immovable protectionist structure was under threat from an apparently irresistible anti-protectionist tide, furious at the longevity of its denial. during the 1970s and 1980s that the structure to successful assaults. One of the Productivity Commission's first reports, to be released in May of this year, will be on assistance to the Australian mobile industry from January 2000. Released APEC. on 20 December last year, the commission's draft report recommends the reduction of automotive tariffs to five per cent by 2004. With Mitsubishi Motors Australia's main assembly plant in the industrial heart of the electorate of Boothby, any decision made by the government in response to the Productivity Commission's report will be of critical importance not only to the electorate of but to the South Australian economy as a whole. For instance, at the end of 1996, Mitsubishi Motors Australia employed 5,188 of people, and of that number 1,605 people resided in the electorate of Boothby; that is, one in 50 of the constituents of Boothby work repudiation for one company-Mitsubishi. In addition, scattered around Mitsubishi are a network of component of suppliers, which include Precise Plastic Tooling, Bridgestone Henderson's Automotive and Monroe Australia. These four companies are major suppliers to Mitsubishi and major employers in their own right in the southwestern suburbs of Adelaide. Beyond the electorate of Boothby, the multiplier effect keeps on radiating. For instance, Mitsubishi constitutes one of South Australia's largest advertising accounts and is worth around $45 million per annum to the South Australian advertising industry. I recognise that a tariff is one of the most forms of industrial assistance that you can have. Apart from protecting infant industries, there are few sustainable arguments favour of tariffs. But if we are to reduce tariffs in accordance with the recommendations of the draft majority report, it is only fair that we consider and analyse what regionimpact such an accelerated reduction will May 1 state quite clearly that I am not advocating the freezing of tariffs. May I also state quite clearly 1 believe we should aim for a goal of a five per cent tariff by 201O--our It was commitment under APEC. That is to say, the fell South Australian government's call for tariffs to remain at 15 per cent right up to 2010 or calls to freeze tariffs until 2007 and review it then represent unrealistic rent seeking which autotakes no account of our obligation under I am confident that free trade within APEC will benefit Australia. I am confident that Australia will gain from trade liberalisation within the APEC countries. I believe we should work towards free trade in developed countries by 2010 and in developing countries by 2020. There can be no doubt that, historically, tariffs in this country have supported and nurtured a rigid labour market, inefficient industry and consequent higher domestic prices. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that, we approach the centenary of Federation, we are still grappling with the tariff question-a question that was framed in Deakin's 'new protection' compact, addressed in the deliberations of the 1929 Brigden committee, critiqued by the likes of Edward Shann and W.K. Hancock in 1930 and then seemingly resolved under the leadership of John 'Black Jack' MCEwen and the pre-eminence of the Tariff Board. As I stated before, to South Australians who work in the automotive industry the answers to the question are tremendously important. The tariff question affects South Australia disproportionately because of the economy's reliance on automotive manufacturing. My chief concern is that continuing to reduce tariffs at 2.5 per cent from 2000 until 2004 will see us achieving our obligations under APEC six years early but may see one or more automotive manufacturers close their Australian operations. It may cause too much dislocation due to a rapid adjustment. Why may this occur? As the majority of the commission outlined in its report when examining the option-an option they actually rejected-of reducing tariffs from 15 per cent to five per cent in a one-year period, they said: ... this option would impose a fast rate of adjustment on the industry, which may cause economic dislocation that could otherwise be avoided. It is important to note, however, that even without the closure of a plant, even without the shock and dislocation that that would cause, as tariffs fall to achieve the national gain, to achieve the marginal increase in national output, South Australia's economy will contract and employment will fall. This is demonstrated in the Econtech model commissioned by the South Australian Development Council-a model which clearly demonstrates that South Australia pays a high price for what is at best a marginal national gain. Headed by Dr Richard Blandy, the South Australian Development Council commissioned from Econtech a South Australian model, SAM, which could be used with the national model-Murphy model 2, MM2-so as to explore the effects of changes as in industry policy. The impact of changes in assistance on South Australia's terms of interstate trade in manufacturing was considered by this SAM model. It found that a decline in terms of interstate trade for South Australia will lead to lower output and employment in the automotive industry-but also in the wider South Australian economy. Using both the Monash model and the MM2 model, the Productivity Commission has estimated that reducing tariffs from 25 per cent to 15 per cent will deliver a 0.1 per cent gain in national GOP. That increase accrues slowly. But the increase in employment and real private consumption, as predicted in the model, is zero. Decreasing from 15 per cent to five per cent delivers a further 0.1 per cent in GOP. However, the SAM model showed that decreasing tariffs from 25 per cent to 15 per cent will decrease South Australia's gross state product by 1.15 per cent, and a decrease in tariff from 15 per cent to five per cent will decrease the gross state product by a further 1.19 per cent-making a total decrease in output of 2.34 per cent. Of further concern are the projections that South Australian real private consumption will decrease by 3.17 per cent as tariffs go from 25 per cent to five per cent. At the same time, South Australian employment will decrease by 1.32 per cent during the period 1996 to 2000 and by a further 1.39 per cent as tariffs fall to five per cent-making a total decrease in employment of 2.71 per cent. This is projected to add 0.5 per cent to the unemployment rate in South Australia-a rate which is projected to take a decade to dissipate. The model also projects a decrease of 2.5 per cent in the South Australian population of those who are of working age, due to emigration to other states. The other projections include, looking at other sectors: in terms of output, the manufacturing sector to decrease by 4.41 per cent; electricity, gas and water to decrease by 3.17 per cent; recreation and personal services to decrease by 3.07 per cent; and even the primary sector in South Australia to decrease by 1.18 per cent. In terms of employment, manufacturing is hardest hit, decreasing by 5.18 per cent; electricity, gas and water is to decrease by four per cent; and transport and communications is to decrease by 1Y2 per cent. What this shows is that nationally we gain a 0.1 per cent of GDP while the South Australian economy will contract by two to three per cent-a contraction which will be felt in every sector of the South Australian economy. it is important to acknowledge that it will be South Australia that will pay the price for that marginal gain. And the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has acknowledged the regional impact of tariff reductions-the impact on South Australia and, to a lesser extent, on Victoria. He is well aware of the price South Australia will pay. On page 226 of the draft report, the Productivity Commission examined the prospect of reducing tariffs by one per cent a year from 2000 to 2010 but felt that the resultant costs would be felt by the community for a greater number of years. However, as the South Australian Development Council's submission pointed out, 97 per cent of these costs, economic welfare costs, will have been eliminated by the time tariffs reach 15 per cent in the year 2000. So it is my submission that that option should have been considered more carefully by the commission. While a freeze from 2000 to 2004 is not unreasonable-that is the Webber or minority view of the Productivity Commission-it may remove incentives to continue the enormous productivity improvements the industry has made and would require a faster pace of tariff reduction from 2004 to 2010. And those improvements in productivity are real: car and component makers expect to export automotive products worth more than $3 billion annually by the year 2000. Over the last decade, as tariffs have fallen from 45 per cent in 1988 to 22.5 per cent this year, the productivity of the motor vehicle industry has improved accordingly. The Department of Industry, Science and Technology in 1996 reported labour productivity growth between 1990 and 1995 of 44 per cent in the component sector and 37 per cent in vehicle manufacture. The Bureau of Industry Economics has reported that these productivity gains have resulted from investment in labour saving technology, changes in capacity utilisation, reductions in the cost of locally sourced components, pressure from customers and upgrading of work force skills. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 1996 the Australian automotive industry exported a record $2.1 billion in products, with South Australia's share hitting the $1 billion mark for the first time. Before lowering tariffs into the next millennium, Australia still requires further improvements of efficiency in the tax system, the labour market and the energy and transport sectors. It is my view that a one per cent decrease in tariffs from 2000 to 2010 would require a slow but reasonable rate of adjustment and see that we achieve our APEC goal of free trade-that is, a five per cent tariff-by 2010. While this would encourage the automotive industry to continue improving productivity, the government would need to keep faith with the manufacturers by continuing to review labour market reform, taxation reform and microeconomic reform in energy and transport. Specifically, though, the Productivity Commission has highlighted the following as what is required: more co-operative work relationships similar to the Japanese enterprise model-I recognise that many automotive workplaces are already working towards that; the implementation of enterprise-based flexible workplace agreements-the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the subsequent amendments will facilitate this; simplifying the vehicle industry award; continuing to implement national competition policy; microeconomic reform on the waterfront and on rail and roads; increased levels of separation in the provision of electricity and retailing distribution in South Australia; subjecting port authorities to the competition principles agreement; contestability in stevedoring services on the waterfront; and reviewing the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax that was implemented in the ALP's last budget-the 1995 budget-on passenger motor vehicles. After all, if the main argument in favour of a more rapid reduction in tariffs is cheaper it should be remembered that wholesale sales tax contributes more to the price of cars than the tariffs do. The high levels of taxation on passenger motor vehicles do nothing to stimulate our domestic market. That is another thing that is required to keep the Australian automotive industry healthy. As a result, Australia has oldest car park in the OECD and is on a par with countries like Mexico and Turkey. As I said earlier, the productivity improvements in the automotive industry have been outstanding and ABS data shows that the automotive industry leads the manufacturing sector in the use of advanced technology, especially in computer assisted design and robotics. For example, in 1995, 41 per cent of all robots installed in Australian industry were in the automotive industry. I have visited Mitsubishi's assembly line and they are making increasing use of robots along the line to improve competitiveness. The industry now produces cars which are internationally competitive and, in South Australia, not only is Mitsubishi exporting its Magna sedan to all world markets outside Japan but component suppliers are exporting rear-view mirrors to Germany, and to Ford in the United States, and steering wheel columns and car air conditioners to Korea. In South Australia, as I said before, there is a disproportionate reliance on the automotive industry. The automotive industry comprises 10 per cent of the state's total exports and generates 15 per cent of the gross state product. With one-twelfth of Australia's population, South Australia has one-third of the nation's automotive industry. The Productivity Commission's majority report recommends continuing the current pace of tariff reform to reap the marginal national gain as soon as possible. But, as the minority report has argued and others have argued, the productivity gains which have been achieved, going from 45 per cent to 25 per cent over the last decade, were relatively easy to realise and further productivity gains may be harder. So I argue that a slower pace of tariff reduction gives the industry a reasonable time to adjust and will make any dislocacars, tion to South Australia's economy more gradual, giving the state time to adjust to those lower tariff rates and seeing that our nation meets its commitments under APEC. It is important that we can be sure that by the year 2010 we will be able to look back and acknowledge that in 1997 we facilitated an environment which allowed the automotive the industry in Australia to flourish and prosper.",67
128,Unknown,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,Sitting suspended from 6.27 to 8 p.m.,70
129,Mr KERR,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"There is a considerable degree of community concern regarding the narrowness of advice that comes to government and the focus that that advice has had for some time centred around what was previously known as the Industry Commission. That concern is not lessened by the way in which this new government is proceeding to deal with it and the two other bodies which the former government had available to it to give it a greater diversity of advice. This government has begun a very strange process of filtering from where it stood prior to the last election. At that time, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was at pains to distinguish himself from his predecessor, saying that he would be a Prime Minister who could be judged on the delivery of the whole of his government's proposed agenda. Post his election we discovered that one was to discern in the pre-election context a distinction between what are now known as core and non-core promises. Subsequent to that, one discerned that there is a subdivision even within those matters. Not only are there distinctions between core and non-core promises, but the Prime Minister will be bound by only the core promises which he uttered. Today it was narrowed down yet again to core promises he uttered which he remembered. This particular piece of legislation survived that narrow funnel of clarification. It was promised before the election, it has been regarded as a core promise, the Prime Minister obviously committed himself to it at some stage and he has recalled that commitment, and so we have it before the House. Why do we have some concern about this? Stripping away all the peripheral issues, such as the recourse that this new government has had from time to time to populist rhetoric and to appeals to some of the more poll driven aspects of its policy formulation, we have concerns about the overwhelming reliance of this government on the free market, its ideological commitment to the level playing field and its unwillingness to have any sources of advice other than those which are predictably committed to a view of the world which the government itself shares. One might say that it is a matter for government to determine how it puts together the range of advice which it seeks to gather, and different governments will have different approaches. If the consequences for poor decision making were only that governments were denied the opportunity of wide ranging advice and those consequences attached only to government, the opposition would have no legitimate basis for concern. But the fact is that a government which denies itself the breadth of economic advice that is necessary for a government to have a full command of the different debates and contentions which are legitimately at issue within the Australian community and internationally is not only doing itself no service but also doing the Australian community no service. It is not true that there is complete uniforthat mity of view about how to deal with some of the more complex issues that this nation faces. The previous speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Boothby (Dr Southcott), a member representing a seat in South Australia, took the House through the different contentions of economic modelling between the South Australian model, which was designed to show the economic effects of proposed additional tariffs cuts in the motor vehicle industry, and that which was used by the majority in the draft report on the motor vehicle industry brought down by the Industry Commission. The difference is not merely academic. If the minority report is correct, then the majority report exaggerated the economic benefits accruing to the nation as a whole and significantly underestimated the economic costs to the regional economy of South Australia and the unemployment consequences that flow from that. There are, even within the larger areas of economic debate, significant areas which the official family of advisers rarely allow to be disputed. Sometimes, of course, there is contrary material which ought to at least come before government in some form so that it can consider whether or not the advice that is tended to it by bodies such as the proposed Productivity Commission needs to be further tested. A very simple example of an area of dispute, which is quite interesting given the weight that the new government places on flexibility in the wages area, is the various studies that have occurred recently in the United States which go to the issue of the employment effect, if any, of increasing minimum wages. The modelling that was conducted and the empirical outcomes that were observed between jurisdictions which changed and increased minimum wages as opposed to those that did not suggest that the anticipated consequence-that there would be an employment detriment following the increase in the minimum wage-did not in fact occur. The abstract theoretical models which have been relied on in so many of the debateswage flexibility will stimulate employment and that increases in minimum wages have a knock-on effect in terms of labour loss opportunities-were shown in practical terms not to hold true. So it is very important that the wide diversity of debate that is occasioned in the international economic circles has its reflection in Australia. So too with the question of protection and tariffs; frequently we in this country are not adequately advised of the range of different policy responses available to decision makers, including those which have been adopted in different environments. There is too frequently a closed circle of advisers which do not enable governments to select and judge as between various contentions. That is not to say, of course, that government ought to be placed in a situation where fanciful ideas are advanced without any weight or credibility and where government ministers are distracted by a plethora of different views, some of which ought to be given little credence. But it is to suggest that there is real reason to concerned when the government collapses down the advisers available to it to a single body, particularly when those responsible are in a sense akin in view, and consistently akin in view, to the department in which those advisers are located from a point of view of ministerial responsibility. You therefore have a single voice reflecting that of Treasury and being then manifested through the Industry Commission and now its successor, the Productivity Commission, which will be established as a result of this legislation. The concern of the opposition, as expressed in the amendment that has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Holt e Mr Gareth Evans), accedes to the fact that the government is in a sense a master of its own destiny as to how it wishes to establish its advisory bodies. We will not decline to give this bill a second reading. The amendment expresses concern, which is appropriate, about the monopolisation of economic advice under the Treasury portfolio with the abolition of the Economic Planning Advisory Committee, which was a separate body responsible for provision of advice through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the abolition of the Bureau of Industry Economics, which was able to provide advice through its minister, the Minister for Industry, Science and TourIsm. What the new arrangements do is to collapse those two other bodies and constitute a single advisory body under the Department of Treasury, responsible to the Treasurer. The government is left in a circumstance where, if it is uncertain about an appropriate response, it has no other source of advice readily available to it. That seems to be a matter of real concern. The opposition has indicated that the collapsing down of sources of advice-the sense of confidence that Australia's interests are adequately represented by a single body whose general predisposition and approach to issues is well established and known-is not an adequate or sufficient basis for policy making. We also recognise that that may give rise to be inappropriate policies in the areas for which advice is tendered. These are not matters of little concern, particularly to a member such as me, coming from a regional part of Australia, where decisions got wrong can have very significant local effects which may not have too much impact in terms of national economic statistics. The share of the gross national product attributable to Tasmania is not such as to mean that a 10 per cent decline in the Tasmanian economy would kick up much impact nationally. But a 10 per cent decline in the Tasmanian economy would have a massive and savage impact on those who live there. So when we find, for example, the new Productivity Commission-the Industry Commission, as it currently is-beginning its work on the textile, clothing and footwear sector, where there is still substantial employment in Tasmania, it is right to fear that the employment impact on regional areas of Australia may not get the attention that it requires. The same concerns that relate to the issues raised by South Australian members regarding the reports into the car industry will be concerning all Tasmanian members. I imagine on both sides of the House-in relation to the current inquiry into the textile, clothing and footwear industry. Again the question has been raised as to whether tariff reductions beyond those which were anticipated previously will be made and whether the pace will be increased. Those are important issues that we need to look at. There can be no retreat from the fact that Australia is an internationally exposed economy. There can be no stepping back to walls of protection that existed in the past. But that said, the narrowness of the official family of advice that currently exists often suggests that there is only one possible policy option in any circumstance, when that is far from correct. Often there are a number of different choices which might be made by a government. When the sources of advice are narrowed to one, it is often difficult to ascertain the full range of decisions which might be properly made by a government seeking to advance Australia's national interests. It is not the case that in economic affairs one answer always stands pre-eminently alone as the correct one. It is a folly to elevate economic prediction to a science which suggests that any decision can be anticipated in terms of how it will be worked through down to the closest decimal point. The reality is that almost all of these areas are not closed systems. Decisions are not able to be taken against a background of variables which are not in play. Variables move and circumstances change, and decisions have to take into account this extremely dynamic and flexible environment. Sometimes a variety of sources of advice exposes the fact that some issues that perhaps were not anticipated by one adviser have been put on the agenda by another, so a possible alternative course of action reveals itself. The difficulty that we are facing now in terms of the way this legislation is structured is that too frequently the likelihood will be that only one course of action appears to be possible. That sclerosis of thinking could lead Australia to display rigidities more akin to the ageing human animal than to the young, vibrant and vigorous nation we ought to be. We all know that, as we age, our capacity for adaption and change becomes slower and temptation towards security of ideas that are known becomes greater. The temptation, I fear, is that this government will continue to pursue courses which have been given official approval by the way in which the Prime Minister regards the world. The Prime Minister once described himself as the most conservative leader this nation has ever had. Certainly, he is identified with a number of economic strategies which are presented to this parliament and to his fellow Australians as if they represent an unambiguously certain course for Australia's economic redemption. Our contention is that they do not. Our contention is that the arrogance of office has fallen too heavily upon the Prime Minister already. The Prime Minister has displayed an inflexibility of mind in relation to how this government responds to a whole series of challenges that have arisen already. That inflexibility in his own mind is not likely to be addressed or benefited from having only one source of advice which is directed to him not through his own department but through Treasury, such that the various ideas which ought be in contest for the future of Australia are given little space in the domain the Prime Minister now occupies. So when he has to consider particular issues-such as which direction we ought to move in with respect to tariffs, the way in which we should deal with the protection of our intellectual industries, copyright issues, issues reflecting creativity and issues reflecting how we deal with tourism, services and new and emerging industries-we will get a policy response which essentially is committed to a singular view of the world, a view which will be reinforced by the fact that no body in the nation has been properly resourced and given the adequate capacity to articulate and develop a credible and coherent alternative world view. We do not want the issues to be contested in a controversial way. We want to make sure that various options are brought before the government and the Australian people so that judgments can be made in the knowledge of the range of considerations properly available for policy making. We are concerned about this narrowing down of advice, and we do believe it is the wrong direction to take. (Time expired)",70
130,Mr MCARTHUR,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"One of the more thoughtful contributions to tonight's debate about the creation of the Productivity Commission came from the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I was in the House to listen to his contribution, and he put forward a well-articulated view questioning the basis and implications of economic rationalism. In response, I wish to provide a defence of the process of economic reform and the ethics of the free market. Michael Novak, in his book The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism, discusses the massive improvements generated by the onset of laissez faire economic policy brought to Britain and the United States in the early 19th century. The backdrop to that development was that in 1795 life expectancy in France was 27.3 years for women and 23.4 years for men, and four-fifths of French families devoted 90 per cent of their incomes to buying bread, quite literally. As Novak states: The invention of the market economy in Great Britain and the United States more profoundly revolutionised the world between 1800 and the present than any other force. After 5 millennia of blundering, human beings finally figured out how wealth may be produced in a sustained, systematic way. In Great Britain, real wages doubled between 1800 and 1850, and doubled again between 1850 and 1900. Since the population of Great Britain quadrupled in size, this represented a 1,600% increase within one century. The gains in liberty of personal choice-in a more varied diet, new beverages, new skills, new vocations-increased accordingly. As Novak states, the rise of the market economy coincided with a rise in liberal democracy, coming out of an era where popular democracies were rare and freedom of speech, of religion and of association was stifled. He states that in most cultures absolute rulers had absolute control in the political, economic, cultural and moral spheres. It was the beginning of market libera'ism which unlocked higher living standards, greater freedom and expanding opportunity. One of the key elements of this shift was a period of rapidly increasing productivity. The first chapter of the Industry Commission's annual report 1995-96 quotes the American economist Paul Klugman. His statements relate to the productivity which I have just been talking about: Productivity isn't everything, but in the long run it is almost everything. A country's ability to improve its standard of living over time depends almost entirely' on its ability to raise its output per World War II veterans came home to an economy that doubled its productivity over the next 25 years; as a result, they found themselves achieving living standards their parents had never imagined. Vietnam veterans came home to an economy that raised its productivity less than 10% in 15 years; as a result, they found themselves living no better-and in many cases worse-than their parents. The key to living standards and greater opportunities in the future will come down to our ability to improve productivity. Part of that task falls to the processes of the marketplace. The activities of entrepreneurs, innovators, discerning consumers, industrious producers and employees are all vital to the improved economic performance of any nation or region. However, policy makers have a role to play in removing the barriers which hinder productivity and enhancements to economic welfare. There is a role for a highly qualified, strongly credentialled advisory body which can provide-independent of political imperatives-rigorous analysis of the cost barriers, regulations and protections accorded to particular sections of the community. This bill will create in the Productivity Commission an advisory body whose role for the first time will be to address the broad issue of productivity in the Australian economy. The Productivity Commission will be charged with the task of giving guidance to the government and the community on the extent and cost of structural impediments to productivity-so critical to Australia's future. In this task, the commission will have the accumulated credibility and expertise of the three bodies which are merged to create it. I notice the opposition are rather critical of the combined expertise of these three bodies-the Industry Commission, EPAC and the Bureau of Industry Economics. The Industry Commission has traditionally been the advisory body on matters relating to assistance, protection and regulation of specific industries. It is famous for its rigorous analysis, backed up by irrefutable evidence of real world industry experience-contrary to some of the comments which have been made in recent days about the tariff rate, which the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) would fully worker. understand. EPAC has been a general economic advisory board, which has recently published papers on issues such as child care, investment and economic growth, future issues for the labour market and, particularly, a good paper on tariff reform and economic growth, which I commend to the member for Corio. The Bureau of Industry Economics is best known for its benchmarking studies, which scrutinised the performance of individual Australian industry sectors against international comparisons. The Productivity Commission will be the primary advisory body on micro-economic reform, something which the previous government put a high priority upon and which ultimately holds the key to unlocking Australia's social and economic potential. To some extent, the Productivity Commission is the next phase in the evolution of the old Tariff Board, which was established in 1921 to examine assistance to domestic industries subject to competition from imports. The former Tariff Board chairman, Alf Rattigan, in his book entitled Industry Assistance-The Inside Story, described the early history of tariff protection in Australia. He said: For the first few years after the Tariff Board was established, the Government got from the Statutory Authority the recommendations it desired. However, by 1927, the Board had become concerned about the abuse of protection a less highly protectionist stance. When it changed its approach the Board found that the Government did not accept most of its recommendations and greatly delayed the release to the public of many of its reports. In 1929, when the economic depression began, the Government introduced very high tariffs-the Scullin tariffs-on a very wide range of goods, without any reference to the Board. It just shows that history is repeating itself. Alf Rattigan was appointed Chairman of the Tariff Board in 1964 by the then minister, Black Jack MCEwen. It was under the chairmanship of Alf Rattigan that the Tariff Board made a fundamental shift of thinking towards assessing the overall economy-wide effects of tariff protection. When Rattigan first took over, he described the situation thus: The Tariff Board was an ad hoc operator; its work was generally initiated by requests from Australian manufacturers for increased duties ... What an amazing thing, as the member for Corio would fully understand. He went on to say: The work of the Board was resulting in a creeping increase in the level of tariff protection. In addition to this increase through the Board's work, new manufacturing activities were receiving high levels of protection without any public inquiry ... Under Alf Rattigan, the Tariff Board started to look more thoroughly at the broader effects of tariff protection-with which, hopefully, this parliament will engage at a future timeparticularly in industries like agriculture and mining which have remained unprotected. All those farmers and miners out there throughout Australia have had nobody advocating their cause. In particular, Black Jack MCEwen, who was supposed to be an advocate of the mining and agricultural industries, was advocating the other point of view. Under the Whitlam government, the Tariff Board was broadened to become the Industries Assistance Commission, designed to look at the issue of industry assistance generally. Beginning in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, the Tariff Board and the lAC began to challenge the orthodoxy of providing unlimited protection to Australian industry. That task was continued by its eventual successor, the and it adopted Industry Commission. The success of the Industry Commission resulted from its ability to gather all the relevant background information, talk to industry players and make policy recommendations on the basis of irrefutable logic and hard, factual evidence. I will repeat that: the success of the Industry Commission has been that they used the evidence and on-the-ground industry information to provide some of their recommendations. That has been rather overlooked in some of the arguments in this place and in the broader community. The reports of the Industry Commission have always been hard to fault because of their theoretical and real world strength. The Productivity Commission has already continued that tradition, making an extremely important contribution to the reform debate through a document which is not as well known as it should be. That document is the Stocktake of progress in microeconomic reform, published by the commission last year. I will quote extensively from this document. That stocktake provides an excellent sectorial analysis of the reforms that have taken place as well as of the work that remains to be done, along with some specific recommendations. Chapter one provides a well-argued justification for the need for reform. Again, there are arguments in this place and in the broader community that reform has gone far enough and that we do not need to pursue further reform because everything is okay in the Australian economy. Fortunately, both major political parties have embraced the need for reform. Even the former Labor government-I commend them in some areas-were prepared to adopt reforms in the industrial relations system which were advocated very strongly by people in opposition like me and others. They broadly accepted the thrust of our recommendations. Unfortunately, while both political parties have embraced the need for reform and accepted the arguments in favour of economic liberalisation, we still see the assault on economic rationalism gaining currency in the broader community and in sections of the media that really do not understand the arguments as well as they might. It is usually based on misconceptions of what economic rationalism is really about. The reforms pursued by the Productivity Commission were about improving living standards and the opportunities for Australians through increased productivity. Both theory and practice tell us overwhelmingly that the forces of competition are the most effective means of achieving this end. The Productivity Commission's Stocktake had this to say about competition: It provides a powerful stimulus for private and public firms to operate efficiently and respond to what consumers want. It encourages firms to search continuously for improvements in the way they operate, and it is therefore vital to the process of productivity improvement over time. Competition is also central to ensuring productivity gains are shared with the wider community through lower prices. What could any Australian want more than that? Typically, assaults on economic rationalism are thinly veiled as special pleadings by those who seek protection rather than competition or a special deal that is not available to other Australians. That is a very pertinent statement. If you look at those people who attack so called economic rationalism, you will find that that is generally the basis of their attack on a very sensible approach to a market economy. On all other occasions, critics of economic rationalism simply wish to indulge in economic fallacies that do not stand up to rigorous scrutiny. They pretend that minimum wages can raise the living standard without costing jobs. They wish to believe that we can protect all industries without paying the price. They pretend that Australia can restrict its competitiveness without losing international investment. They dream that unlimited public funds can be made available to subsidise their particular hobbies, interests or priorities. The critics of economic rationalism are numerous, but they have never come up with a consistent and soundly based alternative to the rigorous economic reasoning used by the Industry Commission.",73
131,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,How much reading have you done?,76
132,Mr MCARTHUR,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"More than you. Unfortunately, the shadow minister at the table does not understand any of this. The bottom line is that, when pressed, many feel that competition and deregulation are good for everyone else but not them. As David Trebeck, a well known commentator, states in the January edition of the Australian Farm Journal, which is read by most farmers around Australia, many people do not believe in the level playing field. They believe in a sloping playing field as long as it slopes their way. It must be recognised that economic reform is not just about blindly following dogma or maximising GDP per capita. There are important social imperatives for improving the economy and removing barriers to the operation of the market.",76
133,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,We finally hear about social imperatives.,76
134,Mr MCARTHUR,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"The honourable member at the table does not understand it. He does not understand anything about economics. Australia's high rate of unemployment is largely a function of the highly regulated labour market, which the government has done something about with its recent labour market legislation. The US and New Zealand, with their relatively free labour markets, have achieved unemployment rates of five and six per cent. Health care queues, poor educational attainment and low living standards amongst the less well-off are often symptoms of overregulated and poorly performing economies. The results generated by economic reform are important to improving both efficiency and equity. Again, the Stocktake of progress in microeconomic reform details the success stories. Airfares have fallen 20 per cent in real terms since airline deregulation, and passenger numbers are up 57 per cent, which is a very strong recommendation for that reform. In 1994-95, telephone competition saved Telstra customers $500 million through lower prices. Real average electricity prices have fallen 13 per cent in the last eight years. It is true that sometimes in the past the benefits of micro-economic reform have been overstated or exaggerated to win support. Arguably, it is the exaggeration of the gains from reform which has done most to fuel the backlash against economic rationalism, which some members in the opposition have made some strange statements about. But we as policy makers and politicians should not always sell reform in terms of the perceived financial or hip pocket benefits. Sometimes micro-economic reform is simply about fairness. Is it fair that only designated newsagents can deliver newspapers? Is it fair that only government owned monopoly rail operators be able to use public rail tracks? Is it fair to make workers join a particular union simply because they work in a particular industry? Is it fair that workers cannot take a job for less than the award wage if they are prepared to do so for the sake of finding employment? Is it fair for some manufacturers to get higher levels of tariff protection than manufacturers in other industries located nearby? Should some farmers be forced to sell their produce through a particular monopoly government owned body? Should some shops be able to open during hours when other shops cannot? The Kennett government has addressed that anomaly. Is it fair that some are exposed to competition while others remain protected from it? The Productivity Commission will be there to ensure that policy makers are made fully aware of the economic tasks which remain and that governments do not become complacent or se1fcongratulatory or think the job is over. Already the commission has performed this role in the area of protection for the car industry. With the rate of automotive tariffs falling to 15 per cent by the year 2000, it is tempting to think that the reform task is complete-bearing in mind that tariffs were in the range of 100 per cent back in 1984. So there has been a dramatic drop in car tariffs under the previous Labor government, as I have stated on many occasions, which is a very good thing and the car industry has improved under that regime. The Productivity Commission's draft report advocates maintaining the momentum of tariff reductions. Similarly in the labour market, the Productivity Commission made it clear that it believes industrial relations reform must go further. The commission's Stocktake report says: Although potentially controversial, greater variability in minimum wages in combination with productivity improvements would improve the job prospects of the unemployed, especially the youth and others with low level skills. It further adds: . . . not all existing wage loadings and award conditions should be considered sacrosanct. It should also be possible over time to reduce the number of safety nets provided. The positions taken by the Productivity Commission on issues of the labour market and tariffs in the automotive industry indicate that they will be a strong force advocating reform. Only last week, the House expressed its condolences following the death of a former member for Wakefield, the Hon. Bert Kelly. He had the reputation in this House for making life difficult for his own government of the day, advocating free trade in a very strongly protectionist climate. It was in that era that Alf Rattigan, the Tariff Board and the lAC picked up the issue of industry protection and its economic costs to the Australian nation. The Productivity Commission must remain a strong and vibrant force for continued economic reform for the benefit of all Australians. Much remains to be done. The stakes are too high for us to stall in this important task of reform that is at hand here in this parliament and in Australia.",76
135,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"I will not do as the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) did and say that he does not know anything about economics. He does know a lot about economics, but he knows only one school of economics. He knows only one approach. In fact, if anyone had any fears about the Productivity Commission, he confirmed them all. He basically said that the Productivity Commission would be committed to one particular economic theory, to one particular approach. It is the approach that he favours. Okay. But the question arises: should the advice coming to government simply be based on such a narrow and single approach? Of course, the member for Corangamite then went on to give us a big lecture about all of the supposed wonderful achievements of economic rationalism and of the approach which he has been advocating. It is interesting that the word 'social' in a speech 20 minutes in length appeared only once in a very limited context-the term 'social justice' did not appear at all. He used the word 'fairness'. His use of the word 'fairness' and the examples he used were interesting. He did not talk about fairness in the context of the huge and growing division between the rich and the poor-a direct consequence of economic rationalism in Britain, the United States and so many other parts of the world. If you have not noticed, the member for Corangamite, this year the British people are overwhelmingly going to reject economic rationalism-the Major government, Thatcherism and all that goes with itbecause they have had enough of it. What has it led to? Beggars in the streets of Londonthat is what it has led to. If you think that is progress and if you think the dismantling of the welfare state, the reduction of social programs and the cutbacks in the public sector-all of which are the result of economic rationalism-are creating a fair and better society, then you do not know what you are talking about. Most people in the Western world totally reject the approach that you have put forward here tonight. They are rejecting it everywhere-throughout Europe, in Britain and in the United States. As soon as the people get an opportunity-if this government is foolish enough to follow all the prescriptions which you have put here today about this Productivity Commission-they will kick you out at the next election. We have a concern about the Productivity Commission. It is not the idea that there should be a body to give government objective advice. The concern we have is that it is supposedly bringing together these three bodies, but if you look at its philosophy and the ideas it has brought forward, you will see that in fact its basic philosophy comes from the former Industry Commission and not from the Bureau of Industry Economics and not from EPAC. It primarily comes from the former Industry Commission and, of course, directly from the philosophy of economic rationalism. The honourable member has his value judgments and his views. He is entitled to them, if he is interested in real empirical evidence of what has happened under economic rationalism in these countries. But let us not suppose that any government should get only one form of economic advice, one set of value judgments, one economic theory. That is what would happen if this Productivity Commission is to proceed in the way it has been outlined here. We have grave fears about that. The honourable member mentioned the Stocktake of progress in microeconomic reform report, which he said was great. It was put out by the Productivity Commission before it had been properly formed-when it was still the Industry Commission. It adopted the title before it was actually formed, before it was properly put into place and before the legislation has gone through. It produced a report under the title Productivity Commission. A very interesting propriety. The honourable member for Corangamite seems to think it is a wonderful document. I think it is a terrible document. It is an atrocious document! The problem does not have to do with a simple matter of what is true and what is false in terms of some point. It has to do with the fact that there are value judgments in that document and it does not even make a pretence of saying there are two, three or four points of view, that there are a number of points of view on these central questions. For example, there is the issue of tariff reductions. The member for Corangamite has already admitted that there has already been a tremendous level of tariff reductions in this country-unilateral tariff reductions at a time when our competitors are not reducing their tariffs. The reduction of tariffs has hit every area, including the area of sugar-not just in industry but in the agricultural area, too. It is very interesting to see that one of recommendations of this so-called Stocktake was to recommend the total abolition of the sugar tariff. It is not merely people working in manufacturing industry that are going to be affected. The recent report went back to its original title. It brought out a report under name of the Industry Commission after it was criticised for using the title Productivity Commission before it was formed. I can say to the House that I and the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) are putting a motion to this parliament on those dreadful interim recommendations which were made. Let me indicate one problem that this body is going to have. The chairman of that body, Mr Scales, issued an interim report and called for public comment on the recommendations. Then what did he do? Mr MCArthur-What is wrong with that?",78
136,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Nothing, except that he went around publicly promoting the recommendations before he had made a final report. The final report has not yet been made and he has gone around the country arguing in favour of the recommendations. Two out of three had one view and there was another minority view. What does he do? He goes around as the chairman of the body while the interim report is there. He is supposed to then make an objective judgment in terms of the final report. What does he do? He goes around the country arguing for the interim recommendations. Mr MCArthur-At least he is up-front.",79
137,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Is that propriety? Is that your idea of an objective body looking at the situation in objective terms? If that is what it means, I am sorry, but it is not my idea or understanding of how these bodies should operate or how they should give objective advice to government. You are entitled, sir, to your views about economic rationalism and the value judgments you bring to economics. The problem you have is that you do not look beyond economics to see the consequences. Of course, your arguments about the importance of market capitalism and the growth of market capitalism and how it has been a triumphant march the in the 19th century are all very interestingexcept that you forgot to mention that millions of people were rendered into total poverty during that period. Let me tell you what fixed the problem. What fixed the problem was government the intervention to provide a safety net, a basic unemployment benefit and a basic wage, many of which reforms came from this Australian nation. You talk about laissez-faire capitalism as if it is the greatest thing but, if it had not been for judicious government intervention to provide the minimum conditions to provide a safety net, we would not have a civilised society-and you know it. We would have people begging in the streets, as unfortunately happened, as I said at the beginning, in certain periods during the Thatcher regime when people were thrown into a situation where they had absolutely nothing in a civilised society. They could not even get the basic minimums with which to live. Of course, we all agree about a market economy. That is true. As the member for Denison (Mr Kerr) said, we also agree that there has been an internationalisation of the economy and, therefore, international forces are at work. But those facts and the fact that there is greater competition do not mean that we are going to be fools in terms of our national interest. If there is going to be genuine multilateral international competition, then it has to be multilateral and not unilateral. If this nation is going to have a future, we are not going to cut down all of our protections, totally and unilaterally, while others are refusing even to allow some of our products into their markets. That is happening with some of our agricultural products, but it is also happening now increasingly with some of our manufactured products. We have to look at our national interest and make a balanced judgment, and we have made a balanced judgment. We have reduced car tariffs from, as you said, 100 per cent to what will be 15 per cent shortly. That is enough, until we see that other countries are going to show some good faith in relation to this and other products. If we do more than that, we are simply destroying our own manufacturing industries, especially our motor car industry, which employs directly or indirectly more than 60,000 people in this country. Is that what the member for Corangamite would like to see? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, representing an area near Geelong which has the Ford Motor Co. as one of the majc..r employers. The Ford Motor Co. itself has saidMr O'Connor-He is on the other side of the river.",79
138,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Well, a lot of his people must work at the Ford Motor Co. I have talked to the Managing Director of Ford and I have talked to other people in industry and they do not agree with any part of your analysis. They are not interested in your theories. They are interested in the real concrete consequences of what would happen if your· theories were implemented. Mr MCArthur interjecting",80
139,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,The honourable member for Corangamite is more spirited today than I have seen him for many years. I am interested in having further debate with him on economic theory and economic policy. Mr MCArthur interjecting,80
140,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for Corangamite should not interject. Mr MCArthur-Why not?,80
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,Because it's against standing orders-that's why not.,80
142,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"He had a go before, Mr Deputy Speaker. The basic reality is that the creation of this Productivity Commission, and the idea of a body to give objective advice to government, is a good idea. The problem has been the way in which we have started. We have started disastrously with this Productivity Commission because it has come out with all of these statements it has made in relation to this so-called Stocktake. There is also another matter: to review all limits on foreign investments with a view to relaxing restrictions. As if restrictions are not relaxed enough in this country. How much further can you go to relax restrictions for foreign investment? What are you going to do, allow people a total and complete takeover of the country? Is that the idea? Then there are all these views about competition and monopolies which the honourable member for Corangamite talked about. That is interesting because he identifies monopolies only in certain areas which are of his own choosing, but he forgets about other monopolies in the Australian international context. Let us talk about the media and Australia's media monopolies. Your government is about to legislate and bring in rules which are going to make the situation in Australian media even more monopolised than it already is, but we do not hear a word from you and I am sure we are not going to see you crossing the floor when a bill is brought in which makes the monopoly",80
143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,Order! The honourable member for Calwell should address his remarks through the chair.,80
144,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,I am sure we are not going to see the honourable member for Corangamite crossing the floor when there is increasing monopolisation and increasing concentration of ownership in the Australian media. I am sure we are not going to see that. Mr Miles-No.,80
145,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"At least the parliamentary secretary is honest enough to agree that there are certain double standards in this matter. The basic reality is that, when it comes to genuine encouragement of competition, we in the Labor Party agree with that. Mr MCArthur-You agree with competition.",81
146,Dr THEOPHANOU,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"f course we agree with that. We agree with encouragement of genuine competition and we agree with fair competition, but we are not going to allow unfair competition in terms of dumping, for example, from international bodies. The W orId Trade Organisation is supposed to allow the situation where dumping is prevented. What have we got in Australia at the moment? Take, for example, concentrated orange juice and what has happened to our orange industry. It has been virtually destroyed because of dumping and the government hasMr MCArthur-You didn't fix it.",81
147,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,Here we go. The member for Corangamite does not think there is anything in this argument. You go and talk to the people up in Mildura and other places which have gone bankrupt in relation to their investments in agriculture and see what has happened to them because of the failure of your government to take effective anti-dumping measures in matters of this kind. Let me also talk about other things that are in this so called Stocktake. Everything in this so-called Stocktake could have been written by the honourable member for Corangamite from his extreme right ideological perspective on this matter. Mr MCArthur interjecting,81
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,Order! The honourable member for Corangamite is interjecting far too much.,81
149,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Fortunately, the vast majority of members of this House are not as fanatical as the member for Corangamite, either on the issues of protection or on the issues of economic rationalism. The vast majority of members of this House, on both sides I believe, are interested in a fair balance between economic theory and social justice. They are interested in a fair balance. The words 'social justice' never appear on his lips, but the basic reality is that there needs to be a balance in society between the role of government and the role of the economy. If you go back to the experience of the 19th century and you get rid of government altogether, or you reduce government to such a small role and you have no safety net and no minimum wages-you attacked the idea of minimum wages before-what are you going to do? You are going to end up in a situation where you will have massive gaps between the rich and the poor, you will create enormous tensions in society and have a very unhappy society indeed. One would have thought that we might have learnt something from history. We should be going forward, not backward. In order to go forward in our understanding of what has happened, especially to Western economies, we should say, 'All right, we've learnt some lessons from both the socialist experiences and from the conservative experiences, and we should be creative and constructive in achieving a balance between the requirements of the marketplace and the requirements of social justice.' That is what we should be looking for as we go towards the 21st century-not looking back to some ludicrous vision of the 19th century, as the member for Corangamite was putting forward, but looking for something which is much more of a balance. What concerns me about this Productivity Commission is the way in which it is being constructed and the way in which the whole argument has been put together. I support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). It is a very good amendment. The amendment of the deputy leaderMr Miles-You will vote for the Productivity Commission, won't you?",81
150,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,We will vote for it and we will be moving amendments. We are trying to fix it up. Mr Miles interjecting,82
151,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"No. I will tell you what else we are going to do though when we get into government: we are going to get alternative sources of advice besides the Productivity Commission, especially in the area of industry. The parliamentary secretary will be interested to know that there has been so little in the area of industry policy since the Howard government came in, that even the industrialists themselves are saying, 'What's going on? Where's the industry policy? What's going to happen with industry policy? What's going to happen to the TFC industries? What's going to happen to the steel industry? What's going to happen to the car industry? Why is there no industry policy from this government?' You have got the half-asleep minister for industry who does not know what he is talking about and who gets up every day and talks about how all these economic rationalist reforms are going to fix up everything. The only thing is that he would not agree with the member for Corangamite on protection. At least he is sensible enough to know that you have got to leave some tariffs in place, otherwise you totally destroy the industry. We totally reject the approach of the government in relation to the Productivity Commission. (Time expired)",82
152,Mr VAILE,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"I certainly agree with the question 'That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question'. The only reason the Labor Party is moving this amendment to the Productivity Commission Bill is that we are changing some structures that they put in place. It was interesting to listen to the speech the previous speaker, the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous). I noted early in his speech that he was giving the former chairman of the Industry Commission and the Chairman of the Productivity Commission the rounds of the kitchen for some undertakings that he participated in going back a short while. I would imagine that the member for Calwell would also be aware that it was his government, the former Labor government, that appointed Bill Scales to that position and certainly his government, the former Labor government, that acceded to whatever comments Mr Scales was making about whatever issue the member for Calwell was alluding to. The only reason the member for Calwell could not do anything about it was that the left wing do not have any influence or exercise any power within the Labor Party these days, and they certainly did not in the previous government. The member for Calwell was making comment about a greater focus on multilateral trade agreements. That is one thing that we are not moving away from; we are placing a greater focus on bilateral trade agreements with an eye on the sorts of tariff regimes that our exports are facing going into particular countries with a view to negotiating on that basis. That is something the former government did not do. The former government and the former Prime Minister had this enormous fetish for multilateral trade agreements. I am not saying that they are a bad thing, but in the context of this debate tonight, which seems to have followed the economic rationalist line in talking about the existence and the movement of tariffs and the existence of tariffs around the world, the previous speaker was placing a great deal of emphasis and importance on multilateral trade agreements whereas the view of this government is that we can exercise more influence in getting a fairer deal through bilateral trade agreements. The Productivity Commission Bill is the delivery of a pre-election commitment. The creation of the Productivity Commission was a pre-election commitment which this legislative package delivers upon. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made this commitment by in his speech entitled 'A Competitive Australia' back in July 1995. The Productivity Commission will be the government's principal review body on productivity matters and is already operating. In line with the government's focus on improving Australia's competitive performance, the Productivity Commission will place emphasis on specific areas which impact on our international competitiveness. Interestingly enough, early in the life of this government, the Productivity Commission produced a document entitled Stocktake of progress in micro economic reform. That document was released back in July 1996. That document was basically put together when the Productivity Commission was still operating as EPAC, the BIE and the Industry Commission. That document contained a very interesting analysis of where Australia was up to with micro-economic reform-som-thing you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will recall that the former government used to pride themselves on in leading the charge for micro-economic reform in a lot of areas but which failed in a number of key areas of micro-economic reform to improve Australia's competitiveness and improve the bottom line of our national accounts. This bill formalises the establishment of the Productivity Commission by merging the functions of the Industry Commission, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the Economic Planning Advisory Council. The bill sets out the functions, powers and policy guidelines of the commission as well as its composition and procedures. The key functions of the new Productivity Commission include holding inquiries and reporting about matters relating to industry and productivity, providing secretariat services and research services to government bodies, investigating competitive neutrality complaints, and promoting public understanding on matters relating to industry and productivity. The Productivity Commission is the vehicle by which the government will push ahead for greater structural reform in the Australian economy. In particular, its objectives will include an improvement to the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity in both the public and private sector, to facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy to ease social and economic hardships arising from reforms, and to reduce the regulation of industry by all levels of government where appropriate. It is interesting to note the opposition's criticism. One of the arguments of the ALP is that the Productivity Commission rolls three organisations into one, reducing the number of organisations advising government. The opposition's fears of centralisation and monopolisation of economic policy advice amount to nothing more than a convenient Treasury bashing exercise. As I said at the start, it is a bit limp wristed. They are just complaining because we are changing some structures that they had in place. The former government called them the Bureau of Industry Economics, the Industry Commission and the Economic Planning Advisory Commission. We are giving it a much more focused name. The functions, for all intents and purposes, are very similar, but they are much more focused on the objective of the government-improving productivity in all sectors of the Australian economy. So these three organisations have been brought together with a single focus to look at productivity and the effects of a number of different government policy areas on productivity. The opposition ignores the fact that there are other checks in place in the government's policy-making process, not least of all being the joint party room, to balance fears of a so called dry economic agenda being pushed by the Productivity Commission. I for one acknowledge the need for a balanced approach to economic policy, and I am aware of a large number of government members who share a similar view. In fact, as the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles) indicated in his second reading speech, one of the stated objectives of the new Productivity Commission is to 'improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity in the public and private sectors in order to achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community'. Further, there will be reduction of industry regulation only 'where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth'. In other words, the Productivity Commission must look not only at the economic consequences of its advice but also at the social consequences. The opposition's criticism on this point is shallow and typifies their unwillingness in government to pursue meaningful micro-economic reform in areas such as the labour market, the transport sector and, in particular, the waterfront. Similarly, the ACTU has been critical of the establishment of the Productivity Commission because one of its roles will be to inquire into labour market issues. Their reluctance for modern labour market reform has been well documented and was certainly well and truly documented in the last three years of the Labor government. On that issue of Labor's dismal record on the waterfront, one of the key areas of focus for the new Productivity Commission will be the overall transport sector and in particular the waterfront. The waterfront is vital to Australia's trade performance, yet under 13 years of Labor government it has been one of the worse performing areas of the economy, especially when compared with the overseas experience. Much of this poor performance can be attributed to the former government's cosy relationship with the Maritime Union of Australia which has monopolised our waterfront for many years. We only need to look at crane rates as evidence. According to the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report entitled Waterline in December 1996, the five port average crane rate has actually increased since December 1995 from 19.2 to 22.3 containers per hour. While any increase in productivity is welcome, it is still significantly lower than that being achieved internationally. Australian ports do not compare favourably when you consider that in Europe they can move up to 50 containers per hour; in the USA some 40 containers per hour; and in Malaysia and New Zealand around 30 containers per hour. Similarly, if we look at ship manning levels we find that they are going backwards. I do not just focus on the involvement and the control that the Maritime Union of Australia still exercises on the waterfront as being the only problem on our waterfront. I think that certainly we should question the limited amount of competition for the stevedoring companies in Australian ports. One of the functions of the Productivity Commission is to look at the implementation of national competition policy and competitive neutrality and to ensure that there is competition in all sectors of the economy. The Productivity Commission should look not only at the labour market side of the waterfront but also at the level of competition, or lack thereof, for stevedoring companies. In December last year, the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce released a report on the waterfront and its performance called Turning the Tide-Wateifront reform in Australia. The key findings of the report were as follows: Delays on the waterfront are costing business in Australia about $1 billion annually and adding as much as 7.5% to freight prices. According to recent studies, Australia rates last in an international comparison of 18 ports. Waterfront charges, port charges, crane rates, ship working rates and delays, all show Australian ports still performing poorly. The importance of getting things right on the waterfront is demonstrated by the following finding: At present, waterfront services represent a significant component of export prices. On average, waterfront services account for just over 4% of the export price on agricultural and mining commodities and 2.7% on manufactures. Greater productivity is not just about dry economics; it is about boosting trade and creating jobs. The Howard government is intent on improving our waterfront and will do so by breaking the MUA monopoly, encouraging new entrants on the waterfront and eliminating anti-competitive practices such as cabotage. The Productivity Commission will play an important role in benchmarking our progress in this important area of the economy. The other area of reform I would like to touch on is that of labour market reform. The opposition has complained that this government's focus on productivity is all about dry economics and not about people. This is also false. Better productivity in our industries, transport networks and labour markets will improve living standards and boost job opportunities. We have heard a lot about improving job opportunities for young people in Australia. The introduction of the workplace relations bill and increased flexibility in the labour market will improve the prospects and job opportunities for young Australians in the future. We must ask the question: why is the opposition running scared about the Productivity Commission putting labour market practices under the spotlight? Is it simply to protect their ACTU mates? An opposition that talks about the need for jobs, jobs, jobs, would surely support the discovery and promotion of better work practices in Australia. It does not have to mean doom and gloom, which the Australian Labor Party has always portrayed since we won office last year and since the implementation of the workplace relations bill, which is about creating greater flexibility. It was interesting to note that one of the areas the Productivity Commission will be reviewing and reporting to government on will be the implementation of the national competition policy which flowed from the Hilmer report. When that report was brought forward to the former Labor government in recent years there was a noticeable exclusion from that report by Professor Hilmer: competition in the labour market. One wondersand I have often had this question asked of me-why that very important and integral part of our economy was excluded from that report and from recommendations about improving and introducing greater competition and flexibility into that important sector of the economy. This government certainly recognises that, and we have taken action to improve it. It is important that the people of Australia understand that the Productivity Commission has been developed out of three former bodies that were implemented under the former Labor regime. The only reason they are complaining about us changing them is that they put those bodies in place. We want to change them; we want to give this organisation a name that focuses on what the government expects of that organisation, and that is improving productivity. It is interesting to note a comment on the very important areas of agricultural support and statutory marketing authorities in the report of the Productivity Commission Stocktake of progress in microeconomic reform. I have had the opportunity in forums to discuss modern improvements and reforms to our economy-particularly with regard to tariffs, subsidies and the alleged anticompetitive nature of statutory marketing authorities. I highlight the following line that is used by the Productivity Commission in its report on statutory marketing arrangements. It would do the former speaker, the member for Calwell, well to read this line. Under the section headed 'Agricultural support', it states: Consistent with the competition principles agreement, statutory marketing arrangements should be terminated unlessand I emphasise the word 'unless'an independent and transparent review finds that, despite their anti competitive effects, the arrangements satisfy a public benefit test-that is, they raise national income. That is a very important comment that is being made by the Productivity Commission. It would do everybody in Australia well to remember that, as we review a lot of the practices that are in place, as we review the way we reform and restructure the economy of Australia, each one of those industries that has served Australia so well over the years, each one of those statutory marketing authorities, all those arrangements that go beyond the primary industries and into news agencies and other areas, we must apply the public benefit test. If there is no public benefit, there is no need to change it. I think that we will be sensible enough in that regard to apply that to the decision the government has already made with regard to single desk selling in the wheat industry, to the sugar industry and to the state governments' review of the statutory marketing arrangements as far as the dairy industry is concerned. One thing that we must bear in mind is that, whilst we must maintain a focus on improving competitiveness, on improving productivity and on improving international competitiveness, we are a different economy in a different country from many of the other developed first economies around the world. We are a very large country geographically; we have a relatively small population, with more than 18 million people; and we have a smaller economy. Not in every circumstance do the principles of the market prevail to provide the best or greatest benefit in the public interest-and that is the caveat that we should apply when applying a lot of the purist principles of economic and competitive reform. I support the bill that is before the House tonight and certainly do not accept the amendment that has been moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans). The government is again delivering on a pre-election commitment in creating the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission is an organisation that will report to government about government policy and settings for government to make the decision on what is going happen in different sections of the economy. This body will not be setting policy; it will be advising government; it will be reporting to government on progress in those key areas of competition, productivity and micro-economic reform generally. It is worth bearing in mind as well that it is the government that will be making the policy settings of the day; it will be receiving reports and recommendations from the Productivity Commission and then making decisions on those areas that the Productivity Commission is reporting on. I support the introduction of this bill. I support what is being done. The committee that I chair, the parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Micro-economic Reform, took the opportunity last year of spending a day in Melbourne talking about micro-economic reform to the Australian Consumer and Competition CommissionMr Rocher-A day is long enough in Melbourne.",82
153,Mr VAILE,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"That is absolutely correct. And we also talked to the NCC and the Productivity Commission. Again, we took the opportunity to highlight some of those important elements in balancing the argument of where we should be taking the economy as far as micro-economic reform is concerned. I support the bill and commend it to the House.",86
154,Mr ROCHER,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"At the outset I would like to make special reference-amongst the very fine contributions to the debate so far, including that by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile)-to that made by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur). Typical of what he has to say in this House from time to time, his was a thoughtful contribution that maintained his intellectual integrity in such matters-an integrity which I would like to feel that I could emulate. I certainly share his views by and large. Of course, that is not easy in a diverse party and coalition such as he is part of. I guess he must sometimes feel like a tree in a small stand of timber infested by a pack of dogs. Nevertheless, he is consistent in everything he says and very well regarded in those areas of industry which have an interest in what he has to say. In April 1996, the Business Council Bulletin commented on the previous government's efforts to reduce trade barriers and expose the Australian economy to global markets. It observed: The structure of the Australian economy now increasingly needs to be focused on our comparative advantages and on our capacity to compete internationally. Accordingly, Australia's resources need to be continually directed to their most productive use. It is in this context that I wish comment on the Productivity Commission Bill 1996 and the associated bill, the Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, being debated cognately. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) foreshadowed the abolition of the Industry Commission, IC, the Bureau of Industry Economics, BIE, and the Economic Planning Advisory Council, EPAC, and the genesis of the Productivity Commission in his headland address in July 1995. The government has justified the establishment of the Productivity Commission on the grounds of greater efficiency, improved levels of public scrutiny and a marked increase in economic literacy amongst the Australian people. The financial impact statement accompanying the bill also points to an expected $17.3 million savings over the next three years as a result of this rationalisation. As the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has acknowledged, the government is 'keen to realise the budgetary savings involved' with the decision. There is the expectation that the Productivity Commission will have an economy wide focus, but it will also investigate specific problem areas. The member for Braddon, the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), outlined these key areas in his second reading speech on 4 December last. Importantly, the Productivity Commission will have the authority to investigate labour market practices that retard productivity. The Workplace Relations Act and associated legislation gives only an inkling of the coalition's commitment to meaningful labour market reform in this country. That package might accurately be described as the ReithKernot laws. In the event, it fell seriously short of the government's promised reforms due to the influence of its de facto co-author, Senator Kernot. The unwelcome outcome enshrined in the principle IR Act is that relatively modest reforms have been reduced to mediocre ones. Against that, the former government proved itself to be inept at recognising the need for serious reform of the labour market and even less capable of doing something about it, due no doubt to the interests and influence of the union movement. The onus is now on this government to provide the Productivity Commission with both the atmospherics and the tools needed to monitor the effectiveness of the government's workplace relations legislation. It should be a matter of priority for the Howard government. The Productivity Commission will also have the capacity to examine the efficiency and competitiveness of services provided by the state and territory governments. This is an important provision in this bill. The Business Council of Australia has pointed out that our federal system with three layers of government is rife with overlapping and divided responsibilities, duplicated roles and an inefficient revenue system. It noted that this has resulted in duplication, waste and delays that affect all Australians, ranging from the way they do business to the cost of goods and services. The private sector is a major user of telecommunications, shipping, water, gas and electricity and has borne a significant part of the cost of inconsistencies and restrictions between the states. The Business Council suggested, quite rightly: Governments, federal and state, have a critical role to play in progressing Australian competitiveness and reducing the costs of doing business. The Productivity Commission will have an important part to play in creating competitive advantages for Australian businesses. The government's repeated references to the wide scope of the charter of the Productivity Commission have not convinced all analysts that the rationalisation is necessarily a wise move. The Australian Financial Review suggested on 27 September 1996 that a lack of public sector competition and the predominance of a 'less efficient Industry Commission methodology' could result in a less fruitful Productivity Commission. This is cautionary, given that a key brief of the Productivity Commission is to 'focus on areas which impact on Australia's international competitiveness'. A considerable downsizing of the staff of the Productivity Commission was required in order for it to meet its brief not to exceed staffing levels of the Industry Commission. About one-third of the combined IC, EPAC and BIE teams were made redundant as a result of the merger. What has concerned industry analysts is the make-up of the loss. Only half a dozen professional personnel from EPAC will stay on at the Productivity Commission, and almost 50 per cent of the BIE's senior staff left before the merger took place. In contrast, it is understood that few senior Industry Commission recruits have opted to leave. The research approach adopted by the Industry Commission has always been based on lengthy public inquiries. It has only ever investigated matters referred to it by the government of the day. Mr Ross Gittins, the Economic Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, has observed, 'Despite its public hearings the IC was an introverted outfit.' He noted that the IC never pursued empirical research, nor did it hold open conferences or forums with economic experts. Some analysts fear that this 'in-house' approach to economic modelling will be entrenched in the Productivity Commission because of the dominance of former senior Industry Commission staff. They are not convinced that such an approach is in Australia's best interest if we are to keep pace with global economic change. On this point I am pleased to note that clause 6, which sets out the functions of the commission, allows for the initiation of research from within Industry Commission ranks. The commission should be encouraged in the strongest possible terms to utilise this freedom. The bill also provides that the Productivity Commission may conduct public workshops and establish task forces if it sees fit. The use of such methods will improve the quality of the Productivity Commission's research and should be maximised. There is concern that the downsizing of the Productivity Commission and the associated reduction in its output will necessarily see a fall in economic literacy amongst ordinary-for want of a better word-Australians. Mr Gittins argues that this does not augur well for a government trying to win public support for the tough changes it has actioned to improve our domestic and international economic performance. In his second reading speech the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister said: The government wants greater public scrutiny and understanding of the factors driving Australia's productivity performance ... Unless we boost productivity as a nation, our incomes and living standards will fall further, relative to our competitors. Unless the government opts to contract out research to private sector think tanks, it is difficult to see how Australia can possibly maintain reasonable levels of investigation into improving our productivity. The Business Council's submission to the federal government shortly after the 1996 election made it very clear that Australia simply cannot afford for this sort of thing to occur. It said: Australia's continuing microeconomic reform efforts and the importance of removing distortionary industry policies internationally need to be continually highlighted. The combined efforts of the BIE, EPAC and the IC produced valuable information on the potential gains from reforms in diverse areas of the economy. The Bureau of Industry Economics was applauded for its work on international trade issues and small business and its international benchmarking project. The electricity, rail and waterfront industries-all of which were found to be operating below par by international standards-came under the microscope of the BIE. By contrast, the Industry Commission's focus has always been on the performance of the individual enterprise not on international comparisons. One economics expert noted that the creation of the Productivity Commission could see that 'poorly performing infrastructure providers are now off the hook'. Admittedly, the Industry Commission has followed the performance of government trading enterprises in its work for the commission of audit on government. But this research has only ever focused on public enterprises while the BIE also scrutinised privately provided infrastructure. Under the former Labor government, the Industry Commission was transferred from the department of industry to the Treasury. Similarly, the Treasury picked up responsibility for the Trade Practices Commission from the Attorney-General's Department. It could be argued that the amalgamation of the three research bodies into the Productivity Commission, which will also come under the banner of the Treasury, is yet another example of that major department trying to monopolise economic policy. Some analysts are concerned that previously commissioned research into industrial relations reform and human resource management will fall by the wayside and lead to a reduction in the diversity of the government's research and public education role. The Australian Financial Review made an important observation about the role of the former Economic Planning Advisory Council on 20 March last year. In doing so, it cautioned the government not to treat the leadership structure and advice of the new Productivity Commission as an afterthought. Journalist Mr Alan Mitchell reported on the part that the independent research of EP AC and the IC had played in the tariff reform debate. He wrote: Tariff refonn was made politically possible because the Industry Commission presented the public with convincing evidence of the economic failure of tariff protection. Mr MCArthur-Hear, hear; good point.",86
155,Mr ROCHER,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"The honourable member for Corangamite obviously agrees. Mr Mitchell continued by saying: Most importantly it alerted the most politically powerful victims of the manufacturing industry'S protection to the high cost of the government's tariff and non-tariff barriers. He also noted that EPAC and the IC had played an equally important role in quantifying gains from the reforms of Australia's infrastructure industries and competition policy. All three above mentioned examples impact directly on our ability to compete in international markets. It is essential that the Productivity Commission continues to produce the breadth, amount and diversity of economic research previously done by the three federal vehicles. Mr Mitchell reported that the ongoing discipline of the Productivity Commission will act as a meaningful check on true reform in areas such as industrial relations. He said: A properly functioning Productivity Commission will embarrass the government and its allies as often as it embarrasses their political opponents. It will expose government failure and industry inefficiency as well as union obstruction. In an open letter to the Prime Minister following the last federal election, the President of the Business Council, Mr Ian Salmon, had this to say: We both agree that to reduce Australia's unemployment rate to no more than 5 per cent by the year 2000 requires the Australian economy to grow at an average of 4 per cent per annum over the period to 2000. He went on to say: To do this Australia has to embark on a renewed program of economic refonn to boost business confidence, increase business investment and substantially improve national productivity. This legislation provides the Productivity Commission with the authority to investigate performance levels in every one of these fields. Accordingly, I support the bill. However, I remind the government of its responsibility to provide the Productivity Commission with the support, resources and, most importantly, the independence to allow it to get on with its very important tasks. The private sector has had to totally rethink the way it does business in order to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for all government practices. The Business Council observed that there are a number of common traits of Australian businesses that have made it in international markets. They include a commitment to improved productivity, innovation and quality. The Productivity Commission Bill 1996 provides the government with the catalyst which creates the opportunity to examine its own behaviour and practices. The $17.3 million to be saved from the rationalisation of the BIE, the IC and the EPAC must be weighed against the amount and quality of research produced by the Productivity Commission. It has the potential to be a very effective tool for the government, but only if its work is taken seriously.",89
156,Mrs GALLUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"I am glad to see that neoclassical economics is not dead in this place. We have certainly had some keen defenders of that position tonight. I would like to take a position slightly different from that taken by the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur). I say to the member for Corangamite: I think you have misunderstood where we are coming from. I think you see people who are arguing against what the Productivity Commission is currently doing as some sort of new-fashioned Luddites who are buried back in the past and are seeking a world of the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s. I suggest to the member for Corangamite that perhaps the reverse is the truth and that he is in a world that has already passed. The war against tariffs has been won. Nobody in Australia-least of all, I suspect, our very parochial state Premiers-is arguing that we should go back to protecting our industries with high tariffs. High tariffs were one of the bad things that happened to the car industry. They put up prices and they protected an expensive, low quality car. By bringing down those tariffs we got a much more efficient industry. I would like the member for Curtin and the member for Corangamite to stop taking a position because it is a position and to ly think through some of the issues. I ask them to have a look at the recent report of the Productivity Commission not with a point of view that all tariffs are bad but by putting the question: what is the standard of this intellecI tual analysis? I say to the member for Corangamite that the intellectual analysis of the report of the Productivity Commission is one of the poorest examples of intellectual thought that I have ever seen in a report. I would like to address this. In doing so I am very much aware of the nature of the bill we are discussing tonight, which provides for the formation of the Productivity Commission by merging EPAC, the BIE and the Industry Commission. I will refer later, if I have time, to some of the policy guidelines the commission has been given by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). I would like to point out where-if we take as an example the Productivity Commission report into the automotive industry-they have failed to follow the guidelines given by the Treasurer. Let's address this report which has been the source of controversy and contention, the report which recommends that we continue to reduce tariffs after the year 2000 by 2'12 per cent per year. That got a very strong reaction from the automotive industry and from the state premiers who knew what it would do to their areas. Mr MCArthur-What's new about that?",89
157,Mrs GALLUS,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Nothing is new about that. But let us look at the argument that got them there. There are three arguments put up by the Productivity Commission for that continual high reduction of tariffs-21h per cent per year after the year 2000, when we will already be down to 15 per cent. Their economic model-the Monash model created by Professor Peter Dixon-shows that there will be an increase in GDP of 1.6 per cent. There are a few interesting assumptions in that model. First of all, they gave us the wrong year. The comparison they made was not with the year 2000, when tariffs are going to be down to 15 per cent, with a five per cent tariff; they used the 25 per cent tariffs, the level at which they are now. What sort of comparison was this? actualThey were going back into a past, to an unreal world that does not exist, instead of looking to the future. So that great big increase in GDP was predicated on a 10 per cent higher tariff than would be the case. That find somewhat intellectually dishonest. I have pointed it out to the commission. I have even done the calculation in their appendix. If you do a mathematical calculation on the information they have applied in the appendix, you get the figure down to 0.9 per cent. That is fine. I will now dispute that that 0.9 per cent is a relevant figure at all. Models have to have assumptions in them. One of the things that Peter Dixon will admit is wrong with his model is that it does not have the capacity to take in regional effects. So regional effects are out of this model. Quite interestingly, Chris Murphy has a model-the MM2-in which he did manage to look at regional effects. According to Mr Murphy's model we get a 1.2 per cent drop in South Australian state product as a result of the change in tariff. That is somewhat different from what we got from the Monash model and also different from the national model. So we have got my model against your model. Let's go back to the Monash model. The Monash model does not include in it at present an adjustment for the money that the government loses from losing the income from tariffs. We have to make up that money somehow, but it is not predicated into the model at all. There is no doubt-I have discussed this with Peter Dixon-that that will change the end result prediction on GDP and bring it downwards. So they are three reasons not to take it. Let me now go deeper into that model and talk about the assumptions it makes, which are absolutely key to the model, about the CPI. It says that as imported cars come in at that lower price with the lower tariffs, overall CPI will drop and we will get better consumer purchasing power. But there are some fundamental problems with that. First of all, there is an assumption within the model that domestic car prices will also come down under pressure from imported cars. This ignores the fact that when domestic car sales drop their unit price goes up, and there will be a limit to how much the car manufacturers can do that, because the higher unit cost forces up their prices. Secondly, what will happen as more imports come in? The dollar will fall. As the dollar falls, those imports will become relatively more expensive and we will undo some of those gains in the CPI. As the dollar falls, the CPI will go up as those imports become more expensive. Thirdly, let us look at the current account deficit. With the importation of cars, there will be pressure on the current account deficit. It will get into a bigger deficit situation. When it does that, there will be pressure on long-term interest rates, and that pressure will again put up the CPI. So all of those factors undo the major assumption in that report that the GDP is going to increase as a result of the reduction in tariffs. It is not so. I now move on to the second argument that is put forward by the Productivity Commission-that is, the cost to consumers, which is quoted at $1.9 billion. The report states: The Commission estimates that in 1995 purchasers of new motor vehicles paid $1.9 billion extra their vehicles because of the tariff. Again, the report is intellectually dishonest. Why are we talking about 1995? Tariffs in 1995 were 27.5 per cent. The comparison should be made with what they will be in the year 2000, which is 15 per cent. It is intellectually dishonest. But it is not only that. There is another problem with that cost to consumers. It does not take into account the fact that the industry itself will be losing income; therefore, the cost to consumers overall will go up. There is another argument that the commission failed to put in relation to the cost to consumers, and this is something we have mentioned before. The commission forgot to put in the added cost of the taxes the government is going to impose because of the loss of income from tariffs. If you do the sumsand I address this to the member for Corangamite as well-the loss to consumers is not $1.9 billion. Do you know what that loss is? It is $40 million. That is the extent of not only the false calculations but also the intellectual dishonesty, because the major fault in there was taking the 1995 figures instead of the year 2000 figures. Let us get to the third argument that the Productivity Commission puts forward. The report states: A halt to assistance reform would remove the most effective incentive the industry has had to improve its performance. It would put at risk the gains made so far and jeopardise the industry's chance of ever catching up to its international competitors. There are a number of assumptions in this. The first assumption is causality-the tariffs came down and the industry made the gains it did in efficiency and all other aspects. You cannot claim causality because two things happened at the same time-that is an elementary logical statement. There were many pressures on the industry at that time to get more efficient-to survive being one of them. Survival, I have to say, is a great incentive. That is one of the great incentives the industry has at the moment. I tell you what, it does not need any incentives such as tariff reduction to try to survive. Second, let us accept the assumption of the for commission that causality is there. It then assumes that, because it has worked in the past, it is going to work in the future. That is equivalent to saying, 'It's all dght. Here's the medicine. One sleeping pill was really good for you, so why don't you take the whole bottle?' A little bit of medicine may be good, so let's give you a whole lot because that has got to be a whole lot better. It is a false argument. In doing this, the Productivity Commission has committed a logical sin that I do not think would be accepted by a year nine high school student. This is what worries me. It is not so much that we have had this recommendation of cuts and tariffs per se, but how the Productivity Commission got there-and it got there by dishonesty. These arguments the commission has used can all be blown away. They are mistakes that children would not be expected to make, yet here we have a $26 million a year commission making these elementary mistakes. I would refer the commission back to the guidelines given to it by the Treasurer, one of which was to: ... improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity in the public and private sectors in order to achieve living standards for all members of the Australian community ... This brings us back to the regional effect of tariff reduction on the South Australian economy. South Australia is dependent on its automotive industry. It is not a happy fact; it is a sad one. But it is true. Pressure on that industry has the chance of driving Mitsubishi or the other manufacturer overseas. Mitsubishi is my interest; it is in the electorate where I live. That brings me back to another question. Just where is the Productivity Commission coming from? There is a subtle message in this report. We all know the conclusion is the same premise the commission started with, but there is also another message if you read the report-that is, the Productivity Commission already thinks one of the manufacturers in Australia is doomed. Read the report. It does not say it in so many words, but there is an assumption that four car manufacturers is one too many. I suspect we might see this come up in the revised model that will appear in the full report. I do not believe that the commission in its final report can use the same assumptions that are in the Monash model. I think we might see an assumption that looks at one car manufacturer leaving Australia. But what would happen to South Australia if that occurred? You would immediately lose 3,000 to 4,000 jobs. And what about the component manufacturers that are there to support South Australia? They would go. An assumption common in economic models is that labour migrates to where the jobs arebut there are no other jobs in South Australia for labour to migrate to. The people who have been working in that industry are not going to pick up their caboodle over their heads and walk to Melbourne with their families looking for jobs because they know the jobs are not there either. We are going to have increased unemployment, and that is something else that we have not put into the model. What about the increased DSS payments to those people who lose their jobs, not to mention the loss in payroll tax to South Australia? Once that happens and you get that higher emigration out of South Australia you get an increased loss of confidence, with more businesses closing up and leaving the state. This is why Premier Olsen is there at the door of the Prime Minister saying, 'Don't listen to the Productivity Commission because it is giving you bad advice. It is giving you dangerous advice.' Finally, in the couple of minutes that are left to me, I would like to look at just one other aspect of the report: the international trade issues section. I have never in my whole life seen anything so trite and trivial as the section that this report has devoted to international trade issues. We have not heard any mention of Indonesia and the Indonesian car. What chances are there for Australia if Indonesia is putting out its own car? We have all the component manufacturers here. What sort of advantage can we have with that? What sort of bilateral relations? Could we help with the car industry? The report does not look at that. It does not look at the after-parts industry and the agreement with Japan. Where are the possibilities for the industry there? And there are possibilities. But this report ignores them. Let us just have a look at the stunning recommendations that come out of the section on international trade issues: The commission recommends that the government continue to aggressively pursue trade liberalisation both unilaterally and through multinational negotiations. Wow! What a stunning recommendation! Can we imagine it recommending anything else? What would happen if it put in a recommendation to not pursue trade liberalisation? It is not that the recommendation is wrong, but it is so trivial. Of course that is what governments are going to do. Why would you bother to make a recommendation? It is an empty motherhood statement. That brings us to its only other recommendation under international trade issues: The commission recommends that the government consult with industry when establishing priority areas for trade negotiations. What a stunning intellectual recommendation that is! Would it like to suggest that we don't consult with industry, that government goes ahead and ignores industry altogether? What I am trying to get at tonight is that the quality of the work that the Productivity Commission put out in the automotive report was not of a sufficiently high standard and we-the country, the parliament and the governmentdeserve a much higher standard from this commission.",90
158,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Given that debate in this chamber alternates between government and opposition, I very seldom enjoy listening to the contribution which immediately precedes mine. But, on this occasion, I have to say that it has been a delight to listen to the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who has given a contribution indicating both considerable research and detail. It was a very cogently argued contribution with which I found myself in total agreement. The people of this country would be, I suspect, a great deal better off if the member for Hindmarsh were the industry minister rather than the industry minister we have. I have to say to her that, if people from South Australia were to leave South Australia and migrate to Melbourne, they would find that, under the recommendations of the Industry Commission concerning the motor vehicle industry, there would not be any jobs for them there either. In my electorate of Wills, for example, the Ford Motor Co. represents our principal source of jobs. And the Ford Motor Co. is under just as big a threat as the Mitsubishi motor company in South Australia from the recommendations of the Industry Commission to which the member for Hindmarsh referred. This bill is about, amongst other things, the passing of the Industry Commission. In my view, the Industry Commission was an antiindustry commission, so its passing is not lamented by me. It did immense damage to the electorate which I represent, with its cuts in industry support and its cuts to textile, clothing and footwear tariffs back in 1990 or 1991. It did immense damage to the textile, clothing and footwear industry in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. Employers simply closed down or went offshore. What jobs were there for the mostly women who worked in these factories? The answer was: none. Our unemployment skyrocketed and stayed high during the recession. It was only later, following Working Nation, that it came back down to levels much more akin to the national average. But will the Productivity Commission be any better? I have to say that the omens are not good. Its initials are PC: that also stands for political correctness. The government rails about political correctness and, sometimes, I know exactly what they are talking about. But the question is: is this PC guilty of another form of political correctness, sometimes referred to as economic correctness? This is the view that only markets work; that markets should determine everything; that there is no role for government in anything, whether we are talking about industrial relations or industry policy or public sector authorities or the tax system; that there is no role for government in achieving social justice, no role for government in achieving equality and no role for government in fostering nation or in fostering community. I want to come to the new Pro ducti vi ty Commission's track record a little later. In addressing myself to the Productivity Commission Bill, I am reminded of the inscription on the floor of the vestibule in the Victorian parliament, from which I come. That inscription reads 'Where no council is, the people fall. But in the multitude of councillors there is safety.' This legislation would fail the test set by that simple quote for it aims to confine the government's ear on critical economic matters to one source of advice. No advisory body is infallible. The Treasurer (Mr Costello), after his recent embarrassment on the mid-year review, which showed up a $3 billion Costello black hole, has an acute appreciation of the vagaries of economic forecasting. Given the breadth of views which go to making up sound policy judgments, it serves a government well to have several different sources of economic advice. Why, then, should any thinking government wish to reduce the number of sources of advice? The question is even more pressing in the case of this government and this Treasurer. The member for Higgins is struggling in his portfolio, with unemployment up, bankruptcies up and the budget deficit blowing out. He desperately needs more sources of advice, not fewer. The very last thing which Australia needs is this Treasurer making critical judgments on economic matters based on his own knowledge, instincts and prescriptions, with no input from EPAC. The simple reason behind the government's decision to merge three advisory bodies into one is its obsession with short-term cost cutting. The same government which is attempting to stimulate industry by slashing industry programs and which is trying to do more for university students by forcing them out of courses through higher HECS charges is now trying to enhance its ability to react to economic changes by abolishing EPAC and the BIE. The government is prepared to gain a saving of $5 million per annum but puts at risk the longer term national interest. This bill also empowers the Productivity Commission to initiate its own research. This represents a significant departure from established practice. Until now, it has been the convention that advisory bodies respond to government requests for research assignments. So it is that governments over the years have assigned various advisory bodies specific investigatory projects. An example of this practice that we have recently seen is the Industry Commission delivering a draft report on the automotive industry, so eloquently and elegantly attacked by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. It is something to which I shall return shortly. What is the role of government if it is to assign to advisory bodies the power to initiate research projects of their own? It stands to reason that any agency as influential as the Productivity Commission cannot initiate research without that research becoming the focus of attention. Who is to say that, pursuant to this legislation, the commissioner's research priorities will be in accordance with the government's priorities? If the government decides-I hope it does-that the automotive industry tariffs should not be lowered below 15 per cent beyond the year 2000, and the Productivity Commission, under this legislation, chooses to initiate its own further research into the effects of a zero tariff regime, what will the community make of this confusion? I would say as a general principle that advisory bodies do best when they provide advice. The Productivity Commission's charter to conduct research into issues that unelected officials regard as important stands in the path of good public sector management. It compromises government, devaluing the government's entitlement to lead economic debate, as well as lessening the respect that government is entitled to command in setting its own economic direction. It is a very poor way of conducting public policy. Last week, this House debated the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996. I participated in that debate. I expressed my concern that, for all its hype and obsession about the minutiae of fiscal statements, that charter represented a betrayal of Australians because it failed to deal with unemployment. Not once was the word 'unemployment' mentioned in the information guide provided by the Parliamentary Library. I share a similar concern with this bill. The defined functions of the Productivity Commission in this bill make not a single mention of employment or unemployment. The same goes for the general policy guidelines for the commission. They are a reminder to the commission that it must bear in mind certain things. For example, it must take account of the government's desire to improve overall economic performance through higher productivity in order to achieve higher living standards. Again, there is not a word about unemployment. The Productivity Commission is told that it must take account of the government's desire to facilitate the structural changes in the economy and ease the social and economic hardships arising from those changes. There is still no mention of that word. It is told that it must recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by the measures it proposes. It must even recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures it recommends. Sadly, there is not one mention of unemployment. At no stage is the Productivity Commission obliged by this bill to directly deal with the issue of unemployment. It is a word which the government has, with a flair that George Orwell would recognise, banished. The government has replaced unemployment as a social concern with various newspeak phrases that are intended to distract battlers who have a genuine concern about this issue. The main reference to unemployment coming from the Treasurer in recent days has been that insidious suggestion that it will make a second round of labour market deregulation easier. One is entitled to ask whether the Treasurer and the Liberal Party want unemployment to fall or whether they are happy with it as it is because it helps keep the workers in line. We all recall the Liberal Party's grand promise before the last election. It unequivocally declared this: Coalition policies will move Australia back towards full employment: the situation where paid employment is available for anyone who seeks it ... The national job creation strategy will deliver this objective. If the government wishes to prove that this flourish of concern about Australia's jobless has some substance, then let it do so by amending this bill to include a direct reference to unemployment. If the government wants young Australians to place any stock in its pre-election hype that it would deliver opportunities for work to all who sought it, then let it come into this place with a very minor amendment that says that reducing unemployment is a serious goal. Let it include with its references to living standards, to productivity, to restructuring and to regulation that word 'employment' as evidence of its commitment. I referred earlier to the Industry Commission's draft report on the automotive industry. This is important to consider because the terms of reference of that report specify that the commission take account of any recent substantive studies and have regard to the economic, social, environmental and regional development objectives of governments. The majority opinion in the draft report are cause for grave concern. They have rightly attracted criticism, as has the government, from Australians who wish to promote local industry rather than see it sacrificed by reckless tariff cuts that pay no regard to what our competitors and overseas car manufacturers are doing. The South Australian Premier late last year suggested that the problem lies with the federal government. He said: I think that there is something of a policy free zone on industry at the moment that needs to be addressed. He is absolutely correct. The opinions of dissenting commissioner Mr Ian Webber are most instructive. He wrote: My firm position is that Australia should maintain tariffs at their 2000 levels until 2005 and that this pause would give the industry time to fully adjust to what I regard as a modest level of assistance. The principal reason why it would make little sense to further reduce tariff assistance to the domestic automotive industry below levels scheduled to prevail in the year 2000 is that the gains for Australia as a whole from such unilateral action are likely to be negligible, while the. adverse consequences for South Australia would be significantand by inference for Victoria. He further found: While cutting tariffs down to the general rate would no doubt pass the internationally competitive automotive manufacturing industry test, I am convinced that any surviving remnant of the industry would be neither 'sustainable' nor 'prosperous' . They are very serious warnings. His warnings on the consequences of further tariff reductions are dire indeed. He wrote: Cuts in assistance may easily have dramatic consequences on those areas heavily involved in automotive activities ... Tariff reductions scheduled between now and the year 2000 are estimated to add 0.3% to the South Australian unemployment rate a decade from now ... Continued tariff reductions beyond the year 2000 take the employment loss in South Australia to 2.71 % ... Also real private consumption is now projected to contract by nearly 3.2%-representing a significant cut to the welfare of South Australians, and a very high price to pay for long-run (net) national gains which approximate zero. Commissioner Webber correctly pointed out that the automotive industry'S restructuring effort to date has been first class and that it was not possible to expect improvements to continue flowing at the same rate. He said: Assistance is down to of the order of one tenth of what it was at its peak ... The gains from reducing tariffs by a given percentage fall significantly as the extent of assistance becomes less. In other words most of the gains from cutting tariffs come from cutting high tariffs, not from cutting low tariffs. Commissioner Webber deserves praise for the way that he has sought to balance economic and social considerations. He has not been afraid to point out the impact of tariff cuts on employment. The great pity of it is that these common sense views are so much at odds with the prevailing orthodoxy of the Productivity Commission, an organisation whose authority the federal government effectively wishes to enhance through the bill before the House. This same commission was responsible in the late 1980s for the restructuring of the textile, clothing and footwear industry, which once provided the backbone of employment in Melbourne's northern suburbs. This same commission more recently recommended the end of the machine tools bounty on the spurious grounds that alternative industry assistance measures were available. At the very same time it delivered this recommendation, the government was in the process of scrapping or modifying these same alternative assistance programs that had been referred to, such as research and development, DIFF, the export market development grants and so on. The general manager of a successful manufacturing plant in my electorate, Farley Cutting Systems, appeared before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in November to discuss this issue. Mr Farley said: The things the government actually did will reduce our profit by 60 per cent. The other thing they have done which is even more. disastrous, or that has happened, is just the total collapse of demand in Australia. Our demand in Australia is running at 10 per cent of our budgeted rate ... Since the election we have not had one significant order. Thanks to the Industry Commission, the machine tools bounty has disappeared, leaving successful and innovative companies like Farley Cutting Systems high and dry. This is the organisation that the government wants to place even more reliance on. This further devalues any commitment the government has to addressing unemployment. It effectively strangles Australian industry by allowing a continuation of inadequate policy prescriptions. In the electorate of Wills the most significant employer is Ford. Data provided to me by the local regional development organisation indicates that Ford and its associated suppliers and distributors account for over seven per cent of all jobs in the region, and that if the automotive industry were to disappear then unemployment in the north-western region would rise to a figure of close to 20 per cent. The vehicle division of the Manufacturing Workers Union has expressed the view that removing tariff protection from the car industry could cost 30,000 jobs and threaten another 30,000 in the component industry. That, of course, goes well beyond the Wills area and into other parts of Australia. For example, I know that in Geelong there is great concern amongst those involved in the automotive and textile, clothing and footwear industries about what the Productivity Commission has in store for them. Automotive and TCF industries in Geelong account for some 7,000 jobs and are under great threat if these tariff cuts occur. I note that the Secretary of the Geelong and Region Trades and Labour Council recently said that if the Industry Commission, now the Productivity Commission, and the government cut tariffs to five per cent in these industries Geelong will be totally decimated. Similarly, the South Australian Premier has described the recommendations of the Productivity Commission concerning the automotive industry as 'high risk and potentially very costly to South Australia and Victoria'. He said they were a 'potential disaster for South Australia' . The Victorian Minister for Industry, Mr Birrell, said the majority report was 'a predictable and blinkered conclusion that would slash Australian jobs and thwart long term industry growth'. He said, 'The commission would condemn Australia to repeat the lost opportunities of the past decade where we made major concessions on tariff policy but received very little in return from our trading partners.' The President of Ford, Mr David Morgan, said the report's primary focus on tariffs made it a 'simplistic treatment of a complex subject'. He went on to say, 'It is telling the commissioner with international business experience'- Mr Ian Webber-'has not supported the majority viewpoint expressed by the commission.' The Managing Director of Mitsubishi Motors, Mr Quinn, said he was 'very disappointed, but not surprised' at the direction of the commission's majority report. This is an issue on which the Liberal National Party members need to stand up for their electorates, as I will stand up for mine. I am attending the Productivity Commission hearings in Sydney next week to put the case for my electorate. I do not know whether other MPs are doing likewise. Government MPs have both the opportunity and the obligation to speak up for their constituents on this issue. (Time expired)",93
159,Mr CADMAN,PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION,"Mitchell) (10.16 p.m.)The Productivity Commission Bill 1996 brings together three advisory groups that previous governments used. Some of these groups have been in existence for a very long time-the Industry Commission for an extremely long time. It was formerly the Tariff Board and then the Industries Assistance Commission. It was a body that gave advice to government about the level of protection that Australian industry should receive in the form of tariffs or other mechanisms. That body, over the whole period of the life of the Labor Party in office, constantly recommended the reduction of tariffs and was constantly and slavishly followed without complaint by a single member of the Australian Labor Party. The complaints and bleatings we have heard from the Labor Party tonight have risen to the surface since they lost office. They are either saying, 'All the time we were in office we really were not allowed to say the things that we are saying now,' or they are saying to the House and the Australian people 'We have quickly changed our minds within a period of a couple of months' and the path that the Labor Party was on for the 13 years that they were in office was completely wrong. The Industry Commission has been consolidated with EPAC, which was the former government's chief economic advisory body, a body which the government took note of for a period but in later years restructured and whose advice it tended to reject. EPAC was introduced with great fanfare by Bob Hawke. We remember the first meetings of EPAC in the cabinet room-the photographs of the then Prime Minister with the members of EPAC and the proud reports that he waved at that time. The fact was that the Australian Labor Party, the government of the day, had no economic policies whatsoever and relied on EPAC to supply them. The substitute for ideas was to have an expert body. The expert body gradually dwindled in favour and in consequence until its reports really consisted of whether the child-care policies or arrangements in Australia were suitable or not. That was the level of regard and competence or the height that it attained as an advisory group to the previous government. The Bureau of Industry Economics, which is the third body, presented a number of reports, none of which appeared to be able to deal with some of the major issues such as micro-economic reform or changes in management techniques of the type that industry was calling for. I recall, and I am sure the House will remember, numerous reports by the Australian chambers of commerce, by the metals industries and trades industries of all sorts. The associations of these businesses called for major reform, doing incredible amounts of research themselves to see what should be done to ease the load on Australian businesses. But not one of those reports prepared by Australian businesses through their associations was really taken up or investigated fully by the Bureau of Industry Economics. So we have had one long-term body with a history of giving advice to government, a second body that declined in favour with the previous Labor Party administration and another body that was only partially effective, producing half-baked or inconsequential reports which were never acted upon by the previous government. It was natural that, with a change of government, the incoming government-being familiar with the lack of real direction in industry and economic advice available to the previous government-should consolidate the bodies, bring together what expertise there was and establish an organisation capable of giving advice and direction in an economic and broader sense to the government. It is a very logical and sensible progression and one which I believe deserves the full support of all members of this House. The previous bodies that formed the three separate structures, by being consolidated into the Productivity Commission, really start to give emphasis to the new direction Australia needs to take in being competitive in international circles and being able to provide benefits for the Australian people. The problem has been that we have not dealt with productivity in its correct form in Australia, that term often being confused with production. The Productivity Commission is not about increased and more painful production; it is about working smarter, working better and getting better results for the same effort. The Productivity Commission, I think, will be a worthy addition to the advice that is available to the federal government. The research that this body will be able to do will take it out of the political correctness regime and allow it to assess Australia's true position in international affairs. It will be able to look at major industries and, in doing so, it will be able to look at world best practice and make real comparisons between Australia's effort and output, as compared with our neighbours and competitors. It will be able to range Australia against the best in the world. I deplore the current trend-which existed previously in government circles under the Australian Labor Party-to use the term 'best practice' rather than 'world best practice'the breaking down of the concept that Australia should be equal to or better than the best in the world to the meaningless term 'best practice', which is not a scale of judgment anybody can apply to any section of Australian industry. Gradually high ideals have been broken down until today we have had a government of a different type come forward and say, 'Let's throw off the halfbaked mediocrity of the past, bodies giving advice to government that are only partially successful, and let's establish a new regime, one that can properly and effectively measure Australia against the rest of the world and can make comparisons.' Some of our comparisons will show that Australia is good in some areas and extremely bad in others. It will allow the Productivity Commission to examine some of the matters of micro-economic reform where change must come and where change is needed. It will allow the Productivity Commission to look at our export effort and how we can be more effective in gaining markets and opportunities for employment for Australia, because ultimately the real test is: are there going to be more jobs for Australians? Is small business going to prosper out of this process? Are there going to be chances for Australian families to benefit from these decisions? Of course there must be because instead of lacking direction, as the nation had under the Australian Labor Party, now we will be able to focus all the energies of government policies relating to industry, employment and the way we relate together in the workplace, because labour relationships is also part of the charge and charter of the Productivity Commission. That is something which was denied those other bodies. The Australian Labor Party, with a change of heart, comes in and says, 'We must reject the Industry Commission report on the auto industry,' without bringing into consideration labour relations, the appalling labour relations that were obvious in the Ford company over a period of years and the changes that have occurred as gradually quality management has taken over from poor labour relations. We still have the major Australian car companies appealing to governments as the easy way to solve their problems. So what is needed instead is a continuing change in labour relations, which is something that this government is committed to, and an opening up of the system so that there is greater competition in the labour markets of Australia. That term really does not take into account the challenge to the individual worker and to the individual manager where people need to be flexible for change, for change to be taken in a way that is non-threatening, and those people with traditional and long-tried skills gradually being encouraged and educated into new fields of endeavour and accepting new technology in the process of their workplace. As we make these changes and as the Productivity Commission really starts to come to grips with some of the factors that need assist us to move ahead, we have nothing but nagging and wishful thinking from the Australian Labor Party. They have been out of office for nine or 10 months and already they are looking back to the good old days of 10 or 12 months ago saying, 'If only we had our Industry Commission, if only we had our EPAC, if only we had instead the BIE, Australia would move ahead successfully.' What a bunch of rubbish that is. you have been in opposition you have proved that you have learnt nothing. You have not taken a new direction of any sort. You are looking back to the past, yearning for decisions that were proved failures under your government and rejected by the Australian people. So this government has moved ahead, established a new body which will take into consideration the needs of Australian families and of Australian small business and their share in Australian productivity and production and, of course, the need for us to be able to export and compete in a sensible manner with those around us. In addition, I want to finally draw to the attention of the House one of the charters of the new Productivity Commission, that is: (e) to recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the Commission. It is not just an economic body; it is a body that can also--and needs also to--take into account the impact of its decisions on social structures. What will be the impact of its decision on working hours and the impact on family incomes? All of those things must be taken into consideration by the commission. So we have a balanced organisation, one that can look at international affairs and international relationships, one that needs to look at our economic competitiveness and one that needs to follow on with the reforms that have been initiated in the first budget of this government-and nearly wrecked in many circumstances by thoughtless and illogical decisions in the Senate. It needs also to be able to apply its mind-and it can-to the local and very personal impact of government policies and government decisions. So we have a balanced organisation, requiring it to to take public hearings as required, to present reports as required and to be able to supply real information for the process of policy formulation and decision making. I support this legislation. I think it is long overdue. Too long have we drifted in the doldrums of Labor decision making. Now we have a new day and a new opportunity. It is starting and is well on the way with the establishment of the Productivity Commission. In the period that (Time expired) Debate interrupted. NA",97
160,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Whistleblowers Larundel Psychiatric Hospital",99
161,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In August last year I raised in this House the need for a legislative scheme of protection for whistleblowers. I referred the House to the 1994 and 1995 reports of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing and, in particular, their recommendation that the practice of whistleblowing should be the subject of Commonwealth legislation to facilitate the making of disclosures in the public interest and to ensure protection for those who choose to do so. The government's response of November 1996 indicated that a number of those things had been agreed to. I expressed the view at that time that this issue should not drop from sight. I referred the House to the sad fate of Victorian Constable Karl Konrad. At that time, the government had been in office six months. It has been in office now nearly 12 months, and there is still no sign of response or action from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or any other member of government on the issue of protection for whistleblowers, and this problem continues. I want to talk to the House about Ms Debra Christian, who has recently resigned as a facility services officer, or what we might call a domestic, from Larundel Psychiatric Hospital due to a lack of support from management and indeed their complicity, and involvement in some cases, in the pilfering of food by other staff members which is intended for patients at the Larundel Psychiatric Hospital. Ms Christian started work at the hospital in November of 1994. One of her duties, and that of other domestic staff, has been to collect food trolleys which arrive from Royal Talbot Hospital in Kew with food ready to be served to the patients and to serve the meals and to clean up afterwards. She was astonished to find that other staff would take from the food trolley items such as fruit juice, fruit, fruit loaf, yoghurt, pies, sweet and sour pork and so on, leaving only basic items for the patients. Parts of hot meals would be stolen, leaving the patients' food to go cold and no food for variety. Breakfast cereals, whole catering tins of tea and coffee, milk for patients-all of this was taken by staff and either used in the staff room or taken home. On one occasion a patient became violent because he knew that orange juice was supposed to be served to the patients. It was being stolen by staff. She took orange juice to that patient and greatly annoyed her fellow staff members by doing this. When she criticised a staff member for doing this and he failed to stop the pilfering, she reported him in 1995 to her unit manager, who had expressed concern that there was never any food in that ward. The man who was reported took a $30,000 package the following month, but was later re-employed on a casual basis, and Ms Christian understands that he had been previously involved in other acts of stealing, including from a stores truck. The pilfering of food intended for patients, nevertheless, continued. According to Ms Christian, unit managers at Larundel, which has six units of some 20 patients each, condone the taking of food and, in some cases, are personally involved in it. Staff are also party to intentionally overordering food in excess of requirements so that they can take the surplus home for themselves. Recently, Ms Christian became involved in a dispute with a second staff member who had also been engaged in constant pilfering of food. Her supervisor, however, told her she must turn a blind eye to this and that she was a troublemaker because she had reported someone before. Ms Christian decided to resign, and has resigned. She is most concerned that the level of patient care at Larundel is inadequate, that patients do not get enough food, that they are deprived of proper food choice and a healthy diet through pilfering and that some of the nursing staff, who are supposed to supervise meals, do not even know whether patients have been fed or not. Furthermore, some of the patients at Larundel have drug or alcohol addictions and suffer from brain damage. But the brain damage is not simply a function of the drugs or alcohol; it is also because they are not eating properly. They need a varied diet. This is simply not good enough. Her objection to this culture of theft has cost her her job, yet one of the perpetrators gets a $30,000 package and re-employment. I stress again to this House the need for both state and federal governments to take action to protect whistleblowers when they make properly authorised disclosures in the public interest from the kind of retribution which Ms Christian has experienced and which, regrettably, other employees have experienced also. Children",100
162,Dr NELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to draw the attention of the House, and also the attention of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), if that is at all possible, to UNICEF's 1997 report State of the world's children. In 1990 the World Summit for Children adopted the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children. UNICEF has a number of important achievements now to its credit. UNICEF, of course, is an international organisation to which Australia, through its foreign aid commitments, makes a not insignificant contribution. There are a million fewer children under the age of five who will die this year than in 1990 despite unprecedented population growth. Every year about 80 per cent of the world's children are immunised before their first birthday, as distinct from what happens in Australia. Polio is well on the way to eradication. Guinea worm, which afflicted millions in Africa and South Asia up until five years ago, is now on the verge of elimination. In only five years of improved effort, an extra 1.5 billion people are now using iodised salt, and that of course strikes a major blow against iodine deficiency disorders and preventing mental retardation in some 12 million infants every year. More people have access to safe drinking water, and oral rehydration solutions have ·now reached 60 per cent coverage. By the way, dehydration from diarrhoea kills about three million children under the age of five every year. Of the 1.3 billion people living in absolute poverty, children are the first victims. Australia, through its commitment in terms of foreign aid and support of non-government organisations, makes a significant-although I think we could do a lot better--contribution to alleviating such poverty. There are between 100 and 200 million children under the age of 15 years who are forced to work in dreadful conditions, and 95 per cent of those children are in the developing world. According to UNICEF's report, 250 million children between the ages of five and 14 years are involved in child labour in the developing world. Australia has been contributing foreign aid. Whilst the member for Oxley has said that we should stop sending all foreign aid immediately and that we should withdraw from the United Nations, I think it is worth reminding the House of some of the projects to which the Australian government contributes. The Australian government provides financial assistance to NGOs such as the National Council of Churches of Australia to raise awareness about the issue of bonded labour among women and girls of the Kamaiyas in Nepal. We are also working with End Child Prostitution in Asia Tourism on a project designed to increase community awareness of the problem in our own region and with ASIANET on a child labour trafficking project-hardly projects from which one would withdraw financial support. Au sAID is also investigating possible assistance to a UNICEF primary education project in India which aims to improve access to education for poor children.· Another possibility for action in this area are campaigns to raise awareness of child labour issues in Pakistan. We are also contributing to programs. I realise the member for Oxley sleeps soundly at night but she might like to think about some of these occasionally. In the Philippines we are contributing to the street children and education project. A total of $3.2 million is being spent by AusAID on behalf of the WFP to provide rice to street children and their parents as an incentive to access better education and training opportunities. We are also working with the Save the Chi 1dren Fund, an Australian project which seeks to improve access to, and the quality of, primary education for ethnic minorities in the Bin Thuan province of Vietnam. It is also worth reminding the House that the central causes of child exploitation are poverty, rural immigration, the low status of women and lack of access that women have in the developing world to education. In many societies, only through education will women be able to overcome the almost complete domination they suffer from men. The solution is awareness. Australia contributes to the enforcement of legislation, the education of women, technical assistance and aid development. I believe it would be irresponsible to withdraw our commitment and even to reduce it. Regional Australia  p.m.)-In the Hunter and Central Coast regions we are experiencing the full impact of this government's assault on regional Australia. Despite all the 1996 campaign rhetoric of the Liberal and National parties in favour of regional programs, regional programs have in fact been hit and hit hard by this remote, Treasury led, doctrinaire government. Medicare offices are being closed; CES offices are being closed; the office of the Newcastle department of immigration has been closed; the highly effective Skillshare programs have been slashed and some offices closed; long-term unemployed people have been abandoned; staff from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs have been cut; and employment projects have been decimated. Looking to the infrastructure area: overall, national highway funding has been chopped by some $600 million, funding for public hospitals has been cut by $800 million and the building better cities program stage 2 has been abolished. That program, derided by members of the government when they were in opposition, has been of substantial benefit to Newcastle and through Newcastle to the Hunter region. Some $70 million is being invested in Newcastle with a multiplier effect right across the region. In stage 2 Lake Macquarie City Council was to seek funds and to get assistance for developments in their area. Meanwhile, we see local federal members of this government trying to present these substantial cuts to regions as benefits. The reality in the Hunter and the Central Coast is that the major federal programs in place that provide employment and business opportunities across those areas are all initiatives and achievements of the previous Labor government. The Australian Taxation Office at Newcastle was rejected by the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard) when he was Treasurer. I was in the delegation that waited upon him with that proposal-an ideal proposal-but he said no, just like that. That office, which has become the model for administration of the tax system throughout Australia and brought considerable benefits right through the region because it covers an enormous area of New South Wales, is an initiative of the later Treasurer. It was approved by Treasurer Keating and opened by Treasurer Keating. It has brought better service to taxpayer constituents; it has brought tertiary jobs, some 700 jobs, into regional Australia; it has brought legal and accounting opportunities; and it has added to opportunities for the university in the training of students and people in those professions. It has had a major multiplier effect. throughout regional Hunter and the Central Coast. It is now a model for the rest of Australia. Our determined industry policy-the steel plan of 1983-brought a rejuvenation of the steel industry in the Hunter and in Australia. The Fraser government and the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, had abandoned the steel industry. The national highway connection through to the Hunter has brought massive benefits to the Central Coast, to the Hunter and to Port Newcastle-and more are yet to come. Our defence industry policy includes ADI and the minehunters being constructed at Newcastle, submarine sections being constructed at Tomago and frigate sections being constructed by Transfield in Port Newcastle. Forgacs dockyard has two years of solid work on what looks like probably being a contract worth over $100 million now-an ample opportunity to establish themselves as a competitive, efficient, reliable service business to the navy and is the result of a determined policy by the former government. The civil facilities at Newcastle airport were upgraded at a cost of $2.75 million and then $3 million was spent in roadworks, an initiative of the former Labor government. They are now providing major benefits to the Hunter and with great potential in sight-not from this government, not at all, not a zack from this government in respect of those projects-for the development and expansion of Labor's regional policies. The lead-in fighter project, won by British Aerospace and located at Newcastle airport resulted from the work of the airport board convincing the two final contenders to base their operations at Newcastle. The board was supported by the two councils, Newcastle and Port Stephens Shire Council, with a commitment of $1 Y2 million and $1 Y2 million from the New South Wales government, but not one cent from this government. Yet you see members of this government trying to claim credit for that project. That was put in place by the airport board and won by the airport board. Neither this government nor its members can claim any genuine credit for these successes and improvements in the Hunter and the Central Coast and the employment, careers and commercial opportunities those projects bring to small business of the Hunter and of the Central Coast. Unemployment: Shoalhaven",101
163,Mrs GASH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak with both pride and enthusiasm about a project that was initiated by the community, for the community and to be operated by the community, known as 'Shoalhaven earning a living' --or as we would know it: working for the dole. The Shoalhaven, like many other areas, has inherited a high level of unemployment both in the young and not so young. It has continuing problems of youth suicide, homelessness, crime, domestic violence and many other associated problems which can be directly attributed to unemployment. Being a coastal area and a most desirable place to live, the Shoalhaven has an ongoing problem associated with such a lifestyle-the transient unemployed visitor looking to settle in our area. When you are faced with a population growth rate of six per cent, 5,000 people unemployed and a probability of that figure increasing to 6,000 by the year 2000, it is time to consider all options. The Shoalhaven community did just that some two months ago. The Area Consultative Committee, concerned members of the public and community leaders did a stocktake of the area's assets and decided that 5,000 unemployed, a possible job growth of only 500 and a population rise in the work force of 750 per annum did not add up. Past work programs have not been successful and were costly to run. This, together with the added news that the potential of the region to create jobs had just been downgraded by the Department of Social Security to the lowest possible figures-that is, two out of 10 for Ulladulla and three out of 10 Nowra-meant that the situation was not only unsatisfactory but also critical. As a government we have to accept some responsibility. However, in the Shoalhaven it has been accepted as the responsibility of the entire community-hence the creation and subsequent announcement of the SEAL project. To hear the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) declare his and this government's stance on working for the dole has reinforced to the people of the Shoalhaven what they knew and believed had to be done-it was time to say 'Enough is enough'. Not only that; there was also an obvious and growing feeling of antagonism towards the perceived image of dole bludgers-those who are unemployed and not contributing to the social or economic needs of our society. To that end, the ACC, which comprises union representatives, all political parties, business leaders, the Aboriginal community, and local government, presented for public debate the 'Shoalhaven earning a living' project. The project is now going through the public presentation and awareness stage. It is designed to be run on a voluntary hasis that will eventually lead to compulsory participation. It is disheartening, to say the least, when you have family men and women coming to see you on a regular basis saying, 'Please get me a job, for I can no longer explain to my children why it is that I do not work and why it is that I am perceived to be useless and a bludger.' They want to set an example for their children to follow, to experience the work ethic, to feel a sense of belonging again and, most importantly, to see a future for themselves. There was a distinct change in people's attitude and general outlook in the Shoalhaven when the announcement of the SEAL project was made. People became positive and actually volunteered to assist. There was a general display of 'Let's unite and make this work.' And now, with the subsequent recognition and support of the government, it will work. Already over 1,000 places have been offered by sponsors for community projects that will be developed as the program progresses. We recognise that bipartisan political support is essential. It is intended that the unemployed who participate in these sponsored projects will work for up to three days per week, and will receive minimum payments to cover insurance, travel and uniforms. Work programs will be in the cultural, tourism, sport and community infrastructure areas. Environmental projects will also playa large part, owing to the land care problems associated with the sensitivity of what is a most fragile coastline. Following the success of these projects, the intention is then to industry and small business, as only when they are involved will real jobs be created. The target is for 3,000 participants and 500 additional jobs by the year 2,000. Costs and budgets are now being finalised. However, the cost of doing nothing will far exceed the cost of the SEAL project. A 10 per cent reduction in unemployment will render a saving to the government of $5 million dollars alone in the Shoalhaven. The minister has been informed of the concept from day one and I, for one, welcome the news that this government has also recognised the importance of a work for the dole scheme--or, as I would prefer it to be known: 'Australians earning a living'. The SEAL project is not-and I emphasise the pointdesigned to exploit the unemployed. I do not believe that forcing able people to work is cruel. I do not believe that giving people an incentive to get out of bed each morning is a mickey mouse stunt. I do not believe that bringing people back into the work force and having them give something back to the community is exploiting them. I am sure there will be some criticism of the SEAL project, but I remind all in the House that in our area both the unemployed and the community at large have demanded it. There is untold unity. Once we were able to live to work, and now it is a case of working to live. (Time expired) Ryan, Ms Edna",103
164,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to take this opportunity to join with a large number of Australians from all around the country and with newspaper and other commentators speaking about the late Edna Ryan, a constituent of mine who died over the weekend. In the time available on the adjournment there is no possibility of paying effective tribute to someone with such a distinguished, lengthy and diverse career as Edna Ryan's. In fact, I probably could not read her entry in Who's Who in five minutes, there are so many elements to it. I want to take one or two themes and comment upon them. I feel comfortable in doing so in the knowledge that my colleague involve the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) spoke extensively on this matter in the grievance debate and that on Friday there will be a memorial service which will give an opportunity for other people to make more comprehensive remarks. I think the noteworthy thing about Edna Ryan's career was its consistency in principle and commitment over a very lengthy period of time right up until her death. Last year she supported me in a small way during my election campaign-and only now have I come to realise that she was actually 91 when she was doing that. It was a remarkable thing and a great tribute for which I was grateful. Many people on the progressive side of politics, the industrial and political wings, have come to be grateful for her advice, her wise counsel and, most particularly, her example. Of course, growing up in Perth I did not know Edna Ryan personally. She was active in New South Wales politics and moved to Canberra in her later years. I could not begin to recite even the extent of her trade union and Labor Party involvement in New South Wales in the time available. I want to mention just a couple of examples, one being her activity as a very senior official in the Werriwa FEC-with due respect to the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) sitting next to me-during the period of one of his distinguished predecessors, Mr Gough Whitlam. Mr Latham-They were all distinguished.",104
165,Mr MCMULLAN,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes. I said one of your distinguished predecessors. Of course, everybody who has represented that seat has been very distinguished, including the present incumbent. But Gough Whitlam, I know, greatly appreciated the support and assistance he received, as did the state members, particularly during Edna Ryan's period on the Fairfield Council. She was the first woman deputy mayor of Fairfield, in 1958. Of course, one of our distinguished members of the House went on to become a woman mayor of Fairfield, before coming here to represent the seat of Prospect. That was a very important groundbreaking role for women in local government. But most particularly she played a groundbreaking role for women in the area of industrial relations and particularly equal pay. But it is not just a historical tribute about great roles in the 70's, which have been supported and outlined by many speakers and many articles. She played a very active contemporary role as well. It is quite possible that Edna Ryan's last major crusade was her fight to have women's concerns represented and visible at national wage hearings before the Industrial Relations Commission. Her belief and fear was that women in the workforce, inevitably, would be worse off under the system of enterprise bargaining. She rallied Women's Electoral Lobby members and supporters, she developed WEL's statements of concerns on the impact of enterprise bargaining on women and she sought then to raise funding through donations and through women's organisations to prepare a full scale submission to the Industrial Relations Commission and recruited a barrister to prepare that submission. Many people in WEL came to appreciate the significance of that, not that enterprise bargaining is always a problem, but it needs to be supervised and monitored very carefully to protect the interests of women. That was a very contemporary, relevant contribution. I want to join with all those people who have paid tribute to Edna Ryan and particularly to her daughters, Julia and Lyndal, her son, Pat, and her daughter-in-law Margaret, all of whom are very active here in the ACT community and, in their different ways, in the Labor movement, and some of whom I have the privilege to call good friends. While Edna Ryan lived to be 92 and lived a fine life, I join with people in extending my sympathies to her relatives and in thanking them, on behalf of everybody in Canberra, for the wonderful contribution their mother made to our country and our movement. Social Security",105
166,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Herbert) (10.55 p.m.)Tonight I would like to speak about comments I recently made regarding the social security system. A Current Affair recently ran a story regarding mothers having children because they saw some financial benefit coming out of the social security support as a result. To cut a long story short, female nursing staff from Kirwan Women's Hospital approached me with concerns about some women-and I will get to the numbers part shortly-claiming that they had children so they can get extra social security benefits. I was asked to act and, accordingly, I did act on those concerns in the local media. From there the story was picked up and run statewide and nationally. A lot has been said since then, some of which has been accurate and some of which has not. I feel compelled to clarify a few comments that have recently been made by other people, but I will preface it by first saying that I do not back away from any of the comments that I have made in the media to date. At no stage have I ever said that single parents, and in particular, single mums, should be denied social security benefits. I have never said that. In the media interviews that I did do on the issue, I went out of my way to say that the social security safety net should be there for women and, indeed, for all people when they need it. I fully supported that and I clearly said that on A Current Affair and in other interviews. It is a tragic fact of life that for some women it can be physically dangerous to stay in certain relationships. For women who need to get out of such relationships, it would be completely irresponsible for any government not to provide some support if necessary. Another point I would like to make is that at no stage have I said that this was an enormous prohlem. Quite clearly, that would be wrong too. Again, I said during the recording of the A Current Affair interview that I was not talking about large numbers. However, that statement was not broadcast. When I raised the issue of misuse of social security by some women, I did not do it because of the dollars and cents aspect. Sure, that was a part, but the more important aspect of it was the principle. It was the principle of family values and what sort of a message I would be sending if, after having heard all the instances cited by the staff of Kirwan Women's Hospital, I had kept quiet and said nothing at all. What sort of message would I be sending to them if I condoned people dropping out of the workplace and into the social security system? You cannot legislate against family and marriage breakdown. You cannot legislate against women getting pregnant, leaving their partners and then coming back years later, out of the blue, demanding child maintenance. At the same time it is very difficult, if not impossible, to legislate to make men take responsibility for the children they bring into this world. By the way, Mr Speaker, that is also something that I have tried to get across in the media on this issue, that is, men must face their responsibilities as parents too. Finally, I did not join the government subcommittee looking into the Child Support Agency to crack down on and deprive people genuinely in need of social security support, as has been suggested. I joined the government sub-committee examining the CSA to sort out the mess that that agency is in, which is an entirely different issue. And I certainly believe that, from the comments that the  year on Today, Tonight, on a program that I also appeared on, there will be a bipartisan approach to be taken in addressing the problems relating to the workability and the fairness of the CSA. I certainly hope for a great result from that. House adjourned at 11 p.m. NA The following notices were given: Mr Abbott to move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the notice  ance of Statutory Rules 1996, No. 261 being called on forthwith .. Mr Kerr to move: That this House notes: (1) the continuing poor state of the Tasmanian economy under the State Liberal Government; (2) the blow-out in the Tasmanian budget as revealed in the Statement of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the period ended 31 December 1996; (3) the release of the ANZ job series advertisements which show Tasmania as the worse performing State with a drop of 7.4% in job advertisements; (4) the loss of another 140 jobs with the closure of the ACI Crown Glassware plant in Hobart, on top of the 5400 jobs already lost under the Tasmanian State Liberal Government; (5) the failure of the Tasmanian State Liberal Government to have any strategy or policies to combat Tasmania's increasing unemployment and job losses; (6) the reduction in public sector employment in Tasmania flowing from federal budget cuts and reductions in budget transfers to the State; and (7) the implicit admission by the Howard Government that it has no answer to the long term and youth unemployment crises in Tasmania. Dr Theophanous to move: That this House: (I) acknowledges the progress made by local car and component manufacturers and their labour force in achieving increased productivity, improved export performance and quality production to the benefit of Australian consumers; (2) expresses its concerns at the majority recommendations of the Industry Commission interim report on the automobile industry and especially the recommendation to reduce tariffs below 15%; (3) expresses its concerns that the Chainnan of the Commission has chosen to publicly advocate this recommendation, while at the same time pretending that he will produce an objective final report; (4) expresses its finn belief that when all factors are taken into account (including Australia's - bligations under the World Trade Organisation) the overwhelming national interest is for motor car tariffs to remain at 15% after the year 2000; and (5) is of the view that the reductions which have taken place in the tariffs to this point have not significantly cut the prices of motor cars for consumers and that to reduce tariffs below 15% will be tantamount to devastating the Australian automobile industry and destroying thousands of skilled jobs in regional Australia. The following answers to questions were circulated: Telstra: Cross Subsidies (Question No. 879) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 30 October 1996: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the table in appendix 8 of the report by the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee of its inquiry into the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996 which details the cross subsidy in each electorate. (2) Does the Minister endorse the figures quoted in the table; if not, will the Minister provide alternative figures. (3) Is the Minister able to (a) say how the cross subsidy figures were calculated and (b) provide similarly derived figures for each major centre in the electoral division of Parkes. (4) What guarantees are there that the rural cross subsidy will remain in place after the partial sale of Telstra. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am aware of the table shown at appendix 8 of the report of the inquiry into the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill 1996. (2) As the designated Universal Service Carrier, Telstra's Universal Service Obligation (USa) requires the company to ensure that the standard telephone service and payphones are reasonably accessible to all Australians on an equitable basis, wherever they live or carry on business. AUSTEL is responsible for administering the usa arrangements and is also required to monitor and report to the Minister regarding Telstra's performance in meeting the usa. I am advised that Telstra funds its share of the costs incurred in providing loss making services under the usa from elsewhere in its business-that is, through cross subsidies. Under the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Act 1991, Telstra, Optus and Vodafone have been declared participating telecommunications carriers. This means they are required to share the costs of meeting the usa based on their share of timed telecommunications traffic. NA AUSTEL is responsible for assessing the contributions of each carrier. Under the Telecommunications Act 1991, AUSTEL is responsible for assessing and publishing the total Net Universal Service Cost (NUSC) incurred by Telstra, each financial year, in providing the usa in loss making areas (which may be smaller than the area serviced by the associated exchange). The Act stipulates that AUSTEL use an 'avoidable cost' methodology which estimates costs avoided and revenues foregone if a particular group of customers in an area declared a net cost area were not serviced. I understand that the figures included at appendix 8 of the Senate report were estimated by Telstra using a model Telstra has used in the past to estimate its NUSC, to apportion the NUSC assessed by AUSTEL for 1994/95, across electorates. AUSTEL and the three carriers have agreed that Telstra's model needs to be revised. They are currently working to establish a new model. AUSTEL has advised that these figures are not consistent with the NUSC which it assessed for 1994-95 (see Telstra's explanation against (3». AUSTEL's NUSC assessments are the only official figures available and have not been published in a disaggregated form since 1992/93, and then only to the State level. (3) (a)-(b) Telstra has advised that the cross subsidy figures provided at appendix 8 of the Senate report were calculated by apportioning AUSTEL's NUSe assessment according to the exchange losses generated by Telstra's model. Telstra has advised that these estimates were derived by overlaying electorate boundaries on exchange boundaries to estimate the losses generated by exchange in an electorate, using the geographical centre of each exchange as a reference point. This involved a significant amount of estimation as exchange boundaries do not necessarily coincide with State or electorate boundaries; each electorate is serviced by a number of exchanges; and an exchange may service a number of electorates. Telstra has indicated that care should be used when interpreting the cross subsidy estimates included in appendix 8 of the Senate's report. Telstra's model is based on a number of assumptions currently under review and further disaggregation of AUSTEL's NUSC Assessment using the model would further reduce the reliability of any resultant estimates. Accordingly, producing data at the level of disaggregation that you have requested-namely for each major centre in the electoral division of Parkes-would not be a worthwhile exercise as the reliability of the figures would be open to serious question. (4) Telstra's Universal Service Obligation will not be affected by its partial privatisation. The Government has reaffirmed in the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Act 1996 and in the Telecommunications Bill 1996, Volume 1, its commitment to the key consumer safeguard of the provision of a universal service to ensure that all Australians will continue to have reasonable access, on an equitable basis, to the standard telephone service and payphone services. Indeed, the Government is currently conducting a review of the definition of the standard telephone service to see whether it should be upgraded to accommodate new technologies. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Wetland Areas (Question No. 985) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 21 November 1996: Further to his answer to question No. 575 (Hansard, 7 November 1996, page 6590), what is the Federal Airports Corporation intending to do in respect of the wetlands in and about Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) manages two wetlands in and about Sydney Airport-the Botany Bay wetlands and the wetlands at Barton Park. In regards to the Botany Bay wetlands, the FAC advises that it plans to follow actions as outlined in the Botany Bay Environment Plan. This is a long term plan which involves undertaking activities such as the removal of noxious weeds, restocking native vegetation and building footpaths.  developing a management plan to enhance the wetlands at Barton Park in consultation with Rockdale Council, local community groups and several Government statutory authorities. With international treaty requirements in place for the area, the FAC realises its responsibilities and is confident that it will meet its statutory requirements. It has already carried out the removal of noxious weeds as part of an ongoing process to improve the wetlands. Plans are also in place to undertake ongoing maintenance of lights and the transformer station located in the area. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade: Expenditure on Hire Car Costs for Ministerial Travel (Question No. 1013) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 December 1996: What were the hire car costs to the Minister's Department for ministerial travel between 1 March and 1 September (a) 1995 and (b) 1996. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) While travelling overseas, ministerial hire car costs are a charge to the Department of Administrative Services. The costs to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are therefore nil. (2) While travelling domestically, ministerial hire car costs are a charge to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The relevant costs were: 1.3.1995-1.9.1995: (Senator Evans)-$50,198.65 1.3.1996-1.9.1996: (Mr Downer)-$18,315.60 Essendon Airport: Operating Loss (Question No. 1043) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 9 December 1996: Does the Federal Airports Corporation annual report for 1995-96 record an operating loss for Essendon Airport, before interest; if so, what is the operating loss for the year ending June 1996 including interest. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. The Federal Airports Corporation's annual report for 1995-96 records an operating loss (before interest) of $1.114 million for Essendon Airport. The Federal Airports Corporation has advised that it raises capital on a corporate basis and is therefore unable to allocate specific interest charges to its airports. Safety Concerns: Air Services (Question No. 1095)  Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (I) How many (a) written and (b) other expressions of concern about the safe operation of air services has his Department or any other agency for which he is responsible received in (i) each of the last 3 years and (ii) the period from 1 July 1996 to the date of preparation of the answer to this question. (2) What was the specific nature of each of the expressions referred to in part (1), categorised by type of aircraft service. (3) Which of the expressions referred to in part (I) originated from passengers. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: To reply to such a broad question is not considered a justifiable use of resources by a number of government agencies. These resources are better devoted to improving aviation safety through increased surveillance, ensuring compliance and investigating and reporting on safety issues. Multicultural Australia Action Plan (Question No. 1101) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (I) Was an Arts for a Multicultural Australia Action Plan endorsed by the Australia Council at its May 1996 meeting. (2) Did the Minister endorse the plan. (3) What steps have been taken to include people of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds on the Council and each of its funds. (4) What is the current status of the plan and what progress has been made on its implementation. (5) Of the appointments to funds made or endorsed by the Minister in 1996, how many persons were of culturally and linguistically backgrounds and how many were indigenous Australians. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) No. The plan is not a document for which Council would seek the Minister's endorsement. (3) Council ensures that appropriately qualified peers are included in its recommendations for appointments forwarded to the Minister for consideration. Recommendations to the Minister are discussed carefully at Council meetings and reflect the diversity of the Australian community in terms of gender, geography and cultural diversity. Representation by culturally and linguistically diverse peers currently exists on most Funds. The Register of Peers is utilised by the Funds to complement its membership as required. (4) Since its endorsement by Council in May 1996, the Arts for a Multicultural Australia action plan has been progressively implemented by all Divisions of the Council and is monitored by a quarterly reporting process. (5) In 1996, the Minister appointed four persons of culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and six indigenous persons, and reappointed one indigenous person, to Funds of the Australia Council. National Library: Off Site Storage Costs (Question No. 1104) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) What is the expected cost of off site storage for the National Library collection in 1996-97. (2) Will additional funding be provided by the Government to meet those costs or will the cost be met from within the National Library's 1996-97 budget. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The National Library of Australia advises that the current anticipated expenditure for 1996-97 on offsite storage of the National Library's collections is $320000. (2) The question of offsite storage of the National Library's collections will be considered in the context of the May 1997 Budget and assessed diverse against other Government priorities. Cultural and Artistic Organisations: Grants (Question No. 1117) Mrs Johnston asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) Which cultural and artistic organisations in the electoral division of Canning are receiving grants or other forms of assistance from the Government. (2) What is the sum of the grant or nature of the form of assistance provided in each case referred to in part (1). Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question. (1) The Older Women's Network (WA) Inc is in receipt of an Australia Council grant provided through its Community Cultural Development Fund. (2) $1,500 In addition, two individuals from the electoral division of Canning have received Australia Council grants in 1996-97: (a) Mr Gary Narkle ($10,000 from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Board) (b) Ms Marguerite Laurence ($10,000 from the Literature Fund)",105
