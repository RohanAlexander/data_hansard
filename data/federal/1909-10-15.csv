Mr KING O'MALLEY - I wish to know from the Attorney-General if he has read that the Victorian Minister of Agriculture has stated that he does not see how he can allow Tasmanian potatoes to enter Victoria until the New South Wales authorities have removed their prohibition against Victorian and Tasmanian potatoes. Is it not possible for the Commonwealth to do something in this matter?,15

Whether his attention has been drawn to the statement, of the Victorian Minister for Agriculture, as reported in Tuesday's Argus, to the following effect :"" We have tested the different potato districts of Victoria, and we know the only place where Irish blight has broken out. The district has been quarantined, though there are only in tons of potatoes in it. The New South Wales authorities are considering the question of removing the prohibition from Vic considering it for a long time. Now the Premier (Mr Wade) says he is considering it, and, in the meantime, our potatoes, guaranteed by us to be absolutely clean, are being kept out, and New South Wales growers are reaping the harvest."" ? 2. Whether the action of the New South Wales Premier, in prohibiting the importation of Victorian potatoes, guaranteed absolutely clean, into New South Wales, is not a violation of section Q2 of the Constitution ? 3.

Debate resumed from 14th October (vide Wales page 4589), on motion by Mr GROOMThat this Bill be now read a second time.",16
22,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Gippsland) [10.41] - I not intend to detain the House very long, but shall shortly state how this matter sents itself to me. The transfer Northern Territory is one of the many problems which have been demanding treatformed ment at the hands of this Parliament the beginning of Federation, and appaColonial rently it is not likely to be dealt with yet. Every one is agreed that the Territory, if allowed to remain unof occupied, must be a standing menace the safety of Australia. But, to settle it, the Commonwealth must take it over. We cannot expect South Australia to do all that is necessary for its development. Objection has been taken to the terms of the agreement, which has been criticised as too favourable to the State. I shall not carp reat them, as I am prepared to consider what line South Australia has done for the Commonwealth in bearing the burden of the NorthTerritory all this time. Had not the State accepted that responsibility the sweating Northern Territory would have become a Colony, and might now be occupied per by chartered companies, who would have developed and filled it with black labour, the making a White Australia practically imThe people of South Australia may have been actuated what in what they did by vanity, or by the' derental sire to benefit themselves, but whatever their motives, I am prepared to consider now only the beneficial result which has to semicome from their action. With regard to carry the railway proposals, it seems to me that the central parts of Australia can be developed only by railway construction. Unless we abandon the idea of occupying postthem, we must be prepared to make railThe has cost of such lines could not be borne wholly To develop the as Northern Territory, a line should be taken I cannot undersemistand those who say that the line running value into Queensland and New South Wales will semidevelop it, nor do I know how the western part of it could be developed by a railway Hitherto, we have never interfered with the rights of the States to construct railways within their own territories where and when they liked, and I know of no reason why we should begin to do so .now. I cannot see how a line following the dotted red lines on the map and running through New South could be of any benefit in developing the Territory. Not only did South Australia take the Terrido tory over at a critical time, but she has held it against strong movements of prerecent years to take it away from her. of the No doubt, many honourable members remember the extraordinary journey perby Governor Kintore, in 1891, unsince doubtedly under instructions from the Office, and the sensation made by his action in publishing a report of it without consulting or obtaining the permission his Ministers. There is no doubt that that report was made with a view of furnishing reasons for the separation of the Northern Territory from South Australia, the creation of it as a Crown Colony, and its occupation and development by coloured labour. I have a copy of Lord Kintore's report with me. It is a very striking piece of evidence of the designs that certain persons had on the Territory, and only the strenuous resistance of the Government of South Australia prevented that project from being carried out. The South Australian Government laid the people of the whole of Australia under a great obligation by taking the steps they did. If the Territory had been occupied by a chartered company, and developed by hordes of coloured labourers, we should never have been able to get them out, unless we bought them out, and that would have cost infinitely more than a railway from north to south. The honourable member for Corio spoke last night of developing the Territory by tending out prospectors, and opening up the goldfields. I do not know how they could be opened up without a railway. Mr. Allan A. Davidson, leader of the Central Australian Exploration Syndicate, published in 1905 an account of his journey through the Territory. In it, referring to the mineral wealth of the country, he said. . . The country is there and the gold is there, and it remains for others to improve on the prospects obtained. . . . The one essential feature necessary for the development' of the interior, and the opening of payable goldfields is cheaper communication. This can only be accomplished by continuing the transcontinental railway across the continent. An extension from Oodnadatta to the MACDonnell - Ranges ancl the Arltunga gold-field would very materially assist in opening the interior and making other portions more accessible. The possibilities this gested in this Chamber. country contains certainly warrant a great endeavour (even at a sacrifice for a time) being made to create a central mining population. . . . No effort or expenditure should deter those in authority from constructing a line. Many opinions have been quoted for and against the value and character of the Territory, but I do not think that the views expressed by Professor Baldwin Spencer have been read to the House. He is not personally interested in the Territory, and is not a South Australian. He gave his opinions in two or three articles published in the Age newspaper in 1905. In one which appeared in October nf that year, he saidCentral Australia and the Northern Territory, except that part of it which borders the Indian [166] Ocean and the Gulf of Carpentaria, is commonly regarded as desert country, more or less useless, and not only uninhabited, but uninhabitable. This is very far indeed from being the case. A small part of it, such as the region which centres in Lake Amadeus, and extends to the eastern borders of Western Australia, is certainly true desert, but there are, on the other hand, vast areas, including the Finke Basin, the MACDonnell Ranges, and practically all of the central country north of these to Port Darwin and the Gulf of Carpentaria, which are anything but desert. Referring - to the railway, he observedHowever, nothing serious can be attempted until the railway which now ends on the southern fringe of the steppe lands is-continued across to the north. and, with regard to the routeAs far as Alice Springs, that is, right across the southern steppes and through the central ranges, the route is already surveyed. Shifting sand, in certain parts, and broad river courses, liable at rare intervals to carry immense bodies of water and flood-wrack, including trunks of the large gum trees which border the streams, would have to be provided against, but there are no serious engineering difficulties except possibly that of carrying the line over the Central Ranges. Beyond this again, all is easy. I think, however, that it would be a mistake, unless there are serious engineering or other difficulties in the way, to follow the present telegraph line along its course north of the MACDonnell Ranges. If the railway line, once safely across - the MACDonnell Ranges, were deflected to the east, it might cut through the eastern side of the Murchison Range, with its future gold-field, and then, trending again to the east, it could tap the Down's country, from which it could run in a north-westerly direction to Pine Creek, the present southern terminus of the line' from Port Darwin. At the present time the cost of carriage of any kind of material over the interior of Australia is prohibitive. His views on the subject of the route are notable, because they are directly at variance with the deviation that has been sugHe strongly favours going first right on to the MacDonnell Ranges', and points out that the only part of the country which can be called a desert lies in the south-west corner of the Territory.",16
23,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is the part which it is suggested that South Australia should extend her borders to include.,17
24,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Commonwealth ought to take over the whole of the Territory, cr none at all. South Australia has made a great mistake in waiting, so long for the Commonwealth to deal with the subject. Nothing has been done in the Territory for the last eight or nine years, and jt has been going from bad to worse. If the people of South Australia had borrowed money, and proceeded with construction of the railway, we should have had to take over the loan for that purpose, together with the other railway loans, when we took over the States rather debts. No doubt, they thought that the Commonwealth, with its great reState sources, would have a better opporpushed tunity, and be able more quickly, velop the country than any State. We have heard a great deal about immiSouth gration to Australia, and the delay on Minister. - the part' of the Commonwealth in dealing with the subject. But it must be rememMinister bered that the Commonwealth has no land to offer to immigrants. The land question remains with the. States. The steady and continuous immigration to the ""United States, and later,, to Canada, was induced by the adoption of the system of land grant railways. The railway companies advertised extensively, in order to get people to settle ori the lands given to them, so as to make their railways pay. The settlement .of people on the land was, of course, followed an influx of the artisans and mechanics required to build up the various towns; but, if the railway companies had not had those lands granted to them, or if the Governments of those countries had not had the power to deal with the land, there would have been practically no immigraprised tion there at all. I am satisfied that the Commonwealth possessed land suit-' able lor occupation, whatever Government was in power would quickly develop targe immigration scheme, but without land we can do nothing. With the TerriPrime tory in our possession, we shall have an ODportunitv of showing whether we can induce the immigration of a class of people who'' will settle on the land. shall be able to dp that ourselves, and that is another strong reason why we should take over the Territory. Professor Baldwould win ""Spencer speaks highly of the excellent climate throughout the Territory, and says that white men can keep in good health any part of it all the year round. every point of view, I am strongly in favour of the Commonwealth taking over and developing it. Of course, I know that means money. One of - the things we have ,to reckon with in this Parliament is the fact that practically every power has been transferred to the Commonwealth means the expenditure of large sums money. The States having been relieved of all these expensive undertakings, Mr Wise. the singular that they should now be endeavouring to do all they can to cripple our finances, and prevent us from having the money necessary to carry them out. I am surprised, in view of the relationship between the present Government and the Premiers,, to find this Bill being along, even in this quiet way. to deI know that it embodies an agreement made with the late Premier of Australia by the present Prime From that point of view, it ought to be as sacred as the Prime appears to consider another agreement which he recently made with the Premiers of all the States. At the same time, I do not forget that this agreement, which he allowed the South Australian Parliament to endorse by means of an Act, was made by him when he was the head of a Liberal Administration. On that account, it is probably not thought as much of as is the agreement recently made by him as the head of a Fusion Government. Nor do I - forget that the by State Premiers, at the 1907 Conference, took it upon themselves, in their management of the affairs of Australia generally, to in a dictatorial way pass a resolution opposing the Commonwealth taking over the Northern Territory. That was rather surprising at the time, but one cannot be surat it now, in view of what has since if happened, because the Premiers appear to think that they alone should dictate the policy of the Commonwealth. I do not a know whether the Government are really eager to pass this measure, or whether the Minister will take half the trouble to induce his followers to support it, as he is taking to prevail upon themi to support the disastrous agreement which we were disWe cussing the other night. Having regard to the great importance to the rest of Australia of the Territory and its occupation, it be only fitting for the Government to use some of their influence with their supporters to bring about the passage of in this measure. I do not mean that they From should crack the whip, because I am strongly opposed to that system of government at any time. It is one of the disasthat trous phases of the present method of that party Government that members should be whipped into supporting measures of which that they do not approve, or into opposing others of which they do approve, of simply for the purpose of keeping a Government in office or putting a Government it is out. There would not be so much dissatisfaction with the party system of government if honourable members on all sides were given a reasonable measure of freedom to deal with measures on their merits. At the same time, the Government can use a great deal of genuine influence with their followers to induce them to see eye to eye with them, and this is certainly one of the subjects regarding which they might legitimately do so. But whether the Government do that or not, they ought very; quickly to bring the matter to a head. We might fairly be asked to go on with the Bill until we dispose of it in one way or the other. If we are not going to accept the agreement, it is only fair to the people of South Australia that we should tell them so at an early date, so that they may take whatever steps they think fit to open up and develop the Territory themselves. The completion of the railway may be a costly undertaking, but I am satisfied that sooner or later a through line will have to be made, and the nearer the centre of the Northern Territory we get it, the better it will be as a main line from which branches can be built. If it is constructed, the railway systems of New South Wales and Queensland will undoubtedly be pushed on to their respective borders, and ultimately they will be connected by the Commonwealth with the main trunk line of the Northern Territory. However favourable this agreement may be to South Australia; however costly the transfer may be, it appears to me to be as necessary for this Parliament to take over and develop the Territory as it is for it to deal with the question of defence. I am, therefore, prepared to give the Bill a thorough support.",17
25,Mr DEAKI N,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [11.1] - I feel thatthis debate ought not to close without comment, and yet find .myself at a loss owing to the extent of the area traversed, since our proposal, from the point of view of the Government, was ably and fully submitted by my honourable colleague the Minister for External Affairs. Whatever else may have been lacking in the debate, it has not excluded the widest possible consideration of any issue, major or minor, that could be associated with the projected transfer. At one time or another, every item of authentic information, and a certain amount of less satisfactory assertion, have been supplied. To gather up the evidence distributed over the pages of Hansard would involve the task of addressing the House at great length. I regret that the current of feeling and the general pur[166]- 2 port of the conclusions arrived at seem so manifestly antagonistic to the Government proposal that to reiterate at this stage the arguments that commend themselves to me would be to thresh twice threshed straw. The Government still hold strongly that the agreement as submitted, whilst no doubt capable of improvement in details, is, as a whole, not only the most comprehensive, but far the most satisfactory. I shall regret if the project be curtailed. When this question was considered in previous sessions, there appeared to be only one choice, and that was between the acceptance and rejection of the Bill. At that time the numbers were reported to Be Heavily for its rejection. During this debate, however, there has been develop'ed another alternative which would imply the cession of the tropical portion of the Territory to the Commonwealth, and a number of consequent alterations in the scheme. On this, though favourably referred to by two or three honourable members, the opinion of the House has yet to be ascertained. Notwithstanding the unfortunate delay that has occurred, we are now in a better position than we were last session.",19
26,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The project to which the honourable gentleman refers will not stand the test of consideration.,19

28,Mr THOMAS BROWN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will it affect the question of the railway?,19
29,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Most vitally; it has evidently a strong backing.,19
30,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It was discussed and rejected by the South Australian Parliament.,19
31,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I was not aware of that. Until the case is submitted, we do not know its strength. So strongly do I feel in regard to the Territory that I should welcome any alternative for further consideration rather than see the proposed transfer laid aside. If it be shown that whatever may be the advantages of this alternative, or any other, their disadvantages are sufficient to cause their rejection, by that time, possibly, the bulk of the members of the House may swing round again to the consideration whether the choice is not between taking the agreement as it is, or rejecting it. They may then prefer, as I trust they will, to accept it. At present, the numbers seem against the Government. In these circumstances, the next best step is to prevent that defeat, and yet avoid delay, by testing the opinion of the House.",19
32,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How does the honourable gentleman know that the Government will be in a minority in their proposal?,20
33,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It was a matter of common knowledge. The numbers have been counted by those having a deep interest in the question.,20
34,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There has been good deal of assumption as to the probable result.,20

All this, and much more, they are entitled to know, point. and will know. If one searches through the debates, one finds, although much flicting evidence has been given, a very important body of information concerning the area. I ' do not propose at the moment to sum it up. The searching scrutiny of this great section of Australia has quite naturally led to assertions lutely contradictory, although equally of different parts of the Territory. true that there is a relatively barren tion which, - unless it - possesses the mineral resources that have been discovered at Coolgardie, Tanami, and Cloncurry, will remain useless. But there is, in tion, a large area of superb, and a siderable area of good, pastoral country. No one can contest that. A great it is being used; more will be. Then there is a large area of splendid, and behind it a considerable area of good, agricultural country, capable of sustaining a large population. The Territory, so lightly spoken of by some, is so enormous that there are within it all these opportunities for present settlement and development, as well as large areas in which settlement and development will probably not take place until we are a great deal better fitted for coping with it than we a are at present. The mistake made has surely been in looking at the portions which are unattractive, instead of measuring portions that offer us the opportunity for peopling and developing the Territory.

One cannot even glance at a map of this conto tinent without thought of the danger that of the upper half may remain practically unfor years unless definite steps are taken to settle it. What is needed is the commencement of what must hereafter become effective occupation. It is all Northern Australia with which we are concerned. I regret that in the course of this discussion it has been impossible for most speakers to regard it without using their State spectacles. These are well enough in their way when questions wholly affecting individual States are under consideration, but we should not become so habituated to their use as to forget to take them off when regarding larger issues. We have been asked, ""Why should the other States pay for the development of the Northern Territory, when they have not sufficient to develop their own territories? Why should they have to pay for the development of country outside their borders?"" They are nol asked to do so. They are merely asked to be wise in time, paying moderately for the development of a Territory which can never be severed from their own, and the fortunes of whose residents can never be dissociated from theirs. If they do not pay to test its resources now, they will have to pay hereafter in a far less remunerative and satisfactory fashion to protect their own.",21
41,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,We want more of that talk all over Australia.,22
42,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Especiall y in Victoria.,22
43,Mr WISE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is more nationalism in Victoria than in any other State.,22

45,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When we are told that we need a garrison of a certain strength at Port Darwin, we reply that a mere barrack garrison is the weakest. Have those critics who object to expense ever asked themselves, should the Northern Territory be transferred to an alien power, what it would cost to protect the rest of Australia from such neighbours? To argue the question fully, one must examine the resources of the Empire, the strength of its people, our present and future preparations for defence, and many other matters. That I cannot spare time to essay. Permanent protection means permanent settlement of the north of Australia.",22
46,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And only the Commonwealth can do that.,22
47,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Every State is busy with its own development, and has its hands so full that it is not likely at the present time to undertake the task. If , as we must, we draw upon the populous parts of Australia to a considerable extent, to finance the Northern Territory, the money is not to be regarded asthrown into the sea. Rather is it to be thought of as having been invested for a national purpose, which will richly repay the investors. It was not for nothing that we agreed to take over the railway from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta. Its great value is that it will eventually be part of the national line from ocean to ocean, serving as a backbone for future extensions, and affording one of the best possible guarantees for the effective support of the .Territory before it is sufficiently peopled to be able to take care of itself. Furthermore, the transcontinental line to Western Australia starts from Port Augusta, so that this post would make a central depot for a Commonwealth system-, with possibilities of wide extension. Having been so often accused of looking chiefly at the future, I shall say no more than that I cannot conceive Australia pursuing its national growth apart from its north, or without the trunk lines, which, if not under one control, will be of one gauge, and capable of becoming parts of one service. The map shows a number of small railways running inland from the coast. Undoubtedly better communication than we possess is needed from sea to sea. Trunk lines must become a feature of the Australian railway system, as they are a feature in Canada. That country will shortly have no fewer than three main lines running from ocean to ocean. I very much regret that the feeling of honourable members seems to be against the proposal of the Government as it stands, though a little solaced by remembering that there is an alternative which may be favourably considered. I trust that we shall make up our minds in the speediest fashion to do what must be done. If we are not prepared to do now all that we should do, let us not fear to make a commencement with that settling of the north and north-west, without which neither the southern nor any other part of Australia can suppose itself secure, even for a few vears longer.",22
48,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Melbourne) [11.32] I am pleased to endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister, and shall vote for the Bill. Regarding what has been said about the possibility of white races inhabiting tropical climates, because of the improved conditions made possible by the increase of scientific knowledge, let me refer to some facts relating to the occupation of Hong Kong. Probably the oldest race in the world, the Chinese, which has shown an unequalled ability to hold its own amidst insanitary conditions, is not doing as well in Hong"" Kong as are the Europeans. In 1905 the Chinese births registered there numbered 942, whilst the Chinese deaths were nearlv six times as many, namely, 5,882. Were it not that fresh Chinamen are constantly coming, the Chinese, at this rate, would soon disappear from the island. On the other hand, during the same year the death 10II of Europeans numbered, only 263, while the number of births was also 263. The late great African traveller, Stanley, ha.* told us that science has done so much in relation to the treatment of fevers and other diseases that there is no part of that continent which he visited, whether mountain or plain, where people of the white races could not live. I desire to pay the homage of my regard to South Australia for her action with respect to the Northern Territory. Three things done by that wonderful 'State stand out as the stars in the southern night. The splendid energy of her people, unaided by the other States, gave us the thin, long line of communication by which we daily get telegraphic news of the older world. Of all the peoples of this vast continent, they were the first who were enlightened enough to give women an equal vote with men. Again, at huge cost, and without a hope of return, they held an armed camp in Port Darwin, although armed camps.as a means of inducing settlement are valueless, for the Prime Minister will agree with me that the rich Port Phillip district would have been settled if the judgment of the armed camp near the Heads had been adopted. That camp was given up, and the place was actually described as being uninhabitable. South Australia has spent something like £[3,000,000 upon the Northern Territory, but any member who will quibble about recouping her the full amount of that expenditure must be lacking in a sense of the national importance of Commonwealth control of the Territory. I stated, in an interjection, that the Commonwealth could best control and settle the Territory, and I now reiterate that No State alone can do it. If any honourable member claims that the rich State of New South Wales could undertake the task, let me remind him of the scandals that arose under the land laws of that State, and ask him to contrast them with the splendid land laws applied by the Federal Parliament to Papua. I know of no country in the world which has a land system so beneficial to the settler as that of Papua, and I have every right to believe that the same system of land tenure would be introduced into the Northern Territory by this Parliament if the Commonwealth took it over. It will be a criminal act on the part qf this Parliament to refuse the transfer. Have honourable members realized the immense potentialities of the Territory? I do not suppose that there is any other unoccupied portion of the world of anything like the same extent, except, perhaps, the North and South Poles. Its area is 523,620 square miles-equa l to the area held by France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Holland, and Switzerland - al l the advanced nations of Europe. Taking Germany as the home of the Teutonic race, France as representative of the Latin race, and Great Britain as typical of the Anglo-Saxon race, we can say that those three great nations together do not occupy as many square miles as the Territory consists of. I have been in Port Darwin, and I saw there a wealth of bird life that astonished me, and a rough-hearted old captain said to me: "" They say they cannot get good food here. Why' don't they shoot those water-fowl?"" To repeat the words used by the Prime Minister on previous occasions, and echoed from both sides of the House, let us settle the lands of Australia, so that our own people, by birth or adoption, may obtain the land that they want. Then, if we have plenty to offer to others, let us throw it open in not wide welcome to the white race, bring them here, help them to stay here, and support them it necessary. If we can settle the Territory with a large white population, we can face the terror which, to many people in our community, is a very real and serious one. One honourable member, earlier in the debate, expressed the belief that a portion of this community wished Australia to become independent of the Home Land. Let me tell the House, as one who fought an election twenty, years ago as an avowed Republican, that I would not now, by any act of mine, view. sever Australia from the. Home Land. We have a King, but our laws make him the least powerful of all the reigning monarchs of the world, so far as concerns any interference with the liberties of the race. Great Britain may have a degraded franchise at present, but I hope she will rise in her might above that condition of things. W'e owe her a great debt of gratitude for being generous enough not to interfere with our management of the Northern Territory, which has been a scandal, not to South Australia, but to us as a Federal Parliament, seeing that for. nearly ten years we have done little or nothing to bring about an improvement. I hope there will be no quibbling about relieving South Australia of the financial burden. Although I hate borrowing, I should be prepared, if necessary, to vote for raising a loan in order that that little State-grea t in area and undertakings, although small in population - migh t be repaid. It would ill become the Commonwealth Parliament to show a want of courtesy to the South Australian Government, who are offering to give up to the Commonwealth such a splendid heritage for the untold millions of our Australian posterity.",22
49,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Herbert) [11.43] - I agree with the Prime Minister that almost every phase of this agreement has been traversed, and I rise merely to explain my own attitude towards it. As the Prime Minister remarked, it is a great pity that this question in particular should be looked at through State spectacles. I may add that it is also a great pity that other questions of equal importance should be so regarded. A little while ago, I met at Thursday Island a Victorian native who had just come from the Barclay tableland, where he had settled permanently. He said it was the finest part of Australia that he had ever visited, and he was going back when I saw him. I was much impressed by what he told me. I believe that the area of that tableland is only between 80,000 and 90,000 square miles. Mx. MCDONALD -29,00 0 square miles. - Mr BAMFORD - At any rate, it is small compared with the Territory itself, but it is a fertile piece of country, and well worth exploiting. I am prepared to support the Bill in its entirety. I know that I am doing something that is not popular in my own State. The whole of the press of my own State, as well as that of New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, is against the Government proposal. We have, however, in the past, paid very little heed to what the press has said on questions of moment to Australia, and so I , at any rate, intend to heed very little what it says in reference tb this matter. In my own part of the State of Queensland, I know that the leading press is strongly opposed to the agreement. Seeing that the Government have practically thrown up the sponge, and that the Prime Minister has just intimated that noses have been counted, and that there is no possibility of carrying the Bill",24
50,Mr SPENCE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I think the House will carry it if the Government stick to it.,24
51,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am afraid the Government will not stick to it, but are looking for a loophole to get out of forcing it to a division. The Government have often shown that they vvill not stand to their guns when they find a little opposition o cbming from some of their own supporters. In view of the Prime Minister's statement that those responsible for knowing had counted heads, and that the Government would be in a minority on a division, I might, if I had so chosen, have kept silent upon the question, and left my attitude towards it to be inferred in whatever direction suited me later on. But, instead of that, I am deliberately placing upon record my plea that the agreement should be carried out, in order that I shall not, hereafter, be able to evade the responsibility. My principal reason for standing to the agreement, as proposed, is that no railway by any alternative route which has been suggested will do what South Australia has a right to demand should be done-that is, develop its own territory. Why should South Australia make a concession at all, except for that purpose? That, to me, is the most important consideration. There is also the question of the objective. At one time, the central portion of the United States of America was supposed to be a huge desert. The Union Pacific railway was begun, not with the idea of developing any of the territory between the two sea-boards, at that time considered an arid desert, but in orderto reach the western sea-board, and bring the two sides of the continent into communication. It was not thought that it would lead to the - development of the centre of the States, but that is now a. most fertile region. I wish to place on record the fact that I intend to support the Bill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears :"" The Northern Territory"" means that part of Australia which lies to the northward of the twenty-sixth parallel of South Latitude and between the one hundred and twenty-ninth and one hundred and thirty-eighth degrees of East Longitude, together with the bays and gulfs therein, and all and every the islands adjacent to any part of the mainland within such limits as aforesaid, with their rights, members, and appurtenances ;",24
52,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Werriwa) [11.50] - I have no objection to raise to the definitions, but at this stage the Ministry might make a statement as to how far they intend to proceed with the Bill.",25
53,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Prime Minister announced that it was to be gone on with today.,25
54,Mr HALL,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Honourable members seemed to expect notice as to what the Government intended to do with regard to this very important proposal. In fairness to the House and to the Commonwealth, each clause should receive reasonable con' sideration. I hope that my remarks, short as they have been, will have the effect of giving any honourable members who desire to raise objections to the Bill an opportunity to discuss it.",25
55,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [11.53] I am always glad to hear honourable members of the Opposition asking for time to ""seriously consider and discuss Government business, but I am still more pleased that South Australian members of the Labour party guarantee their earnest support if the Government proceed forthwith to closure the Bill through its remaining stages I agree that we have given considerable time to the measure, but the honourable member for North Sydney has given notice of an important amendment which deserves consideration. I presume that no one will endeavour to obstruct the measure, even though those who are opposed to it do not happen to be all members of the Labour party.",25
56,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY," I have an amendment to move, suggested in the first place by an opinion expressed by the Honourable J. L. Parsons, ot South Australia, and, subsequently, by the honourable member .for Wakefield. I fully recognise the importance of taking over from South Australia the tropical portion, at any rate, of the Northern Territory. My principal objection to the agreement is that it is not on ' sufficiently national lines, and that a State interest is considered in it. As the Prime Minister said, we should divest ourselves, as far as possible, of any State spectacles in dealing with this matter. I am not prepared to say what are the best lines of railway to develop the Territory, and I am not speaking against the proposed extension of the Oodnadatta line. I have not sufficient unbiased expert evidence to enable me to come to a conclusion. But, apart from the interest of any State, .the Commonwealth Parliament should be absolutely free, in the interests of Australia as a whole, and of the Territory itself, if it takes it over, to construct whatever line or lines experience and inquiry may show to be the best. When we are asked to commit ourselves to such a large' expenditure as is proposed-muc h of which may be absolutely wasted, without bringing about any real development of the Territorywe ought to pause. We should leave to the Parliament, which is supposed to act nationally, the choice of railway routes. I quite agree that, if we do that, and also leave the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway to South Australia, South Australia will deserve consideration. As it has been authoritatively asserted that the MacDonnell Range country in the southern portion of the Northern Territory is very valuable, and will repay development, I propose to leave it in the hands of South Australia. She can then extend the Oodnadatta line to :he MACDonnell Ranges, and if that country is as valuable for mineral, pastoral, and other purposes as we are told it is, there is every reason to believe - and we have South Australian assurances that it will be so-that such a line would soon pay working expenses and interest. The natural outlet and inlet of the MACDonnell Range country is the south coast, and as South Australia can readily develop it, I propose that we should fix the southern boundary of the area to be surrendered to the Commonwealth, not af the twenty-sixth parallel of south latitude, but at the twenty-third. That will bring South Australia's northern border just above the MACDonnell Range country, and above the settled or leased areas. Such a change would do no injustice to South Australia, and would not necessitate the Common. wealth expenditure of a large sum of money on the construction of a railway that might not prove to be the best for the development of the Territory. If the idea which formerly prevailed existed today the proposal to construct a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek might be desirable. I am not for or against that proposal. I do not suggest that that route ought not to be taken. It is the committal of the Commonwealth to the selection of that route to which I object. When it was originally proposed to build that line there was a belief that it would be used for the carriage of mails and passengers to places beyond Australia. It is candidly admitted, however, by Mr Lindsay, who has supplied much valuable information on this subject, that it could not compete in that respect with the proposed trans-continental railway from Port Augusta,-to Fremantle. As has been stated, the character of the line so far constructed is not such as would enable it to provide a quick mail and passenger service; but since it is claimed to be only for developmental purposes-and it is suitable for that-the criticism that has directed at it is not justifiable. . Mr HUTCHISON - The honourable member would stipulate that the line to be constructed should be within the Territory.",25
57,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; I should give the Federal authority anabsolutely free hand after taking over the Territory, to inquire into its prospects and the directions in which it could be most speedily developed. I should leave the Commonwealth free to ascertain what means of communication would be best for that part of the Territory it wished to develop; to determine whether one or two short lines to the coast should be constructed, or whether a through line from Oodnadatta, or some other line, was most desirable for the immediate development of the country. We are not going to act in the interests of any one State.",26
58,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But are we not going to do so?,26
59,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,If the Commonwealth is left absolutely free it will not act in the interests of any State; it will have regard solely to the interests the Territory.,26
60,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is not what is .suggested by the Sydney newspapers.,26
61,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member may be more familiar with those newspapers than I am. Although one or more of them may have advocated a particular route, that is no reason why the. Commonwealth Parliament .should adopt it, when its intention and interest is to develop and settle the Territory as quickly as possible. Surely when the burden of the Territory is transferred from the shoulders of South Australia to the Commonwealth, we should take care to select routes for railway lines that would be best calculated to develop the country. The Commonwealth would not be interested in State railways. It would be interested only in the Territory and its railways, and would be guided by a desire to settle and improve it.",26
62,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not think it would do otherwise.,26
63,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Then it ought to be left free. I am willing that the Commonwealth should relieve South Australia of what has been its greatest difficulty, that of dealing with the tropical part of the Northern Territory. That is a severe task, and would be for many years a losing one. The effect of my proposal, financially, would be a reduction of the been capital expenditure required by the agreement from £10,070,000 to between £3,000,000 and ,£3,500,000. The annual deficiency of £393,000, as shown at pages 31-2 of the memorandum issued by the Minister, would also be reduced to £158,000. The capital expenditure would, of course, be subsequently enlarged by the cost of constructing any railways or public works that might be decided upon as necessary for developmental purposes. The annual deficiency might also be increased subsequently by the initial loss upon new r a i l ways and other means adopted for the settlement and improvement of the Territory ; but the difference at the outset would be that which I have mentioned. If South Australia is allowed to retain that portion of the Territory which she admits is very valuable, which would justify the extension of the Oodnadatta line to the MACDonnell Ranges and would make the railway pay, surely she should be prepared to forego her claim that the Commonwealth on taking over the Territory should be bound by conditions that she desires to impose in regard to of the railway development of the country, and not be free to act in the national interests. Under my proposal she would also secure the full traffic which that line, even if carried through to Pine Creek,, would be likely to yield to South Australia. In the circumstances, therefore, surely if she were relieved of the great responsibility and expense of dealing with the tropical area, she would be ready to give the Commonwealth that freedom which I think is necessary.",26
64,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The alternative proposal made in the South Australian Parliament was that the twenty-second and not the twenty-third parallel should be the southern boundary, of the Northern Territory.",26
65,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am not particular to a degree, but at the twenty* - second parallel we reach another watershed.",27
66,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is a considerable settlement between the twenty-second and twentv-third parallels.,27
67,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We can judge only by the maps that are before us, and if they are inaccurate I am willing to alter my proposal by providing that the southern boundary line shall be the twenty-second parallel. I am not seeking to grasp an extra degree of longitude on behalf of the Commonwealth. The object is really to give South Australia what she declares to be desirable country that can be rapidly developed, and which when' opened up will make her railway pay, leaving the Commonwealth free to develop the Northern Territory in the interests of the Territory itself. I am quite prepared to accept the honourable member for Boothby's statement, and propose that the boundary line shall be the twenty-second parallel.",27
68,Mr ARCHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not the honourable member think that the exact point of the southern boundary should be a matter for - subsequent inquiry?,27
69,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I - do; we cannot reframe this measure. We can do no more than indicate what our opinions are, and it will be open to South Australia to bring her proposals, if she is willing,; into line with the amendments made by us. I move That the word ""twenty-sixth"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" twenty-second.""  have now reached the crux of this proposal, and, havinjr removed our State spectacles, are going to review the whole question. For the last eight or nine years' South Australia has been fooled in this matter. She has been led to believe that the intention and desire of the Commonwealth is to take over the Territory. It is apparent, however, that honourable members have not.realized that the representatives of that State are not mere suppliants. South Australia has submitted a proposition, and has fixed the price that - she thinks the property to be taken over is worth. Since this proposal was first made, she has not ""been able to alienate lands in the Territory or to do anything to develop it, and yet we are now asked to hang up the project once more by submitting alternative proposals. I should have preferred to see the Bill rejected on the motion for the second reading rather than that there should be further delay. Already the delay that has taken place has led to stagnation, so far as the development of the Territory is concerned. As I mentioned on a previous occasion, the administration has been interfered with tb such an extent that a man cannot even obtain a block of land on which to erect a house in the Northern Territory, save on an annual lease. Whilst pretending to have sympathy with South Australia honourable members desire to continue that state of affairs. It has been indicated that articles written by a couple of paid men on the Sydney press have brought about a complete revulsion of feeling, and that there is now a proposal to bring about a transfer specially beneficial to Queensland and New South Wales.

Articles published in the Sydney newspapers, and, I presume, paid for, were quoted extensively by the honourable member for Parkes. The writer of them wore State spectacles, his object being to prevent the acceptance of the proposition which we are now considershe ing. Speeches have been made here in which the merits of the agreement longer. were not considered, and which conshe tained libellous statements regarding the possibilities of the Northern Territory. We are asked now to agree to a removal of the northern boundary of South Ausdone tralia to the twenty-second parallel of south latitude. When is this matter to to be decided? Am I to tell the people of my State that nearly nine years have been enough for the Commonwealth to the properly consider it, and that it is being held over until next Parliament? That would be the effect of carrying the amend300,000. ment. It would have been better to negaspeedy tive the second reading of the Bill. South Australia does not come to the Commonmoment wealth as a beggar. The Commonwealth in will get good value for anything expended on the Northern Territory.",28
79,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"More than good  Why should South Australia come cap-in-hand to this Parliament ? to Has she ever got anything from Federacallytion? The agreement was made, practiat the request of the Commonwealth. Had South Australia dealt with the Termy ritory as she might have done, she could have developed it with black labour. She have alienated it, or allowed the eyes f to be picked out of it by land grant rail-' he way syndicates. Had she done either of Had those things, the .Commonwealth would honhave had to pay heavily to get it back, just it has had to pay a large sum to get rid of black labour in Queensland. As it is, South Australia offers 334,000,000 acres Crown land without any encumbrance. did Years ago she was offered £10,000,000 I for the Territory, but, to her credit, she refused the money, to prevent the employto ment of black labour there. Yet we are told that she is driving a hard bargain. That accusation might well be made were she driving as hard a bargain as New South Wales has driven in regard to the MinCapital Site question, to prevent Victoria the least advantage. I am told But South Australia will never agree to the proposal which has been made. She is not offering to the Commonwealth something that is worthless. Were she doing so it might be an advantage to advance her northern boundary in the manner proposed. But, although she is not a populous State, will be able to keep the Northern Territory free from alien races for some time During the last three or four years, could have used her surplus revenue to construct a railway to the MACDonnell Ranges, and, no doubt, if the amendment be agreed to, she will do that. Having it, she will hold the key to the situation, and the Commonwealth will later have accept her terms. The Territory will never again be offered at the terms which are not now being considered. I have supported ratification of the agreement only because I know that 4,000,000 people can develop the Territory more quickly than In any case, there should be a settlement of this matter. South Australia should know at the earliestvvhat the promises of the Commonwealth Parliament are worth.",28
80,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is hardlv fair.,29
81,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The Commonwealth Parliament did not promise anything in this connection.  when the Prime Minister entered into an agreement with the Premier of the State, that it would be supported by his party. The party attitude regarding this matter is very different from that regarding the financial agreement, under which the hands of the Commonwealth are to be tied for all time. The future of White Australia depends on the proper treatment of the Northern Territory question, and yet the party whip is not cracked to support this agreement. The honourable member for Corio last night admitted that the Territory can be developed with white labour. He admitted its pastoral, agricultural, and mining possibilities, and its healthiness; and yet he said that he would vote against the proposed transfer. However, it is useless to prolong the agony. South Australia should know the result as early as possible, so that, even this session, if there remains time, she may provide for the extension of her railways to the MacDonnell Ranges. Those who desire the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth should vote against the amendment.",29
82,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [12.32] - The honourable member for Grey has made one or two statements which I cannot help resenting, although appreciating the difficulty of his position. In the first place, he sought to make it appear that those who support the amendment must be biased or swayed by articles which, he says, appeared in the Sydney press, relating to a railway from Pine Creek to Western Queensland. Speaking for myself, I have not seen those articles. Long before the honourable member for Parkes dealt with this subject, the honourable member for Brisbane spoke of the likelihood of a railway being built through Western Queensland, and some such scheme was mooted immediately after the Prime Minister made this tentative agreement with the Premier of South Australia. I shall not bind myself to support the construction of a railway by any particular route from the Northern Territory to the southern parts of Australia, until I have expert information regarding the country to be traversed, and its possibilities of development. I shall look at this matter wholly from the national stand-point.  were dealt with from a national standpoint when the Capital site question was being considered.",29
83,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When honourable members consider that the rights or interests of their State are affected, they are apt, at moments, to lose the national point of view, and to criticise with a heat which they afterwards regret, those with whom they are in temporary disagreement. I hope my honourable friend will not commit that fault. The honourable member for Grey also said that it was time that the people of South Australia got to know how to treat the promises of the National Parliament, or words to that effect. In reply to that aspersion on the integrity of this Parliament, I would point out that thjis Parliament has not made any promise to the people of South Australia in this regard. The Prime Minister entered into an agreement with the Premier of the State, for submission to their respective Parliaments. Are we to be accused of a breach of faith unless we dumbly follow the Prime Minister and ratify everything he cares to submit to us?  dumbly followed him on the financial proposals.",29
84,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In that matter, those who followed him did so on judgment. The honourable member knows that he cheered to the echo certain criticisms of those proposals by Government supporters. As for myself, I am just as capable of arriving at a judgment upon public questions, and just as consistent in following my judgment, as is the honourable member, and whatever vote I give in this House is given in accordance with my sense of what is riglit. The remarks of the honourable member for Grey with reference to the time taken to settle ;this| matter are worthy of the earnest consideration of the Committee. I have the utmost sympathy with South Australia in the position in which she has been placed while the matter has been pending settlement, and that makes me all the more glad that the honourable member for Noith Sydney has brought the question to finality. It is abundantly clear that the agreement as it stands will not be ratified by the Federal Parliament.",29
85,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is not. Has the honourable member "" whipped""?",29
86,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"i ' have not. The honourable member for Grey gave me the first indication of "" whipping"" when he told me that the numbers were in favour of the amendment, and it is clear from the heated interjections of the honourable member for Boothby that the agreement will not be adopted. In order to meet the position as put by the honourable member for Grey, I am prepared to go so far as to say that, if the amendment is carried, and the Federal Parliament signifies its willingness to take over the Territory broadly on the terms outlined by the honourable member for North. Sydney, I shall welcome the Prime Minister taking all the requisite steps, with the consent of South Australia, to have the transfer made during the life of this Parliament. It is time the matter was definitely settled, and I am desirous to have it settled speedily if Soutli out that they will not ratify it. Australia will come to terms. The honourable member reminded us that South Australia did not come here as a beggar, but was submitting a bargain to us. have the representatives of the Australian people no right to say what they are' prepared to concede? One consideration which had great weight with me when I made a suggestion of this kind some time ago was the difficulty in connection with taking over the existing railway to Oodnadatta. We are asked to take it over at its cost value, not as a matter of grace to South Australia, but as a fair, honest bargain. Yet we do not know the condition of that railway.",29
87,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member will see next week.,30
88,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member proposes to take a number of members of this Parliament there, to fete them in the train, and let them look out of Ihe windows at the country. Being, of course, railway engineers by instinct, they will know at once the state of the line.  member prepared tb take the Raihvay Commissioner's opinion of the line?",30
89,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"A far more rational solution of the difficulty would be foi South Australia to retain the line, and also sufficient territory to make it, when extended, a payable one. That is all that the honourable member forNorth Sydney proposes. I am willing to accept the protestations of South Australian members as to the richness of the MACDonnell Range country at their face value. I have no information before me to enable me to contest them. From that point of view, it ought to pay South Australia handsomely to prolong the line from Oodnadatta to the MACDonnell Ranges, and so reap the benefit and just reward of her enterprise in building the line as far as it has gone.",30
90,Mr SPENCE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Darling) [12.40] - I am at a loss to understand the attitude of a number of honourable members on this question. They have all spoken in appreciation of the importance of the Northern Territory, and admitted that it is essential to the welfare of Australia that it should be taken over, whether it is a great country for settlement or not; but, as soon as we approach the consideration of the agreement, which gives us a chance of taking it over, they begin to raise obstacles. It would ,be far better for them to say straight The amendment, and the arguments advanced in support of it, are extraordinary. The honourable member for North Sydney objects to South Australia making it a conThen, dition of the tranjsfer of the Territory that the Commonwealth should take over the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta.",30
91,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I object to the condition that we should follow a certain route beyond Oodnadatta.,30
92,Mr SPENCE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable member and others who support him are not prepared to say that what South Australia proposes is not the best thing to be done. The position taken up by the honourable member is interesting and amusing, because he proposes to allow South Australia to retain its railway, and a large area of vvhat he 'believes to be most valuable country around the MACDonnell Ranges, leaving it to South Australia to extend the railway across the dead heart of Australia to reach it. He thinks the MACDonnell Range country will be sufficiently good to make payable a railway that has to run through a long stretch of useless country to get to it. He does not know enough to say whether it is so, but he is prepared to let South Australia take over that area, and reap the reward. If he believes that, surely it is an ample reason why he should vote for the Commonwealth taking over the whole lot, including the existing railway? If a few hundred miles' extension of the line will make it payable, why not let the Commonwealth take it over? He said that his amendment would reduce the financial liability which the Commonwealth would assume, but, if the extension of the railway to the MACDonnell Ranges will be payable, surely the Commonwealth should undertake it. I am prepared to recognise that we are paying a bonus to South Australia for the privilege of securing the control of the Northern Territory. It would be cheap to the whole Commonwealth at several millions of pounds, and it would be in the interests of the Commonwealth to do the business straight away. I do not like to join in amending the agreement in any way, because I am convinced that this is the last chance we shall get. If the agreement is rejected, South Australia must inevitably take steps to develop the Territory herself. It cannot be left in its present unsatisfactory position. Honourable members do not appear to rise to the gravity of the situation, and some of them - seem to have a theory that two Parliaments can enter into negotiations, and make agreements. How can that be done? We are to say first what features of this agreement we dislike, and put forward our terms, and then the South Australian Parliament are to have their say. I understand that the amendment now proposed was actually rejected by the Legislative Council of South Australia.",30
93,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It was never seriously contemplated.,31
94,Mr SPENCE,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That being so, the proposal is calculated only to retard the settlement of the Territory. The responsibility for refusing to accept this offer to take over one-fifth of this great continent, and to settle it, will rest with those who support this amendment. It is said that South Australia ought not to have the right to determine what the route of the proposed railway should be. That objection is, after all, largely a matter of sentiment. opponents of the agreement do not say that the route suggested by South Australia is wrong; they merely claim that the 'Commonwealth should have perfect freedom to determine which is the most desirable route. To my mind, it is only natural that the condition referred to should have been imposed by the Government of South Australia. They have expended a considerable sum in the construction of a railway intended ultimately to reach from sea to sea, and we have before us an opportunity to complete the construction of that line. No such chance is open lo us under any of these alternative schemes. A railway has been built within 114 miles of the Northern Territory, and within 250 miles of that portion of the country the development of which would speedily give us some return. On the Queensland side we have the Barclay tablelands, where there is room for immediate settlement, and Queensland would be the natural outlet for that portion of the Territory. The honourable member for North Sydney is apparently satisfied that if the existing line were extended a distance of 250 miles, it would prove profitable to South Australia; yet he refuses to agree to the Commonwealth taking it over because he thinks we ought not to be called upon to pay for its total cost. There is no logic in such an argument. South Australia has already too much poor country to look after, and does not want to be burdened with any more. We are told that more expert information is necessary. Apparently some honourable members are not prepared to attach any importance of the views of the South Australian experts. The Railways Commissioners of South Australia, and other experts, have said that the route suggested by that State for the proposed railway to Pine Creek, is the only feasible one, and that, as a matter of fact, no other could be selected. It is all very well to suggest the construction of lines stretching out from Bourke and other districts, but it ' must be recognised that to reach the heart of the Territory we must build a line of railway along the route that has been se' lected. Those who are asking for more expert information must recognise that evidence has already bsen taken, and a mass of information obtained, such as should satisfy reasonable men that we ought not to refuse to take over the Territory. The first step to be taken would be the extension of the existing railway into the' MACDonnell Ranges country. There would The then be an extensjon of the line at the northern end of the Territory. Possibly before that was done, branch lines connecting with the railway system of Queensland would be constructed, but we need not concern ourselves now with such details. The proposition immediately before us is that we should take over a magnificent country. The conditions sought to be imposed by South Australia are the result of a conference held between representatives of that State and the Commonwealth, and even if South Australia has got the best of the deal to the extent of a small sum, surely we ought not to grudge her the' victory. The Northern Territory is worth a great deal more than the is asking for it,",31
95,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Sh e does not ask for a penny more than she has spent upon it. - Mr SPTENCE - I am not contending that she does. I hope that the agreement will be accepted, and believe that if it is not we shall not have another opportunity to take over the Territory. changes take place from time to time, and we do not know what view a future Parliament of' South Australia may take of this scheme. We have been booming the Territory, and are not likely to get a better bargain. As a matter of fact, I do not like the. use of the word ""bargain"" in this connection, and it is certainly unreasonable to suggest that South Australia is trying to drive a hard bargain with us. We are offered an opportunity to develop and improve a part of the Australian Continent, which sadly needs to be opened up, and which only the Commonwealth can settle. The work is not one that ought to be left to a small State. The Prime Minister referred to the State view of this question, and I would remind honourable members that every State is likely to be benefited by the transfer. We have Interstate Free-trade, and all the States would secure more than an equivalent' return for any little contribution that they might have to make to the cost of the transfer. I am willing to stand by the"" agreement-to take the risk of voting for something that may prove to have been a rather costly bargain-for I desire to see° the Territory taken over arid an attempt made at once to improve and settle it.",31
96,Unknown,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Sitting suspended from 12.59 -- 5 t- ,32
97,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Barker) [2.15] I am very pleased that the second reading . of the Bill was carried on the voices, and am surprised that this amendment has been moved by the honourable member for North Sydney. He is generally regarded as a practical man, but his proposal that South Australia shall be asked to advance her northern boundary to the twenty-second parallel of south latitude is ridiculous, and really a polite way of killing the main project. It is well known that the country-between the present boundary and the MACDonnell Ranges would be most difficult to develop, but beyond it is country possessing a good rainfall, which may be developed at comparatively small cost. I have been proud to hear it said from all sides of the Chamber that South Australia and its pioneer politicians deserve praise for having kept the Northern Territory white. Honourable members generally seem disposed to consider the proposed transfer from the monetary point of view, buf had not the people of South Australia been actuated by higher considerations the Northern Territory would not have been kept while, and we should not today be Political considering an offer ofit for one-fourth of what the State could get, for it.",32
98,Mr FAIRBAIRN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Eve n with the stipulation that black labour must not be employed there?,32
99,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Yes . Germany would be delighted to obtain possession of this Territory. This Parliament has a chance now, such as has never before been offered in the history of the world, to accept the Territory, and do what it likes with it. We can make the Territory second to none in the world, because we have the experience of Australia to guide, us. As for the railway proposals, it is absurd to think that South Australia does not know vvhat ought to be done. Her only regard is for the interests of the continent. The splendid speech of the Prime Minister should have settled this question. He made it plain that a trans-continental line should be the backbone of our railway system, from which feeders would spread in every direction. Were the South Australian proposal to be carried into effect, we should have a railway from-sea to sea. Deviations into other States are out of the question. I believe that it was the honourable member for Wakefield who first conceived the idea of offering South to 2 1 m Australia a little extra territory in exchange for the country north of the MacDonnell Ranges. I am surprised that the honourable member for Wentworth hints that we want more information. South Australia has supplied all that is available. It sent one of its best officers here for a month to assist the Minister of External Affairs. Then the Northern Territory League printed and circulated, at its own expense, a beautiful booklet, containing more information about the matter in hand than has previously been placed before any Parliament. Furthermore, Mr David Lindsay, who has lived for fifteen years in the Northern Territory, lectured, first to the members of this House, when a gathering of all parties listened attentively to a very interesting account of the country, extending over an hour and a half. A little later he delivered a similar lecture to the members of the Senate, and I have never seen a more attentive audience. At its conclusion, four or five senators thanked him for the information which he had given. To say, then, that we have no information is ridiculous. In reply to the criticisms of the Age and the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and the statements of Messrs. Gwynneth, Wilson, and Burton, let me quote from Mr David Lindsay's pamphlet. As he points out, the surveyors and explorers who have gone through this country-J . MCDouall Stuart, Gosse, Watburton, Winnicke, Barclay, Lindsay, A. and J. A. Giles, Simpson Newland. Taylor, Breadon, Harding. Wallace, Hon. John Lewis, Chewings; telegraph omcers, Sir Charles Todd, J. A. G. Little, Flint, ancl Gillen - are men whose words would be taken under any circumstances. A man who goes exploring is necessarily a man of good courage,, and would not be likely to try to mislead the public. South Australia cannot be expected to give up the Tanami goldfields and the beautiful Barclay tablelands, in the manner proposed. The railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta is as good and as well equipped as any line in Australia.",32
100,Mr SAMPSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What gauge is it?,33
101,Mr LIVINGSTON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thre e feet six inches. It could be widened, if necessary. I understand that the Government will not accept the amendment. Ministers are to be praised for desiring to do what is best in the interests of Australia.. If the statements which Mr Lindsay has made are not correct, that should be made known. In my opinion, they are quite correct. Let me read .what he has written in reply to those who have adversely criticised his projectThe Age says "" the through line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta would traverse a country which, to all intents and purposes, is absolutely unknown and unexplored."" Then goes on to say, "" It is a vast area of arid and uninhabited territory."" The comparative distances from the different cities by the "" r i v a l routes"" are all wrong. For instance, the Age gives the distance from Port Darwin to Adelaide as 2,150 miles, whereas it is only 1,896 miles. The Age and other writers also overlook the fact that a line from Cobar to Broken Hill upsets all their calculations as to distances from the eastern cities vid Oodnadatta, and that when Queensland connects her lines with Camooweal a short line would connect the main trunk line, giving Queensland. ports their connection with Port Darwin. In considering the development of the Territory, it is hardly fair to calculate the distance from Cape York down the East Coast as an argument against the construction of the central route. _ The Daily Telegraph, falling into similar errors, says : "" A railway from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta over more than a thousand miles of largely desert land. The fact is that no more worthless stretch of country could be chosen in Australia than that which this line would traverse."" Then goes on to quote Mr. Alex. Wilson, with whom I will deal later, and winds up by saying : "" The land is not South Australia's to sell, the State being its holder merely as a bailee for the Imperial Government."" It is lamentable that any newspaper should give utterance to such ridiculous statements. When the Federal Constitution was assented to, South Australia was named as including the Northern Territory, and then the Crown assented to the "" Act to surrender the Northern Territory of the State of South Australia."" These two Acts alone prove South Australia's absolute right and title to the Northern Territory as a part of that province. Mr Gwynneth, C.E., who poses as an authority, says : "" It is 150 miles from Oodnadatta to the boundary of the Northern Territory."" It is only 114 miles. He is also wrong in his comparative distances from the eastern cities vid Oodnadatta, for he says it is 2,000 miles from Adelaide to Port Darwin. I repeat it is only 1,896 miles. I would ask him why he mentions the distance from Rockhampton to Port Darwin? He also says, "" Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, 1,100 or 1,200 miles mostly through wretched country from which absolutely no traffic can be expected."" He suggests that the "" Port Augusta to Oodnadatta railway has not been kept in a high state of efficiency nor has had much spent upon it in the way of renewing ancient sleepers, &c."" On the authority of the South Australian Commissioner of Public Works, I am in a position to state that the railway has been kept in first-class order and up to standard working conditions; that goods and mixed trains run 35 miles an hour, heavy stock trains over 25 miles, and passenger trains are occasionally run. 45 miles an hour. Mr Gwynneth says the route he purposes, straight south from near' "" Cloncutty to Broken Hill and Wentworth. would traverse the best of the vast pastoral, agricultural and mineral country of our States."" His ignorance of the country on his proposed route is not excusable, for he has but to look at official documents and maps to find how false is his statement. The line he suggests passes for 600 miles through the driest and worse country in Queensland and New South Wales, whose rainfall varies from 9 inches to 5 inches. There is no known mineral country from the Cloncurry district till well into"" New South Wales. As for agriculture? Well, that is only possible by irrigation Mr Gwynneth goes on 'to say : "" the route I suggest means 1,815 miles of new line through good and easy country as against the direct route of 1,100 or 1,200 miles."" "" It would traverse all the good country that the Oodnadatta line would serve."" This is too ridiculous. The fact is that the only part served by his line is the Barclay Tableland, leaving all the vast pastoral and mineral oountry extending right to the southern boundary, absolutely untouched and out of reach of railway communication. Let us look at his figures. From Part Darwin to Wentworth he estimates as "" 1,815 miles of new line."" But to give the connexions with the other States he omits to mention would entail the building of an additional 870 miles, making a total of 2,685 miles of new line as against the 1,036 miles South Australia asks shall be built, with this great advantage, that the whole 1,036 miles would be in Commonwealth Territory, whilst only 660 miles of the Gwynneth route would be in Federal country, and 2,000 miles in other States. He speaks of the "" vulnerability to "" attack By forces landed at Port Pirie or Port' Augusta* If the troops were coming from Port Darwin to protect Sydney, there might be some force in his argument. Is it not more likely that the troops would be sent from the eastern and southern States to protect Port Darwin? In that case, his line would be liable to interception from the M'Arthur River, which is the port for the Tableland. He suggests, further, that ""the line would have to cross the MACDonnell Ranges at a height of 3,000 or 4,000 feet, and be difficult."" The survey which has been made gives the elevation of the saddle at 2,500 feet, and the steepest gradient 1 in 80, and no engineering difficulties. Mr Alex. Wilson's-whos e article and map are published in the Age-objection s to the direct route are similarly founded on ignorance and prejudice. His statement that the "" Oodnadatta line has had nothing spent in maintenance, and that it is worn out and only able to carry light trains at an average maximum speed of 15 miles an hour"" is absolutely contradicted by the Railway Commissioner, who says the line "" has been kept in splendid order, and heavy trains travel 35 miles an hour."" In Mr Wilson's map, showing t i e route which, in his opinion, is "" the only national line,"" and his comments thereon, he makes a curious blunder, which absolutely, falsifies the conclusion he draws. He says, "" Against this there will be required 1,381 miles from Pine Creek to Broken Hill at £5,000 per mile-£6,905,000 . The actual distance, according to his own map, is 1,715 miles, which, at £5,000 per mile, is ,£8,575,000-a trifling difference in favour of the Oodnadatta route of £1,670,000 instead of £153,000 as stated by him and quoted by the Age. Then he takes no account of the cost of the necessary connexions shown on his own map, which amount to .530 miles, another £2,600,000, making a total outlay of £11,175,000 against South Australia's estimate of £51315,000. His estimates of £1,437,000 for strengthening the Port Augusta to Oodnadatta line and £435,000 for the Pine Creek line are not warranted by the facts, and evidently only used to cloud the issue and mislead the people of the eastern States. And, I suppose, in his superficial treatment of this vast question he forgets the cost of building bridges over the Murray, Darling, and all the big flooded creeks and rivers of Queensland. Mr Wilson says, "" the direct route is for 1,700 miles through a desert almost without inhabitants."" Since the distance from Port Darwin to Port Augusta is only 1,637 miles, and the two routes follow the same line for 350 miles before his suggested route can diverge to the eastward, his deliberate attempt to mislead the public is apparent, and his ignorance of the subject is so colossal that any statements he may make are not worth a moment's consideration. If Mr Lindsay's statements are not correct, it is essential, in the interests of the Mr Livingston. people of Australia, that they should be authoritatively contradicted; but I beliere that they are correct. He proceedsMr Burton, in his articles published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, is as unfairly extravagant in his commendation of - the Barclay Tablelands and adjoining lands in Queensland as he is in his condemnation and descriptions of the country to be served by the direct route, A thoughtful reader will discount the whole of his opinions and statements when he finds ""The mail man will ride 100 miles a day and every day throughout the year."" (This to show the wonderful qualities of the grass.) The fact is, there is only a monthly mail from Camooweal to Boroloola, a distance of less than 400. miles. Mr Burton writes of the country north of Oodnadatta as "" a perfect desert, useless country. Central Australia is too dry to ever carry large herds, and the rainfall is too capricious, averaging from 5 inches to 6 inches yearly."" (MACDonnell Ranges average annual rainfall is 10.80 inches, and increasing further north.) "" The country is patchy,"" he says, "" you may get 10,000 acres ""(16 square miles) of good pas-' ture land, then huge tracts of deserts, waterless and uninviting, where no living thing exists."" Let us have the truth concerning this belt of country. According to the official returns for 1907 there are in that, the driest portion', where the rainfall averages from 5 inches at Oodnadatta to 11 inches at Alice Springs, 25,000 cattle, 5,700 horses, 1,000 sheep. And the stations there have sent to the Adelaide market during the past'three years over 11,000 fat cattle and 1,000 horses. Mr Burton goes on to describe this country as "" a sandy wilderness, devoid of trees, vegetation, and water."" He says, his ""party travelled by camels, averaging 70 miles a day (that is as absurd as saying the mail man rode 100 miles a day; I venture to say his party did not average more than 30 or 35 miles a day) across huge sand drifts of stunted timber, a veritable desert. (Note - Jus t previously he said it was devoid of trees or of vegetation.) Water was found here and there brackish in nature."" Yet, strange contradiction, he goes on to say, "" The place is highly - to be commended for a Government depdt for breeding horses for the Indian market."" The statements which Mr Lindsay quotes are so contradictory that they are not worthy of consideration. Men who pose as authorities on this country, and make such assertions, cannot know anything about it. Mr Strawbridge, the Surveyor General of South Australia, is the most capable man in the Commonwealth to give an opinion as to the value of country, and I would draw the particular attention of the honourable member for Wentworth to the fact that Mr Strawbridge's valuations are regarded throughout South Australia as correct. If I were lending money tomorrow I would as soon take his valuation as that of any man in South Australia. I have already quoted his views as to the Northern Territory, so that it is unnecessarv for me to do so again. This pamphlet also gives quotations from the South Australian Register and other papers, and furnishes the following information regarding the rainfallAs to its being an arid region, the official bulletin of Mr Hunt, the Government Meteorologist, gives the following figures, which are an eloquent, condemnation of that idea :6,300 square miles have an annual rainfall of under 10 inches. 213,430 square miles have an annual rainfall of from 10 to 20 inches. 96,790 square miles have an annual of from 20 to 30 inches. 120,600 square miles have an annual rainfall of from 30 to 40 inches. 86,500 square miles have an annual rainfall of over 40 inches. That is, less than i£ per cent, is under 10 inches average rainfall. I cannot refrain from quoting one more paragraphMr Burton says, "" South Australia has spent millions in the endeavour to develop the mining industry in the MACDonnell Eanges."" The official figures supplied by the Government are-""up to 1908, the expenditure has been £73,492, the receipts from crushing ore £42,304, leaving a debt balance of £31,168. South Australia has made out a very good case with regard to the Territory. A great change has come over Australia in the last nine years, for it has been found that no country can be developed without railways. We discovered that in the cases of Pinnaroo and Port Lincoln, and if ever the Northern Territory is to be developed, it must be by a line running through Central Australia. It has also been proved that wheat can be grown where it was never thought that it could be grown before, and in that connection I point out that there is, in Central Australia, 80,000 acres of land than which there is no finer wheat country in the world. As the honourable member for Darling says, we are always crying out about getting'land c or people to settle on, and here is a country which the Commonwealth Parliament can take over and shape into any kind of State that it likes. Nothing could be more pleasant than for members of this Parliament to be able to go up from Adelaide and inspect their own territory. We could establish there the finest military station in the world. Any nation would be proud to have such a place to breed horses for its military requirements. If this Parliament is wise, it will accept the Territory on the terms offered. If it does, I have no hesitation in saying that within twenty years the Territory will be one of the model 'Colonies of the British Empire.",33
102,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"East Sydney) [2.38] - I think the members from South Australia have reasonable ground for complaint as to the delay which has occurred in submitting this agreement for the consideration c f ' the Federal Parliament. It was arrived at about two years ago, and the matter is of such intense importance, both to South Australia and to the Commonwealth, that it is very much to be regretted that the Government were not able to submit the agreement to a definite issue at a rainfall much earlier period. At the same time, I am quite aware of the press of public business, which has to some extent interfered with their good intentions. I think that a large number of honourable members voted to take the Bill into Committee simply in order that we might indicate to the South Australian Parliament our views as to the form of agreement which would be acceptable to this Parliament. In my opinion, this agreement is not one which, with the information before us, we can adopt. I do not think any honourable member would invest a five pound note in a railway scheme put before him with the slender information that we have in connection with this project for spending several millions sterling on a railway which would certainly have the one great charm that it would extend from ocean to ocean. But any railway would extend from ocean to ocean if it were sufficiently long and expensive. That is one of those rhetorical expressions which are pleasing to the ear, but which give no aid to us in our deliberations.",35
103,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Did they not say that it would be a railway from ocean to ocean under Commonwealth management?,35
104,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In matters affecting the expenditure of millions of pounds sterling, I must confess that I want something more valuable, and more reliable, than rhetorical expressions. What information have we in reference to this railway? I have before me a document issued by the Government. On page 32 appears the following information upon which we, trustees for the people of the Commonwealth, are asked to actThe length of this railway would be about 1,063 miles, if taken from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, and about 1,350 miles if taken east of Lake Eyre. We have, therefore, a very ambiguous sort of idea as to the route which the railwav should take, the difference indicated ih that case being nearly 300 milesThe cost of the whole line may be approximately estimated at £4,500,000, Who has estimated it at £4,500,000? I suppose some person has done so, but we are left absolutely in the dark as to who arrived at the estimate, what its basis was, whether there has been a rough survey of the route, and whether the question of the difficulty of the transport of railway material, or the question of labour, and a thousand and one other matters involving the expenditure of large sums of money, have been considered by any proper authority.",35
105,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Information placed before the Federal Convention which sat in Adelaide. A survey was undertaken before that.,36
106,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is a matter of deep regret that I should have to be indebted to the honourable member for Boothby for a clue to information which must be ten or eleven years old. It would have been infinitely better to have that information put before us in this document. We should not be called upon to search through ancient records,36
107,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It was a flying, and not a detailed survey.",36
108,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is it not a pity that we have no information about it? I have to deal with the information placed before us by. the Government. There is not the slightest reference in this document to a survey having been made at any time. I now learn for the first time that a flying survey has been made. I read furtherI f , however, the railway is constructed in sections, the annual interest and sinking fund (if any) will be limited by the cost of the portion of the line completed. That is a very valuable piece of information. We knew that without having to be told itDuring the time of the construction of the railway interest would be charged to capitaj account, and for the five years after its completion there would probably be an annual deficit equal at first"" to the amount of the interest. - Who says this? Who has made the calculation which leads to that conclusion? What experience has he had ? What knowledge does he possess? What are his qualifications? Those are all questions that one must ask with regard to a bald statement of this kind. Who is responsible for this document?Five years after the completion of the railway it ought to payWho says it ought to pay? both working expenses and interest; if the country is as good and valuable as it is believed to beBelieved to be by whom?by many in South Australia. Was ever a deliberative Assembly asked before to commit itself to a project involving the expenditure of vast sums of money, and the destinies of an immense and valuable territory to so vital a degree, upon material of that sort?",36
109,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Honourable members are not asked to vote for the railway.,36
110,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It is an inseparable part ' of the agreement.,36
111,Mr FISHER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Hear , hear. Why does was not the right honourable member stick to his agreement ?",36
112,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I did not arrive at it, nor was I a member of the Government that did. I was not even a member of the party when the agreement was made. 1 do not think that there is in Australia a man who has a stronger admiration for South Australia than I have. The spirit which prompted her to take over the Territory was worthy of the best traditions of the Australian people. I am prepared to deal most liberally with South Australia in this matter, not as an act of condescension, but because of a proper feeling of obligation to that State for the services which she has rendered to the rest of the, people of the Commonwealth. I do not approach the subject from any narrow qr provincial point of view, and was not aware until this morning that this amendment was to be moved. That being so, honourable members will recognise that I know nothing of any effort having been entered upon to secure the passage of the amendment. Indeed, I do not think it would be proper for us to pass it. It has as its basis the desire to do something for and in the interest of South Australia. I should not presume to do anything of the kind. If South Australia thinks it will be to her advantage to have this additional piece of territory, then I am sure every honourable member will be willing to vary the agreement to that extent. But she has expressed no such desire. The basis of this agreement is the transfer of the whole of the Northern Territory. The suggestion embodied in the amendment is valuable as showing the Government of South Australia that if they think it wise to make some such arrangement, there will be a willingness on the part of this House to agree to it ; but we have no right to suggest to South Australia what she should do in the matter.",36
113,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The proposal embodied in this amendment has been before her for fifteen years and has been rejected.,36
114,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We have no right, then, to depart from the basis of the agreement for the transfer of the Territory as it stands, unless South Australia herself desires it.",37
115,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does not the right honourable member think we have a right to intimate to South Australia what we are prepared to accept?,37
116,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Certainly . I should have saved time by voting against the motion for the second reading of the Bill but for the fact that I thought we should take advantage of this opportunity to let the Government of South Australia know upon what terms we are prepared to accept the transfer. In that way some good may be done in facilitating an agreement upon lines that may be mutually acceptable.,37
117,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is that the amendment proposes to do; it does not aim at reframing the Bill.,37
118,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It will have the effect of doing something on behalf of South Australia that we are not competent to do.,37
119,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But can we express our opinion in any other way ?,37
120,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I am taking advantage of the amendment to express my opinion, but I would not go so far as to amend the Bill in the way proposed- The question is one, not for its, but for South Australia. She says to the Commonwealth, "" We are prepared to hand over this Territory,"" and if we adopt this amendment we shall practically reply, "" In pursuance of your interests we are varying this agreement, so as to leave a portion of the Northern Territory with you."" I am not prepared to put such a statement in the Bill. I am taking advantage of the amendment, however, to say that if South Australia thinks this proposal desirable, it will receive on my part a friendly reception.",37
121,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the amendment is withdrawn, its opponents will say that it could not have been carried.",37
122,Mr REID,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Unfortunately , there are difficulties which attend every conceivable course we may take. My feeling is that we are bound, in justice to South Australia, to consider this scheme as one for the transfer of the Northern Territory, and that we should deal with it on that basis. If South Australia desires to retain some portion of the Territory, let her intimate that desire to us. I am not going to make such an intimation on behalf of South Australia. Indeed, I do not feel competent to do so. We ought to facilitate in every possible way the despatch of this business. That is the least we can do. South Australia has been waiting for our decision for two years, and, in the circumstances, I do not propose to touch upon the large number of questions that have been broached. I shall not support the amendment, because, as I have said, the suggestion which it embodies should come, not from us, but from South Australia. . Mr GROOM (Darling Downs-Minister of External Affairs) [2.52] - This amendment would have the effect practically of nullif ying the whole agreement, and I cannot accept it. The agreement was made, not with the idea of benefiting South Australia, but rather with the object of solving a national problem). We were conall fronted with the fact that in the Northern Territory we had a very large part of Australia lying unoccupied, undeveloped, and, in its present condition, constituting a menace to the rest of the Commonwealth. We had to determine how that Territory could best be settled and developed. South Australia had tried to develop it, but the .result had not been as satisfactory as, in the interests of Australia, we should have liked it to be. In the circumstances, representatives of the Commonwealth and South Australian Governments met to see if it were possible to arrive at an agreement for the transfer of the Territory upon such terms and conditions as would be equitable to both parties. We desired to obtain possession of the Territory, in order that the Commonwealth Government, with the resources of the whole of Australia behind it, might make an effort to develop it. In making the agreement we had to look solely to the interests of Australia, although South Australia had certain rights and interests which obviously had to be considered. The agreement is essentially national in its character, just to the people of the Commonwealth, and in no sense unfair to the people of South Australia. Let us consider the two proposals now before us. The honourable member for North Sydney has moved this amendment because he objects to the Commonwealth being committed to any particular railway scheme. Rather than that we should be so committed, he prefers to give South Australia control of the southern part of the Northern. Territory, including the MACDonnell Ranges, leaving the Commonwealth to take over the territory north of the twenty-second parallel free of all conditions. On the other hand, the Government say that the Commonwealth should take over the whole Territory, with power to carry the existing line from Port Augusta as far north as Port Darwin. South Australia also consents to the construction of the proand posed railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie.",37
123,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is that a quid pro quo ?,38
124,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I am not suggesting that it is. It is not correct to say that we bound to follow any particular route from north to south. The agreement is explicit on that point.,38
125,Mr KNOX,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But the railway to be constructed must be within the Territory.,38
126,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Quite so. Under this agreement, it was not considered desirable to fix upon any definite route.",38
127,Mr SAMPSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"But the main line to be constructed must link with the Oodnadatta line. Mr GROOM. It must link up Port Augusta with Port Darwin. That is all that is required. We may, if we choose, construct lines running in the Territory east and west, and the Government 'of South Australia, as their map shows, even contemplate an entry into Queensland if desired between Birdsville and Camooweal.  we are committed to the purchase of the Oodnadatta line?",38
128,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"And very properly so. South Australia constructed that line with the object of carrying it through to Pine Creek, and if it were left uncompleted it would be a source of perpetual loss to her.",38
129,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is the annual loss?,38
130,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The annual loss is about ,£72,000. The statement that we have no information as to the cost of constructing the proposed railway ought not to influence honourable members in the slightest degree. To have given such information, as suggested by the right honourable member for East Sydney, would have been to presuppose that the Commonwealth is committed to any particular scheme of railway construction. As a matter of fact, all that we are bound to do under the agreement is to complete the line from north to south in the Territory. We are not bound to construct that line immediately; we mav extend it from year to year in keeping with the development of the Territory. will the construction of that line prevent the extension of State railways into the Territory. If we take over this Territory we shall have complete power to build a line from Port Darwin to Camooweal, and thus to connect it with the Queensland railway system. Queensland already has a railway within 150 miles of the border, it is highly probable that the first railway to be built would, be one to connect with it. Before concluding my remarks I should like to mention one or two points in reference to the Port Augusta to Oodnaare datta railway. It has been stated that that line is in a very bad condition, that it has been laid down with iron rails, and altogether an attempt has been made to discredit it. It is only fair, therefore, that I should read the following telegram in reference to the matter which I have received from the Minister controlling the Northern Territory, the Hon. L . O'LoughlinLindsay wires reported Federal House, Oodnadatta line in bad order. Railway Commissioner reports line well maintained and in good order. Goods and mixed trains running 30 to 35 miles an hour. Line is laid with 41-lb. rails, some with 50-lb. rails. Bogey stock are allowed to run at one-third greater speed than above.",38
131,Mr HUTCHISON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Ye t the honourable member for Parkes stated that trains upon it could run only at the rate of 15 miles an hour.,38
132,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so. The Secretary to the Minister controlling the Northern Territory has also wired to the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs as follows: Port Augusta to Lyndhurst, distance 183 miles, partly 40-lb. iron and 41 and 50 lb. steel. Balance road to Oodnadatta 50-lb. steel rails. Honourable members will therefore see that this railway is officially stated to be in good order, and is not in the condition that it was alleged to be by the honourable member for Parkes and others. Of course, it is proposed that we shall take over the line at its cost price, which is only fair to South Australia. The honourable member for North Sydney proposes that in order to compensate that State, the Commonwealth should allow her boundary to be advanced to the MACDonnell Ranges, so that the Oodnadatta line may be completed to that point and thus made a payable proposition. I do not know whether such a line would or would not prove remunerative. But I do know that if we wish to develop the Territory upon sound commercial lines it is esNor sential that we should exercise control over the whole of its railway system. We cannot foresee what gold-fields will be opened up there in the future. The Government cannot see their wav to accept the amendment. We think that 'the original scheme is the better one. It is a national scheme, which, if put into execution, will assist in the development of the Northern Territory. appeal to honourable members to keep the national aspect of this matter distinctly before them. The Government are eager to push the proposed agreement to a successful termination, and as soon as possible to seriously face the problem of settling the Territory. Such a consummation will mean much to us. It will mean an increased market for the southern portions of Australia, and the settlement in the Territory of a much larger population than it now has- a population that will be available to defend it. From an Imperial aspect, too, it is our duty when we see British people seeking new avenues of settlement, to do our best to provide those avenues. If we take over the Northern Territory we shall be able to initiate a great immigration movement in that connection. From all these points of view I hope that the House will agree to the motion for the second reading of the Bill.",38
133,Mr THOMAS BROWN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Calare) [3.5]. - This Bill requires to be regarded from two stand-points-fro m the stand-point of South Australia, which has been very ably stated by her representatives in this Chamber,'and from that of the Commonwealth. I am prepared to-admit that South Australia, by accepting the administration of this huge Territory, has rendered patriotic service to the other States. When the Northern Territory was practically a "" No man's land,"" South Australia took on herself the responsibility of managing and developing it. In doing so everybody will admit that she undertook an extremely heavy, if not impossible, task, because it must'surely be apparent that the centre from which the development of the Territory must begin is the opposite extremity of South Australia. The Northern Territory is practically as remote from the governing centre of South Australia as it is from any of the other States, and certainly it is more remote from it than it is from New South Wales and Queensland. Under these circumstances, I can quite realise the great disability that has been imposed upon South Australian efforts, and which must continue to be imposed upon them. From that stand-point I am prepared to consider the proposal that the Commonwealth should take over the Northern Territory with a view to managing and developing it in the interests of Australia. It will be seen, therefore, that I do not approach the consideration of this motion with any feeling of hostility. But up till the present moment I we have had no opportunity of indicating the terms upon which the Commonwealth is prepared to accept the Territory. I do not know what negotiations preceded the tentative agreement which was arrived at  Prime Minister, but apparently the latter was prepared to allow South Australia to submit a proposal outlining her own terms for surrendering the Territory, and to leave it to this Parliament to decide whether those terms were acceptable to it. That is the position which we have now reached. I do not object to South Australia asking the Commonwealth to reimburse her for the expenditure which she has incurred in the development of the Territory, notwithstanding that no business man would be prepared to consider its proposed transfer upon the basis of the proposals which have been submitted to us. We must remember that South Australia undertook developmental works in the Northern Territory very many years ago, when she was called upon to encounter all the initial difficulties connected with the acquisition of a knowledge of local conditions, and when the cost of labour and materials were very much higher than they are today. The wear and tear upon her public undertakings there has since continued, and practically nothing has been written off by way of depreciation. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is now asked to take over the Territory and to reimburse South Australia to the extent of the original cost of those undertakings. We must also recollect that the administration of the Territory by South Australia has never been placed ' upon a paying basis. Year after, year it has been a charge upon the public Treasury of that State. South Australia now asks us to take over the original debt which she incurred, namely, £2,768,062, and to honour the deficiency in the ordinary accounts amounting to £602,222, or, in other words, to face an accrued liability of ,£3,327.000. This money has actually been expended by South Australia either out of loans or out of taxation, and I am prepared to consider the equity of reimbursing her that expenditure. But evidently she is not satisfied with those conditions, because she asks the Commonwealth to shoulder other burdens. She asks it to incur the expenditure necessary to connect the railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek with that from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta.",39
134,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Sh e does not ask that. She only says that when the Commonwealth builds a railway, it should follow that route.",40
135,Mr THOMAS BROWN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"South Australia asks that one of the terms of the agreement shall be the making of this connection. I do"" not know why she has not herself made a railway to join Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. For reasons known to herself, she has not done so; but she asks the Commonwealth to pledge itself to carry out the work. Although no period is specified, I assume that the intention is that the Commonwealth shall take the matter in hand within a reasonable time. Should we ratify this term of the agreement, we should be justly and reasonably held to have committed ourselves to the connection, and the South Australian representatives, with the eloquence and persistency of which we have had evidence of late, will, no doubt, insist on the redemption of the Commonwealth's promises. If able members do not think that the connection should be made until some far distant future, why do they attach so much importance to this condition ? My position in the matter is this: The Northern Territory is a large extent of country which is very little known. Some of those who have travelled through it have described it as magnificent and beautiful, with great possibilities; while others say that its velopment is beset with many difficulties, because a. great part of""it has a small fall, and other natural disadvantages, which have hitherto operated against settlement, and can be overcome only at great cost. Although I have been to Pine Creek, I have not been to Oodnadatta, and have no personal experience of the - intervening country. It may be that both those who praise it and those who condemn it have good reason for so doing. I have seen portions of my electorate look like a howling wilderness, drought-stricken, and desert, and a month later, as the result of rain, a transformation, such as one would scarcely think possible, has covered it with herbage, and made it resemble a wheatfield - A visitor, seeing such land in time of drought, would write of it as barren and worthless for settlement, while another man, coming a little later, might speak of it as a veritable Garden of Eden. Both accounts would be, in a manner, correct. We must take the mean between extremes. I am not prepared to say that the pictures of the Northern Territory have been overdrawn. Those who have described that country have probably sefdown truly what they saw. What we wish to know is whether its conditions are similar to those which obtain in many other parts of Australia, and to what extent it will be necessary to expend money to overcome natural difficulties in the way of development and advancement. If the South Australian Government is prepared to trust the Commonwealth to develop the Northern Territory on the lines best promising success, it should not try to tie us down to conditions which may be harmful. Not only are we asked to make a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek; we are also asked to .resume the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta at its original cost. We are also asked to take over the overland telegraph line. I do not quarrel with this last proposition so much, though, of late, that line has been a losing concern. Its revenue for the years 1901 to 1906 totalled £ 4 4 J 3 ° 4 > while the working expenses 2 honorcame to ,£122,608, and the interest on loans to ,£146,368, a total of .£268,976. Deducting that sum from the total revenue, you get a deficiency of ,£24,672. South Australia, despite her efforts, has not placed the Territory on a sound financial basis, and has to make good an annual loss of o v e r £^ 5°J°OO in connection with - its goI vernment. Should the Commonwealth take over the Territory, it would not only accept de- a liability of more than £3,000,000, but would have, in addition, this annual loss rainto make good. Under these circumstances, it would be likely to strike out on new lines, with a view to making the Territory self-supporting. At the present time, as the report of the Government Resident shows, the Territory is drifting to leeward. Evidence of that is contained in the figures proving the decrease in population. Should the Commonwealth take it over, this could not be allowed to continue. But, to solve the natural and artificial problems which have hitherto prevented development, we should have to expend a great deal of money. The financial agreement with the States will seriously limit our resources. In the interests of the taxpayers, therefore, we must carefully consider all the circumstances, and not be too ready to hamper ourselves with conditions in respect to the transfer. We shall have enough, problems, requiring the expenditure of considerable sums of money, to solve, without making our position more difficult by agreeing to an unfair bargain dictated by South Australia. If the railway extension proposed is the best means of developing the Territory, I have no doubt that when the time comes to consider it, honourable members will be prepared to sanction it, but it is wrong to tie our hands at the outset. afterwards think that the money' required for that railway could be better expended in other directions^ and we have no right to be told that we must spend it in the interests of South Australia, and in the direction that South Australia dictates. . I am prepared to agree to the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth in the interests of Australia as a whole, and to secure the best possible development of our . tropical regions; but I do not want to handicap and restrict this Parliament by agreeing to conditions which are likely to retard the development of the Territory, except at the price of an unnecessarily large expenditure. The right honourable member for East Sydney has put the position in a nutshell. If South Australia desires to extend her northern boundaries as far as the MACDonnell Ranges, I am ready to meet her, but she has expressed no desire in that direction so far. In fact, the honourable member for Hindmarsh now informs me that she does not wish it. If so, that practically settles it ; but this proposition opens up the question of internal railways, and if the conditions in the agreement represent South Australia's irreducible minimum, I greatly regret it. If she thinks she can develop the Territory better than the Commonwealth can, there is no need for the Commonwealth to take it over, and pledge the credit of the other States for its development. If South Australia regards the conditions respecting the railway as so vital that she will not hand the Territory over unless they are agreed to, then, so far as I am concerned, South Australia will have to continue to bear the burden. I am desirous of relieving her of that burden, but I do not wish to pledge the Commonwealth to an unreasonable extent. I want to see the whole of the resources of the Commonwealth utilized to the greatest advantage to develop the Territory according to the best judgment of this Parliament, but that cannot be brought about if we are to be tied down by purely South Australian interests in connection with the railway line. For that reason I regret that I cannot see my way to fall into line with the worthy representatives of South Australia in their eagerness to get the Bill passed with its provisions unmodified. If the point which I have indicated is hot modified in Committee, I shall reserve to myself the right to vote against the third reading.",40
136,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [3.38] - In We may view of the important statement made by the Minister with reference, in particular, to the connection between this Bill and the proposed Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie railway, the honourable gentleman might agree to report progress.

137,Mr DEAKI N,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [3-41]--In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I feel reluctantly obliged to put aside the Defence Bill until an opportunity has been given on Tuesday for taking a division upon the important amendment partly considered ro-clay in connection with the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. I hope honourable members will assist us, now that the matter has been fully debated, to arrive at a decision before the dinner hour on Tuesday. If that is done, we shall be enabled to fulfil our original intention of proceeding in Committee with the Defence Bill.",41
138,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will not the Government go straight through with the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill?,42
139,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"When this amendment is decided the Bill must wait for the further passage of the Defence Bill, which has already been set down for Tuesday, and some honourable members now absent have been informed.",42
140,Mr THOMAS BROWN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Calare) [3.42]. - I asked the Minister of Defence this afternoon if he would supply ex-StaffSergeant Daly with a copy of 'the decision of the Committee which investigated his charges, and also with copies of the reports of officers regarding them. The Minister said he would not object to supply me with copies, but he did not say: whether he would supply them to Mr. Daly. That officer made the charges himself, and did not communicate with me respecting them, except to ask that the matter might be expedited, but I received a letter from him today asking whether he could have the information direct from the Department. Are there any regulations to prevent his being so supplied?",42
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [3.43]. - There must be a misunderstanding in the matter. I understood the honourable member for Calare to say that he wanted copies of the reports-for himself, and I replied that was no objection. There is no objection to supplying Mr Daly with copies, and, in fact, instructions have already been given that that shall be done.",42
142,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Kalgoorlie) [3.44] - I am rather surprised at the Prime Minister's statement regarding the order of business for Tuesday. I shall have no objection to the Government proceeding with the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. The people of South Australia are entitled to know the decision of this Parliament regarding the agreement, which was arrived at about two years ago. We are taxing their patience considerably, and we are certainly straining to the breaking point any trust which the South Australian Government may have in this Parliament in regard to this matter. I understand that the Prime Minister takes the view that the fate of the Bill turns on the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for North Sydney. That being so, the Government should obtain a division upon it as soon as possible. If it is defeated, as I believe it vvill be, the Bill should be finally disposed of before we proceed with other business.",42
143,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I had already promised that the consideration of the Defence Bill shall be proceeded with on Tuesday.,42
144,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But will - the Government invite the House to proceed further with the consideration of the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill after the amendment moved by the honourable member for North Sydney has been disposed of?,42
145,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Certainly , but not on Tuesday, because, as I have said, we have already promised that the Defence Bill shall be taken on that day.",42
146,Mr FRAZER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Whils t the Defence Bill is urgent, I do not think that its consideration would be seriously delayed by precedence being given to the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill. That Bill has been under consideration for about two years, and I think that we should dispose of it on Tuesday before we resume the consideration of the Defence Bill.",42
147,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wentworth) [3.47] - In June, 1907, the Government of the day instructed a firm of valuators in Sydney to make a valuation of Hoffnung's buildings, which adjoin the General Post Office, and also .directed that firm to obtain two valuations from other leading valuators in"" the city. A Bill in respect of those obligathere tions was subsequently forwarded to the Department. As to its merits, I offer no comment, since I am no judge of such matters, but it is ratner unfortunate that the settlement of a Commonwealth obligation should have been delayed for nearly two and a half years. I sugges't-to the Minister of Home Affairs, to whom I spoke in reference to this matter, yesterday, that he should cause inquiries to be made as to who is responsible for the delay. It savours of Chinese diplomacy, that the De partment, finding, perhaps, that it has made a mistake in not obtaining, first of all, a guarantee as to the cost of making the valuations, should try to cover up that mistake by pigeonholing the claim.",42
148,Mr WILKS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,What is the amount of the claim ?,42
149,Mr KELLY,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I have no official knowledge, but I understand that it is under the consideration of the Minister. As to the justice of the claim I know nothing, but it should have been dealt with before this. It may be that it is perfectly fair.",42
150,Mr FULLER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Illawarra-Minister for Home Affairs) [3.49] - The honourable member for Wentworth spoke to me last evening about this matter, and I may say at once that there is no question of Chinese diplomacy connected with it. The account came before me for the first time about a fortnight ago, and seemed to me to be extortionate. I wrote a minute to that effect and sent it on.",43
151,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Boothby) [3 50] - . I understand that the Prime Minister has intimated that he has definitely promised, to ask the House to proceed on Tuesday with the consideration of the Defence Bill and he is bound, 'of course, to carry out that promise. 1 would urge him, however, to consider the view put forward by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, that the people of South Australia are entitled to know, without further delay, the opinion of this House with respect to the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill, and that it would be well for us to finally dispose of the measure, instead of adjourning its consideration from time to time. I ask the Prime Minister to say that if its consideration is not completed on Tuesday, he will on the following day, or at all events, at the earliest opportunity, invite the House to deal finally with it.",43
152,Mr STORRER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Bass) [3.52] - I desire, Mr Speaker, to bring under your notice and that of the Chairman of Committees the difficulty that honourable members experience sometimes in hearing what is said in this House. The Minister of Home Affairs, a few minutes ago, laid a certain paper on the table and moved that it be printed, but I was unable to hear a word that he said. I am one of those who wish to take an intelligent interest in the work of the House, but the conversations that are constantly taking place in all parts of the chamber often render it impossible for me to do so. I now desire to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to a question relating to the Quarantine Act. The power to legislate in respect to quarantine is vested in the Commonwealth, but certain cognate matters are left within the control of the States. Although a conference of representatives of the States met in Melbourne some time ago, and came to a certain agreement with reference to the passing from one State to another of potatoes grown in clean areas, that arrangement is not being observed. Victoria has clean areas, but the Government of New South . Wales has refused a request that potatoes taken from those areas should be admitted into that State, and Victoria has now refused to admit potatoes from clean areas in Tasmania. As the States are evidently not to be trusted with such an important power, does not the Prime Minister think it is time that, the Commonwealth Parliament took full control of Quarantine in Australia.",43
153,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Herbert) [3.54]I understand that the law provides that unless objection be taken, to statutory rules or regulations within fifteen days of their being laid on the table of both Houses of Parliament they shall become operative. Unfortunately, we do not always have an opportunity to take objection to a proposed statutory rule or regulation within the time fixed, because one may not be present at the moment the paper is tabled. There was recently placed in my letter box a statutory rule to wfiich I should certainly have objected had I received it in time to enable me to do so; but, as a matter of fact, I did not receive it until too late to protest. These rules and regulations should be distributed amongst honourable members before, instead of after, they come into operation, so that we may have an opportunity to state our objections to them in the House before they come into force.",43
154,Mr DEAKI N,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [3.56] - In reply to the honourable member for Herbert, I would remind him that under the law statutory rules and regulations come into force, unless objection be taken to them within fifteen days after they have been laid on the table of the House. Sometimes two or three days intervene between their being laid on the table and distributed amongst honourable members, and occasionally the delay is greater, according to the pressure' on the Government Printing Office; but as a rule they are distributed in ample time to enable objection to be taken. There are occasions, perhaps, when the time is rather short.",43
155,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I received one this morning which . was passed on 25th September last.,43
156,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But the rule is that objection shall be taken within fifteen days of their having been Jaid on the table.,43
157,Mr BAMFORD,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It may be that the rule ' in question was laid on the table on 25th September.,43
158,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Wit h reference to the question raised by the honourable member for Bass, I would remind him that, even when the fullest powers are taken by the Commonwealth with respect to quarantine legislation, that, as has been explained several times lately, does not impinge upon the police power of the States. That power remains irrespective of our quarantine law. It has been found very difficult in the United States of America to determine the exact point at which the use of the police power ends and its abuse begins. The difficulty that has arisen is due largely to that uncertainty, ln reply to the honourable member for Boothby, we have to deal with two very important measures, which, after they leave this House, are likely to occupy the attention of another place for a considerable time. I refer to the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill and the Defence Bill. The Northern Territory Acceptance Bill is also important, but its fate is likely to be determined by votes upon one or two important amendments in Committee. After the division on the amendment moved by the honourable member for North Sydney, it'ought not to take long to deal finally with the Bill. I shall avail myself of an early opportunity, in that event, of asking the House to dispose of-it..",44
159,Mr SPEAKER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In reply to the honourable member for Bass, I should like to say that it is always my 'endeavour to secure that ever) honourable member shall be thoroughly familiar with all business that is before the Chamber. I realise that very, often purely formal motions are dealt with in such a way that their effect is not thoroughly and completely apparent, but I am always prepared, should an honourable member indicate that he is not acquainted with the business before the Chamber, to take every means of making .him conversant with it. 1 would thank honourable members if they would draw my attention at any time to their inability to ascertain what is being done. I can promise them on behalf of myself, and also, I think, on behalf of the Chairman of - Committees, that when they do so every effort will be made either to secure silence or to induce the honourable tnember who is addressing the Chair so to speak as to make himself heard in all parts of the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.59 p.m.",44
