Mr ROBINSON presented a petition from the President, Vice-President, and the Executive of the Central Council of Employers of Australia, praying that the Australian Industries Preservation Bill might be referred to a Select Committee. Petition received and read. PERSONA LEXPLANATIONS .  morning's Age appears an article headed "" Other Officers."" It beginsThere is reason to believe that Colonel Robertson very strongly objects to the unauthorized ancl unwarranted use made of his name  is Colonel Robertson a personal friend of Co!onel Hoad's, but.he is above all things desirous that his last few years of service shall be free from any exploitation of his name by anti-Australian politicians-o r by any one else. Were these unreasonable questions to ask the Minister?Is Colonel Robertson shortly retiring from the command of the Second Infantry Brigade; and, if so, when? What reason does he give for retiring? Is he retiring because he objects to a proposed new appointment? It seems to me that those questions were absolutely reasonable. At all events, there is nothing unwarrantable in them-. If I cannot ask questions of the Minister representing the Minister of Defence without my action being termed unwarrantable, the sooner the affairs of the Defence Forces are left to the officers to be dealt with they like, the better. The article tinues^With regard lo General Hutton's adverse fidential report on Colonel Hoad I ask the House to pay particular attention to this passage, because yesterday, when I asked the questionDid General Hutton leave on record favourable report of the abilities of Colonel Hoad; and what was such report ? ithe Minister's reply, although the question was a reasonable one, and could easily have been answered in the affirmative the negative, was that the report was fidential. If it was confidential, and fore, not to be seen by honourable members, how did the Age arrive at the conclusion that it was an adverse report?",13
1,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"How did the member get the information? I suppose that the Age got it in the same way as did.  I got it. This newspaper article not only lies, but it slanders innocent men. It says thatOne of five persons, the names of all of whom are known to the Minister of Defence, and one, at least, of whom is a Victorian politician, can alone have given to Mr. the contents of the ex-General Officer Commanda ing's biased report. If the Age got from the Minister himself, as it says here that it did, its information that there was a confidential report, whywas it permitted to know that the report was adverse to Colonel Hoad, while that honourable information was withheld from the House? I got my information from the Age newsindustries. paper when Major-General Hutton was of leaving Australia; but, knowing the w i l f misrepresentations and lies published that newspaper, I was not sure that its. information was correct, and therefore tioned the Minister upon the subject. His reply was that the report was confidential. Nest.",14

I do not know a .state Victorian Member of Parliament who is an [30]- 2 officer, and no Victorian Member of Parliament has ever given me information about as the Defence Forces. The only information conI have was obtained from the Age, and this morning that newspaper shows that the reconport in question has not been treated as confidential, because, although the House 'has not been allowed to know the nature of its contents, a representative of that newspaper must have ibeen allowed to see it. I should not have referred to this an unmatter had the article merely concerned myself; I do so because it was a cruel thing for the writer to suggest that five men know a certain secret, one of whom must have given it to me, and to indicate or a Victorian politician as the person most conlikely to have done so.

5,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [10.41] - I thought that yesterday we had exhausted our list of grievances, but, apparently, the debate which took place then created some, and I wish, therefore, in justice to the leader of the Labour Party, Page to make a personal explanation regarding statement of mine then. Yesterday, when criticising the Government for appointing Commissioners for the investigation of certain proposals with a view to seeing if they could be nationalized, I saidWe are told by the Prime Minister, the member for Northern Melbourne, and the leader of the Labour Party that there is no power in the Constitution to nationalize these It is one of the complaints today the leader of the Labour Party that he canu l not get the Prime Minister to say whether he will help them to get the power to nationalize in one or two of these monopolies. quesI also quoted from a speech delivered by the honourable member for Bland at Crow's",14
6,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The speech was delivered, not at Crows Nest, but at Millerstreet, North Sydney. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.'-The passage which I quoted, and upon which I based member had my strictures, was thisMr Deakin's programme at present was in a of transition, if , indeed, it existed at all. That being so, the Labour Party had a right to be informed as to Mr Deakin's intentions before it entered into any agreement. The party had had no clear statement on this matter from Mr. Deakin. M.r. Deakin had declared that the question of Socialism was one for the States, and that before the Federal Parliament could deal with it there would have to be an alteration in the Constitution. Under these circum-stnnces. it was fair to ask Mr Deakin whether - he would alter the Constitution in order to make - it possible to nationalize one or more existing monopolies. I assumed from that passage that the honourable member had subscribed to the - authoritative judgment of two of the At itorneyst-General of the Commonwealth.",14
7,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,Of three of them. The honourable and learned - member for Northern Melbourne gave the same opinion before he became Attorney-General.,15
8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"-At any rate, - he gave a very emphatic expression of his opinion the other evening.",15
9,Mr WATSON,Unknown,I expressed no opinion upon the matter.,15
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I now understand that to be the case. I was wrong in assuming from the honourable member's speech that he thinks with the Prime Minister and others that this Parliament has not the power to nationalize Commonwealth industries. While making this explanation, in justice to the honourable member, I should like to add that, in my opinioni, nine out of every ten persons reading the passage which i quoted would infer from it that he subscribed to the opinion which he was criticising.

12,Mr EWING,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"The Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, Perth, has furnished the following information: The Branch Past Office at Fremantle Town Hall has .not been closed; the only alteration made is that telegrams handed into the Town Hall since the 16th May, 1906, are collected every fifteen minutes by special messenger on bicycle from the Fremantle office, and transmitted therefrom instead of from the Town Hall office. This arrangement is considered to afford more expeditious despatch than previously obtained, ancl was the ""result of a recommendation made by the senior inspector. GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S "" RESIDENCES BILL . SECOND READING.",15
13,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [10.47] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. When the Appropriation Bill came before the Senate last year, dissatisfaction was expressed that provision was made for the upkeep of two residences for the Governor General. It was then pointed out that the Senate was not afforded a fair opportunity of considering the advisability of providing two residences for the Governor General. The Minister then promised that a Bill would be introduced during the next session in such a form as to enable both Houses to. deal specifically with the question of maintaining a residence for the Governor General in Sydney, and in order to permit of the fullest and freest discussion, the Bill takes its present form. Honourable members will see that it is merely an enabling measure. It provides that the Governor General may enter into an arrangement with the Government of the State of Victoria for the use and occupation by the Commonwealth for a period not exceeding five years of Government House, Melbourne, as a residence for the Governor General, and that he may also make a similar arrangement with respect to Government House, Sydney. So far as Victoria is concerned, an agreement has practically been approved of for the continuance of the occupation of Government House, Melbourne, on the terms hitherto existing. No rent is to be paid, but the Commonwealth are liable for upOFFICE. keep and maintenance, and at the expiration of the agreement the residence and the articles therein contained are to be handed over to the State authorities in the same good order and condition as when taken over from the State. So far as New South Wales is concerned, the original agreement has expired, and after the end of this year we shall be merely, as it were, tenants on sufferance. An appropriation has been made covering the expenditure up to the end of the financial year, and since then temporary provision has been made in Supply, pending further arrangement.",15
14,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,Can the Minister tell us the cost of the upkeep and maintenance of the Governor General's residence in Melbourne ?,15
15,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"I shall furnish that information presently. We desired to enter into negotiations, subject to the approval of Parliament, with a view to continuing in occupation of Government House, Sydney, on the same terms as formerly. The Premier of New South Wales then pointed out to us that the tenancy of the residence now occupied by the State Governor was about to expire, and that it would be necessary to make fresh arrangements for the accommodation of His Excellency. They asked that an agreement should be entered into-subject , of course, to the ratification of Parliament-for a certain definite term. Five years is suggested in the Bil l because it is confidently hoped that by the end of that time some definite steps will have been taken to establish the Federal Capital. The Premier of New South Wales asked for an assurance that an agreement would be entered into for a certain definite term, which would justify the New South Wales Government in acquiring a residence for the State Governor. That seems to us to be a most reasonable request. We must remember that in connection with both these Government Houses the States concerned have been treating us with the greatest generosity. We have had handed over to us these magnificent buildings, without being called upon to pay a single penny in the wav of rent. All that we are required to do is to maintain them, and to hand them over practically in the same order of preservation that they were in when we received them. When, therefore, the Commonwealth was established, we found ourselves in possession of Government House, Melbourne, and Government House I, Sydney. At a Conference of States Premiers, held before Federation was established, it was agreed by a majority that two residences should be provided for the Governor General-that during the sittings of Parliament the Governor General should reside in Melbourne and that during the recess he should reside in Sydney.",15
16,Mr WILKS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,What does the Minister mean by a majority of the Premiers-ca n he give their names?,16
17,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"I am using the expression contained in a telegram forwarded by the honourable member for Gippsland, who was then Premier of Victoria, to the Premier of New South Wales. He saidReferring to your telegram of the Sth May . . . the majority agree to residence of the Governor General New South' Wales during recess, but consider that he should visit other Colonies.",16
18,Mr WILKS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,H as the Minister any record of the proceedings of that Conference ?,16
19,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"No ; that telegram is the only official record of the decision that we have. On the strength of the representations that were made, and the agreement arrived at before Federation, .communications took place with the Imperial Government, and the proposal of the States was acquiesced in. The people of New South Wales justly and fairly believed that these proposals would be carried out, and on the strength of that parliamentary action was taken.",16
20,Mr HENRY WILLIS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,N e w South Wales spent a large sum of money.,16
21,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"Yes . New South Wales spent a very large sum of money, and I think that they behaved in a spirit that was well worthy of the Federation. They made the most liberal provision for the celebration of the inauguration of the Commonwealth, in a manner befitting the occasion. We entered into an agreement with the States Governments of New South Wales and Victoria that we should continue in occupation of their respective Government Houses for a period of three years, with a right of renewal for a further period of two years - in other words, for a term of 1 five years altogether. Of course, it was provided that we should be liable for the maintenance and upkeep of the houses, and hand them over at the expiration of the term in good order and condition.",16
22,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,Is the Minister able to say whether any fixed term was agreed upon in the first instance?,16
23,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"Yes . The term of three years, with a right of renewal for a further two years. The terms of that agreement were to be embodied in a draft lease, which tcok some time in preparation, and is in existence today. We are now holding these properties upon the original terms, with the exception that, as regards the State of Victoria, we have practically agreed to continue in occupation of Government House, Melbourne, for an indefinite period, subject to twelve months' notice of termination on either side. That agreement was practically concluded at the close of last year, and a copy was immediately transmitted to New South Wales. At the same time, a discussion took place in the Senate, and a desire was expressed that the two residences should the dealt with separately. On the strength of that debate, and the promise made to the Senate, negotiations had to be again opened up with New South Wales, and it was then agreed that we should submit to Parliament a Bill which would enable us to make a contract for a period of five years.",16
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,At whose suggestion is the term fixed?,17
25,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"At the suggestion of the State of New South Wales. It was pointed out that the New South Wales Government desired to enter into a new arrangement to provide a residence for the State Governor, and naturally they wished "" the Commonwealth authorities to give them some guarantee that they would continue in the occupation of Government House, Sydney, for a term, because, if this Parliament refused at any time to make the necessary appropriation they might have the two establishments thrown upon their hands.",17
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The Government contemplates entering into an agreement for a definite period with the Government of New South Wales?,17
27,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"We contemplate entering into an agreement for five years. The arrangement with Victoria is subject to twelve months' notice on either side. Of course, it may be that the Premier of New South Wales will assent to the same conditions.",17
28,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,Has he not done so up till now?,17
29,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"What is asked for is that the Commonwealth shall enter into an arrangement for a period of five years, and for the reason which I have given. That reason seems to me fair and reasonable.",17
30,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,Does the New South Wales Premier ask the Commonwealth Government to defray the cost of providing another residence for its State Governor?,17
31,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"No ; the State Government provide that. All that we are asked to do, and all that we propose, is to continue the existing lease upon exactly the same terms as have hitherto operated. We are not asking this Parliament to appropriate a. single additional penny of expenorder diture for the upkeep of these two viceregal establishments. We shall not ask for an increase in the amount of the appropriation when the Estimates are under review. Honourable members will doubtless recollect that some time ago a discussion took place in this House as to what constituted a fair and reasonable amount to allow for the maintenance and upkeep of the two establishments occupied by the Governor General. Accordingly a return was prepared in which it was shown that ,£5,500 was absolutely the bed-rock expenditure. It was pointed out that that estimate had been made in the absence of any experience other than that provided by the short period during which the Commonwealth had been in occupation of the two Government Houses, but it was believed that their maintenance could be provided for upon that basis. Ever since then the expenditure has been kept down absolutely to bed-rock, and it has been found, with the exercise of care and economy, that the amount indicated will very nearly cover all necessary demands. Of course, there are certain amounts for non-recurring expenditure-expenditur e due to the fact that we are required to keep the buildings and their contents in good order and condition. But in some instances we have been able to provide for the upkeep of the fabrics themselves out of the sum appropriated for maintenance.",17
32,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The Minister has not yet told us what is the respective cost of the upkeep of the two Government Houses?,17
33,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,I have said that .£5.500 is considered the bed-rock expenditure for the upkeep of both establishments.,17
34,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The amount °f £s>15° was suggested.,17
35,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"But £5,500 was the sum agreed to as the minimum. It was stated that that was the lowest possible expenditure which could be incurred for the maintenance of the establishments.",17
36,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,Does that represent the cost of the upkeep of each ?,17
37,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"No ; it represents the cost of the upkeep of both. If the honourable member will turn to the Estimates he will see that the total expenditure last year was £5,868, so that we have kept very closely to bed-rock. As I have already pointed out, a certain amount must be provided for non-recurring expenditure for which we are liable, because we are bound to hand over the buildings in good and condition, and to replace certain things which are liable to wear and tear. If honourable members will refer to the past expenditure by the States they will find, in some instances, that the amounts which they Have appropriated for. the upkeep of their Government Houses are in excess of the sum I have mentioned. We are not asking for any additional expenditure in pursuance of the agreement embodied in this Bill. We are simply continuing the existing arrangement, and there will be.no expense incurred under it other than that of which we have had experience during the past five years. We ask the House to agree to the Bill, because we think that it is a just thing that we should provide for the upkeep of two Government Houses, one in Sydney, and the other in Melbourne.",17
38,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,At whose request has this arrangement been made?,18
39,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"The Premier of Victoria requested the Commonwealth Government to consider the question of whether it should not pay rent for the accommodation provided in Melbourne for the Governor General j but since then, he has practically concluded an agreement with us under which no rent shall be charged, and we shall continue in possession of the Melbourne establishment just as we have done hitherto. I think that the States are treating us generously in this matter, and I ask the House to give us the authority to carry out the agreements contemplated by the Bill.",18
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"Parramatta) [ IT . 9 ] - I am glad to hear the statement which has been made by the Minister in regard to this matter. 1 should have liked him to say, during his speech-per haps I should have suggested it-that at no distant date- I mean this sessionthe question of the Federal Capital Site will receive some attention at the hands of the Government.",18
41,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"It is receiving attention now, and it will be submitted as soon as possible to the House.",18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"I am glad to have that assurance. Meantime, it strikes me that the proposal made in this Bill is a fair arrangement upon both sides. The New South Wales authorities have to provide a residence for Sir Harry Rawson, the State Governor, and I understand that they are desirous of entering into a five years' tenure of a house with that end in view. It is only reasonable, therefore, that they should ask the Commonwealth Government to occupy the vice-regal establishment in Sydney, which the State Governor is vacating, for a similar term. I suppose that the Government are following sortie precedent in the matter of the phraseology which is employed in this Bill. In it, I notice that they take power-it strikes me as sounding, rather strange-to permit the Governor General to make an arrangement with the State Governor..",18
43,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,In that we are only following; the official means of communication.,18
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"Of course, everybody understands that the Governor General means his responsible Ministers, but I did. not know that this form of phraseology entered into the question of securing of a place wherein the Governor General might live.",18
45,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,It means that he must obtain executive authority.,18
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"It is language to which one is not accustomed in our Acts of Parliament, and it shows the way in which constitutional law operates from the top to the bottom of our industrial and social order. I take it from what the Minister has said that the Government propose to enter into an indefinite agreement with the Government of Victoria, so far as the occupation of the Melbourne Government House is concerned, subject to twelve months' notice upon either side. With respect to the vice-regal establishment in New South Wales, the Government propose, at the request of the Premier of that State, to enter into an agreement' for a definite term.",18
47,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The Victorian Government may ask for the same agreement as we contemplate making with New South Wales. We are only placing the Governments! of the two States upon the same footing.,18
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"I think that the attitude which is assumed, both by the Government of New South Wales and that of Victoria, is an eminently fair and reasonable one. There has been some criticism levelled against the recent action of the Victorian Premier in making a claim for rent for the occupation of Melbourne Government House.",18
49,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"It was not the claim for rent that was objectionable, but the remarks which accompanied it.",18
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"It strikes me that a mistake was made in this matter at ""the very outset of Federation, and this fact shows the inadvisability of allowing sentimental considerations to enter into affairs of plain business. For my part, I believe it would have been better if , at the advent of Federation, we had entered into an agreement with the Government of New South Wales, under which we should have paid for everything which that Government did to place at our disposal accommodation for ' the Governor General. should thus have put the matter upon business basis. However, sentimental siderations were permitted to creep in, and whole Empire. we accepted the hospitality proffered by the Government of Victoria at the time. The result was that matters were not considered in that sharp business way in which ordinary transactions are considered. Thus comes about that later proposals of a more strictly business character have been made, State Governor. accompanied by language which gives rise to some amount of irritation. I say again that I think the Commonwealth Governaccommodation ment ought to be under no obligation to any State of a pecuniary character. So from that being the case, we ought studiwould ously to avoid any such relations. We have supreme control and command of the purse cur here. of the Commonwealth, and the Governoffer ment is supposed to be supreme within limits of our Constitution. Therefore seems to me that we ought to operate our powers independently of any outside authority, and without reference to any sentimental considerations whatever. ought to be self-contained in every way, only as to the place where we shall meet, but as to the payments we shall make for the privileges that we enjoy, and for every other aspect of our constitutional working. Consequently I make no complaint in spect of the proposals which are made by the Government, and which amount to this: that we simply propose to pay our way into be concluded. relation to the matter of vice-regal accommodation. I do not see why the Commonwealth Government should not pay its rent just as freely and unrestrictedly as the monest and poorest labourer in Australia has perforce to do.",18
51,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The Bill* does not propose that we s'hall pay a rental.,19
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"It amounts pretty much to the same thing. The Bill proposesi that we shall make a definite arrangement with the States Governments in regard to the housing of our Governor General-a n arrangement involving expenditure, if not actual rental.",19
53,Mr WILKS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The upkeep of the two vice-regal establishmerits is pretty expensive.,19
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"I suppose that that time. it is a Httle expensive from one standpoint, but, judged from the proper relation in which these things ought to be viewed, it strikes me that it is very reasonable.",19
55,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,It is very small.,19
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"I should say We that it is small. It is as small, or smaller, 1 a perhaps, than the expenditure upon anyconother establishment of the kind in the",19
57,Mr WILKS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The honourable member misunderstands me. I was referring to the difference between the upkeep of Governi t ment House by the Commonwealth and that of the establishment occupied by the,19
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"I do not know what the arrangements are in respect of the provided for the State Governor. If the upkeep and rent together far were included I should imagine that they amount to quite as much expenditure as we are under an obligation to inHowever, I clo not intend to the slightest opposition to the Bill. I the think it is an eminently fair one. My it hope is that we shall soon secure a local habitation of our own, so that we may terminate this dual relationship with the various States, and have one GovernorWe General's residence at the permanent not Seat of Government--in the place which this Parliament will decide, I hope, very speedily, and with satisfaction to all concerned. I understand that the Government are moving in this matter at the inrestance of the Government of New South Wales, and that other, reasons press them to ask for a definite agreement of this kind",19

If we had that question settled we might thenagree upon one permanent residence for the Governor General, instead of having a residence in both New South Wales and Victoria. There has been a good deal of trouble over this matter ever since it originated. In the first instance, when the Governor General came to reside in Melbourne, there was a feeling in New South Wales that he ought to reside there too. That led up to the creation of a second establishment.",19
60,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The Minister has just said that it was arranged before,19

We are assured by the Minister that New South Wales is in this position-that during this month the Government will have to make provision for housing its Governor.",22
104,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"No , during this year.",22
105,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"If it is this year, that is better from our point of view than this month. A convenient opportunity is afforded to convenience New South Wales, and to save fhat State a sum which, I suppose, amounts to £3,000 or £4,000 a year for the rent and upkeep of a Governor's establishment.

106,Mr LEE,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,£500 .,22
107,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"I am surprised to hear that an establishment in keeping with the dignity of the State has been obtained for that sum. Even if the saving on rent will be only £500 a year, New South Wales should be enabled to make it ; whilst at the same time the Commonwealth will be able to save 'about £3,000 per annum. I am not prepared to say whether or not New South Wales desires to save money, but judging from a communication received for by the Federal Government a little while ago, I should imagine that the State is pretty short of funds.",22
108,Mr SKENE,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"Evidentl y she is not short of funds, because her Government makes this offer. Mr Frazer.'-In the communication to which I refer, it was suggested by the New South Wales Government that the Federal members should start to look for a new Federal Capital Site, and in a postscript it was courteously intimated that they were invited to bring their own sandwiches. It was like an invitation to attend a Lord Mayor's banquet, with an intimation that the guests were to take their own food and wine. It appeared to me, from that invitation, that New South Wales desires to save money. Here is an opportunity for her to do so. I am also strongly of opinion that we have arrived at a stage in our national history when no special privileges should be accorded to any particular State. We ought not to perpetuate a system whereby the Governor General is expected to live in different States at different portions of the year.",22
109,Mr WILKS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,We might as well buy him a perambulator.,22
110,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"It would no doubt be a convenient means of transport. The time is opportune for us to decide that the Governor General shall reside in Victoria while the Parliament meets here, and shall accompany the Parliament to the Federal city as soon as it is constructed. When the Bill gets into Committee, I shall take the opportunity of inviting honourable members to vote against clause 3.",22
111,Mr WILKS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The honourable member and I will get no more invitations from the Governor General if we take the course suggested.,22
112,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,I suppose that would not trouble either of us very much. The question ought to be dealt with apart from such considerations.,22
113,Mr WILKS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"Dalley) [11.35] - I agree with much that has been said by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. In the first place, I wish to say that the title of this Biil strikes me as being rather too imposing. Instead of "" Governor General's residences,"" I would rather see the word "" residence "" usedI hope that the time will soon arrive when we shall have one residence only for the Governor General. The people of Australia, who have neither the opportunity nor the desire to attend Government House functions, but who have to pay the bill for the up-keep of various official establishments, ought to be considered. They thought that on the consummation of Federation the expenses of the States upon Governors would be greatly diminished. I hoped that the office of State Governor would be abolished, and that the various Chief Justices would act as Lieutenant-Governors. The present cost is very great. In some of the States the Governor is provided with two residences, one in the city and one in the country. In addition to that we now have the Governor General provided with two residences, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. tainly have no desire to see Sydney brought down to the level of a fishing village. If we are to have the Governor General residing there, he certainly should occupy a residence appropriate to the dignity of his office. Government House, Sydney, occupies the most beautiful site on God's earth. I can quite understand Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth entertaining similar opinions with regard to the Governor General residing in them. But it is not our duty to provide a perambulating system of residences for the Governor General. The present situation affords an additional reason why we should hasten the ultimate decision with regard to the Federal capital. When we do finallv establish a Commonwealth residence for the Governor General, I think that the Commonwealth should maintain one establishment in the Federal city, and should not be called upon to incur the expense of keeping up a second residence. The Governor General's private residence, if he wishes to have one in the country, should be a charge on his own income. This Bill provides for the occupation of Government House, Sydney, for five years. I suggest that a provision should be inserted enabling the agreement to be terminated on twelve months' notice by either side.",23
114,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,That would not give the State Government a definite term.,23
115,Mr WILKS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"It is a mere matter of convenience. If the Federal capital were established within five years, we should have to continue to maintain the Government Houses in the States when we did not require them.",23
116,Mr FRAZER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,It would be difficult to impose that condition when we are getting the houses for nothing.,23
117,Mr WILKS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"It is not difficult, because the very condition I suggest exists today in regard to the occupation of Government House, Melbourne. Of course, if I were acting only in the interests of Sydney, I . should be willing to let this five year provision stand. But I do not wish to see anything unfair done. It is rather annoying to pick up one of the daily newspapers and find a cavilling between the State Premiers and the Commonwealth Prime Minister as to whether we should pay rent for Government House. I take the view that as a matter of justice the Commonwealth Government should pay its I cer- way, and it should certainly reimburse the State Governments for out-of-podket expenditure. But at the same time, the occupation by the Commonwealth of the Government Houses at Melbourne and Sydney does not involve the two States in additional expenditure. The Commonwealth provides for the up-keep of these establishments, which amounts in itself to a very large rent. Indeed, the Governments of Victoria and New South Wales have made an economical arrangement by allowing the Governor General to occupy the official residences in Melbourne and Sydney whilst they pay rent for cheaper establishments for their own Governors. The general public are not concerned as to the residences of the State Governors and the Governor General. They are not part of the social world of which the Governor General is the pivot. The masses of the people do not care what is done in this matter, so long as they are not involved in unnecessary expense - At the same time they do not desire to see a State placed in an unfair position. The arrangement made some years ago with regard to Sydney Government House was considered to be a compliment and an act of justice to the mother State. That was simply a setoff against! the arrangement that Melbourne should be the seat of Government until the capital city was occupied. But the .taxpayers are not concerned in this arrangement, and must look with horror on the piling up of expenses.",23
118,Mr FOWL ER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"Perth) [11.45] - I think this is a fitting juncture for a reminder from the Federal Parliament to the States Parliaments, and to the people of the States, that They have failed to carry out the understanding which, at the time when federation was about to be consummated, was, I think, almost universal. It was very generally understood that as soon as a Governor General of the Commonwealth was in existence in Australia, the States Governcis should be represented by some permanent offici' - of each State rather than by ar .mported gentleman who would be expected to keep up a petty vice-regal establishment, such as seems to have been the rule in all the States up to the present time. Federal Parliament be accused of extravagance in any direction, I think we may fairly retort on the States Parliaments that in this respect they are not only extravagant, but are continuing a totally useless and unnecessary formality in respect of these little vice-regal courts. It seems to me to be the height of absurdity that in the city of Melbourne we should have two vice-regal establishments. quite sure that the vast majority of the people, if they had an opportunity to express an opinion in a direct fashion on this particular issue, would speak without hesitation as to the advisability and, indeed, the necessity, of abolishing these States vice-regal courts. It it were absolutely necessary for the welfare and happiness of a certain section of the people of Australia that they should occasionally tread a vice-regal carpet, or that a still more select few should put their feet under vice-regal mahogany, that might be accomplished by arranging that the Governor General should visit the various States for . a short period in each year, and in that way afford those people an opportunity to gratifv their social ambition. I feel that the Federal Parliament should' enter a strong protest against the continuance of these States vice-regal courts. It was dis.tinctly understood that they should be abolished as the result of federation. We now have had federation in existence for five years, and, beyond a reduction in the salaries of some of the States Governors, nothing more effectual has been accomplished. I am informed by the honourable member for Kennedy that there was a request from a late Secretary of State for the Colonies that the status of these States Governors should not be altered or reduced.",24
119,Mr MCDONALD,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,Such a request was made in the case of Queensland at any rate.,24
120,Mr FOWLER,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"That may be so, but I think that in a matter of this kind the voice of the people of Australia should be supreme. Whilst we are always ready to listen to suggestions from the Colonial Office, they should be very well grounded indeed, and I am not aware that very cogent reasons have been adduced by any one for the continuance of the States viceregal courts. But in any case, I think it is the duty of this Parliament to remind the States Parliaments that there is a very useful reform possible of achievement in this direction, and that, apart altogether If the from the saving of expense, the present position is one which makes us almost a laughing stock of people elsewhere. We can very well dispense with many of these little vice-regal courts throughout Australia. I think that we should be quite content with one Governor-GeneraTs establishment. Mr. JOSEPH.COOK - Suppos e honourable members begin in Western Australia, to show us how it would work. I am Mr FOWLER - The remarks I am making are as applicable to Western Australia as to the other States.

A complaint is being expressed throughout Australia at the present time about the extravagance, or, if - honourable members object to ithat term, the unusually large expenditure of the Commonwealth. I cannot at present deal in detail with the subject, but I know that every Tasmanian Department taken over by the Commonwealth has become more expensive-in some instances, the increases are very large-and less efficient.",28

Mr MCWILLIAMS - No doubt that should be so, but the question arises, is the Governor General to be compelled to reside permanently at a bush capital, or is he to be provided with residences in Melbourne and Sydney also? Those are points which should be considered at this I have always juncture. We must, of course, in dealing with this matter, keep in view the arrangement of the Premiers to which reference has already been made.

It is now suggested that we should have alternate agreements with eacli of the States, one being for a period of five vears. and the other extending until the Federal city is established. As I have already pointed out, it will be necessary for the New South Wales Government to make. arrangements for the accommodation of the State Governor, ar.d» they reasonably ask that we shall enter into occupation of Government House, Sydney, for a fixed term so that they may arrange to lease a residence for the State Governor for a similar period.",29

179,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"Then there is no necessity for the amendment. We know that even if we were able forthwith to secure the site for the Federal Capital, a considerable time would be occupied in laying out the Federal City, and in working out the whole scheme. It seems to me, therefore, that the amendment would be merely a placard, and would serve no useful purpose.",29

181,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,The mere insertion of the amendment would not indicate that. Our intention all through has been merely to provide temporary residences in Sydney and Melbourne. No one has ever expressed the opinion thati these residences should be maintained permanently. The amendment would not in any sensebe binding.,29

We all know that if the Federal Capital Site were finally selected, and the work of establishing the Federal City were pushed on with all possible speed, it would not be possible to provide accommodation for the Governor General at the permanent Seat of Government before five years had elapsed.

189,Mr WATSON,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,I think that the limitation to five years would prevent that.,29
190,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"I am afraid not, because considerable differences of opinion exist as to the agreements already entered into with New South Wales and Victoria. The only consideration which induces me to vote in favour of maintaining a residence for the Governor General in Sydney,' as well as in Melbourne, is the deliberate arrangement that was entered into by the Premiers, including the Premier of Tasmania, which, I think, we are in honour bound to carry out. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the period of five years from being extended.",29
191,Mr GROOM,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,That could only be done with the express authority of Parliament.,30
192,Mr MCWILLIAMS,FREMANTLE TOWNHALL POST,"We know that every step taken in connection with this matter is used as an argument why we should proceed further. If the amendment be adopted, it will clearly express to any future Parliament the intention of this House that the residences in Melbourne and Sydney should not be maintained after provision has been made for the accommodation of the Governor General at the Federal Capital. When that stage has been reached, neither Victoria nor New South Wales will have any claim in regard to the Governor General other than could be put forward by the other States.",30

The principal obstacles in the wav of a settlement of the Federal Capital question are being presented by the representatives of New South Wales, particularly by the members of the State Parliament. If they had been reasonable in their attitude, we should not have been under the necessity of dealing with a measure of this kind. I think that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie might go a step further and propose that clause 3 should be struck out altogether, with a view to enacting that the Governor General shall reside at the Seat of Government.",30

The very persons who are today denouncing us for the expenditure incurred in the maintenance of these vice-regal establishments are themselves extravagant.

217,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [12.41] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This measure is one which has been beforethe House upon several occasions. It has also been before the Senate. Its object is well known to honourable members. It is: being re-introduced in the form in which it appeared upon a former occasion. Its object is not to authorize the construction of the Transcontinental .Railway, but simply to provide for an appropriation of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 to enable proper surveys to be made, which will put the House in possession, of information that is absolutely essential to enable it to express a sound judgment upon that very important undertaking. provides that the Minister may cause a survey to be made of a route to connect by rail Kalgoorlie in Western Australia with Port Augusta in South Australia. It then goes on to authorize the expenditure of the necessary sum of money. In 1904 the Bill passed this House by a considerable majority. It has received the sanction of every party in this Chamber, so far as it is possible for a party to be represented by executive authority. Originally introduced by the first Deakin Government, it was. afterwards taken up by the Watson Ministry,-and when the Reid-MCLean Government were in office they advanced it through its remaining stages, and it was transmitted to the Senate. The measure was discussed in that Chamber in 1904, and again last year. Upon the last occasion the Senate resolved to the effectthat the Bill should not be proceeded with ""until South Australia had given parliamentary sanction to the construction of the line through its territory. Since then we have communicated with the South Australian Government upon the matter, and have re the Premier of that State:Sir, In reply to your letter of the 7th instant, respecting the. proposed railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, I have the honor to refer vou to my telegram of rst March last, and to say that this Government has no objection to the survey as therein notified, but cannot undertake to consider a Bill for .submission t j Parliament in the absence of information as to the route and terminal points of the railway. That is to say that, so far as South Australia is concerned, she is not hostile to this Bill . In fact, I believe that the people of that State favour the construction of the Transcontinental Railway. The only point with them is that they do not care to commit themselves to any scheme until they know the route that is to be followed, and possibly the cost of the construction of the proposed line. That is the very information which, under this Bill, we are asking the House to give us authority to obtain. We hold that the building of the Transcontinental Railway is a great national work, which is worthy of the attention of this House, and which ought to be regarded from a Federal stand-point. It is an undertaking which ought not to be rejected until honourable members have been afforded an opportunity of arriving at a sound judgment upon it . It has often The Bill been asserted that the line is intended merely to benefit Western Australia. That is not the way in which we ought to regard a great national undertaking. We should approach it from a Federal stand-point. We should also regard it from an historical stand-point, with a view to ascertain the reasons why this Bill now becomes before the House for consideration. I am free to admit that, when I first considered this project, I was inclined to take up a critical attitude in respect to it. But I felt that inherently it appealed to one's Federal instinct as being the right thing to do. Since the proposal was brought before the House, I have had the advantage of visiting Western Australia, going throughthe country to be traversed by the line as far as it was possible to go by rail, and consulting with the people of the State on the proiect.. I , as a representative of Queensland, desired to look at the question from the Western Australian stand-point, in order to be able to give a judgment fairly and honestly according to the facts. I feel absolutely confident that the people of Western Australia are only claiming that which from a Federal standpoint is a fair and reasonable thing to accord to them. In Western Australia. I made some inquiries, and I found that when the State was asked to consider the important question of whether she would enter the .great Australian union, certain aspects were submitted for her consideration. Separated as she virtually was from the eastern States by a sea journey, and developing her own territory, she almost seemed to be complete within herself as a centre of government. On the face of things, as far as economic conditions were concerned, there did not appear to be any special reason for inducing Western Australia to join the Union from any material advantage she was likelv to gain. But of course, from the national and defence points of view, there were many reasons to actuate her intaking that step. As far as I can see, after looking closely into the question, there was no State which gave a more patriotic decision than Western tralia did when she decided to throw lot with the others, and form a great tralian nation under the Crown. From the plated joining the Union. stand-point of the people of Western Ausis tralia, undoubtedly one of the chief tages which they would gain from joining the union was that they would get railway connection with the other States. The porary advantage of the expenditure little money does not appear to have the motive which actuated them. Unless have commercial means of communication, unless we have means by which people can move freely from State to State, no real .Federation has been accomplished. idea in establishing the Federation was obtain freedom of commerce and intercourse amongst the peoples in the union. It true that the people of Western Australia had communication by sea with the eastern States, but that is only one of the avenues of trade and commerce, and in times war it would be most seriously affected. The people of Western Australia say, "" Just as you have a telegraphic systemi extending all over Australia, and forming, as it a nerve system for the whole of the union, so it is necessary to have arteries and so that the life blood of the nation may pass freely through them. We are not whole people until every part of Australia is linked together by commercial highways."" They are only making to us a fair and reasonable appeal from the Federal point of view when they press this claim very strongly upon us. During our visit they asked, "" What is our position the present time? We are absolutely isobe lated. We are practically just as much island as is New Zealand. There is no more organic connection between the eastern States and our State at the present time than there is between Australia and Zealand. There is a vast area of land conAustralia, necting us, it is true, and if vou will construct a railway across that country will give us that link or bond which will able us to become real members of the great Australian union."" When we are forming established. an Australian nation we cannot overlook these considerations. We cannot simply regard this proposal) as a mere expenditure of public money, and say, "" Oh, it means that Queensland will have to contribute £2,000 or £3,000 towards the outlay; that tion. will not benefit us, and therefore we ought not to assent to the proposal."" Again, from the New South Wales stand-point, similar argument should not be used. Mr Groom. AusWhat we have to consider are the in her facts placed before, the people of AusWestern Australia when they contemWhen it sought to establish a federation there are advanmany things which cannot be included in the legal bond or contract. Even this morning, what attitude did we take up in temrespect to the Governor General's resiof a dences? The House acted in a Federal been spirit in this matter. When it came to we deal with the clairrn of the great State of New South Wales, we did not argue that 1 because it was not mentioned in the Constitution, therefore we should not honour the The promise that was made. The attitude to .which honourable members took up this morning in agreeing to the Bill to provide is a residence for the Governor General in New South Wales, was simply this: We realise that when the proposal to establish the Commonwealth was made, of there were certain moral hopes or promises which were held out to the people, and that they are just as much matters of national honour as is anything which could were, have been put in the written bond. If these hopes and aspirations were held out veins, to any portion of the Commonwealth, it behoves us, as a nation, to do our best to one honour them. We have passed from the six States stage, let us hope, into the Australian stage, and do not desire to have the feeling engendered in the mind of any portion of the Commonwealth that it is not receiving justice at the hands of the majority. And the more remote a State is from the Seat of at Government, the more jealous we ought to in guarding its position, and seeing that an whatever hopes it has which are based on any substantial ground, shall be honored. Any one who takes up the records can realise that leading Australians who comNew municated with, and spoke in, Western as leaders of the Federal moveonly ment, would be more or less regarded in vou the nature of holding out fair promises enwhich might be expected to be honoured by the people when the Federal Parliament was The people of Western Australia, relying absolutely and fully upon these promises, entered into an indissoluble agreement. They tied their hands absolutely when they decided to become for all time members of a great Australian FederaWe must;, therefore, treat' them with that justice and that spirit of fairness and equity to which they are ena titled under the conditions. To-dav, we are not asking the House to' go so far as to sanction the construction of this railway. All we are asked by the State to do today is to obtain that amount of information which will enable the House to come to a sound judgment, so that, even if the House in its wisdom should see fit to reject the scheme, the rejection will not result from the operation of an anti-Federal spirit, but simply from the exigencies of the case. That is* the position which we ask the House to consider. . If it refuses to pass the Bill , it will be practically closing its eyes to the facts. It will be' absolutely refusing to grant to Western Australia even the courtesy of an investigation of its claim.",31

After Federation was accomplished in ZG01, the State, at its own expense, caused special inquiries to be instituted ir. order to give its people the fullest possible information. Special reports were made by Mr O'Connor, one of the finest engineers, whom I think Australia has even seen, and whose works will stand through all time as an eloquent testimony to his great engineering capacity and skill. I refer particularly to the magnificent work which he did in Fremantle Harbor, ancl to that, perhaps, still greater work, the designing and execution of the Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie water scheme - These two schemes alone mark Mr 0'Conn6r out as a man whose word is worth considering. According to the report which he made to the Government of Western Australia in 190L, he estimated that the construction of the railway would cost about £4,400.000 . That estimate was subsequently confirmed by the reports of engineers who were apright pointed by the Commonwealth to investigate the matter, when they estimated the cost at about £4,500,000 , and anticipate, after ten years, it will realise a profit of £18,000. It will be seen, therefore, that Western Australia was eager to appoint competent persons who should fearlessly investigate the merits of the project, and make a proper report in order to put us in possession of all the facts. The State also obtained a further report from Mr Muir, who went over the route of the line as far as it was possible to do.",34
240,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has the Minister ever read the Treasurer's report of his ride over the route of the line ? Read what he says about the country.,35
241,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I wish that the honourable member would read it.,35
242,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have read it. The right honourable member searched the country for water, and thanked God when he got a bucketful.",35
243,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Mr Muir made a full report. Western Australia, therefore, has treated the Federation fairly. sent her own officers to thoroughly investigate the country, as far as they could, and placed the House in possession of extremely valuable information in the shape of their reports. In addition to that, her Parliament passed an Act giving the consent of the. State to the. survey of the line. The preamble to the Act ought to be borne in mind by this Parliament, because it voices honestly and fairly the hopes and aspirations of the people of the State. It reads as follows :Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia, being desirous of securing closer union and the benefits of mutual protection and defence, and being desirous also of enjoying the advantages of freedom of trade, commerce, and reciprocal intercourse, have, by th* Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, foimed one Federal and indissoluble Commonwealth -. And whereas, in furtherance of these objects, power has been conferred upon the Parliament of the Commonwealth to make laws for the construction and extension of railways in anv State with the consent of such State : And whereas, on the faith of the early construction of a railwav to connect the western and eastern portions of the Commonwealth, by means whereof they could enjoy - the full benefits of such union, the people of Western Australia did agree to the said Constitution, and to form part of the Commonwealth : And whereas, to enable the Parliament of the Commonwealth to execute nnd maintain those essential provisions of the Constitution which were intended to confirm the people of this portion of the Commonwealth in that assurance of protection and defence, and the advantages of postal and commercial intercourse, and of freedom of trade by land and by sea, which are enjoyed by members of the Commonwealth elsewhere, it is desirable to authorize such Parliament to construct a railway as aforesaid : Now, therefore, be it enacted, &c.",35
244,Unknown,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Sitting suspended from i to 2 p.m.,35
245,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Incidentally , I might mention that the whole distance from Fremantle to Adelaide is 1,746 miles. Already there has been constructed a railway fromi Fremantle to Kalgoorlie 387 miles, and another line from Adelaide to Port Augusta 259 miles, leaving a distance of 1,100 miles to complete the transcontinental scheme. The engineers hare reported in favour of a gauge of 4 f t . b\\ in., and the State of Western Australia has undertaken, if the Commonwealth builds the connecting line, to extend the gauge on the railway from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie.",35
246,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Wester n Australia has undertaken to make the gauge on that line conform to whatever gauge is adopted She by. the Commonwealth.,35
247,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , Western Australia is prepared to incur that extra expense to 1 meet the requirements of. the Australian Parliament. When this question was under consideration by this Parliament on a former occasion, the House desired to have the lands reserved for twenty-five' miles on each side of the line, in order that it might not be alienated.. To meet us in that respect, Western Australia, on the 26th October, 1904, passed resolutions reserving the land in question. In addition to that, Western Australia has shown faith in the line by an undertaking she has given, dated 18th May, 1904, to the effect that, for ten years, if the line is not paying, she will bear a share of the loss. The Western Australian Premier announced that decision in the following telegram:On condition that Commonwealth is allowed a free hand as to route and gauge of railway, this State will be prepared for ten years after line constructed to bear a share of any loss in excess of our contribution on a population basis. It would be premature. to fix exact proportion we areprepared to pay at this stage, but I am confident that it will be liberal, and satisfy the Federal Parliament of our sincerity in this connection, nnd our belief that the work will soon be a directly paying one. Western Australia even went so far as to hold out inducements to South Australia in the way of indemnifying that State against loss. I may further announce that, through the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, the State Premier has been asked whether, in case the survey was authorized, the State Parliament would do anything in the way of fitting out a prospecting party to accompany the surveyors. The following telegram has been received from the Premier of Western Australia on that point:In response to wire from Representative Frazer asking if Government could see way clear to announce that Government prospecting party would accompany survey party test either side route proposed transcontinental railway for mineral deposits, have replied stating Government would be willing to assist on lines indicated his wire. That telegram shows that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who has ever kept in view the interests of his own State, but who, at the same time, has always taken a Federal view of other matters, has secured from the Western Australian Government .an assurance that full advantage will be taken of the survey from the prospecting point of view. Western Australia is not acting in this manner from any purely selfish stand-point. She is, I am' satisfied, looking at the matter from a Federal point of view, and desires to afford us every opportunity of ascertaining whether we are justified in doing what it is proposed to do. I have now shown the steps that have ljeen taken in this matter, and I think it is hardly necessary for - me to elaborate the points at issue to any great extent. may, however, remark that, in my opinion, the Western Australian people are entitled to this railway for several good reasons. The first is on account of the Federal aspect of the question. From an Australian stand-point-leavin g the special Western Australian interests out of consideration altogether- I think the survey ought to be made. Secondly, from the point of view of defence, the line ought to be constructed. If honourable members take the trouble to look at the report obtained from the military authorities in 1903, they will find that Major-General Hutton put this aspect of the case very strongly. states in his minute on the subjectThe contemplated extension of railway communication between Kalgoorlie in Western Australia and Port Augusta in South Australia, is, from a strategical and military point of view, of unquestionable value. The isolation of Western Australia, without direct land communication with the other five States of Australia, will , in time of war, cause a general feeling of insecurity. Under the existing circumstances, Western Australia, for purposes of co-operative military assistance from the other States, is as far distant from direct means of reinforcement as New Zealand is from the Eastern States of Australia. In order, however, to correctly view the present construction of the railway in question as an important factor in the defence of the Cpmmonwealth, it will be well to consider the special importance of Western Australia in the eyas of foreign powers, and the description of attack to which Australia is subject, and to meet which intercommunication between the States by land must be regarded as of paramount value. Tben he goes onThe potential wealth of the gold-fields and the vast extent of valuable and unoccupied land in the territories of Western Australia render the acquisition of that portion of the Australian continent a most valuable prize to foreign nations. The strategical situation, moreover, of Western Australia, dominating, as it does, the southern side of the Indian Ocean, and the converging trade routes from the West, must be considered as of the greatest importance to British and Australian interests. In addition to that, the right honourable member for Swan has placed a memorandum on the papers embodying an extract from a report from Major-General Edwards, then commanding the British troops in Hong Kong. This report was furnished to Governor Sir W. C. F. Robinson. Major-General Edwards statesNo general defence of Australia can be undertaken unless its distant parts are connected with the more populous colonies in the south and east of the continent. If an enemy was established in either Western Australia or at Port Darwin, you would be powerless to act against him. I Their isolation is, therefore, a menace to the rest of Australia The interests of the whole continent, therefore, demand that the raihvays to connect Port Darwin and Western Australia with the other colonies should be made as soon as possible. The military authorities whom I have quoted, considering the question absolutely Irom a national stand-point, give, in my opinion, excellent reasons why we ought, at all events, to survey the route of the proposed railway. At this stage I am not asking that the construction of any line shall be proceeded with. I am simply asking that the matter shall be properly investiHe gated.",35
248,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have to consider the expense as well.,36
249,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Exactly ; we are asking for an investigation to enable us to determine whether the expense is justifiable.,36
250,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The present estimateis too high.,36
251,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hear , hear.",36
252,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The engineers, in their report, tell us that they-have erred on the side of caution, so that there may be no mistake about it. An investigation of the route may prove that the cost of constructing the line will be much less than has been supposed. Even, however, if an honourable member were inclined to oppose the construction of the railway, that would be no reason for resisting an investigation of the route. It is not a question of one State against another State. It is merely a question of whether there shall be a fair investigation of what is asked by Western Australia on the merits of the proposal.",36
253,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable gentleman said this morning that there was a Federal bond which must be observed.,37
254,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I certainly said that we had to look at the matter from a Federal stand-point, and I say so still. Inducements were held out to Western Australia to enter the Federation, and she was assured that the railway would be constructed. If honourable members would go to Western Australia and investigate this matter impartially, ascertaining the views of the people, as I myself have done, as far as I could in the time that I could spare for the purpose, they would find that the promised construction of this railway was a distinct factor in inducing the electors to accept the ^Federal Constitution; just as in New South Wales the people were induced to accept the Federal Constitution on the undertaking that the Federal Capital would be located in that State. only difference is that in the one case the bond was embodied in a written contract, and in the other there was an understanding.",37
255,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who had power to pledge the Commonwealth in that way?,37
256,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No one actually had that power, and in the same way no one. had power to give a pledge to New South Wales that a second residence for the Governor General would be provided in New South Wales.",37
257,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Responsibl e men raised the point in Western Australia.,37
258,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly , and it is essential, at the beginning of our national life, that we should give no just cause of complaint to any large body of our people who have entered into the Federal agreement under the belief that they were to be treated by the Federal Parliament in a certain manner.",37
259,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Victori a passed a Bill with the object of getting something for some of her citizens under the belief that the .Commonwealth would pay the expense.,37
260,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And that measure was carried out. Every provision of it has been carried out.,37
261,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But at the expense of Victoria.,37
262,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , because, as a matter of law, that was all that Victoria asked. She never asked that the money should be paid by the rest of the Commonwealth.",37
263,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why should not the cost of this survey be borne by the States of Western Australia and South Australia?,37
264,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Because it is a matter of national concern; and therefore I am sure that the honourable member for Wentworth will repeat the vote which he gave on a previous occasion in favour of the second reading of this measure. Another reason that can be advanced is that the line will open up new country. A misapprehension prevails as to the character of the country that would be traversed by the line. Mr Muir, who has to some extent investigated the route, reports emphatically on this point. I will quote what he says about part of it- I was led to believe, prior to starting this trip, that the country to be traversed consisted almost entirely of a desert, composed of sandhills and spinifex flats. This impression proved, however, to be perfectly erroneous, unless a waterless tract of country, though well-grassed and timbered, can be called a desert.'",37
265,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is that in agreement with The the book written by the right honourable member for Swan?,37
266,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is an extract from a report by Mr Muir, who made his investigations on the spot. He goes onTo the north, near the 3rst parallel of latitude, the country is more open In fact, from the South Australian border fbr 250 miles in a westerly direction, it is one large open plain of limestone formation, fairly well grassed throughout. Taken as a whole, this stretch of country is one of the finest I have seen in Australia, and, with water-whic h doubtless could be obtained if properly prospected for-it is admittedly adapted for grazing purposes, and will , without doubt, be taken up some day from end to end.",37
267,Mr JKENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the country is so magnificent, why is it not settled?",37
268,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"-On e of the reasons is that there is no proper railway communication, and another is that the country is too far from the seaboard..",37
269,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is there not equally good country far from the seaboard in the other States ?,37
270,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No doubt there is; but perhaps the honourable member will allow me to answer one question at a time. Mr. Muir says with regard to the water supplyApart from the facilities that would be afforded tn railway construction, and the maintenance of the railway service when completed, by artesian water being struck on this waterless tract of country, it would be of incalculable profit to the State in another direction. At present there are millions of acres of splendid pastoral land lying idle in this portion of the State, solely beto 327,391 acres. cause water has not been conserved. it be known that artesian water has been discovered, and what is now nothing better than a waste would be transformed in a very short space of time, into one of the most important stock-raising centres of our State. A report was obtained from Mr Castilla upon the possibilities of the water supply. I will quote the last paragraph from it . It was published in Western Australia on the 19th July, 1904. Mr Castilla saysIn the course of my duties, I examined over 10,000,000 acres of country, well fitted, given water for pastoral settlement. Our bores have demonstrated that water exists, and I think that there is a very much greater area available. These are reports from men who are competent to judge, and they show that the country is not such a desert as it is stated to be. They certainly justify us in asking that a proper investigation of the route of the proposed railway should be made, not only for reasons of defence, but also because there is a possibility of the opening up of valuable country. When the country is examined it is quite possible that valuable mineral will be revealed. If the line be constructed, we shall secure better postal communication between the Stajtes at each end of it ; the cost of maintaining telegraphic communication between the Eastern States and Western Australia will be reduced, seeing that a telegraph line erected along the railway could be looked after with less expense; better means of communication will be provided between the States for the travelling public, and trade and commerce will be promoted andi extended. turns we have of the progress and development of Western Australia show that when the engineers hold out a prospect of increased trade, as the result of the construction of the proposed line, we may have every confidence that their reports are justified. The State of Western Australia has a wonderful record. It has yielded to date no iess than £67,739,016 in gold. There is a large increase taking place in the numbers of stock depastured in the State. In cattle alone the increase has been from 199,793 m 1904. As regards land settlement, Western Australia has splendid returns to show. In 1897 there were 31,489 acres under wheat, and in 1905 the area under wheat was 182,080 acres. The total area of land devoted to agriculture in 1897 was 111,738 acres, and it had increased in 1905 In 1896 the value 0? Once let the deposits in the Government Savings Bank in Western Australia amounted to £ 4 6 0 , 6 1 1 , and in 'J.905 to £ 2 , 2 0 7 , 2 9 6. The export and import trade of the State grew from £8,143,783 in 1896 to £16,272,528 in 1905. The population of the State in 1896 was 122,696, and_ in 1906 it had increased to 250,207. These returns show continual progress and advancement. Every addition to the population of the State means greater development of the territory and a better prospect of the proposed railway becoming a paying line. With every addition to ithe population in Western Australia there is an increased obligation upon us to afford the people there all the facilities for communication with the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth that are possessed by the people of the other States.",37
271,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Why not let the State, if it has such possibilities, make this line?",38
272,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The State of Western Australia is quite prepared to do all it can in the matter.,38
273,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We could only build the deposits railway into the middle of the desert which has been spoken of.,38
274,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the construction of the line were a State matter, two States would be concerned in it ; but it is not merely a matter of State, but of national concern. In putting these facts before honourable members, I am not asking thern to commit themselves at this stage to the construction of the proposed line. The; people of Western Australia claim that certain inducements! were held out to The re- them to join the Federation, and that it is now a fair and reasonable thing to ask for the investigation for which this Bill makes provision. The Government are asking the House to view the matter from an Australian stand-point-to realise that each State is entitled to consideration, and that, where necessary works rise out of purely State into national importance, the Federal Parliament should give them the consideration to which they are entitled. In this case that consideration can only be afforded by granting the survey for which ^896 to 561,490 in provision is made in this Bill. I appeal to the House to approach the question in a generous.and Federal spirit. It is not desirable that in any part of the Commonwealth there should exist a feeling that the people are not being fairly dealt with, whether it be Western Australia or any other State. It is only by the House approaching these great questions in a national spirit that we can create the feeling of mutual goodwill among the States which wi] 1 make us a people not merely one in bond, but one in Federal sentiment and spirit.",38
275,Mr MCLEAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Gippsland) [2.22] - I have never been very hopeful regarding the prospects of this line. On the contrary, I have always been very doubtful whether a thorough investigation of the proposed route, and the country on either side, would result in justifying the very large expenditure which must be involved in the construction of the line. At the same time, I do feel that Western Australia has strong claims upon our sympathy. In the first place, that State is a part of Federated Australia, and is labouring under very serious disadvantage in being cut off from the rest of the Commonwealth by a very large stretch of uninhabited country. We must remember that Western Australia has been largely peopled from the Eastern Bill. States. She is an excellent customer for the products of those States, and the trade with Western Australia Has been an exceedexpenditure ingly profitable one for the rest of the Commonwealth, especially for Victoria and New South Wales. It seems to me that Western Australia is not asking anything unreasonable in urging that the Commonstruction wealth as a whole shall test the question of whether this line can be justified on its merits. It is premature at this stage speculate whether the line should ultimately be constructed. We cannot discuss that question intelligently until we have made a thorough investigation of the proposed route. I understand that it is intended not only to make a trial survey of the route, but to enlist the services of Western Australia and South Australia for the exsaid ploration of the country for a conmembers siderable distance on either side, and to prospect for water, minerals, and' other resources which it may possess. From all we hear, there can be no doubt is a good deal of country alone the route which might profitably' be used for settleunderstood ment if a proper water supn'- and a sonable outlet for the products of the land were provided. These are questions which require to be set at rest. Even the Federal aspect aside, though' in my opinion it is of the greatest importance, because it is from the Federal stand-point that Western Australia has the strongest claims upon us, it seems to me that in spending £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 .on this survey, we snail be returning to Western. Australia but a very small modicum of the profit we derive from our trade with that State. I am therefore quite prepared to vote for the trial survey in order that the resources of the country may be thoroughly tested. But I impress upon the Minister that the Government must be careful that the expense incurred under this Bill, if it be passed, shall not exceed the amount we vote. It is possible to incur almost anv expense on the survev of a railway route. What is known as a flying survey can be carried out at a very small cost. We could have a reasonable trial survev at a cost which would be moderate, though greater than that of a flying survey. There might also be a permanent survey, but that is not to be thought of at this stage.",39
276,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We shall not spend more than the amount provided for in the,39
277,Mr MCLEAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It appears to me that if the. Government are careful to keep the within the limit of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 honourable members will be treating Western Australia in a rather churlish fashion if they refuse to spend that comparatively small sum to ascertain whether the cono f the proposed line can be justified on its merits. In voting for a trial survey, I wish it . to be distinctly underto stood that I d'o not commit myself in any way to the ultimate construction of the line. I say this the more emphatically because of some remarks attributed to the right honourable Treasurer. I do not know whether the right honourable gentleman made these remarks in one of his genial after-dinner speeches, but I have read somewhere that he he would consider that those honourable who voted for the survey were committed to the building of the line.",39
278,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; I was misreported. I have never said that, and I do that there not even think it.",39
279,Mr MCLEAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It should be distinctly at this stage that in voting for a reathorough investigation we are not in any way committing ourselves to the very large expenditure which must be involved in the if we put construction of the line.,39
280,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I quite agree with that.,39
281,Mr MCLEAN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wit h that understanding, it is certainly my intention to vote for the Bill. I hope to see it pass. While I have very little hope of ultimate success, no one will be more pleased than I if the exploration of the country and the survey prove that the construction of the line can be justified on its merits. When we have all the information before us will be the proper time to consider the further question of whether the Commonwealth should undertake its construction, and, if so, on what terms and conditions. Those are matters which must be left to a - future date, and, in the meantime, I intend to support this Bill.",40
282,Mr CAMERON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wilmot) [2.27] - I rise to protest most emphatically against the waste of money which will be involved in the proposed survey of this line. Ever since the Federal Parliament has beenin existence, the construction of this railway has been a pet project of the present Treasurer, and I presume, also, of other honourable members representing Western Australian constituencies. I well remember that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in the first Parliament, who was one of the ablest men. who ever came from Western Australia, and who had a thorough knowledge of this project, was emphatically against it until, first of all, the existing ""State railways were connected with Esperance Bay.",40
283,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Frobabl y that is why Kalgoorlie recognised that gentleman's merit.,40
284,Mr CAMERON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,All I can say is that the people of Kalgoorlie made a very bad exchange.,40
285,Mr WATSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The electors of Kalgoorlie should be the best judges of that,40
286,Mr CAMERON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am giving only my independent' testimony on the point. It must not be forgotten that each State in the Federation must bear on a - per capita basis its share of the cost of every new scheme agreed to by this Parliament, and involving the expenditure of money. It appears to me that until the per capita arrangement is applied in other directions as well as to new expenditure, it is hardly fair to saddle the smaller States with additional expense. The history of all such surveys will, no doubt, be repeated in this case, and once we have passed this Bill we shall have presented to us such a glowing report that we shall be forthwith asked to vote money or float a loan, for the construction of the railway.",40
287,Mr STORRER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This is the thin end the wedge.,40
288,Mr CAMERON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is no doubt that it is. We find that representatives of the larger States are only too happy at all times.to permit the smaller States to come in and share on the per capita basis the cost of works from which they will derive no benefit. We do not find the same reckless prodigality exhibited when suggestions are made that in the near future the distribution of Federal revenue should be carried out on the same basis. Last session I was particularly struck with a speech delivered by the honourable member for Mernda, in which the honourable member was good enough to propose that the Braddon "" blot "" should be done away with, and that a per capita distribution of revenue should take place-that the revenues of the four principal States should be pooled per capita on the one side and the revenues of the smaller States should be pooled in the same way on the other. In making that suggestion, the honourable member entirely overlooked the provisions of the Constitution for which he is such a stickler.",40
289,Mr HARPER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I did not make that suggestion.,40
290,Mr CAMERON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable .member must excuse me, he did. I read his statement. The Constitution prevents any such fer capita arrangement as that suggested by the honourable member 1 last session. So long as the larger States show themselves unwilling, to deal liberally with the smaller States, I shall conceive it to be my duty, in the interests of the latter, to resist expenditure froni which they will derive no benefit.",40
291,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"New England) [2.32]. - I have been challenged with not possessing a sense of justice, and, therefore, I wish to say a few words on this proposal to put myself in the right j because I be-' lieve in absolute justice, so far as that is possible, in the management of human affairs. We have been told that we should authorize the survey of the proposed line because the people of Western Australia - were promised that, if they agreed to Federation, a railway would be built to connect Western Australia with the Eastern States. I know that one of the objections raised in New South Wales to the Constitution Bill was that, if it were passed, pressure would be brought to bear on the Commonwealth Government to build such a line, and, if provision had been made in the Constitution for the construction of of that line, the Bill would have received, more opposition than it did.",40
292,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would have gone through flying just the same.,41
293,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In New South Wales it did not go through flying, and I do not think that it would have gone through at all bad such a provision been contained in it. It has been said that the people of Western Australia stand in the same position in regard to the construction of the proposed railway as that in which the people of New South Wales stand in regard to the location of the Federal Capital; but, whereas it is expressly provided in the Constitution that the Federal Capital shall be located in the mother State, there is no similar provision regarding the Western Australian railway.",41
294,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is nothing in the Constitution requiring the maintenance of a residence in Sydney for the Governor General.,41
295,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is another matter. I did not take part in the discussion of the Governor General's Residences Bill, and, personally, would not care much if he were not provided with a residence in Sydney. There is, however, no parallel between the position of the Western Australians in reference to the proposed railway and that of the people of New South Wales in reference to the Capital Site question. If Western Australia was brought into Federation upon the promise that this railway would be made, that promise was given behind the backs of the people of the other States, and their votes were obtained for the Constitution by means of a deception. I voted for the survey of a route last session after a good deal of thought, but with not much enthusiasm.",41
296,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is that because the honourable member's party happened to be in power then?,41
297,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,41
298,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Surely the honourable member does not propose to reverse his vote now?,41
299,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am! older and more experienced than I was then, anil every man, as he gains greater wisdom, is entitled to make use of it. If I voted wronfflv on one occasion, there is no reason why I should not reverse my vote on the first opportunity. I did not vote for this survey Avithout conditions. conditions have been fulfilled in some respects, but not entirely, and I shall require their embodiment in the Bill before I vote for it again, because I cannot accept the promise made last session.",41
300,Mr SKENE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What conditions are they?,41
301,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The chief condition is that the land on both sides of the line shall be reserved for a distance of twenty-five miles back from it'.,41
302,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It has already been reserved in Western Australia.,41
303,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not tliink that the Commonwealth should incur expenditure to benefit South Australia and Western Australia only; but I shall vote for the Bill if I am assured by responsible persons that South Australia, as well as Western Australia, will make this reservation.",41
304,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is insisting upon an impracticable condition.,41
305,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it fair to the' other States that the Commonwealth should pay money to improve the value of land in South Australia and Western Australia, and get no return ?",41
306,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The CommonAvealth improves the value of land in a NeAv South WalestoAvnshipAvhen it erects a post-office there.,41
307,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It .does the same thing Avhen it erects a post-office in Western Australia. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth has put up A'ery feAv post-offices in NeAv South Wales, because the State Government had done really too much in that direction prior to Federation. If I had my Avay, the added value given to land by improvements of this kind AA'ould be returned by means of a land value tax.",41
308,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A Federal land tax?,41
309,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . I Would not A'ote for a proposal like that of the leader of the Labour PartA^, which I consider outrageous. I shall vote against the second reading of the Bill unless the condition to which I ha\'e referred is fulfilled. We Avere told last session that both Western Australia and South Australia Would comply with the conditions which Avere laid doAvn.",41
310,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"South Australia is not at all "" sweet"" on the project.",41
311,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the CommonAvealth enhances the value of land in those States by expenditure shared in by all the States, it is rot too much to require the reservation of land along the route to enThose able it to obtain a return of that value.",41
312,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the honourable member have the New South Wales Parliament adopt such a rule?,41
313,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes . I have for years advocated that principle. It is outrageous that private persons should pocket the increased value given to land by Government expenditure.,41
314,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member believe in a betterment tax?,42
315,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . I do not think that a betterment tax could be imposed in this instance; but it is reasonable to ask for the reservation of which I have spoken, .so that the Commonwealth may obtain a return for its expenditure.",42
316,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member believe in land nationalization?,42
317,Mr LONSDALE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . I think that the quicker the States get rid of their land, the better it will be, so long as they receive a return for their expenditure upon it. There is no doubt that the land through which the line would pass would become much more valuable, and I think that the Commonwealth would have a perfect right to avail itself of any advantage that might accrue in that respect. I shall certainly vote against the second reading of the Bill , unless we are absolutely assured that the land through which the line would pass will be reserved.",42
318,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Corangamite) [2.46] The Minister asked us to consider this question from an' Australian stand-point, and it is from that point of view that I desire to discuss it . On this occasion it suited the Minister to quote the opinion of Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, but in other instances that officer's views have not been received with much favour by hon01 able members on the Government benches. I think it is quite possible that within the next century there may be a reasonable demand for the construction of the proposed railway.",42
319,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,H as the honourable member read Major-General Hutton's statements with regard to the importance of the line from a military stand-point?,42
320,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; but I do not intend to discuss that aspect of the matter; I leave that to the honourable member. I wish to enter my protest against even a survey of the proposed line being made. At the present stage in our history I do not think that such a work is justifiable. The Minister contended that the construction of a railway would contribute largely to the development of the vast unsettled area that lies between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie, but I should like to point out that Western Australia and South Ausall tralia should do a great deal more than they have done up to the present in the way of developing their territories before they ask us to incur an expenditure such as that now contemplated.",42
321,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wester n Australia is spending large sums of money in that direction.""",42
322,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then she is only doing her duty. We have no evidence that the country through which the line would pass holds out such prospects as the Minister would have us believe. The reports of those who have travelled through it, and particularly the report of the Treasurer, who has written a very interesting description of his experiences, show that the lives of those who took part in the expeditions were in constant danger owing to the want of water.",42
323,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Bore s have been put down recently, and water has been struck.",42
324,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Notwithstanding that, all the'reports available to us confirm what the Treasurer told us as to the character of the country when he passed through it . For the greater part of the distance between Fort Augusta and Kalgoorlie no water of any consequence has been discovered, and we know that the rainfall is very small indeed.'",42
325,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How does the honourable member know that?,42
326,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I gather that from the reports.,42
327,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Th'at applies to only about 400 milesi of the distance.,42
328,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Treasurer speaks of 400 miles as if it were nothing, but his report shows that it was no small matter for him to cover that distance. It was a matter of life and death to him and his party'. However, all' these matters, are secondary considerations. What we have to consider is whether the railway would prove of sufficient value to the whole of Australia-leavin g out of consideration Western Australia, or any other individual State-to justify its construction at the present moment.",42
329,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That question can be answered in the affirmative.,42
330,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That would be proved one way or the other by the survey.,42
331,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think it would.,42
332,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,At least we should get the information we can on the subject.,42
333,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think we should be justified in spending /even the amount proposed in making the survey. I contend that up to the present time we have nothing before us to indicate that the line would prove of any special value, or that any appreciable development would result from its construction. Therefore, I shall vote against the Bill. I believe that some time during the next century it may prove desirable to make the survey, and that, probably, during the succeeding century the construction of the line will be justified. At present, however, we should not be warranted in taking any action in that direction. The Minister told us that there was every prospect of valuable minerals being found. We are all very glad that such valuable mineral discoveries have been made in Western Australia, and we acknowledge that they have proved of inestimable advantage to the whole of the Commonwealth. In view of the magnificent work that has been done by the pioneers of the Western Australian goldfields, I am quite certain that if there had been any minerals of value in the territory lving between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta they would have been brought to light long before this.",43
334,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Western Australian Government intend to equip a prospecting party that will travel with the survey party and search the country for minerals.,43
335,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Western Austraspeaking lian Government might very well equip their prospecting party, and send it out forehand, so that information might be tained which would assist us very materi- £2,500.000. ally in coming to a conclusion. absence of reliable supplies of water, the pastoral value of the country is very",43
336,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Bores are now being put down.,43
337,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , no doubt; but how are the people who take up the country for pastoral purposes to put down bores ? Are they to take their flocks and herds into the country before the water is found?",43
338,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,-Herd s have already been taken through the country.,43
339,Mr WILSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Onl v under tional conditions. We know that rain falls very seldom, and that the absence of water line. is the great difficulty in the way of settlement. The district is now uninhabited, and I believe that for many years to come it will continue to be so-that, in fact, will be found to be uninhabitable. I should like to apply to this tract of country which have been used in regard to another portion of AustraliaCurse the railway, curse the track, Cur.se a'.l the way there, and all the way back, Curse the rlies, and curse the weather, And cur.se the desert altogether.",43
340,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wannon) [2.55] - I hope that the House will not pass this Bill . I feel sure that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 . will not be sufficient to defray the cost of the survey of a line extending for 1,100 miles through extraordinarily difficult country. Expert engineers, like Sir William Zeal, who have had an experience extending over a lifetime, say that the survey would be more likely to ' cost between £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 than £ 2 0 , 0 0 0. Therefore, if we passed the measure, we should probably be called upon to sanction fresh drafts upon the Treasury next year.",43
341,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The sum has been fixed by the engineers themselves.,43
342,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then when the'survey had been completed, demands would be made for the construction of the line. This Bill is only the first step towards the construction of the line, to which I am entirely opposed . I have here copies of some 1 reports issued by the Government of Western Australia, from which I have obtained information which satisfies, me that we should not rush into this expenditure at the present time. The Treasurer, when at the Premiers' Conference, at which he endeavoured to make provision in be the Constitution for the construction of the obrailway, estimated that it would cost Since that time, the esti-In the mates have grown enormously.",43
343,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The proceedings small. of that Conference were not reported.,43
344,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Treasurer made that statement to the Conference and to the press.,43
345,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Whenc e did the honourable and learned member obtain his information ?,43
346,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Fro m the records. The late Mr O'Connor, when he was Engineer-in-Chief for Western Australia, es 'imated that the proposed line would cost very excep- £ 4 . 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",43
347,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That was for a wide-gauge,43
348,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am perfectly aware of that. Whilst we are on the gauge question, I would point out that if a line were it constructed from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie upon the 4 f t . 8£ in. gauge, the present words railway from Port Augusta to Terowie, which is only 3 f t . 6 in. in gauge, .would have to be reconstructed, and the Commonwealth would probably be asked to bear a portion of the cost. Then, again, the Western Australian Government would probably ask us to assist them to widen the gauge of the present line from Kalgoorlie to Perth. I would also point out that the present line from Terowie to Adelaide is on the 5 f t . 3 in. gauge. Mr. Muir, Inspector of Engineering Surveys in Western Australia, also made a report, in which be estimated that the proposed railway from Kalgoorlie to the South Australian border- a little more than half the total length-woul d cost £1.730.000. Therefore, we may assume that, according to his estimate, the proposed new line would cost for the whole distance, £3,500,000. A committee of railway experts, which met in Melbourne during the term of the first Federal Parliament, drew up a report which was presented to the House by the then Minister of Home A f fairs. Their estimate was £4,500.000. Thus we have three estimates by persons who were apparently favourable to the construction of the line, varying from £ 3,500,00 0 to £4.500,000 . perts have expressed the opinion that the line would cost considerably more.",43
349,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And some of thern think that it would cost less. Mr ROBINSON.i- I should .like to know who they are. The estimate of the Inter-State railways experts did not include the cost of providing a water supply.,44
350,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Oh , no.",44
351,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I say that their report states that the cost of providing a water supply has'been omitted from their calculations. Now, what would be the protanks. bable cost of insuring an adequate' water supply? The sum may run from anyvery, large sum of money. thing up to £ 7 5 0 , 0 0 0, Sir JOHN FORREST . - I do not think they put said that; if so, I should like to see it.",44
352,Mr ROBIN SON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Thei r report was laid upon the table of the House on 24th July, J903. Mr O'Connor, in his report, estimates the cost of water supply at £ 5 9 4 , 0 0 0 .",44
353,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is far too I am analyzing the evidence much in the light of our present knowgentlemen ledge.,44
354,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Mr John Muir estheir timated that between Kalgoorlie and the South Australian border, a distance nf miles, or less than half that of the total length of the line, the cost of providing [3i] water supply would be £ 1 8 3 , 0 0 0 . If we double that estimate, so as to insure a water supply over the whole distance which the railway would traverse, the expenditure would be, approximately, £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 .",44
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But the whole of that country is not so badly off for water.,44
356,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,L am quite aware of that. But the fact remains that it is country possessing a very low rainfall.,44
357,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable and learned member mean to say that of Fowler's Bay, where there are numerous farms ?",44
358,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is true that there are one of two good spots on the route, but practically the whole of the country that would be traversed by the line has a very low rainfall. Here is Mr Muir's report upon the subjectI am quite satisfied that the country we have been exploring is almost, if not quite, waterless. The natives evidently obtain their water supply from the mallee and other roots, numerous heaps of which are to be seen lying about, and a blackfellow will not, I believe, have recourse to these rcots if he can obtain water within anything like a reasonable distance. Other ex- That is a pretty strong declaration to make. He further says, upon page 8 of his reportAs will be seen by my general remarks, the proposed railway would traverse about 475 miles of country in this State, which is, to all intents and purposes, waterless. Of this length, for the first 100 miles water can be conserved in tanks, using the granite and ironstone ridges in the localities as a means of catchment. But for the remaining 375 miles, in the lime-stone country, the porous nature of the soil precludes any hope of being able to conserve surface supplies.",44
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We could cement,44
360,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That would cost a Mr Muir goes on to show that it might be necessary to down bores. These would cost £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 for a certain poition of the whole distance. There is no warrant for assumthe ing that artesian water can be found.",44
361,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He is in favour of providing a putting down bores.,44
362,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know that he is. of those who are favourable to the line, with a view to showing that even upon statements it is an undertaking which we should be very chary of sanctioning 475 for many years to come'. Further, I find from the testimony of these gentlemen thut a very grave doubt exists as to whether a line can be constructed at anything like a reasonable cost, and whether a water supply can be obtained.",44
363,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable and learned member say that the cost of a. water supplv is not included in the estimate of £4,50.0,000? .",45
364,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am under the impression that it is not.,45
365,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is included, as will be seen by reference to the schedule.",45
366,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was in error that point, for which I am sorry. Leaving that item out of consideration, I still saythat the cost of constructing the projected railway would be £4,250,000, exclusive of the amount that would be involved in insuring a water supply. Now we all know that the expenditure which would be i ncurred in providing a water supply is necessarily a matter of conjecture. Here are two men who have had better facilities for judging of the cost' of providing a water supply than have the engineers",45
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Mr Muir went over the country. .,45
368,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am aware of that. His testimony is that to insure a water supply between Kalgoorlie and the South Australian border, which is less than half the total length of the line, an expenditure would have to be incurred of £ 1 8 3 , 0 0",45
369,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"After seeing Mr Muir's report, the engineers reduced their estimate by £500,000.",45
370,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Mr Muir's report was written to put the project ir. the most favourable light. Mr GROOM,-That is not correct.",45
371,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The engineers of all the States reported upon it.,45
372,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Thei r report assumes that the working expenses of this line, which would traverse a more or less watersupporter less country, would represent about 55 per cent, of the revenue accruing from it , withstanding that in Western Australia the proportion of the working expenses of railways to the total revenue derived thereChamber, from is nearer 80 per cent. In, other words the engineers claim that the working excause penses of this particular line would be very much less than those of far more favourably-situated railways.",45
373,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable and learned member must bear in mind that it taken place. would practically traverse very .level country.,45
374,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But there are other things to be considered. For instance, there is the cost of stacking coal along the route, the repairs which would require to be undertaken, and the maintenance of the line. The cost of all these things, having in view the difficulty that; would be experienced in getting men to live in the country through which the line would pass, would be veryheavy indeed. Further, the engineers have reduced the allowance for contingencies by. upon a very substantial amount.",45
375,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has the honourable and learned member seen a copy of Mr . Gwenneth's report ?,45
376,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not. I do not say that there are no reports favourable to the construction of the line, but I do say that the reports generally present sufficient evidence to make us very chary about sanctioning the undertaking.",45
377,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It seems to be a question of which Prime Minister will put the measure through Parliament.,45
378,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I venture to say that had a division upon this Bill been taken within six weeks after the assembling of the present' Parliament, it would have received very short shrift indeed. It was owing to the necessity which Governments were under to maintain friendly' relations 0 . with the five powerful representatives 'from Western Australia, that the measure was included in so many Ministerial programmes.",45
379,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,All the leading men in this Parliament are committed to it .,45
380,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is quite correct.,45
381,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They were committed to it long before we had Federation.,45
382,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Unfortunately , they have been committed to it one by one. I do not think that even my honourable friend, who is such an enthusiastic and excellent of this line, will deny the accuracy of my. statement that, had a divi < notsion been taken on the Bill within six weeks after the - meeting of this Parliament, the it would never haye got beyond this",45
383,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Oh , yes it would, be the right honourable member for East Sydney wanted to get into office even then.",45
384,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The line has ob-. tained a factitious support by reason of the frequent changes of Government which have Now that it seems unlikely that another change will take place before the general election, the present seems an opportune time to deal effectively with the Bill. Our constituents know that if we are committed to the proposal which it contains, and if £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 proves insufficient to complete the survey, we shall have to vote an additional sum to see it through. We cannot carry the survey to the borders of South Australia and then abandon the work.",45
385,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Government say that they will not spend more than £20,000.",46
386,Mr ROBINSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Othe r surveyors declare that the undertaking; will cost £ 5 0 , or £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 . Does the Treasurer wish me to believe that if the expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 suffices only for half the survey, the Government will not complete it? Does he mean to suggest that he would vote against any further expenditure? The fact is that when once we put our hand to the proposed survey, we shall have to undertake the construction of the line. do not believe in the building of the railway, and therefore I shall not vote for the survey of a route. I hope that our brethren in 'another place will maintain the firm attitude that they took up on this measure last session. If they do, they will save the country an expenditure of ^£20,000possibly much more - and postpone for a considerable period the project of building this so-called transcontinental railway.",46
387,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Moira) [3.12] - I have practically nothing fresh to say uppn this Bill , except that the Minister in charge of it has designated the construction of the proposed railway as a "" national work."" I have heard many definitions of a national work, but in Victoria such works have usually involved the State in a dead loss. Even the most ardent supporters of the Bill cannot find any justification for their action. It is strange indeed that the survey of a route should be proposed before the sanction of one of the States through which the line would pass has been obtained. I pointed out last session that the South Australian Government has refused point blank to assent to the construction of a railway through its territory until the route which it would follow has been determined.",46
388,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,South Australia is willing that the survey should be undertaken.,46
389,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course. work would cost her nothing',. Similarly, Western Australia is willing to agree to the construction of the proposed railway, because it would cost her nothing. [31]- 2",46
390,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It would cost the people of that State just as much per head as it would the people of Victoria.,46
391,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It would cost them as much per head, but in the sum total the amount they would contribute would be very small. The estimate of those who have been asked to report upon the proposed line is that its construction would involve an outlay of £5,000,000 .",46
392,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of about £3,700,000.",46
393,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, the 0 0 0 opinion of the Treasurer is entitled to far more consideration than is that of the experts. I do not question that for a moment the report of the engineers to whom the matter was referred. It is signed by Mr.  of Queensland, Mr Moncrieff, of South Australia, Mr Kernot, of Victoria, and Mr. Palmer, of Western Australia, who estimate I the cost of construction at just a shade over £5,000,000.",46
394,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is not the last report.,46
395,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course it is not. As that estimate would alarm honourable members who were advocating the construction of the railway, the authorities wanted a lower estimate, in order to induce people to come in and give their support.",46
396,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member think this fair?,46
397,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I should assume .that it is fair.,46
398,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What influence had we with the engineers? None at all. Did we try to exercise any influence?,46
399,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I asked for the latest' information on the subject, and in reply I received this report, dated March, 1903.",46
400,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They went to look at the country themselves.,46

403,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I suppose they have not returned yet.,46
404,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,After seeing the land they reduced their estimate by half-a-million.,46
405,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Allowin g full credit to the engineers for that reduction, I think it must be admitted by all those who have taken an interest in large undertakings of Thit this kind, that, generally speaking, the estimate of cost is exceeded by the actual expenditure. My experience has been that in nearly every instance the estimate of the cost of a work involving a large expenditure has been exceeded. What I have been at a loss to understand is the fact that this so called magnificent pastoral country, situated, as it is, within a reasonable distance of a market, and abutting on the seaboard, is practically unstoeked today.",46
406,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Because there is no surf3.ee Welter.,47
407,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We are told that ining vestigation has proved that there is a water supply. But what does it amount to ? After these putting down a bore for over 2,000 feet, is ^205,860. a supply of 70,000 gallons per day was obtained. Will any man in his right mind report than that. say that any stock-owner or person interested in stock would go out and stock country where there was a rainfall of less than 5 inches a year? Will any one that country in which, after putting down a bore for over 2,000 feet, a supply of quoting from. 70,000 gallons of brackish water per day is obtained is pastoral country?",47
408,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is fit for the purposes of stock - the revenue also will be probably doubled.,47

412,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have it from men who of water carriage? have lived in the country for years that the rainfall is over 15 inches per annum.,47
413,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is a strange thing that men who have been asked to report upon this country say that the aborigines fields. keep off it for a considerable portion of the year.,47
414,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The rainfall is not served.,47
415,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is all very well for the honourable member to say that there of the country. is a rainfall of 15 inches per year, but ' Mr KENNEDY there is no official record to support the statement. It would be better, in the first place, to prove that the records are wrong than to contradict them.",47
416,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Eve n these reports show that the line will earn a profit in course of a few years.,47
417,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, on paper it is easy to prove anything. In their mates of traffic the engineers take produce landed at Fremantle, and say how much the return will amount to. Then they go on to say that they do not take credit for the whole of this traffic.",47
418,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Fro m which report is the honourable member quoting?,47
419,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am quoting from paragraph 8 of the report, dated March, 1903. They sayWe have been furnished with particulars showpassenger and stock movements at the' port of Fremantle, which we have carefully considered, and we have taken a. portion only of as a basis for our revenue' estimate, which",47
420,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is a later,47
421,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know that it would throw much more light upon the subject, and I do not think that the honsay orable member could get any better authorities than those whose report I am If , when the line has been opened for traffic for ten years the population of Western Australia is double the present number-and many authorities anticipate a greater progress than this investigation of the sources of expected revenue would probably lead to our being able to increase these estimates. it enter into the mind of any man who has had anything to do with the movement of produce where water and land carriage are available that there is the slightest possibility of a single pound of produce being carried from the Eastern States to Western Australia by rail when there is the option",47
422,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They would have to bring it 400 odd miles.,47
423,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Perishabl e produce to any quantity would be sent to the gold,47
424,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The perishable produce would toe out of the reach of the conwage-earners on the gold-fields.,47
425,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think that the honourable member knows the geography - I do not know everything, but I shall be able to speak a little more clearly if the Treasurer will permit me to express myself in my own way. As a proof of the accuracy of my observation, let me quote the experience the that we have had where railway's exist. Take, for instance, the movements of stock, cattle, or sheep from Queensestiland to the southern ports of Victhe toria, when there isa market for them here. Will any man connected with the business attempt for one moment to send stock here by rail ? Some years ago I had some experience in the business, when it would have beeni profitable to send stock from Queensland to Victoria in times of scarcity, but we found that the railway rates were really prohibitive. Taking even the special rate quoted-and it was a great reduction on the ordinary ratestock could be carried by boat for practically a third less. Assuming Adelaide to be the port of shipment, and that the railway was made right through to Kalgoorlie. I venture to say that there would not be any possibility of the men engaged in the business attempting to send stock by rail when they would have the option of sending it by boat.",47
426,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Stil l we think that they would send it .,48
427,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He r e is the experience that we 'have every day,48
428,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And every, one else thinks so too.",48
429,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the honourable member talking of the question of carrying stock into the gold-fields of Western Australia?,48
430,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I can conceive that the honourable member for Moira has great difficulty in making his speech. If honourable members who are interjecting so frequently would reserve their remarks until they speak ii? reoly, it would be much more in accordance with the rules of the House.",48
431,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have no objection to rhe interjections, except when they tend to prevent me from conveying my impressions in my own way. Take the same conditions with regard to produce carried over a short or long distance. In Victoria we have on our sea-board railways in competition with water carriage. Take a point on our railways such as Sale. that owing to the peculiar conditions which prevail, and the charges for water carriage, consignors' can send goods from Melbourne by boat to Sale, and get them carried back 30 to 40 miles to the 100-mile limit on the railway-that is, towards Melbourne-at a cheaper rate than they can get them carried 100 miles by railway. We know that it is the height of absurdity for men when making estimates as to the maintenance of this line to think that there is a possibility of there being practically any return from the carriage of goods or stock from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie. But if this is such a wonderfully good thing, what surprises me is that the people of Western Australia, with theii great enterprise, do not keep it to themselves. In ordinary life when a friend comes to a man with "" a good thing,"" possibly the best plan to adopt is to knock him down at once. We are told by the representatives of Western Australia that this railway will be a really good thing for the Commonwealth. I have never known either a State or an individual not to have the first of a good thing. We have had the opinions of the military authorities with regard to the necessity of this railway for defence purposes.",48
432,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member will not quote them.,48
433,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On a previous occasion I quoted from the report of .these authorities, who simply say that it is the height of absurdity to think that the line is necessary for defence purposes under existing conditions. Looking a little further ahead , no saneman will say that it 1 would be the mail route of the future from Australia to the old world.",48
434,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I will .,48
435,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course, the right honourable member will.",48
436,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Bii t I am not sane though, according to the honourable member.",48
437,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The right honourable member has his eyes fixed upon one little spot on the western coast. Looking to the future, the mail route will be vid the north of Australia.",48
438,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Throug h foreign country.,48
439,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The r e is no more risk of our mails getting on to foreign country in sending them vid Port Danvin than there is in sending them via Fremantle, and the route would .be much more direct. The chief obstacle in the way of We find this Bill is that one of the States most materially concerned has refused! to assent to the construction of the railway.",48
440,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,South Australia has. not refused her assent to the project.,48
441,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"South Australia was asked to give her assent, and the official papers show that it was refused.",48
442,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is only postponed.,48
443,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"U p to the present time, according to the official papers, South Australia has refused her consent to the construction of a railway to Western Australia. She gives reasons for her refusal, but whether they are correct or not is not for me to determine. I may assume that there are reasons which have influenced the Government in coming to its present determination. What is the authority for fixing the estimate at £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 ?",48
444,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The advice of the engineers.,49
445,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not seen any report from engineers intimating what the cost would probably be. But I have seen it in print, on the authority, not only of railway surveyors, but of engineers of construction, that nothing less than £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 will cover the cost.",49
446,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who are they ?,49
447,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Senato r Styles is one.,49
448,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is he a surveyor? plain. He was a contractor, I think.",49
449,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"He has been both, and I am prepared to take his estimate preference to that of a layman.",49
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have surveyed' - more country than Senator Styles, I think.",49
451,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,""" If we are to have a survey which will be of any use whatever, we must have an idea as to what it is likely to cost. I know that in Victoria we have, as a matter of fact, spent something like half-a-million sterling on surveys of railways that there is no hope whatever of constructing for generations to come. What is more, when the permanent surveys are made, it is almost invariably found that the estimates mad'e on flying surveys are misleading. I feel sure that if the Government embarks upon this proposal the same result will follow. It is a peculiar thing that every Government which has held office in the Commonwealth has felt it to be incumbent upon it to include this survey in - its pla'tform as a national work.",49
452,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It shows that there is no prejudice against it on the part of Governments.,49
453,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know that it is a matter of prejudice; it is rather a matter of policy. One honourable member who was formerly in favour of the survey has seen fit to alter his mind, and I think that, on reflection, it is possible that others will realise that they have been under a misapprehension. Before the House comes to a determination on the second reading, I trust that the Minister will, furnish us with the authority on which he has come to the conclusion that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 will complete the survey.",49
454,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is an estimate based upon the adivice of the engineers of the States.",49
455,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,W h e r e is their report?,49
456,Mr GROOM,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The estimate is not .contained in any report, but it was arrived at upon tlieir advice.",49
457,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have a vivid impression of what' has occurred, particularly in Viatoria, as the result of flying, surveys. They cost a good deal of money, but, with the exception of furnishing information as to the character of the .country traversed, they are practically of no value as to what the actual cost of construction will be.",49
458,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This is very easycountry. There are 400 miles of level,49
459,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We have many miles of level plain country in Victoria and New in South Wales, and when a strong wind blows, the rails are covered with sand.",49
460,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member's vision is limited to Victoria. This is limestone plain country.,49
461,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It may be fhat I take a circumscribed view of the matter, but we have no reliable data on which to base an estimate of the cost of construction. In Victoria We have spent considerable sums of money on flying surveys, but when subsequently the permanent surveys have been made, the estimates have been more than doubled. I do not feel that I am warranted in changing the opinions - which I have held from the outset. I have looked into the facts, and have come to the conclusion that under existing circumstances, I am hot justified in voting; for a Bill which will ultimately involve the expenditure of at least £5,000,000. Mr. WILKS - Did not the honourable member vote for the expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 for the upkeep of. New Guinea? That sum is voted every year for that purpose, but this Bill only requires £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 to be spent once.",49
462,Mr KENNEDY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I voted for the expenditure of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 to secure New Guinea as part and parcel of the Commonwealth and of the Empire. That was a matter of national importance. But I do not admit that the proposed railway is of national importance; and if it is, I see no reason why it should not be built as all the other railways of Australia have been built, by the States concerned. We are entitled to more information from the Government than we have had. We ought at least to know upon what data the engineers base their estimate that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 will be sufficient for the survev. - Mr KELLY (Wentworth) [3.40] - The first consideration which weighs with me in approaching this question is the undoubted fact that the Government, during the recess-urgently , no doubt, as it applied itself to this subject-ha s not been able to carry out a recommendation made by the Senate on this measure last session. Ths Bill, as the House knows, was shelved in the Senate by means of the following amendment: That all words after "" be "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words further considered until evidence that liament of South Australia has formally consented to the Commonwealth constructing that portion of the proposed railway which would be in South Australian territory has been laid on the table of the Senate."" The Minister has not been able House that he has received the agreement of the Parliament of South Australia in the this regard. That is the first consideration which affects me in approaching sure, for we should be very careful, before we come into conflict with another place on a question which vitally concerns States rights. Until the expressed desire Senate in this particular .has been met in the way required, it is idle for this House to go ahead with the Bill. There is not the slightest doubt that the adhere to the decision previously given.",49
463,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is the honourable member paper. always prepared to ""climb down"" to the Senate ?",50
464,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am always prepared, when the Senate asks- |for a reasonable thing, to see what can be done to meet its wishes. What the Senate has asked is only gentleman. reasonable, as I shall endeavour to show later on. The Minister, in introducing measure, told us that we must not this scheme merely from the point of view of the money involved. From the point of view of any one who wishes to see this measure pass, his injunction was a parinformation ticularly wise one.  not say this last session.",50
465,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I spoke in exactly the same sense, and with the same object view.",50
466,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And then the honourable tained- a pamphlet. member voted for the second reading of the Bill? , Mr KELLY - No doubt my action should be a warning to any one who wants to meet the supporters of this When the Bill was formerly before the House, I explained carefully'that I would go to the length of voting for the second reading on the chance of having included in the measure, in Committee, a provision safeguarding the taxpayers of the Commonwealth as a whole. Those honourable members who are now so generous in trying to trip me up, should recollect that all honourable members were led into believing that if they voted for the survey they would not be committing themselves to ""the railway. "" not I , however, certainly think that they are the Parcommitting themselves to the railway.",50
467,Mr WATKINS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why ?,50
468,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Because the Treasurer, in Adelaide, in December last, just after this House had passed the Survey Bill, to tell the spoke as follows:He was quite satisfied that the proposal for construction of the line would be received just as well as that for the survey. the meaThe Treasurer went onOtherwise it would be improper for honourable members to have voted as they had for an expenditure of ,£20,000, as that would then have been of the so much waste money.",50
469,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who said that?,50

529,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , but the honourable gentleman was, I think, showing a little heat just now. It is better that we should put this matter on a sound basis. I suggest to the Government that, having heard these extracts from the descriptions given by the Treasurer, they might consider whether the debate might not now be reasonably adjourned, with a view to the further consideration of the measure-on Tuesday. What are we committed to if we pass this Bill? It is true that it is only to provide for a survey, but I feel that the Treasurer would have been quite right in saying that we shall be taking a wrong course of action in passing a Bill to provide for the survey if we are not prepared, subsequently, to endorse the verdict of the experts invited to conduct it. That appears to me to be a reasonable contention.",53
530,Mr CARPENTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member looks at a motor car, is that any guarantee that he will buy it?",53
531,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I would not pay an expert to examine a motor car if I .were determined not to buy one. and the people's representatives in this House should not act more foolishly in the transaction of public affairs than they would in honourable private life. We must consider now the ultimate as well as the immediate results of passing this measure. If the proposed survey is made, Parliament will probably be committed to an expenditure of from £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 for the construction of a railway. We shall thus be forced to initiate an era of borrowing, ancl to compete with the States in the London money market. All the members of the Labour Party, including the representatives of Western Australia, and many other members of the House, have announced themselves as opposed to Commonwealth borrowing, and I understand that it is a plank in the platform of that party that there shall be no borrowing by the ComThere monwealth.",53
532,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I believe in borrowing We for reproductive purposes.,53
533,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The plank of the Labour Party is no Commonwealth borrowing, without any qualifications. However, as I understand that there is a desire to adjourn now, I ask permission to resume my remarks on Tuesday next. Leave granted; debate adjourned. the PAPERS. MINISTERS laid upon the table the following papers:Report of the Royal Commission upon the Ocean Shipping Service. Money Orders, regulation 4, Statutory Rules 1906, No . 40. ADJOURNMENT. TRADE MARKS ACT REGULATIONS. Motion (by Sir JOHN FORREST) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",53
534,Mr WILKS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Dalley) '[4.1] - I complained last night that - the regulations necessary for the administration p f the Trade Marks Act have not yet been published, although the Act was passed seven months ago. I should like to know, seeing that the employers are able to take advantage of the provisions relating to trade marks, when the employees will be able to take advantage of the trade union label provisions ?",53
535,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.2] - The regulations were passed today, and will be published into-night's Gazette. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.3 p.m.",53
