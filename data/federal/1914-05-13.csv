1,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I ask the Prime M in ister what Parliament is to understand, from the following statement:The present Government hod put fiscalismout of the bonds of a Parliament that was not competent to deal with it. 'It had been put. into the hands of men who were able to apply business treatment to a question of business. Are we to understand from that statement that the Inter-State Commission will! - draw up a set of recommendations which the Government will adopt in the form of a Bill?",11
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I mean nothing of the kind. Evidently my honourable friend has been reading what some of mycritics are saying. I am responsible not their setting of the matter, but tlieir will? my own.",11
3,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The statement which I have read is part of the report of a meetNew Guinea. ing addressed by the Prime Minister in Sydney.,12
4,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I ask the honourable member to put his question on the notice-paper. POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT. MATERNITY ALLOWANCE-PREFERENC E TO UNIONISTS.,12
5,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Has the Prime MinMinister ister read an address by the Attorneyto General, reported in yesterday's metrothe politan newspapers, in which that honorcolleague able gentleman declares that he is enGovernmenttirely against the maternity allowance, and would, if he had his way, wipe it out, and that he would also refuse to allow preference to be given to unionists, either by Government action or by a legal tribunal. I ask further whether that the policy of the Government?",12
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I again remind the House, as I have done on several previous get' occasions, that it has been ruled rereply peatedly that questions founded on newsing? paper statements are not in order unless the questioner makes himself responsible personally for the accuracy of the report which he quotes.",12

10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not opposite aware of any blackbirding there, but should be glad if the honourable member will bring under my notice any facts in his possession regarding the matter.",12
11,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The Government will have the House with them in putting a stop to blackbirding. Mr MoWILLIAMS - I ask if drastic steps are being taken to prevent New Guinea natives from being deceived, and indentured practically without their for, knowledge, and in some cases against",12
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I hope that that is not the condition of affairs in,12
13,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,I am afraid that it is.,12
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In that case, the matter is very serious, and will be considered by the Government. DOUBLE DISSOLUTION. , Mr MCDONALD - I ask the Primo if his attention has been drawn a statement by the Vice-President of Executive Council at Echuca. His is reported to have said of the They had' a great programme, which they would give to the people when they were ready for it. They awaited the decision of the new Governor General whether they would be allowed to go to the country or not. Is it true, as the remarks quoted indiis cate, that a double dissolution has already been asked for and refused? Can the Prime Minister say when we shall from the new Governor General the for which, according to the honourable senator, the Government are wait",12
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is regretable that one of so much experience and discernment as the honourable member should not have become aware long ago that it is not customary for Governments to tell the House all that transpires in communications with Governor General.,12
16,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The Vice-President of the Executive Council should be,12
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not aware that the honourable senator has said anything wrong. Honourable members constantly try to read into I speeches delivered by those on this side meanings which no sane and reasonable man would, or should, attribute to them. QUACK ADVERTISEMENTS.",12
18,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs observed the advertisement of a person who calls himself "" Kalma "" the Healer? Is he aware that - this person is said to have been prosecuted under the Victorian Pure Foods Act and convicted, and that, on appeal, the conviction was quashed by the Full Court cn the ground that the article sold was not a food within the meaning of the Act?",12
19,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"What is advertised? Mr BRENNAN"" - This man advertises that he cures diseases of all kinds. Will the honourable gentleman take the steps necessary to invest this Parliament with power in respect to commerce to deal with frauds of this kind ?",13

21,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs why he is adopting a different method in connection with the present outbreak of smallpox from that which he adopted a few months ago?,13
22,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Because it is not smallpox.,13
23,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am not aware that any different method has been adopted, but if the honourable member will indicate more particularly what he means, I shall be better able to give an answer. EEDERAL CAPITAL.",13
24,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Is the words. Honorary Minister in a position to give any information .as to the progress of works at the Eederal Capital?,13
25,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I could give my honourable friend a great deal of information if the House would be content to listen me. If the honourable member will place any questions on the notice-paper, I shall be only too happy to answer them.",13
26,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"Is it a fact that work has been practically stopped, and, if so, when is it intended to resume it?",13
27,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"It is not a fact that work has been stopped. Advertisements plications, had been examined. have already appeared calling for tenders for certain sections of the work in consaid nexion with the Mount Stromlo reservoir, the reservoir on the top of Red Hill , the completion of the pipe line between the two; and, further, in connection with the main sewer.",13

29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I remind the honourable member that he and other honourable members have for the last month prevented any questions being answered. In my opinion, it is time these informal questions ceased, and that we proceeded with the real questions and the business of the country. ADJOURNMEN T (Formal). THE TARIFF.",13
30,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [2.44] - I desire to move the adjournment of the House in order to direct attention to a matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" the intolerable position in which the Government has placed the House in regard to the Tariff question."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",13
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Disgracefu l and kindly systematic obstruction!,13
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I must ask the Prime Minister to withdraw those words.,13
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In compliance with your direction, sir, I withdraw the",13
34,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is not merely in compliance with my direction, but in compliance with the Standing Orders.",13
35,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I take this step because of the unsatisfactory replies that to were given by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs to questions put by me on Friday last in connection with the Tariff. We were then told by the Minister of Trade and Customs that 463 applications associated with the Tariff had been sent on to the Inter-State Commission, and that 320 witnesses, whose evidence concerned 149 apI t appears from what the honourable gentleman that there are now 300 of the applications in regard to which no witnesses and have been called, while further applications are still reaching the Commission. Furthermore, the Minister stated that up to the present evidence had been taken only in one State, and that it would be necessary for evidence to be heard in aU the States before there could be any rectification of anomalies.",13
36,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That is not what I said.,14
37,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"If the honourable gentleman did not use those exact words, he used words very like them.",14
38,Mr GROOM,Unknown,The honourable member should look at Hansard. He did not pay the Government the courtesy of notif y i ng that he intended to move the adjournment of the House.,14
39,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The Minister knows very well that the Standing Orders would prevent my quoting from the Hansard of this session; but this is the note which I took of the words used at the time. . . . so far, evidence on Tariff matters had been taken only in Victoria, and, obviously, before a progress report could be made by the Inter-State Commission in respect to any industry, those affected in other parts of Australia should be given a chance to present evidence. Mr Tudor then askedDoes that answer mean that no Tariff matters will be dealt with until the Inter-State Commission has taken evidence in every State of the Commonwealth ? The Minister of Trade and Customs repliedCertainly not. The conduct of the proceedings is entirely in the hands of the Commissioner. I do not see what other meaning can be attached to the Minister's words than that evidence is to be taken in each of the States, unless it so happens - although it is almost an impossibilitythat there is an industry confined to one State, and not affecting any other. When the Minister of Trade and Customs told us that the matter was entirely in the hands of the Inter-State Commission, the Prime Minister added, "" It is not going to be taken out of the hands of the Commissioners."" The honourable member for Maribyrnong asked that the evidence taken before the Commission should be placed before honourable members; but it has been in t i mated that this is not to be done. I , for one, absolutely refuse to be bound by the recommendations of the Tariff Commission. The Commissioners have no responsibility to my electors, and, so far as I am concerned, they are not going to perform duties that are my right in this House. We have been told that the Commissioners will give us a summary of the evidence on which they have arrived at certain conclusions; but I desire to have the whole of the evidence. The Chairman of the Inter-State Commission is a confirmed Free Trader, and was for years one of the strongest advocates of the Free Trade policy in the New South Wales Parliament; and evidence which might be satisfactory to hi m in regard to industries in my own and other electorates might not be satisfactory to me. As a matter of fact, while I sliould be glad to have a copy of the evidence, I cannot commit myself to any of the conclusions which may be arrived at by the Inter-State Commission. I submit that the Government, in referring the Tariff to the Inter-State Commission, and ' giving them no instructions as to whether a report was to be quickly presented, handed over a matter that very properly belongs to this Parliament. When the Tariff was referred to the Commission, the Government might have told the Commissioners that it was a matter of urgency, and that there should be a report at the earliest possible moment. As it is, the Commission has been sitting for nearly twelve months, and has dealt with only one State, with some 300 applications yet to be considered; and it becomes evident that during the life of this Parliament there can not even be a rectification of Tariff anomalies. This is a negation of the policy on which the present Government were returned. I have with me the report, published in the Sydney Morning Herald on the 4th A p r i l , 1913, of the policy speech delivered ait Parramatta by the Prime Minister, at that time leader of the Opposition.",14
40,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The Age accepted him as a Protectionist after that speech.,14
41,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"A f t e r stating that the T a r if f matter would be referred to an independent Board-thes e gentlemen knew at the time that the Inter-State Commission Bill had been passed-h e saidThis need not, and will not, prevent a prompt rectification of such anomalies as are discovere'd by the Department in its administration. And in Parramatta, which hitherto had been known as a Free Trade stronghold, that statement was applauded. Apparently the attitude of the Government is that there are no anomalies.",14
42,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They said there were any amount of them. . Mr JH CATTS - The Labour Government dealt with a large number of items under the Tariff, but the present Minister of Trade and Customs, speaking at Toowoomba on the 8th April of last year, said that this was altogether insufficient. The honourable member's speech covered five or six columns, and was headed with the word ""Advertisement,"" showing that it was paid for, and that it was to go forth to the people of Australia as his fully considered utterance. The honourable member complained about the small work done in regard to the rectification of Tariff anomalies by the Pisher Government, and he repeated the statement of the present Prime Minister .that there was to be a "" prompt rectifi- fess this cation of anomalies."" After the first rectification of Tariff anomalies by the Fisher Government, the previous Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra, in order to obtain evidence in connection with further anomalies, issued question sheets to manufacturers, and this investigation was proceeding when the Minister went out of office, but the need for the rectification of anomalies was so urgent, as shown by the investigations being made, that the then Prime Minister told the country that even if the electors did not amend the Constitution to enable the new Protection idea to be carried out, the Labour menb would still go on with the question of the Tariff. The result of the investigations instituted by the previous Minister of Trade and Customs were in the possession of the present Government immediately they came into office, and have been in their possession for twelve months. Will the present Minister say that the information derived does not reveal the fact that there are anomalies in regard to the Tariff? He knows perfectly well that it does. At any rate, i there were no anomalies to be rectified immediately, why did the present Prime Minister and the present Minister of Trade and Customs both refer to the need for the immediate rectification of anomalies even without waiting for the report of the Inter-State Commission?  with them in the previous three years?",14
43,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The Labour Government dealt with a considerable number of anomalies, but as the honourable reasonably member was out in the wilds of Australia, where there were no newspapers to read, apparently he does not know this, or know that the Tariff had been even mentioned in the House. But the honourable member has come here for the purpose of preventing the Tariff being dealt with. He won his seat on the statement that he would prevent any further protection being given to Australian industries. ",15
44,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The honourable member admits that he was returned to Parliament for this express purpose. ,15
45,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,If a few more honourable members opposite would con,15
46,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,On e is enough.,15
47,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Yes , one is enough, but we know there are other members on the Government side who are in the same position. What was, during the last campaign, the attitude in New South Wales of those supporting the present Government? Sir Joseph Carruthers, who stumped the country in their favour, is reported in the Daily Telegraph of the 6th May last year, to have said I have always held, and still hold, that, there is nothing which so rapidly makes for' extreme wealth on the one hand, and extreme poverty on the other, than high tariffs. Mr Wade is reported, on the 10th of May Govern- last year, to have saidMy remedy for trusts is to take away the Tariff duties on articles affected by trusts. The honourable member for Parkes in a signed letter appearing in the Daily Telegraph on 23rd April, 1913, saidBoth the Free Traders and Protectionists have, whilst preserving their respective convictions, mutually agreed to allow the Tariff to stand ""as it is.""; to make no material alteration either in the direction of increasing or decreasing its incidence. The honourable member always speaks his f convictions fearlessly, and it is quite evident that the arrangement honourable members opposite have come to was correctly stated by him. The Daily Telegraph on the 8th April, 1913, in referring to the policy speech made by the ex-Prime Minister, saidAnd what he says now is that the Tariff Labour will propose, if returned to power, is one that will cover the difference between wages paid in Australia and elsewhere. A venerable and mendacious old argument, this. The present Australian Tariff seems to be protective, and to express the fiscal opinion of a majority of the people. That being so, no necessity suggests itself to the Liberal Party for meddling with it one way or the other, except to remedy proved anomalies. The present Government, in submitting their programme to Parliament last year, made the following statement in regard to the T a r if f : The Inter-State Commission has already been appointed, and, in addition to fulfilling its constitutional duties, it will supervise and report to Parliament with respect to industrial production and commercial exchange. It will also inquire into the working of the Tariff and its operation and effect upon the investment of capital, and the employment of labour in Australian industries. It will make recommendations from time to time for the adjustment and revision of the Tariff, due regard being had to the interests of all sections of the community. In the meantime any anomalies discovered in the existing Tariff will be dealt with. "" In the meantime."" According to the actions of the Government, the phrase "" in the meantime"" does not mean "" inside twelve months."" MT . MCGBATH - It does not mean "" in our time.""",15
48,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It certainly does not, and now the Government come down with two paltry Bills in order to seek some party advantage by striving to get a double dissolution before the Tariff is dealt with. Thus they show that they have no intention of dealing with - the Tariff during this Parliament. The words in the policy statement - the Inter-State Commission "" will make recommendations from time to time for the adjustment and revision of the Tariff, due regard being had to the interests of all sections of the community ""-ar e an evasion. Is it the business of the Inter-State Commission to have regard to all sections of the community ? It all depends upon which way  the Chairman of the Inter-State Commission, may look at it from what he calls the stand-point of the rural consumers, and come to the conclusion, as he has done previously, that the interests of such consumers are best conserved by a policy of Free Trade. If so, we shall have no recommendation from him in the direction of giving further assistance toAustralian industries. I say this is a matter that ought to be lef t to the Government, and to this House. bers of this House represent various sections of the community, and it is their duty to protect those sections. In my opinion the Tariff issue is not the true business of the Inter-State Commission. It was stated in the House the other day that everybody was satisfied with what the Government are doing. I have here a report of the annual meeting of the Western Australian Chamber of Manufactures, held in Perth in August last, and reported in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 30th August, 1913At the Chamber of Manufactures annual meeting the presidential report stated that the attention of the Minister for Customs had been called to a Fremantle firm importing a quantity of furniture, comprising several thousand pieces, from China. The Minister had promised the matter would be considered in the Federal Parliament. It has never been considered by the Federal Parliament. This was a matter of urgency brought under the Minister's notice by the manufacturers of Western Australia through their organization, and a complaint was made that f u r n it u r e was being imported from China, to the detriment of local citizens interested in the industry. Yet, in spite of the M in ister's promise, the matter has never been brought before Parliament. The report continuesMr Keyser, a member of the Sydney Chamber, exhorted West Australian manufacturers to hold fast to the prospective plank, and expressed the opinion that in the Inter-State Commission the dominating note of personnel was Free Trade, though Mr. Lockyer was certainly a Protectionist. It is evident', therefore, that the manufacturers of Western Australia were dissatisfied some seven or eight months ago with the attitude of the Government on the Tariff question. So far as I am concerned, there are two directions in which the Tariff requires to be amended. Firstly, to deal with anomalies, and to more substantially protect Australian industries; and, secondly, to repeal those duties which are purely revenue-producing. By the first reform we would encourage Australian manufactures, and provide more work for our people; and, by the second, we should remove the load which the majority of the people are now bearing, because of the taxes being raised upon necessaries of life which are not produced in Australia.",16
49,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Whic h are not being proMem- duced in Australia-yo u should make thati clear.,16
50,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Yes . I emphasize that point, "" Which are not being produced in Australia."" The Prime Minister, in the speech to which I referred, said, under the heading of "" Cost of Living "" I should add, further, that since becoming the responsible leader of the party I have been inundated with appeals from all sorts of people as to what I propose to do to bring down the cost of living, and, at the same time, intimating that, in their opinion, the present high cost of living is the direct and sole result of the present Tariff. I do not hesitate to say, without discussing the subject fully, that I am hopeful an expert investigation of the Tariff may lead to a substantial reduction in the purely revenue duties of the present Tariff schedule. Surely, without any investigation by the Inter-State Commission, or any one else, every honourable member knows perfectly well thab there are a number of duties which are revenue-producing only, and, as I pointed oub in a speech delivered' by me in this House last year, the Government could bring down a Bill any day in the week to wipe out those purely revenue-producing duties, and help to reduce the cost of living, without requiring any investigation by any outside body at all, the particular items being perfectly well known to both Ministers and private members. But not a finger has been raised by the present Government to carry out that promise to the people. As a matter of fact, that was one of the important statements made by Ministers of the present Government throughout New South Wales when they were appealing to the electors. I have in my hand au official pamphlet issued by the Liberal party in New South Wales, and printed with the authority of Archdale Parkhill , General Secretary of the Liberal organization in that State, asking the people to vote for the Liberal Senate candidates-Si r A . J. Gould, Millen , and C. W . Oakes- "" to bring about low rents and cheaper l i v in g ; in the electorate which the honourable member for Lang represents, there were placards all over his electorate, "" Vote for W. E . Johnson, and reduce the cost of living."" That followed upon the statement of the Prime Minister that the revenue producing duties should be wiped out, and a burden taken off the backs of the people, so far as concerns revenue raised from the necessaries of lif e not produced in Australia. Yet nothing has .been done, and I venture to say that the Government have no intention of doing anything. Instead of grappling with the Tariff issue the Government declared their in tention to try to get a double dissolution by introducing two Bills that do not deal with the business of the country in any way, but are intended simply to bring about a deadlock in the legislative halls of the Commonwealth. I am reminded by the honourable member for Kennedy that the Treasurer, hinted, if he did not actually say, that it was the intention of the Government to bring before the House a proposal for additional revenue duties; indeed, that is the only deduction to be drawn from the business paper. What is meant by the proposal that the House shall today go into Committee of Ways and Means, and Committee of Supply to find means of raising revenue? We know perfectly well' that the Government obtained supply which was to last them from June last u n t i l next June, if not into the middle of July, and yet now, at the beginning of May, we have a proposal that the House shall go into Committee of Supply, and the probabilities are that those additional revenue duties, which were more than hinted at by the Treasurer the other day, will be brought forward.",17
51,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Do you think the amendments should go ""to private people first?",17
52,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member for Werriwa came into this House as a Free Trader.,17
53,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I am still a Free Trader.,17
54,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"The honourable member says he is still a Free Trader, and here we have an additional reason E. D. why the Government should shelve the T a r i ff issue. I have no doubt that the "" and, honourable member for Werriwa, knows perfectly well, as an old parliamentarian, what must be the effect, in the present state of parties, of a declaration by him that he is a Free Trader, and is going to fight this matter out if it comes before the House.  free, while the Labour party are bound by caucus. - Mr JH CATTS - It is because honourable members opposite are free to turn their own Government out of office that we find the latter going back on the pledges which Ministers gave the people at the last Federal election. It is because the supporters of the present Government are a party of shreds and patches-becaus e they have no common binding policy save their hatred of, and opposition to, the Labour movement-that they cannot come together on this or any obher great question of public importance. That is why the Government have shelved the question. They do not propose to deal with it during the life of the present Parliament, since they have said that they intend to send both Houses of Parliament to the country as soon as possible. In conclusion, I venture to say that a majority of the honourable members of this House, regardless of party, desire that the Tariff shall be dealt with . I cannot debate this matter as I should like to, inasmuch as under the Standing Orders I am not permitted to speak for more than half-an-hour, and I shall be compelled, probably, to take another opportunity to refer to it . a sheaf of correspondence fro m manufacturers in my own electorate relative to the Tariff, but I have not time to quote them today. Some of the matters covered by this correspondence were represented to me as being very urgent immediately upon the assembling of this Parliament nearly twelve months ago, but for the reason I have just mentioned I cannot go into details affecting my own electorate in particular and Australia generally. I take this opportunity, however, to let my constituents know that I am no party to the stand taken up by the Government on this question, and that I . have availed myself of every means within my power to induce the Government to carry out the pledges which they made to the people in this regard. Ministers calmly tell the House that the whole matter has been handed over to the Inter-State Commission. That body, according to them, is to be the guardian of all the interests of the community in respect of the Tariff, and we are to act upon its report without .having more than a summary of the evidence upon which its conclusions are founded. There is no indication as to when the Tariff will be dealt with , and the Inter-State Commission has not been asked to report within any specified time. The action of the Ministry in pushing on with certain other business shows that they have no intention of dealing with the Tariff during the life of this Parliament, and, in these circumstances, the words of the motion which I have submitted literally express the proposition that the Government . have placed the House in an intolerable position in regard to the Tariff question.",17
55,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [3.14] I am surprised that the Minister of Trade and Customs has not seen fit to rise at once and give the House some definite in dication of what the Ministry intend to do with regard to the great question of the Tariff. The replies which Ministers have given to questions on this subject are somewhat equivocal. We do not know exactly where they stand, but some of us have arrived at what we believe to be a reasonable conclusion as to their attitude. The interjections made a few moments ago by the honourable member for Calare and the honourable member for Werriwa clearly show the influences to which the Government are subjected when they and I have their supporters meet in caucus. The honourable member for Calare was returned to this House for the express purpose of opposing any revision of the Tariff in the direction of granting further protection to the industries of Australia. A large proportion of the supporters ""of the Government belong to the old Free Trade party which we had thought to be absolutely dead.  member increase the duties ? Mr Fenton"" - In some cases I would considerably increase them. I am anxious that we should have a scientific revision of the Tariff . I would point out to the Free Traders on the Government side of the House-and they seem to preponderate - that prior to Federation New South Wales was regarded as a Free Trade State, and that any income which it obtained through the Customs Department came principally from revenue duties. I can see the old New South Wales influence operating in this House today.",18
56,Mr WEST,Unknown,"Pardo n me. Mr . FENTON - I am not referring to the honourable member, for I regard him as a brilliant exponent of the Protectionist policy. Although he has lived in the midst of Free Traders in Sydney for for t y years, he has remained a strong Protectionist, and he is also one of the most loyal members of the Labour party. Prior to Federation, as I was pointing out when interrupted, New South Wales was regarded as a Free Trade State, and many of her industries were in a very backward condition. But what has happened since the passing of the Federal Tariff ? From 1891 until the inauguration of Federation the progress made by the manufactories of New South Wales was very small, but since the passing of the Commonwealth Tariff, which gave a certain measure of protection, the industries of New South' Wales have advanced by leaps and bounds. In 1891 the value of manufac-turing plant in New South Wales was £4,000,000; in 1912 it was £14,000,000. The factories of that State, in 1891, bered 3,056, with 43,000 employees, as against 5,162 factories and 90,000 employees in 1912. Then, again, the wages increased there from £4,272,000 in 1891 to £11,600,000 in 1912. The output of New South Wales factories was valued at £16,500,000 in 1891, whereas in 1912 it was-valued at £61,163,000. The added value in the course of manufacture in 1891 was £8,000,000, whereas in 1912 it had increased to £22,000,000. In one year alone there was an increase of £7,000,000 in the value of the output of her manufactories. I quote these figures to show that even with a mongrel Tariff great advances have been made. With a scientific Tariff the advance would have been far more pronounced, and if we had a scientific Tariff now New South Wales, in common with all the other States, would benefit very considerably.  gone up 35 per cent.",18
57,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member would delight to obtain from China and Japan everything that he wears and uses in his household. Does the honourable member consider that we should patronize manufacturers who pay their workmen only 9d. a day? The logical effect of his argument would be that we should buy our goods where they can be obtained most cheaply. That would mean putting the Australian workman into competition with Chinese workmen receiving only 6d., 8d., and 9d. a day. MT. HIGGS - Hi s god is cheapness.",19
58,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In that case he must get his goods from the low-grade nations, whose workmen receive such awful wages.",19
59,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Protectio n does not prevent competition; it merely transfers it from one man's shoulders to another's.,19
60,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That argument has been disproved long ago. If the honourable member could guarantee to me the same social, economic, and industrial conditions throughout the world, I would vote for Free Trade. But, knowing the degraded state of the labour of many of the countries with which the artisans employed in Australian industries have to compete, I cannot understand a true Australian agitating for Free Trade. I believe in Australian goods for Australian people. If ever there was a country which should be self-contained, that country is Australia. We have practically num- every climate, and can produce almost everything. Why, then, should we not impose sufficient protection to encourage the development of all the resources of thiswonderful country? The honourable membet for Cook spoke of a pledge made by the Labour party at the last election. That pledge was discounted by our opponents, and particularly by the press, though one of the chief newspapers in the Commonwealth, in a leading article published on the 1st April, 1913- a very significant date-said , "" Whatever happens,, the Labour party now stands irretrievably pledged to serve the cause of effective protection."" That was the comment on"" the policy speech of the honourable member for Wide Bay, delivered at the end of March. Unfortunately this journal did not support protectionists during the electoral campaign; it criticised severely many of us who claimed to be staunch protectionists then, and who had been so before that time.

I cannot conceive how it is that, in these latter days, any Free Traders remain. Unfortunately, Free Traders predominate in the Liberal Caucus, and have assisted the Ministry to place the responsibility of Tariff revision oh the Inter-State. Commissioners. I , along with the honourable member for Cook, and others, have uttered my protest against what is being done. At the present rate of progress I do not know whether the Commission will make any recommendations to Parliament during this generation.  and Customs has the matter under observation.

Whatever may be said of the Inter-State Commission, its recommendations will place before us evidence such as Parliament has not had to guide it during any previous consideration of the Tariff.",20
70,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,That statement is an insult to the Tariff Commission.,20
71,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I was not a member of the House when the Tariff was dealt with after the Tariff Commission had reported, but I am of the opinion that members did not vote then in accordance with the facts presented by the Commission. On the contrary, they voted at the dictation, or, rather, I will say in accordance with the desires, of combines, trusts, and corporations. Knowing the obstinacy of some honourable members, probably these combinations treated them as one treats a pig; that is, they pretended to try to drive them in the direction opposite from that in which they wanted them to go. Twelve years ago I pointed out in this chamber that what was being done would create a nail trust, and I have had the pleasure of seeing that prophecy fulfilled.",20
72,Mr CARR,Unknown,It is a selfish gratification.,20
73,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"It is a pleasure sometimes to have proof that you were able to accurately perceive the iiltimate effects of legislation. Some members of the Labour party were as clear and distinct in their pronouncements as to what would happen if certain duties were imposed as I was; all credit to them for it. I hope that the leavening influence of their intelligence has spread through the party, and that when the Tariff comes to be again considered, there will be a more intelligent discussion than we have had hitherto. The honourable member for Maribyrnong seems to think that Protection ends competition, merely transfers it from the shoulders of one man to the shoulders of Our primary producers have to send their produce-meat, hides, wheat, butter, fruit, and rabbits-to other side of the world, to sell it there against the competition of all other countries, and to pay freight on its transport. But when they come to buy agricultural machinery, the local facturers say, ""We the competition of the world, though we have no freight to pay."" Protection merely transfers from the shoulders of the man who ought to bear it to the shoulders of the man who is already competing, in the markets of the world; in other words, it makes the farmer bear two competitions instead of one; and that is neither reasonable nor fair. It is quite true that we may in this way build up the city at the expense of the country; but it certainly is not the way to increase the production of wealth. By so much as the Tariff may be necessary to encourage the production of particular articles, and by so much as the article produced fails to be of the value it would be in other countries, are we lessening the value of our natural production, and diminishing the amount of wages that can be paid to the workers. If all the farmers and others engaged in the agricultural industry were bound together ih one union, they would begin to recognise that they were called upon to bear two competitions; and it is only right that the burdens of life should be equally distributed. Each burden is in itself heavy enough, and no double load should be heaped on any single Let all share the burdens, and let each gain, as far as possible, the profits of his work and industry. If the Labour ' depart from that doctrine they will only heap up further burdens on the masses of the people. ilr. Conroy.",20

77,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I mean agriculture. If it had not been for the remarkable progress of agriculture tliere would not whereas it have been the development of machinery we have seen. For the past four or five another. years we have had the largest imports and exports, and the greatest increase in tallow, wool, wages, and we know that the general the prosperity increases with the imports. If we wipe out the imports and exports we wipe out the prosperity of three-fourths of the people. A f t e r all, there is nothing wonderful about trade, which people only carry on for their own advantage, and Parmanuliament has no right to interfere in favour cannot meet of any class. If any help be extended let al- it be to those who desire to get the full results of their work. Do not bind the people competition down in such a way that they must buy from any capitalist who puts his money into some concern. I have nothing to say against capital, because the great want of the country is capital; and I wish I could give a large portion to everybody in the community.",21
78,Mr CARR,Unknown,I should like the honourable member to show us how the people are to get the full results of their labour.,21
79,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"That is . one of the problems that every one of us would like to understand. While a man may not get the full product of his labour, we ought to see that, under no circumstances, is any of that produce taken away from him. When taxes are imposed by the Tariff, or otherwise, we surely do not think that there is a philanthropic body of men willing to pay £16,000,000 a year through the Customs House for the benefit of the workers ! If there ' were such a body of men, they would be deserving of the highest praise. One moment some Protectionists pretend that it is the importer who pays the duty, and the next moment they have to admit that the „ individual. duty is passed on with an additional charge for the advance of the money. I regret that the Australian Labour party party should absolutely act in opposition to the Labour party of any other country in the world. Elsewhere Labour ' representatives fight to keep taxes off the people, but in Australia the Labour party, while amusing themselves by talking against trusts and combines, vote as those trusts and combines dictate, and thus heap up the public burdens.. It is fortunate, indeed, that there has been such an increase in the value of our great natural productions, because otherwise the burden of taxation would have become most severe. It is said that this Parliament has done nothing; but, at any rate, the Government have prevented the increase of burdens, and this is the first Parliament for many years that has sat without doing a considerable amount' of harm. The Government and their supporters have not been numerous enough to effect good sound legislation, but we have put some check on the foolish, insensate, nonsensical legislation which is said to be against the interests of wealth, but which increases the earnings of the wealthy by one and a half fold.",21
80,Mr BUHNS,Unknown,Is the honourable member going to take any notice of the report of the Inter-State Commission ?,22
81,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I shall be ready to read the report of the Inter-State Commission, but whether I shall find myself bound by it is another matter. It is the evidence that I have to consider, and which will guide me in coming to a decision. As I read events in this and every other country, they show that, when Tariffs meddle or interfere, they increase the public burden, build up trusts, and in every way delay the advancement of the country.",22
82,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Is this the ' scientific Protection of which the honourable member is said to be in favour?,22
83,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"All efforts at a scientific Tariff seem to have the result which followed the appointment of the Tariff Commission in the United States of America in 1881. Every member of that Commission was a Protectionist; but, after the evidence had been given, all had become Free Traders except one, and he was admittedly the stupid man of the jiarty.",22
84,Mr HANN AN,Unknown,"Fawkner) [3.45] - I endorse the action of the honourable member for Cook in bringing the Tariff question before the House. The sincerity of the honourable member has been questioned by honourable members opposite, who point out that the Labour party, during their three years in power, could - have altered the Tariff in any direction they chose. At Gympie, in 1910, the Leader of the Opposition stated that it was. the intention of the Labour. Government to submit certain questions by referendum, and that, if tliese questions were answered in the aflirmative, immediate action would be taken to bring into operation the New Protection policy. Unfortunately for the manufacturing, labouring, and other interests of Australia, the referenda proposals were defeated. At the last general election, in 1913, the Leader of the Opposition, at Maryborough, distinctly stated that if his party were again returned, and even if the referenda proposals were defeated once more, the first business of the National Parliament would be the revision of the Tariff. That was the pledge made, and I am positive that it would have been honored if the Labour Government had been returned to power. Whether rural representatives opposite approve of the Prime Minister's promises or not, the fact remains that that gentleman, as Leader of the Opposition, when placing the policy of his party before the country, pledged himself to Protection as definitely as did the Leader of the Opposition. Now, however, while the whole of the members on the Opposition side are prepared to support a revision of the Tariff, a majority of the Government supporters repudiate the promise made by their leader during the last campaign. What an inconsistent position is that of honourable members opposite 1 On the platform they tell the electors that they favour industrial legislation, that they are whole-hearted supporters of the Wages Board system, and that they are prepared to continue the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The object of all. this legislation is to compel manufacturers and employers to comply with certain conditions; and the policy of Australia today is to regulate the hours, wages, and so forth, of every man and woman employed in our industries. Some honourable members opposite go further, and claim that to the Liberal party belongs the credit for the initiation of this class of legislation. However that may be, we are gradually creating here a standard of living which is superior to that in the older countries; and, in the majority of cases, the conditions are such as manufacturers elsewhere are not called upon to comply with. In Australia we have in operation a fortyeight hours' week in the great majority of our manufacturing industries, and in many cases a forty-four hours' week. I regret to say that there are some who are not enjoying the benefit of the form of legislation to which I have referred, but the majority of our people in Australia are enjoying industrial conditions that are superior to those operating in other parts of the world. Yet we find individuals who claim to be in favour of industrial legislation, and yet absolutely refuse to raise their voices or record their votes to give protection to the people engaged in our industries, and whose living depends on the prosperity or non-prosperity of those industries.",22
85,Mr CONROY,Unknown,What about collecting the money from other members of the community to make up the difference?,23
86,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"Can the honourable member, who is a Free Trader, point to a single Free Trade country where the workers generally have a standard of living equal to that which exists in Australia today, and which has been brought about by Protection-suc h as it is-and the various forms of industrial legislation in operation? If a public man says that he favours industrial legislation in order to protect the workers, and compel the manufacturers to comply with certain conditions, and yet, on the other hand, advocates a system that allows the products of the sweated labour of other countries to come into Australia and compete in the open with the products of our own workers made under the industrial conditions prevailing here, he is inconsistent. Yet that is the attitude of the honourable member for Werriwa and others who hold the same views. There is a growing feeling in parts of some r u r a l districts in favour of a system of Free Trade. This is due to the fact that a number of people like the honourable member for Werriwa are going through the country preaching a false gospel, false so far as the interests of Australia are concerned. In years gone by, when the prosperity of their industry depended on home markets, the farmers were not in favour of Free Frade, but now that the people of Australia generally have been taxed to give them improved facilities in order to get their produce to the markets of the older countries of the world, they favour it .  paid for those facilities?",23
87,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"E very section of the community was taxed for the purpose of assisting ihe farmer to get his produce to the markets of the older countries. This false doctrine of Free Trade is being preached throughout the rural districts by a coterie of L it t l e Australians. The Labour party recognise how important the prosperity of the rural industry is to the community, but those who take a broad view must recognise that in regard to the general prosperity of the community, the manufacturing industry is just as important as the rural industry, and that each is dependent on the other.",23
88,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,A large proportion of farmers are capable of taking a broad national view in respect to a policy of Protection.,23
89,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"I admit it ; they recognise that those engaged in the manufacturing industry need protection against the cheap competition of the outside world; and though there are many men sitting behind the Government who preach Free Trade, there are others who go before the electors and proclaim themselves Protectionists, but yet, when the opportunity comes for carrying out their pledges, are found wanting, and are prepared to shelve the question of Protection altogether.",23
90,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Where are the Ministers?,23
91,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Thoug h you block the business of legislation, administration must go on.",23
92,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"The Ministr y say that they cannot get on with the business of the country as parties are at present situated. H ad a Bill for the .revision of the Tariff been brought before the House - and considering the position of the parties, it would have been an excellent move on the part of the Governmentevery member . of the Opposition would have given it his wholehearted support, and recorded votes in the interests of the manufacturing industries of Australia and the people employed in them. It is the only consistent and logical attitude to assume in conjunction with that honourable members adopt in regard to in dustrial legislation.",23
93,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Why did not the Labour Government introduce a Bill ?,23
94,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"The ex-Prime Minister gave the pledge that if certain proposals in the referenda were carried, the question of Protection would be brought before Parliament, and it was because the referenda proposals were not carried that the promise was not carried into operation to its fullest extent. Even though a Bill for the revision of the Tariff was not introduced, certain anomalies were rectified, though not to the extent they deserved; but even if the Labour Ministry did not take up a great deal of their time in dealing with the rectification of anomalies in the Tariff, there were such i m portant measures as the Navigation Bill , the Land Tax Bill , and Bills dealing with other matters passed during their term of office.",23
95,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [ 4 . 0 ] sorry Ministers do not regard this matter in an important light. The Minister of Trade and Customs interjected a moment ago that we were endeavouring to block business. I shall no doubt be charged by a certain section with obstructing business. I cannot conceive of a more interesting, or more important, matter this Parliament might occupy its time with than the question of the need for further Protection in the Commonwealth of Australia. We had today an invitation from the honourable member for M a r ibyrnong to the Prime Minister to do something to find employment for the unemployed. Why is the number of unemployed growing ? It is because we are bringing into Australia every year over £70,000,000 worth of goods, many million pounds' worth of which could be made by Australians getting the Australian standard rate of wages and working under the Australian standard of conditions. I look at the imports. I do not bother so much about the Inter-State Commission or their reports. are coming into Australia in large quantities it is very evident to me' that Australia needs more Protection. But what do the Ministry care about Protection ? The honourable member for Cook has shown us what certain members of the Liberal party think of the question. I . wish to know from the Minister of Trade and Customs what he has to say in reply to our challenge that his view regarding the Tariff question is wrong, when he says that it would not be right to interfere with the Inter-State Commission? The honourable member for Cook has pointed out that last year the Ministry promised to rectify anomalies when they were discovered, and that they intimated there were certain anomalies which might be dealt with. Why are they not dealing with them ? Why , instead, are they forcing through the House certain legislation which, in regard to its incidence, has nothing to do with the welfare of the people of Australia ? What is the reply the Ministry make to the very strong in dictment of the honourable member for Cook ? They put up the honourable member for Werriwa. He is the gentleman put up by the Liberal party to reply to the challenge which has been uttered by Protectionist members of the Opposition. I expect that the Ministry will next put up the honourable member for Parkes, who is a Pree Trader, and the honourable - I am member for Franklin, another Free Trader, and the honourable member for North Sydney, or the honourable member for Calare, both Free Traders. Then there is another semi-Free Trader, the righ t honourable member for Swan. Where is the knight of the Crown of It a l y that he does not say something as to the immediate necessitv of an amendment of the Tariff ?",24

98,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The statement of the honourable member for Gwydir is quit* incorrect.,24
99,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"There are too many Free Traders on the Government benches to admit of our getting any relief from the present Government. The honourable member for North Sydney would reduce the If goods duties if he had the opportunity. We haveheard from the Prime Minister that he is in favour of maintaining the Tariff as it was decided by the majority of the 1 people of the Commonwealth at the election of 1906, when Australia voted largely Protectionist. It will be remembered that Sir George Reid raised the Free Tradebanner, and was beaten, and it was generally recognised that Australia wasProtectionist. Honourable members of the Labour party said that they wereprepared to maintain the policy decided"" upon that election. But that did not prevent the Prime Minister and other FreeTraders coming into the House and doingtheir level best to reduce the duties p r o posed in 1907. They did not consider that they had a mandate to vote for P r o tection. On every occasion they will ' vote to reduce the protective duties. To day I asked the Prime Minister whetherhe had not stated that the present Government had taken fiscalism out of the hands of a Parliament that was not competent to deal with it, and put it into the hands of men who Avere able to apply business treatment to the Tariff. The Prime. Minister replied that those words were not his utterance, and, in an irritated manner, said that the question ought to be put on the business-paper. I do not want to do the Prime Minister an injustice, and charge him with having said things he did not say, but that statement was published in the Melbourne Age on the 12th May as having been uttered by the Prime Minister at the opening of an eight-storied factory, covering a space of over 2 acres-a n establishment being erected by David Jones and Company, of Sydney, for the carrying on of a number of industries, including the manufacture of underclothing, tea-gowns, and boys' clothes, ticket-writing, laundering, &c, all being the result of Protection.

100,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"At this interesting function, the opening of a modern factory, the Prime Minister proposed success to the factory, and, according to the report in the Sydney Morning Herald, an interjection from Mr Griffith on the subject of Protection prompted the Prime Minister to replyI do not know whether it is safe to talk unadulterated fiscalism, but for the first time this Government has put the fiscal question out of the hands of Parliament, which is not competent to deal with it , and into the hands of men who have no axe to grind, and no object in life but to apply business treatment to the Tariff, and recommend to Parliament the results of their independent investigations.

123,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"The honourable member for Cook is another who makes charges without anything to support them. The position of the Government has been taken. clearly stated, and they are carrying out the policy that they announced. We announced plainly that, so far as we were concerned, we stood by our Tariff policy* and we have, by neither word nor deed, gone back on the promises we made. We further stated that it was our intenthat. tion to appoint a Commission to investiprepared gate the industries of Australia. We constituted the Inter-State Commission at the earliest possible date, and we set the Commission to work. Honourable memopposite seem to think that we ought to amend the Tariff without considering the interests of all parts of Australia; the that only one part of Australia should be considered. I say that the whole of is interested in Tariff reform. a When we are framing a national Tariff we must act upon' national lines. What I stated in this House before was distinctly this, that we have a Commission talcing evidence on important The Commission has taken evidence in Victoria, and has had a short sitting of a week in Tasmania. It is the intention of the Commissioners to evidence in other cities, and as soon the Tariff Commission presents any report the Government will be prepared to decide as a matter of policy what action shall be taken.

It was analnounced some time ago that so far as the Government were concerned, in legislating upon Tariff matters, we desired to legislate with knowledge, and the InterreState Commission as now constituted will collect information, and it will enable the House to legislate in a way that will make it possible for us to give proper assistance to the industries of Australia.

135,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"My answer is contained in Hansard, and if the honourable member for Cook does not care to accept that he can do the other thing. The Government have announced their intention of taking action in regard to the T a r if f as soon as the Inter-State Commission's reports are presented, and we are in a position to take such action. The statement which has been made by honourable members opposite is entirely without foundation, as is usual. It is a peculiar thing that honourable members . opposite are all running away from the Inter-State Commission at the present moment. What are they afraid of ? They passed the Act which enabled the Inter-State Commission to be appointed, and, now that we have appointed the Commission, they are afrai d of it .",27

It was invited by this Government to deal at first with urgent way the matters - with all industries needing urgent attention; but, as a matter of fact, not one industry has applied to the Commission to deal with a Tariff question on the grounds of urgency. While the Commission is judicially investigating these Tariff questions, and doing its duty in that way, we shall not call your interfere with it in the exercise of its duty. What would be said if , before it had completed its inquiry on some Tariff question, we took the whole matter out of its hands, and proceeded to deal with it? If the Commission had taken evidence only in Queensland with regard to some great industry common to Australia, what an outcry there would be in Victoria if we proceeded at that stage to deal with the question. Would not manufacturers in this State say, "" Why, you have not even allowed us to give evidence before the Commission?"" It is our duty to hold the balance evenly between all the States - If any one in any part of Australia desires to give evidence with respect to an industry, surely the right to give that evidence is not to be denied. Honourable members opposite appear to think that it should be, and there are people in this State who seem to imagine that the fact that evidence has been given here with regard to a Tariff question should be suflicient to conclude the whole matter. The attitude of the Government is that the Inter-State Commission shall proceed to deal with the matters placed before it in the exercise of its own discretion, and that its reports, when presented, will be acted upon. In conclusion, I desire to refer to a statement that has been made with regard to the supply of a full-report of the evidence taken before the Commission. Two or three honourable members have said that, because a verbatim report is not to be placed before Parliament, they consider that they will not be bound by its findings.. I would remind them that even if a full report were presented, they would not be bound by the findings of the Commission. Honourable members are not of necessity to accept its conclusions.",27
139,Mr ARTHUR,Unknown,There is no suggestion that we are.,28
140,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"But some honourable members opposite have said, ' If we do not get a verbatim report of all the evidence we shall not accept the conclusions of the Commission."" 1 would point out that the value of the reports will lie in the fact that they come from an independent body, acting in a judicial manner. The Commission is examining many witnesses; it is also taking a great deal of evidence in confidence, and it will be able to present to Parliament a well-weighed, wellconsidered report, which should enable us to act with knowledge instead of in ignorance. How many honourable members bothered to read the verbatim reports of the evidence that was taken by the Tariff Commission ? The reports of the evidence taken by that Commission covered thousands of pages, and cost the country a very large sum to print.",28
141,Mr WEBSTEH,Unknown,The honourable member was a party to that expenditure.,28
142,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"In so far as I was a member of this House, I was a party to it.",28
143,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,28
144,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I wish only to add that a summary of the evidence taken by the Commission will be available for the consideration of honourable members, and thati it will supply the substance of the matters dealt with.

163,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I did not understand the Prime Minister to say that the honourable member was a sneak. If the Prime Minister did so, he was not in order.",28
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I did not say it. Let the honourable member quote what I said, and I shall withdraw it if exception be taken to it .",28
165,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The Prime Minister asked why the Leader of the Opposition was sneaking behind his colleagues like a sneak.,28
166,Mr OBCHAED,Unknown,No .,28
167,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has denied that he used the words alleged, and it is usual to accept an honourable member's disclaimer.",28
168,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,We cannot.,28
169,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is it in order. Mr Speaker, for an honourable member to make such imputations as the honourable the ex-Speaker is constantly making against 'me ? He is constantly puttin g into my mouth words that I have not used.",28
170,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I rise to a furthe r point of order.,28
171,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There is already a point of order before the Chair, but I do not know whether it is desired that I should regard it seriously. I can deal only with specific points as they arise, and cannot give a ruling on a mere generalization.",28
172,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I rise' to a point of order.,29
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I will withdraw anything that I said. I wish to know from the Leader of the Opposition why he is going to support this motion, which, if carried, will dispossess the Government of their positions?",29
174,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That would be a pity.,29
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Whether that be so or not, it is not customary for the leader of a party to remain dumb while his followers do all the talking upon a motion so important as this undoubtedly is. The Leader of the Opposition shows a singular and absolutely entire want of courage in getting behind his followers. The right honourable member has, perhaps, already abdicated. Has he ""gone under"" to the new party?",29
176,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Oh !,29
177,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,This is good sidetracking.,29
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member may well laugh. I congratulate him on the way that he is controlling the actions of the Opposition.,29
179,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,The Prime Minister has admitted that the question is an important one.,29
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,And it is because of its supreme importance that I decline to take part in this trifling with it in the National Parliament. Every one knows that there is not an atom of sincerity in these propositions.,29
181,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. The Prime Minister has said that there is not an atom of sincerity in this proposition. I contend that that is a disorderly remark.,29
182,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the imputation.,29
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,A m I supposed to withdraw everything?,29
184,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I was named for less than that.,29

187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I submit that the honourable member cannot do so now.,29
188,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I shall conclude with a motion. The question to which I propose to refer concerns the Prime Minister, amongst others, and relates to the treatment that is meted out to members of the Federal Parliament when travelling by rail in New South Wales.",29
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I submit that the honourable member cannot bring forward such a question at this stage.,29
190,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,A question of privilege may arise at any time.,29
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No ; a question of privilege must be a question suddenly arising.,29
192,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The question has arisen suddenly.,29
193,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Unde r the Standing Orders an honourable member may rise to speak upon a master of privilege "" suddenly arising."" The question raised by the honourable member may be a matter of privilege, but it certainly does not appear to me to be a matter of privilege "" suddenly arising."" - Mr Webster - Ha d you waited, sir, a little longer you would have realized that this question has arisen very suddenly, and I am sure that if you had had meted out to you the treatment which I , with others, received last night you would agree that this is a'question of privilege which has suddenly arisen. This is the first opportunity I have had to refer to it. Has the Prime Minister himself no regard for the dignity of his position? The honourable gentleman was taken out of a train by which he desired to travel expeditiously, and forced to take a seat in a slower train.",29
194,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I must rise to order in the interests of the transaction of public business. This form of interrupting public business must be put an end to by somebody at some time or other, and I make an appeal to you, sir, in the interests of the transaction of the business of this House.

Honourable members must be heard in silence.",30
196,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should appeal, to you, Mr Speaker, put the Standing Orders into force. They preclude the possibility of any tion such as the honourable member wishes to move being brought forward now as matter of urgency. It is clearly laid down in the Standing Orders that, at expiration of two hours after the meeta ing of the House, the Orders of the Day must be called on, and a question of p r lege cannot intervene in the manner proposed. Besides, the question raised is not one of privilege, and no one knows it better than those who are raising it . This is only another way of interrupting public business, and this sort of thing must oease.",30

202,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,That is a reflection on Mr Speaker.,30
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not at all. I wish to know what the law of Parliament the subject is. It is evident that honourable members opposite are merely using the proposed motion as a means of again interrupting public business and occupying the time of the House.,30
204,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Is that in order?,30
205,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The Prime Minister is not in order.,30
206,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Mr Speaker,30
207,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am prepared, . without further assistance, to give m y decision on the points that have been raised. It is laid down in the Standing Orders that the Speaker gives his ruling feel that I when a point of order is raised; and it is to only when he is in doubt, or desires enlightenment, that discussion on the point moraised is permitted, and its duration is entirely with in the discretion of the a Speaker. When the Speaker has stated that he is prepared to give a decision, it the is not the practice to continue debating point of order. In the first place, I point out to the Prime Minister that the i v i - Standing Orders require that objectionable statements concerning, or imputations affecting, honourable members must be withdrawn, and that it is the practice of Parliament to require the withdrawal of words considered personally offensive.",30
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The ability of honourable members opposite to say that they are being reflected on is unlimited ; they There to raise a must be some limit .,30
209,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is not customary, nor is it permissible under the Standing Orders, or under the practice of Parliament, to traverse the Speaker's ruling. The Speaker's decision is final, unless obto in a regular and forma l way, as provided for by the Standing Orders. If honourable members, when exception is taken to any remark as offensive, would at once withdraw it at the request of the memSpeaker, a considerable amount of time would be saved, and proper parliamennot been tary decorum would be preserved.",30
210,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,The Prime Minis- . I ter has not withdrawn what he said.,30
211,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I understood him to,30
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I beg to withdraw once more.,30
213,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Havin g allowed the Prime Minister to intervene, I hope you will permit me, Mr Speaker, to ask you on to look at Standing order 111.",30
214,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That is not a point of order. I was about to quote to the House the standing order to which the honourable member desires to draw attention. It saysAn urgent Motion, directly concerning the privileges of the House, shall take precedence of other Motions, as well as of Orders of the Day. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that this afternoon another motion was declared to be one of urgency, and was debated u n t i l half-past 4. The honourable member for Gwydir did not rise when that motion was called on, to move the motion which he now claims to be one of urgency, but which is not immediately connected with the business of the House. Standing order 284 declares thatAll Questions of Order and matters of Privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every otber Question. Those' are the Standing Orders that apply in this case. As to the urgency of the question which the honourable member for Gwydir wishes to discuss on a motion of privilege, I point out that nothing to which the matter relates has suddenly arisen. The honourable member himself allowed another motion to intervene which prevented a discussion of the matter to which he wishes to draw attention, although he was in the chamber before that motion was moved, and could have risen at any time in the interim since the House met, and I regard his action in doing so as practically an admission that the matter which he wishes to discuss is not one of urgency.",31
215,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Then we can have it tomorrow.,31
216,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"W it h regard to what constitutes privilege, May says that breaches of privilege may be divided into these classes1. Disobedience to general orders or rules of eitlier House. The subject-matter of the honourable member's motion does not come under that heading, nor does it come under2. Disobedience to particular orders. The third class of breaches of privilege is spoken of as3. Indignities offered to the character or proceedings of Parliament. The fourth class comprises4. Assaults or insults upon members, or reflections upon their character and conduct in Parliament; or interference with officers of the House in discharge of their duty. The honourable member's motion does not cover breaches of privilege coming uuder any of these heads.",31
217,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,What about the indignity ?,31
218,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"May speaks of in dignity in connection with some proceedings in the House. What the honourable member wishes to refer to took place in a railway train, beyond the precincts of the House, and cannot be said to be a matter of urgency which has suddenly arisen. The matter can be dealt with on notice.",31
219,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,Is not interference with a member who is travelling to perf o r m his parliamentary duties a matter of privilege ?,31
220,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is not a matter of privilege of an urgent character coming within the category that I have read. It would be for the House to determine whether it was an interference involving a breach of privilege.,31
221,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Do you, sir, maintain that if a member is interfered with in his progress to this House, - and prevented from reaching here in a fib state to carry on his duties, that is not an infringement of our privileges?",31
222,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am of opinion that, if an honourable member were forcibly prevented from coming here to attend to his duties, it would be a matter of privilege, to be dealt with by an ordinary motion. Seeing that in the present case other business has been allowed to intervene, and that what has occurred did not happen immediately before the meeting of the House, it can scarcely be said to be subject-matter for a motion of privilege, to be dealt with as one of urgency. What has occurred is in no sense a matter of urgency, because it can be dealt with as well at a later hour, or 6n some subsequent occasion.",31
223,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"What about the motion to dissent from your rulin g given last Priday, which I have placed on the notice-paper ?",31
224,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Standing order 119 says that if motions have not been disposed of within two hours after the meeting of the House, the Orders of the Day shall be called on.",31
225,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I rise to order. It is time that this matter was cleared up, Jbecause it affects you, sir, and the business of the House. I raise a question of privilege on something happening in this - Chamber. Surely something must be <lone to provide that the business of the House shall be carried on. On Friday last, the honourable member for Bourke moved an amendment to the motion of the Attorney-General which forms the subject of the Order of the Day, and you, .sir, ruled it out of order. The honourable member for Gwydir thereupon notice of his intention to move today that your ruling be dissented from.",31
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I there'is no question of privilege.,32
227,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable member does not know what I am about to say.,32
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The member has made it abundantly clear that he wishes to treat as a matter of privilege the putting aside, under the standing order, of the notice of motion to dissent from your ruling, Mr Speaker. I say that that cannot form the subject matter of a motion of privilege.",32
229,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The Prime Minister is quite wrong. I knew that he did not ""know what he was talking about.",32
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I require that' observation to be withdrawn.,32
231,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I withdraw The point I wish to make is this: Y o u , sir, have ruled that a certain amendment is out of order.

232,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I submit that the able member for Kennedy is out of order. You, sir, have ruled that understanding order 119 Orders of the Day must be called on, and the first Order of the Day been read by the Clerk. The honourable member for Kennedy is merely traversing your decision in attempting to raise a question of privilege in this way, and therefore out of order.",32
233,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I have no wish traverse your ruling, sir. The House in a difficulty, and if I can help it I shall be glad to do so, whatever hona orable members may think. If you, . rule that the motion cannot be discussed, I must, although very much loth to do so, move to dissent. I must do this in the interests of Parliament.",32
234,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"This ceases to be a Parliament if we cannot discuss the matters, put before it .",32
235,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Yes . The Standing Orders lay it down as clearly as possible that no motion of censure must be held over the Speaker for a moment longer than may be unavoidable. gave Mr. JOSEPH COOK - There is no motion of censure hanging over the Speaker.,32
236,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Unde r the circumsubmit that stances, the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir is the first thing that should have been discussed, because it is of serious importance to the House, in volving the protection of the minority. I honourable regret that the Prime Minister has taken the steps he has; and I trust, Mr . Speaker, that you will withdraw your decision, so that we may proceed. *.",32
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have taken no steps. I rise to a'point of order. The honourable member is accusing me of having taken steps to prevent the transaction of public business.,32
238,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That is not in order.,32

244,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"This , as I say, is a honorserious matter, quite apart from any party politics or party considerations. It must be remembered that, while we on this side are in Opposition today, we may has be on the Treasury bench tomorrow; and, under the circumstances, I trust that the question may be discussed.",32
245,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The position is a is very simple one. The question is not one of privilege, but one affecting the Standto ing Orders. As to the last point raised is by the honourable member for Kennedy, I out, have to point out that mere dissent from Speaker's ruling does not necessarily in sir, volve a vote of censure on the Speaker. In the first place, what are known as Speakers' rulings are really not Speakers' rulings, hut decisions of the House u n t i l the House otherwise decides. It is quite possible that the House may be absolutely wrong and the Speaker absolutely righ t as regards any decision he may have given. But the House has the right to decide always for itself, and this conveys no reflection on the Speaker. motion of dissent was moved from a r u ling on Friday, and that motion was placed as the first notice of motion before Government business; and in the prdinary course it would have been called upon after questions upon notice. the House itself took action, and decided that something else should intervenesomething which the House decided was of an urgent character. The discussion of that question took up the whole of the tyro hours which were available for the discussion of motions; and I had no option, under the Standing Orders, but to interrupt the debate when two hours had expired, and call on Orders of the Day. Standing order 119 is as follows:If all motions shall not have been disposed of two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House, the debate thereon shall be interrupted, and unless the House otherwise orders, the Orjlers of the Day shall be taken in rotation. That is exactly what is being done on the present occasion, and what has been done on previous occasions. N/o discretionary power is given to the Speaker; he is bound, under the Standing Orders, after two hours, if all motions have not been disposed of by that time, to call on the Orders of the D a y ; and I am simply carrying out the Standing Orders and the practice of the House.",32

266,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [5.2] I understand that the question now before us is whether leave shall be given to introduce a Bill to prohibit preference to unionists in the Government employ. First, I have to regret that the Attorney General, who is in charge of the measure, is not present, and I cannot but regard this as discourteous. The Government profess to be extremely anxious to proceed with business, and it is somewhat unfortunate that they do not take a keener interest in the immediate question before us. Honourable members opposite, though, no doubt, they would all like to discuss this question, have not the courage, with one or two exceptions, to rise in their places.",34

275,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I had better withdraw all the words I uttered about the honourable member, if he objects to them, though he is, I think , the only one outside the institution I have mentioned, that would object. The Bill under consideration opens up one of the biggest questions with which the House has to deal. It is idle for our opponents to come, along with the stupid idea in the minds of some that they can stop the progress of industrial organization. No men have been subjected to such enormous difficulties as those gone through by men who have brought these organizations to their present stage. Many have lost their lives in the struggle for the combination and organization of workers, and in the effort to gain better conditions than those prevailing in days gone by-condition s which I hope we shall never see again. Before factory laws or laws regulating the operations of mining were introduced, the workers were compelled to toil under almost inhuman conditions. Reports of Commissions presented to the House of Commons, and to Legislatures in the United States of America and elsewhere, have disclosed that in many factories children, six, seven, and eight years of age, took the places, not merely of the mothers, who took the places of the fathers, but of the men also, and worked twelve-hour shifts with overseers standing over them with straps to , keep them awake. It was the revolt against such a condition of affairs that brought about the trade union movement, but the formation of Labour organizations had to be done in secret, and the books and minutes of the unions had to be concealed from the authorities. Even Parliament enacted that the workers should not be permitted to combine or ask for additional wages or better conditions. It - was not until early in the nineteenth cent u r y that this restrictive legislation was repealed, and the workers got a better opportunity of organizing, and, as a result of their organizing, were able to enforce better conditions from their employers. Such has been the early history of the privations and hardships which originated the Labour movement. remarkable that, while the Attorney General says that he does not believe in giving ""legal preference""-to use his own words-in public or private affairs in any shape or form , he has not the moral courage to say that he is prepared to wipe out all preference to unionists.",34
276,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,You are instalments.,35
277,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,But the great vital principle is not touched by the Bill before us. The measure is merely a declaratory one for the purpose of showing that the Government and their supporters do not favour preference to unionists.,35
278,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"It shows, that they are not in favour of granting preference to unionists by the aid of public money.",35
279,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"-The member does not understand the question. The great bulk of the people affected by preference to unionists are not touched by the Bill . The measure is merely a declaratory one, for the purpose of telling jbhe world that the present Government are not in favour of preference to unionists. ' But no one would accuse them of being in favour of preference to unionists. At the last election they said, on the public platforms, that they were not in favour of preference to unionists, but they have not the moral courage to propose an amendment to the Arbitration Act in that direction; in fact, they are afraid to deal with the general measure.",35
280,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"There are many on the Government side who believe in preference to unionists, but not in Government employ.",35
281,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"No w we have it . While the Government started out with the general proposition of no preference to unionists, tliey are now not prepared |to go on with it because one or two of their, supporters-eve n if it be the honourable member only-ar e in favour of preference to unionists to those who are not in Government employ. The Government abandoned their original idea. They were afraid to come down to the House with it because some of their supporters were not in accord with it .",35
282,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,Nothin g of the kind.,35
283,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,There was no more prominent question before the country at the last elections than this same Bill .,35
284,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"At the last election the Bill had not seen the light, and could not have been before the electors. It is We can only drag out informatio n from honourable members opposite piece by piece. We have an admission from the honourable member for Nepean. When the Government came down last session with a proposal to amend the Arbitratio n Act in relation to preference to unionists, it was suddenly withdrawn. Why? Begetting it by cause the honourable member for Nepean had said that he was not in favour of it .",35
285,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The honourable member did not say that.,35
286,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The honourable member for'Nepean said that the only preference to unionists he opposed was that where public money was used.,35
287,Mr ORCHARD,Unknown,"I said that there were men on the Government side who believed honourable in preference to unionists, but not in Government employ.",35
288,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"We know now why the Bill was withdrawn. It is quite evident that honourable members on the Government side were not unanimous. A large number of unions can enforce preference to unionists. If preferenceto unionists is a good thing for those organizations that can enforce it , why is it not good for some of the weaker organizations ? As a matter of fact, our opponents take every step they possibly can to try to prevent the growth of labour organizations, but they might just as well attempt to stop the tide with a pitch-fork. There was a time when it might have been done, but it is not possible today. Our opponents know that any legitimate attempt to stop the growth of industrial organizations would probably lead to a revolution. The present position of trade organizations has, in many cases, been brought about by bloodshed and by dragging from the powers that be the p r i v i leges the workers enjoy today. It is said that preference to unionists should not be given because the organizations take political action. Those organizations that can enforce preference to unionists certainly take political action, and they will do so whether our opponents lite it Or not, hut the hope is that our opponents may prevent political action being taken by the weaker organizations, who seek, by that action, to better their conditions. Have not employers derived all the benefits and privileges they enjoy today by political action ? Every action of aggression towards the workers has been taken by political action. The early organization of trade unions was prevented by political action. In the early stages of their existence these organizations were retarded by political action. It was through political action that Governments sent troops to shoot down trade unionists who sought better conditions - And now today, because those organizations, which our opponents, by political action, tried to prevent coming into existence,' and whose progress they retarded, are now taking political action, honourable members opposite squeal, and say, "" It was good enough for us to use agaiust you when you were trying to form your organizations, but it is not good enough for you to use in order to better your conditions."" Trade organizations will use political action to better their conditions. It is absolutely idle for our opponents to say they should not do so. The trade unionist of today is not what the trade unionist was fifty years ago. Have we not given him the right to join a union, and the right to record a vote? Have we not also given him the right to be educated? Do we not go so far as to tell him that we shall prosecute him if he does not send his children to get the necessary education that the State provides, so that they may grow up to be better citizens at a later period ? Can we expect the organizations, composed of educated people, and with the franchise extended to them, and with the opportunity of realizing the power they wield-ca n we expect them to remain as their predecessors were thirty years ago ? It is not reasonable to expect it. As a matter of fact, these combinations will become stronger, and bigger, and will wield the power they possess to get a fair share of the wealth they produce, as well as better conditions. The Attorney-General tells us frankly that he would not give any preference of any kind, but the most remarkable thing is that we find the Government introducing 'a system of preference at the first oppor[35]-2 tunity they get. Even though they deny preference to the trade unionists of this country, and deny them the right to say whether they will work with non-unionists or not, we find the Govermnent are the first to initiate preference, under the law which enables them to sit on the Treasury bench. The Government have given to certain contractors preference without calling for tenders, and that involves the using of Government funds to the extent of £40,000 or £50,000, and yet they turn round and say that preference to unionists should not be given amongst' the employees casually engaged under the Government, because it means the expenditure of Government funds upon those particular individuals. ""What is happening on the transcontinental railway today? The Government cannot obtain men who are outside the organization, and they are obliged to give preference to unionists, whether they like it or not. Yet it is Government money which is being expended. The honourable member for Nepean tells us that the Government do not believe in preference to unionists in relation to men employed on the Government works. But that is only so much sham and hypocrisy for, as I have pointed out, the Government are giving preference to unionists today on the transcontinental railway. That will continue to be done on all big works where there exist vast organizations of workers who can enforce the principle of preference to unionists. It is a remarkable thing that where preference to unionists can be enforced by the organizations, industrial trouble very rarely takes place.",35
289,Sir JOHN EORREST,Unknown,We have had industrial trouble on the transcontinental railway.,36
290,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The reason is that the Government will not pay the wages that are asked. The honourable member, being one of the most intelligent members of the party, will understand the point that I am trying to make. The whole argument of the Attorney-General is that we should not give preference to unionists where the expenditure of Government money is involved. That is the whole bone of contention, so far as the proposed Bill is concerned. Yet we find that the Government are obliged to give preference to unionists on the transcontinental railway, otherwise they could not get the line constructed, because all the men employed are in an organization sufficiently strong to compel the Government to give preference. Because of the strength of that organization, the Government are prepared to accept the principle in that case, while, at the same time, imposing a penalty on others who are less advantageously situated in the cities and elsewhere. That action is not only inconsistent, but it is a rotten thing for the Government to do. The Government have no right to give preference to unionists even on the transcontinental railway, if they are honest in their opposition to the principlej because, in giving preference there and refusing it elsewhere, they are differentiating between two sets of people. So far as the proposed Bill is concerned, the honourable member who sought to introduce it gave practically no explanation as to why it to be brought down. I am at a loss to understand how the honourable member has the courage to bring down .the measure after the exposure of the preference given by the Government in connection with the contract to Mr Teesdale Smith. was one of the most glaring cases of preference that I know of. The Govermnent refused to call for tenders, and gave preference to one of their own supporters. The Attorney-General talks about spoils to the victors, but let me tell the honourable member that I have never known a more glaring case of spoils to the victors than the instance of the Teesdale Smith - contract. It was an instance so glaring and palpable that any man could see exactly what was being done. It is all a hollow sham for honourable members to tell us that they do not believe in preference. Then, again, we are told by our opponents that the principle of preference to unionists will be the means of driving men into organizations. Of course it will; that is the object of We do not want the principle except for that purpose. Even the Attorney-General has said on different occasions that we can never hope to have any peaceful settlement of the industrial troubles that occur from time to time until we have, on the one hand, the labourers completely organized, and, on the o£her hand, the employers completely organized. That is the position that we take up. We say that there should be complete organization on both sides, and, until there is Mr MCDonald. that complete organization, there will be no machinery available by which industrial disputes can be dealt with. The whole aim of compulsory arbitration has been to force the employers, on the - one hand, and the employees, on the other, into organizations, the idea being that once both parties are completely organized we are in a better position to control industrial movements than we can ever hope to be while both parties remain in a disorganized state. Compulsory arbitration will practically break down unless there is complete industrial organization. That has been the whole trend of development. First of all, there were the small guilds, then came the craft unions, firstly amongst the skilled workers, and afterwards in the different crafts. The great mass of the people, however, were in no organizations whatever, and, while the small guilds and craft unions met the rewas quirements of the time in a slight way, they did not deal with the great mass of workers who produced the world's wealth, and who were the most poorly paid in the whole community. As time went on, it was recognised that only from a more That complete organization of the workers could great reforms come. Attempts were then made to organize this big industrial army, so as to get the workers into a body which would be able to claim better conditions than they had been able to obtain previously. I need only mention the instance of the shearing industry. Is there any class'of men under heaven who were worse treated than the shearers were prior to the formation of the Australian Workers Union? I say that they were the worse-treated class of men in Australia, and only by organization did they improve their lot. There is also the instance of the sugar workers, and the honourable member for Richmond, "" the rising hope of the Liberal party,"" will know that what I am about to say is correct. The it. condition of those workers was anything but good.' I have known men working in the sugar industry who were treated little better than the Kanakas, and it was that treatment which helped to drive them into an organization. Then there is the case of the rural workers. Owing to the conditions these men have had to work under, and the miserable wages they are paid",36
291,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,There is no quarrel between . the rural workers and their employers.,37
292,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I have heard that statement a hundred and one times, hut, if there is no dispute, they are making a mighty big noise about it .",38
293,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,There is no dispute.,38
294,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,I amongst the farmers of this country there are many fair-minded men. I dare say the great bulk of them are fair minded.,38
295,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,And are paying fair wages.,38
296,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Some of them are, and I was glad to hear the honourable member for Hume say that they are paying better wages than the rural workers axe asking for. But what is the reason for all the protest against the rural workers' log if the farmers are paying better wages than the workers are asking for?",38
297,Mr BENNETT,Unknown,Because workers do not want the log.,38
298,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The great bulk of the farmers are prepared to pay fair and reasonable wages, and give reasonable conditions to their employees, but there are others who are not prepared to do that. They are ' the men who bring about trouble, and if the honourable member for Gippsland is sincere in his protestations this afternoon, he will have sumcient courage to go amongst the farmers who are paying good wages and congratulate them, and also congratulate the workers on the organization they are bringing into being. I was pointing out how badly the shearers and the sugar workers were treated prior to their organizing. Now let me refer to an organization which the honourable member for Hindmarsh is in terested i h . The carrying of heavy bags, some of them weighing 3 cwt. and 4 cwt., and the piling of those bags in high stacks, was a means of killing thousands of men employed in that industry. Y e t who were the people who fought against a reform ? We found honourable members on the Government side against the introduction of a smaller bag.",38
299,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,I think we introduced it .,38
300,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"The majority of members sitting behind the Treasurer were sitting on this side at that time. The right honourable member was a member of the Ministry, and, I think, the smaller bag was introduced by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. The right honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro are, I think, the last two remaining of the then Ministry, but the majority of members'who are now sitting on the Government side never lost an opportunity of saying that the introduction of a admit that smaller bag was an injustice to the farmers, and that the men who refused to carry the large bags were mere loafers. The death of an honourable member who sat on this side of the House, and who died suddenly last session, may be traced to the fact that while working on the wharfs he had to carry and stack these heavy bags. It is idle for our opponents to tell us that the employers want to do the best they can for all parties. I do not hesitate to say that, if the opportunity offered, we should have prevailing today the conditions that operated twenty or t h i r t y years ago. Every concession, every benefit, that the rural the worker has gained has been wrung from the powers that be; no voluntary concession has been made. Those who did not hesitate to avail themselves of a constitutional means of coercing the workers and of tyrannising over them in days gone by now howl like a lot of curs because 1 their opponents say that they intend to avail themselves of. exactly the same means of bettering their conditions. We are told that but for vile agitators like some honourable members on this side of the House the rural workers would cheerf u l l y follow their occupations. That, no doubt, is the view of the honourable member for Gippsland; no doubt, he would say that but for the agitators "" everything in the garden would be lovely."" The Attorney-General and others of his party assert that .they desire to bring about more harmonious relations between the workers and the employers, and that they also wish to see the employees securing the full fruit s of their industry. But what is the position ? Statistics show that the worker does not get anything like the full fruits of his to i l ; that out of fighting every week he works two days for himself and four for his employer. In such circumstances, is it not idle to say that the relations between employers and employees should be more harmonious? The very action which the Government are taking is but another effort to divide society into two clearly-defined classes: those who produce wealth, and those who own the means of production, distribution, and exchange. These are two antagonistic forces. On the one hand, we have the men trying to get as much as they can for their labour; while on the other, we have the employers seeking to obtain the largest possible returns from the machinery in their hands. That being so, we must expect industrial unrest. The men are determined to stand up for their As the result of education, they are fast realizing that they have powers of which they did not dream a few years ago. They are going to try to enforce those powers, and industrial upheavals will take place from time to time. The introduction of machinery is throwing more and more skilled labour out of every day. In the Steel Trust of America we have an organization employing something like 230,000 hands. Its first object was to break down the organizations of industry, aud it has succeeded so well that today not a union man is to be found in its employment. Having broken down unionism, it tried to displace skilled labour, and it did so by introducing machinery, and employing from the southern portion of men who could not speak the language-in place of skilled local labour. The position today is that not more than 20 per cent, of the labour employed in the trust can be classed - as skilled The unskilled labourers employed by the trust work-for seven days a week-from ten to fourteen hours per day, and receive 7d. an hour. Honourable opposite represent a class of people who, if they had their way, would set up in Australia the same state of affairs. displacement of skilled machinery is taking place our industrial activities, with the result that the unskilled labour market is flooded and the one class of men is competing against the other in the struggle for exist- ence. How can it be said, then, that preference to unionists and their organization is detrimental to the best interests - of the community? If we want to rid ourselves of the present industrial we must wipe out, first of all, class distinctions. The struggle for existence is compelling men to join various organizations, and our unions are likely to increase very considerably in numbers. The Australiau Workers Union ally comprised the shearers and bush workers alone, but, as the result of negotiations, it has joined forces with the Australian Workers Union of Queensland, which includes the sugar workers, Mr MCDonald. carriers, and others, and today it numbers nearly 100,000 men. B y reason of its strength the union is able, in most cases, to enforce preference to unionists. The Government say that preference to rights. unionists shall not be permitted, but the casual labourers employed in undergrounding the telephone lines, as well as in carrying out other works under the control of the Department of Home Affairs, will be members of this vast organization, and preference will have to be given unless these works are to be employment held up, just as in the case of the construction of the transcontinental railway. It is ridiculous for the Government to tell us that they are sincere in their proposals in this regard. Ministers themselves have declared on the public platform that the Bill is designed to do something more than abolish preference to unionists-that it is to bring about a political crisis. more Mr TUDOR - The ' Attorney-General men taken said on Monday that he would withdraw Europe- it.

305,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I reciprocate the honourable member's sentiment. It seems to be necessary that the Government and their supporters may know what is in tended, and be able to speak outside in unrest one way, not in two or three. It is therefore advisable to obtain the fullest information as to the need for legislation industrial of the kind proposed, and we cannot do better than refer the proposal of the At torney-General to a Select Committee. We origin- were told in connection with the Tariff that all information should be obtained in regard to the various industries affected by any revision, so that our legislation might have a scientific basis. It is miners, for that reason that Tariff revision haa Sheen referred to the Inter-State Commis-sion. I do not propose that the subject - of preference to unionists shall be referred to the Inter-State Comniission, because I realise that that would mean shelving it for a considerable time.

The Bill which it is sought to introduce - does not go to the root of preference to unionists. We know exactly what it contains, because we have been told by Ministers' here the country what is its object and scope. Last session the Attorney-General introduced a comprehensive measure dealing with preference to unionists in connection with arbitration. That measure gave opportunity to go into all the pros and cons of the matter. But the Bill for which leave is now being sought confines our attention to one small point, - and therefore I assert that honourable members are not sincere in regard to it .",40
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I was required to - withdraw a similar expression.,40
312,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Then I withdraw my remark. Ministers have declared that the object of the Bill is not to prevent preference to unionists, but to bring about a crisis. It is that which led me to say that I thought the Government were not in earnest.",40

Party feeling has been greatly excited by this proposal. I do not think that debates of this character are calculated to increase the dignity of the House, or to strengthen its influence in the country, and the sooner we can get back .to what I call a healthy state of affairs, the better it will be for Parliament and for the country.",40

I am trying to show what the proposal means, and giving reasons why the Government should support it . I have not risen this afternoon to lecture anybody; that is not my object or idea; but, with all deference, I submit that the lines on which we are proceeding do not add to the dignity of the House, or advance the best interests of Australia. This is a very serious question; and if we are worth our salt, we ought to give a lead to the people as to the best lines of legislation. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Hear , hear!",41

Assuming, for the sake of argument, that we have to the amend- go to the country on a Bill of this character, what is to be the issue placed before the electors ? That issue will not be represented . by the measure that I have described as a sham; but we shall have all over again the discussion of years ago on freedom of contract. That aspect, however, will not be presented or fought over in the cities or metropolitan areas; honourable members opposite have too much w it to "" flog a dead horse "" such as this in the big centres. It will prove, however, a splendid cry for the country districts, where the passions and prejudices of the primary producers can be roused against unionism, and the whole course of action of the Labour party. There will be let loose all those distinguished workers in the cause of Liberalism, whose chief characteristic is that they never speak the truth except by accident. Two-thirds of them cannot get an honest day's work from anybody; they belong to that section of the community who have never any constant work, and for obyious reasons. What is going to be the effect of such a fighting policy amongst the farmers and primary producers? Is such a campaign worthy of the dignity of this House, the dignity of the Government, or the. dignity of the Conservative party in Australia? There can be only one answer to that question. I have said that I do not believe in the measure, because it is a sham.",41
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is this a proposed I think he amendment on the sham?,41
331,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"It is an amendment of what, in the abstract, is a sham, which is a high explosive in the hands",41
332,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I must ask the honcall orable member to withdraw the word "" sham "" as applied to the Bill .",41
333,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I withdraw the word, Mr Speaker, but I must, say that also, have the Prime Minister invited me to use it . Mr SPEAKER , - An honourable memi l l ber is not entitled to make an irrelevant speech, by way of reply to irrelevant in Mr W . H . IBVINE - Is it an explosive sham, or a sham explosive?",41
334,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"A not h e r view of the matter may he taken. Industrial unrest will continue and spread all over the world, for the reason that the workers are becoming more intelligent and enlightened, and are beginning to realise that the civilization of today presses harshly, heavily, and cruelly on the great masses. We are, of course, better off in many respects than our British brethren, but the conditions which make for the present system are in our midst here, as well as abroad. I have no desire to enter into a heated party squabble, because this is too serious a question for that sort of treatment. It is terrible when we realise how colossal wealth is being built up by one section of the community, while the other section work for a bare living. These latter have nothing to sell but their labour, ancl as labour will not "" keep,"" it has to be disposed of in the market at once, if the people are to live; and the profits thus made tend to create further wealth for the more fortunate section. I am not complaining about people owning wealth, but merely pointing out how brutal, immoral, and barbarous is the present system of civilization. It is-a disgrace to men of intellect and culture, who have had all the advantages of education, that they do not do something to bring about altered conditions. The workers, with their trade unions and other organizations, are working steadily in one direction ; and the Labour party have ever been in favour of arbitration and conciliation and other peaceful methods of solving the problem. There is a demand for better conditions, 'and the steps that are being taken are not taken out of revenge or any feeling of that sort. Our great desire is to banish hatred and other strong feeling, and to regard the matter from a philosophical point of view. Let us realise the blots on our civilization, and, for Heaven's sake, try to remove them! If we fail , we shall, at all events, have the satisfaction of having tried. At present, the workmen can go to the Court and obtain an award; and the time may, and, I think, will , come when another section of the community will have to face a tribunal, the duty of which will be to fix prices; the one is the logical outcome of the other.",42
335,Colonel RYEIE,Unknown,"If the award suits the workman he w i ll abide by. it , but, if otherwise, he will not.",42
336,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"The honourable member need not worry on that score. Every day in the newspapers we read of men being convicted of felony, but we do not say, on that account, that the laws against felony are a failure. On one side we have the educated section of the community; on the other side we have the uneducated; and as the strain of hard work does not tend to brain culture such as is enjoyed by those who do not work, there should be large-hearted charity extended in the one direction where there would be hesitation to grant it in the other. Could not the Attorney-General find a better job than bringing in a Bill like this? He may differ from me as to the evolution that is to take place according to the picture of civilization that I have drawn. I know that it is his task to protect invested interests aud the conservative interests against whab he thinks are the inroads of the great mass of the working people. Tliere is a clear line between the two parties. There is ahead fe/ouble enough, passion and hatred enough, without honourable members opposite going out of their way for the purpose of manufacturing further trouble. That is one reason which makes me feel so bitterly against honourable members opposite. I do not blame them for being conservative. I respect Conservatism. I differ from it in principle, but I recognise that some men, by their education; environment, and by their very mental constitutions, do not take a hopeTul view of things, and are frightened that tliose who share my views will break things, and take extreme action. They recognise that evils exist, but they think that our remedies may not be effectual, and may make things worse. But such Conservatives do not go out of their way to make, war on their fellow-men. They are content to simply block any further advance by those who share my opinions, and thus give the country a breathing time until the people are prepared to allow affairs for another series of years to be under the management of those who seek to bring about a policy of extensive reform. Though I do not agree with that position, and have always fought it , and always shall fight it , I understand it, and respect it. Some of the most honoured people in the country hold those opinions. Now the Minister has asked what benefit is to be derived from a Committee, but I put it to him that to climb down by the means we bave suggested is the best way out for tliem. I do not say "" climb down "" in an unkind way. We all make mistakes, and do not care to climb down if we can help it. The Government have taken up a mistaken policy. If the matter with by the Bill is submitted to a Committee, and judged apart from party prejudices and passions, and something is found that will justify legislation the subject, well and good, but in any case our suggestion provides for the Government the opportunity to back down, If not to reverse their policy. ask them to pass a measure of reform to which honourable members of the Opposition can subscribe. All I ask is that they shall mark time on this Bill, and proceed with legislation that should be considered. There is plenty of work on which this Parliament could run its natural legislation of a character that must be dealt with, and then we should get upon a better plane, and do some effective w,ork. I hope the Government will allow better counsels to prevail. Last session the spectacle was not too good, and the outlook for the present session is none too hopeful. There is a determination part of the Opposition to oppose legislation of the character of thab brought down by the Government. ligent man will agree that the only logical attitude assume, having regard to the principles we have taken up. Our action be misunderstood by any one. No Ministers are anxious that time should be frittered away when beneficial work could be undertaken, so there is every reason why a measure of this sort should be referred to a Committee. heaps of precedents for such a course. On many occasions in the House of Commons, when party feeling has run high, amendments - of this character have been brought forward with success, and for the benefit"" of the people of the Country.

338,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"-Before dinner, I ' was urging upon the Government the desirability of their accepting the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Kennedy. I am not here to lecturebhe Government, or anybody else, becauseI do not think that that attitude comesdealt with good tasbe from anybody; but I am of opinion that the Government committed an error of judgment in proposingthe Bill for the introduction of which they upon are now asking leave. They have committed an error of judgment in again bringingforward a Bill of that character, havingregard to its history during last session,, I do not and the electrical state in which the-House is today, and is likely to continue.. I am not saying that by way of re crimination. I am not talking about themeasure itself, because I look upon it as a very flimsy proposal, and one likely to> be of very littl e value; in fact, if it becourse, comes law, it will only affect somethinglike 2,000 or 3,000 employees of the Government, and all that the Bill proposes to do has been done by the-Government as an acb of administration. One is not surprised at the Government, doing that when one recollects the principles that are continually enunciated byon the honourable members on the Government side; but I ask the Government and thensupporters to consider whether it is acAny intel- cording to the best traditions of t h i * it i"" House? Is it the best way we can spend we can our time, to have a conflict over a question that must have imported into it all"" cannot the bitterness of party prejudice and misrepresentation? As I have previouslypointed out, this is merely a revival of the old question of freedom of contract. TheB ill will not frighten anybody in H in d marsh or any of the big cities, but the Government may make it a big stalkingThere are horse so far as the primary producers areconcerned. For that reason, I appeal to the Government to support the amendment, and they will then have an excellent opportunity of backing down from, the position they have taken up. TheyMother are not the first persons in the world to make a mistake; but all of us, when we recognise that we have made a mistake, that are anxious to rectify it as quickly as we can. Governments, no matter from which: party they are chosen, are liable fjo commit errors of judgment, and that is. the charge I bring against the Government tonight. If the amendment is-passed, the proposal to introduce this Bill will be referred to a Committee, and the result ot the Committee's investigation will be to discover grounds on which a measure can be framed, or to advise that such legislation should be deferred to a later period. I do not think any honourable member will seriously contend that he is giving to the country the best that is in him when he is a party to any legislation that is born of strife and feelings bordering on revenge. Any party that takes its lead from a section of its adherents who like that sort of work, is not doing the best that can be done for. the country. There is plenty of legislation with which we can occupy our time. Some three years ago the question of Tariff reform was very much before the people of the Old Country, and some honourable members who are present to-night were in England, and had an opportunity of observing the attitude of the leading statesmen of the Motherland. I am not referring to the statesmen of either party in particular, but to the leading statesmen of the British Parliament; and I have never felt such pleasure and pride as I did over their attitude in regard to Tariff reform. They had, and they have today, difficulties to contend with ; but one of the chief objections they had to dealing with the Tariff question was that they saw the terrible condition of millions of the working people of Great Britain , and they said, "" If we cannot do anything to make the conditions of tliese people better, we will not do anything to make their conditions worse."" That may not be a very great attitude for a reformer to take up ; but it was a masterly attitude for a statesman to adopt, and I ask the Government to take that attitude today. There is a tremendous bitterness of feeling in regard to this industrial question, and I would appeal to both sides of the House to remember that we have to face this problem, or it will be faced by others when we have passed away; and possibly they, having a clearer view, and education being more widespread among the working classes, will be able to deal with these problems more satisfactorily than we can today. What are the Government going to get out of this measure, eyen if they get leave to introduce it? They are going to let loose throughout the country party animosity, party hatred, and all the bitterness that can possibly confront us.' Dust is to be thrown in the eyes of the piimary producers, and they will be told of all sorts of iniquities that will spring from this industrial movement, which, I say, is one of the best guarantees in the world today for industrial peace and for the solidarity and strength of the British Empire. The uplifting of the great masses can never be effected from the top; they must work out their salvation from beneath; and mistakes, no doubt, will be made. The educated section of the community never makes any mistake, and I do appeal to the Government to withdraw this motion and allow us to proceed with something useful.' In the time allotted to us, let us do something that will be of value to the community.",43
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,This amendment is no withdrawal.,44
340,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"It is not a withdrawal, but it is a way out of the difficulty. If I were to appeal to the honourable member for Kennedy to withdraw the amendment, and then ask the Prime Minister to withdraw the Bill , I could quite understand him saying that that was not a fair position to put him in .",44
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,What will you do if we withdraw the Bill?,44
342,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,I should ask the Government to get on with some legislation that is of value to the country. I am not going into any details.,44
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is not wise to go into details, is it?",44
344,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"The r e is the question of the Beef Trust. We know the history of that trust in America. It simply taxed the whole of the consumers of America and ruined the graziers. To-day the trust cannot buy the quantity of stock it requires in America. Is it that America is played out for stock-raising ? Would any sane man on the face of the earth believe that? Stock-raising is played out in America only because the grower has no guarantee that when he raises his stock he"" will not be ruined by the trust, as his predecessor was ruined previously. We know what the trust has done in the Argentine. The Argentine is not blest, or cursed, with a federal system of government; but the Government of that country have, in their wisdom, decided to l i m it the export of frozen meat to a certain quantity per annum. They say to the 'Americans, "" If you choose to trade here, well and good, but you must not do it at the-expense of the Argentine."" iWhat have we done in Australia? The Attorney-General says that he proposes to bring in a measure to deal with this question. My own candid opinion is that he will not be able to do so; because, as has been said on different occasions, an alteration of the Constitution is necessary in order to give this National Parliament power to cope with the matter. Attorney-General says we have that power. Let him bring down his Bill . we may differ from the Attorney-General, we must admit that he is generally capable of making out a good case for anything that he takes up, and he may be able to convince me that there is a chance for this Parliament, even with its present restricted powers, to do something. The Opposition have no desire to hamper the Government. rather to assist them in passing legislation that will be useful to Australia. The National Parliament cannot be judged by the number of Bills that it passes. There are some questions which we might be justified in discussing for a month, and even then we might not feel competent to arrive at a definite decision as to the action that - should be taken. know what the"" press may say, nor do I care, but I submit that Parliament is not bound to pass a Bill a day or even a Bill a month. We have to consider the' quality rather than the quantity of our legislation. The mere fact that a large number of Bills is passed in one session is no reason for congratulation. quality of our legislation is the point to be considered, and a record of the passing of many Bills may point to nothing save that our legislation has been swift, and, perhaps, of a shoddy character. Another question to which this Parliament might well turn 'its attention is the control of the Murray waters. At the recent Conference of State Premiers a proposal was made to deal with the Murray by a system of locking, the Commonwealth to find something like £1,000,000, and the remaining expenditure to be borne by Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia.",44
345,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Hav e not the Government referred that matter to the Inter-State Commission?,45
346,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"It should not be referred to the Inter-State Commission; it should be dealt with by this Parliament. There may be some feeling between the States concerned, but where on bhis continent is there a better assembly for discussing and settling the question in the interests of the people of the whole Commonwealth .than is the National Parliament? Legislation dealing with the subject should follow broad national lines. Many people in South Australia believed, prior to Federation, that the The National Parliament would have control of the Murray River. Indeed, I think However two-thirds of the people of Australia held - that view. But later on they found that Federation would not help them out of the difficulty. An y intelligent man viewing the fact that the two parties in this House are practically equally divided, would say, "" If members had any patriotism they would sink their differences of opinion and come to an We wish agreement upon national issues of pressing importance to the people."" This question of the Murray waters demands the combined wisdom of the National Parliament. There is also the revision of the Tariff awaiting our attention. Honourable members opposite say that the Labour party should have dealt with it when in office. My answer is that so I do not many large and important questions of pressing urgency demanded our consideration that it was impossible to dispose of them all. If I were making an unreasonable proposal I should not be surprised' if the Attorney-General turned it down, but the position that I take up is that we do not and cannot make the The issues in this great country. The electors have returned to this House two parties practically equal in number, . and those who know the ABC of public life must recognise that in such circumstances nothing in the way of reform or progressive legislation on vital party lines can be attempted. Recognising this, the Government should deal with the broad, non-party questions that await our attention. It is all very well for the Government to say, "" We do not like this or that "" ; but they are in the same position as we are. We should like to be able to carry reforms calculated, by evolution, to change the face of our civilization, and to bring about a better distribution of wealth by removing the system of wage slavery that we have today. That, however, can be done only when the people return a party sufficiently strong numerically to do so. The Government and their supporters, I repeat, are in much the same position that we occupy. That being so, I am not making an unreasonable proposition when I urge that they should interpret the mandate of the people on the lines indicated by me, .and introduce important non-party measures. I have by no means' exhausted the list. Measures dealing with company law, bankruptcy, and one or two other subjects have long been promised. There is now ample opportunity to deal with them. The Government, therefore', should accept this amendment. The proposed Committee would furnish a report on which they might act. There need be no hurry on the part of the Committee in bringing up a report. A little delay would tend to cool down the party passions and prejudices which now exist. We have had enough of that sort of thing. There is thrown on every honourable member the responsibility of maintaining the' dignity and prestige of the House, and we should so act that when we receive our walking tickets we shall be able to hand over to our successors the conduct of the business of the country with the prestige of the National Parliament unimpaired. We urge the Government to give up the mistaken policy they are now pursuing, and to deal with national questions. The break of gauge is a question with which they might also deal.",45

348,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I was not going into detail. A f t e r we have collected all the information on the question that we can get, we may find that it is not worthy of the attention given to it . Parliament can either tur n its attention to matters of urgent reform, for which there is the mandate of the people, or it can take the alternative course to which I have referred. I ask the Attorney-General whether he will withdraw his motion ? Mr W. H . IBVINE - No .",46

352,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"I am surprised at the reply of the Attorney-General, but I hope that he will consider the views that I have put forward, and that Government supporters will insist that Ministers'shall retrace their steps, and not pursue f u r ther a line of action which is not in the best interests of the country.

354,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Cook) [8.20] - The proposal before the House is that a Select Committee be appointed to inquire generally whether legislation of the kind sought to be introduced, or of some other kind, should be passed to deal with preference to unionists. As a reason why the whole subject should be referred to a Select Committee, I propose to quote some strong opinions regarding preference to unionists expressed by the Prime Minister some years ago. They come under the following headings: (1) Voluntary action in settling disputes. (2) Australian capitalists; why unionists should be more protected in Australia than in England. (3) Objections of employers to preference answered. (4) The question of free labour. (5) Freedom of contract; and arising out of that. (6) The work of girls in factories; the opinions of a member of the House of Commons, of Richard Oastler, and of John Stuart M ill being cited in support of the Prime Minister's argument. (7) Question of referring this matter for decision to the Courts. (8) What unionism has done for the workers and for the world generally; with the opinion of Thorold Rogers in support of the Prime Minister's argument. The passages - which I propose to read are to be found in a great speech delivered by the honourable gentleman, in 1900, when a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. reported in the New South Wales Hansard for the 2nd August, 1900. The Prime Minister, having delivered his speech, had proofs of the report submitted to him by the printer, and, on the following day, calmly corrected them in his office, so that his remarks might be preserved for posterity in the public records of the country in the exact form that he wished them to take. This speech was not made when he was with in the ranks of the Labour party. Years before he had left the Labour party to join the so-called Liberals. At the time of its delivery, he had been a M in ister of the Crown in a Liberal Administration, and had had many years' experience in Parliament. The speech, therefore, was the expression of one whose mind must be considered to have matured on the question with which he dealt. Having taken some interest in union matters, and having heard the question of preference to unionists threshed out in great union assemblies, in public debates, and in this Parliament, I say that the arguments and pathos of the speech, excel anything that I have heard. Speaking of voluntary action in settling disputes, the honourable member saidAll that voluntary action can eto for the settlement of these disastrous industrial troubles has boen done; but in spite of all that has been done, men are today being victimized because they belong to trades organizations - The other day a mine manager discharged six men, the reason given being that the trade of the mine was falling off, and that, therefore, these men had to go. It was only a coincidence that they were the six men at the colliery who had agitated for an advance in wages, which was afterwards conceded. - They attended the meeting, at which it was 'determined to ask for this advance, and, so to speak, took a lead of the proceedings whereby it was secured, and it was merely a coincidence that they, and only they, were sent about their business at a time when there was an appearance of a falling off in trade. .With variations, that has been the experience of the union movement from the beginning down to the present day. Members of a trade, fearing injustice, their fellows to band together, and become their spokesme», agitating for better conditions. This: at oncebrings them the wrath of their employers, because the improvement of working condiAfr. J. H. Catts. tions and the increasing of wages means the corresponding curtailment of profits. Every device known to the human mind is practised to get r i d of such men, It is coercion being used to drive them out of the industry. The Prime Minister, when he made his speech, .had been Postmaster-General in an Administration of which the present HighCommissioner was the head. Having worked in mines, the instance which he cited appealed to him directly.",46
355,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,We should have a quorum. [Quorum formed.],47
356,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"It is to be remembered that the Prime Minister, when he spoke, had had experience in the Old Country as well as in Australia, and knew the hardships to which unionists had been subjected in both parts of the world. Dealing with the attitude of Australian capitalists, and to show why unionists should be more full y protected in Australia than in any other country, he saidHaving had experience of both countries, I venture to say that there is a difference between the capitalism of the Old Country and the capitalism of these Colonies. . . . It seems to me that the difference in the capitalism in the two communities is largely one of temperament. In the Old Country there is still a lingering trace of the old spirit of noblesse, which has come down from feudal times. I am glad to say that it has not yet left the capitalism of the Old Country. In these young countries most capitalists have had to force their way up from the ranks, and the process has developed a somewhat harder side to their natures. They have become what may be called professional capitalists. From a remark recently made by the honourable gentleman, it would appear that he is now the spokesman for those capitalists. He pointed out that there was greater necessity for protection for the workmen in Australia by the expedient of preference to unionists than there was in the Old Country, because Australian employers, generally speaking, were a harder lot to deal with, and more given to desperate and inhuman measures, than those of whom he had spoken. Now we come to the thir d point, when the Prime Minister answered the objections of employers to preference to invite unionistsBut now let ns see for a moment what this objection really is, and whether it is so formidable as it might appear in some quarters. upon I take up a criticism of the Bill by the Builders' and Contractors' Association, and here the objection is put in sentences. Then he quoted the objections of the Employers Association as follows-We also question the justice of imposing disabilities upon nine-tenths of the industrial community at the instance of the trade-union ""tenth"" in order that the majority of the employees may be coerced into joining trades unions or becoming industrial IshmaeBtes. That is the same old "" gag "" - for it cannot be called an argument-that is put forward by the employers today; and the reply by the Prime Minister of 1900 is as applicable now as it was then. The honourable gentleman bas never retracted those words; in fact, he has emphasized them by saying that he has never turned round on any of his principles. He went on to deal with the question of free labourIt is a recognised rule in unionist circles that unionists should not work with free labourers. Yet the honourable gentleman is a party to a Bill which seeks to compel unionists to work with free labourers on the public works of the Commonwealth. He proceededI know a great many people who will not agree with that. The reason why that takes place today is this : A free labourer is I egarded by the unionist as a menace to his wages, as a menace to his ' price. It is in order to secure his price that he has to sacrifice the free labourer. That is the reason why unionists very much object to work with free ""labourers, because the free labourer is only used, as a rule, by the employer in order to coerce the unionist to accept conditions which the unionist dislikes. That being so, under this Bill the motive of the employer to employ free labour will be taken right away. The free labourer is never called into requisition at all, except in times of industrial trouble. May I remind the honourable gentleman that he recently delivered himself in a speech before an organization which is, presided .over by that evil genius of the workers of Australia, one J . T. Packer. When the tramway employees at Ballarat were tryin g to obtain an increase of wage, which then stood at 30s. a week for married men, this Packer of this Liberal strike-breaking labour institute, wrote to the manager of the company to the effect that if the unionists were not prepared to work for wages the members of the organization were prepared to send men from Melbourne to do the work at the company's price. Y e t the Prime Minister honoured this organization with his presence, gave it his blessing, and sent it on its way rejoicing. The Prime Minister stated that those strike-breakers are never called into requisition except in times of industrial trouble, and there can be no excuse that he did not understand the position. Some honourable members opposite may not realise what it is for a man, with a wife and family, to be struggling on 30s. a week, and, when no has banded with his fellows to obtain a few shillings more, to find, just as success is within his grasp, that some one else comes along and deprives him of it . The increase of wages would have meant more boots and more education for his children-woul d have meant bread and butter instead of bread and drippingbut all his efforts are rendered abortive by the free labourers. As I say, some honourable members opposite may not understand these matters, but that cannot be said of the Prime Minister, who realizes the'position perfectly well, and had it in his mind when he was speaking. He went on to sayMan for man, it is a recognised rule that the trade unionist is at least the equal of the free labourer in ability at his work. Thereforo it is not on account of superior workmanship that the free labourer is employed, but in order that he may be a menace to the unionist, who is employed for the time being, or in order to defeat him if he is out on strike. The honourable gentleman tells us that the free labourer, whom this Bill has Been introduced to placate, is not employed because he is the better workman, but for the express purpose of being a menace to unionists; and yet, as an employer of labour on behalf of the people of Australia, he now proposes-in fact, he ad-, mits having already done so-to employ them, not because they give better value to the public, but because, by their means, he can help them to break down unionism as employers generally are trying to break it down.",47
357,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,And to get cheap labour.,48
358,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Quite so. The honourable gentleman went on to sayAs this Bill is going to stop strikes, there will be no further motive on the part of the employer to take the free labourer under his protecting care. We have an Arbitration Gourt which is presided over by one of the Judges of the High Court, and it has absolute jurisdiction over the public works of the Commonwealth. If there is no need for this discrimination of favour of unionists when there is an Arbitration Court to settle matters, surely, on the honourable gentleman's OAvn argument, there is no need for him to do by this Bill what the Government have already done, namely, encourage those who object to workmen's organizations. He went onI should like'to say, as the result of long experience in these matters, that if honourable gentlemen will think for a moment what is the object of the free labourer, and the effect of the free labourer upon the condition of the unionist, they will see a very good ground for dislike on the part of the unionist to the free labourer. The Prime Minister has been sitting in his place while I have quoted his own speeches and expressions of opinion, and no denial has come from him. We know that, as a rule, if the Prime Minister objects to any statements regarding him, he uses his privilege freely. He sits there interjecting every two or three minutes to contradict statements that may be put forward, but he, has never stood up in the House and contradicted the speeches I have quoted. I now wish to refer to the question of freedom of contract. The Prime Minister is now connected with a party who bandy about the sacred name of liberty, and the following reply of his to an argument based on that old sentiment, is very appropriate at the present time. saysWe hear it in these words : that this Bill is an interference with liberty-a n interference with the principle of freedom of contract. I often think that those gentlemen who make this objection must be very ignorant of our industrial history. They must be very ignorant of the operations of this principle of the freedom of contract when they claim for it so many virtues and so many advantages. The industrial history of this, and every other country, shows that masquerading under this principle of freedom of contract has been some of the most ghastly and horrible slavery that this or any other country has ever known. Go to the beginning of this century and read there a picture of the operation of this principle cf freedom of contract. I have here a volume entitled Industry in England, by Mr H. de B. Gibbins. Any one who will take the trouble to read this book will, I think, for ever after very careful as to how he uses that phrase, "" freedom of contract."" We are not here, I take it, to mouth shibboleths either of liberty or protection or anything else. We are here to investigate facts, and to see the bearing of them, and they are facts in the industrial life of this country. The honourable gentleman, who is seeking to return to the old principle of freedom of contract, under which the employer shall be free to choose non-unionists as against unionists, here states that that principle has been responsible for some Mr J, fl. Catts. of the most ghastly tragedies in the in dustrial life of the Empire. H is words are as true today as they were when uttered in 1900. He went on to picture how employers with freedom of contract, treated little girls in England in the factories, and he quoted the speech of a member of the British House of Commons as follows:Our ancestors could not have supposed it possible-posterit y will not believe it true-that a generation of Englishmen could exist, or had existed, that would work lisping infancy of a few summers old, regardless alike of its smiles or tears, and unmoved by its unresistiug weakness, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen hours a day, and through the weary night also, till, in the dewy morn of existence, the bud of youth was faded, and fell ere it was unfolded. . . . Here is a picture put forward by our present Prime Minister of the treatment employers will mete out to tiny toddling, girls in their lisping infancy.",48
359,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Does he say that he was misreported ?,49
360,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"No ; and when the speech is quoted in his presence he walks out of the chamber. He does not like to be reminded of these convictions of his, which, I venture to say, are just as much his convictions today as they were He on the day they were uttered. The Prime Minister may have changed his position, but he has not changed his convictions on the matter. It is absolutely impossible for a man in the maturity of liis manhood, after having been for many years in public life, to put forward opinions of this description which are not his real opinions. To imagine that a man would do that sorb of thing is to have an opinion of him that I would not - like to describe. Then the Prime M in ister proceeds as to the work of these girls on the night shifts in the factories of England. He says, . . Then, in order to keep them awake, to stimulate their exertions, means are made be use of which I shall now advert, as a last instance of the degradation to which this system has reduced the manufacturing operatives of this country. Children are beaten with thongs, prepared for the purpose. Yes; the females of this country, no matter whether children or grown up-and I hardly know which is the more disgusting outrage-ar e beaten, beaten in your free market of labour, as you term it, like slaves.

He has always been associated with that class in community who stand for the very evils the present Prime Minister was attacking. The Prime Minister, in his speech, proceeded to quote an authority on i dustrial matters, Richard Oastler, lowsI am quoting this as a perfect picture freedom of contract-the shibboleth which being mouthed today by all employers Apparently, he has not forgotten the picturesque language he adopted some years ago, judging by our recent exgiven periences of the honourable member i Houseand I cannot but believe that those who it so fully must be very ignorant of what is meant in its full operation at the beginning of this century. I will tell you what I seen. Will honourable members just imagine the pathos of this statementTake a little female captive, six or years old; she shall rise from her bed at 4 o'clock in the morning of a cold winter but before she rises she wakes, perhaps, half-adozen times, and says, "" Father, is it time Father, is it time?"" And at last, when gets up and puts her little bits of rags upon commits them to the principle. her weary limbs-wear y yet by the last day's e leaves her parents in their bed, for labour-if they have any-is not required so early. She trudges alone through rain, and of snow, and mire, and darkness, to the mill, there for thirteen, fourteen, sixteen, sevenor even eighteen hours, is she obliged work, with only thirty minutes' interval for meals and play. Homeward again at night she would go, when she was able, but many a time she hid herself in the wool in the mill, as she had not strength to go. And if she were one moment behind the appointed time, bell had ceased to ring when she arrived trembling, shivering, weary limbs at the and factory door, there stood a monster in human form, and as she passed he lashed her. This, he continued, holding up an overlooker's is no fiction. It was hard at work in this town week. The girl I am speaking of died; but dragged on that dreadful existence for Prime Minister was answering those who seek for freedom of contract, which if operative, this Bill would him. concede. We know perfectly well that what the Bill purports to deal with was put into operation by the Gotwelve months ago, so that the measure will not effect anything. At the same time the Prime Minister canescape his responsibility for the principle involved in it , and last year in their the policy programme the Government indicated that they were prepared to put it into operation, as far as the Commonwealth has jurisdiction, in regard to the whole of the industries of Australia. n - However, they probably thought that this as folgeneral application of the principle of freedom of contract was too big r.f an undertaking, and that it would is not act with the public of Australia, and they thought that they had better try the public with a small dose of it before going on with the full measure, so they have us a little dose of it in this Bill . n this They have put it into operation only in regard to the day-labour system in mouth the Commonwealth service. They think that this will satisfy the employers, and have bring them to heel when the Liberals are out to fight, and that it will open the financial chests of the monopolistic cliques of Australia on their behalf; and if they seven get back into power they will revert to the full principle referred to in their proday, gramme of last year, which apparently ? has been abandoned for this Bill , which, she though milder in its declaration, still The Prime Minister also quoted another great authority on this question. He saidWe cannot do better than refer to an authority which is more frequently quoted by the opponents of this measure than perhaps any other-a n authority whom they nearly always regard as being on their side. I refer to John Stuart Mill. I am going to quote a few sentences from his essay on liberty. Whatever other people may say of John Stuart Mill, I disagree with him in many of his statements; but I recognise in him one* of the clearest and most profound thinkers on these questions that our race has ever produced. This is what John Stuart Mill says: "" The object of this essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individual in the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physical force, in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of public opinion. That principle is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty _ of action of any of their number is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can he rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. Then he adds his comment, and saysThat quotation from John Stuart Mill rectlv describes the principle operating under this Bill. He was there referring to the principle of unionists, but this Bill asserts preference to unionists beiug included the Arbitration .Bill introduced in the New South ""Wales Legislative Assembly. The Prime Minister had made a study of citizens, these authorities. N ot only had be pracwhether tical experience of how the matter affected the workmen, but he had also read the Commonwealth. great industrial authorities f against preference to unionists, and he was giving voice to his matured convicwhat tions after his practical experience and refer years of studying the question. Now I come to the question of give the Judge exercising judicial ence; that is, if , on a plaint referred to the Arbitration Court sided over by a High Court upon the evidence produced, the Judge thinks that it ""would be in the terests of the whole community granted preference to unionists, he may so. This principle was embodied in Bill that the Prime Minister was cussing when he was a member of New South Wales Assembly, and his marks are very much to the point, beCourt, cause, in the Commonwealth Act, the dispreference cretion is left to the President Arbitration Court, who is a Judge of the Mr J. JET. Catts. High Court, and this Bill , so far as it has any operative effect, seeks to with draw part of the jurisdiction of the Court in this matter. This is what the Prime Minister had to say about it We commit millions of pounds' worth of pro- . perty to the disposal of our Judges every day.. All over the world the Courts of Law determine the conditions of families and of estates, and it seems to me that we should not hesitateabout committing trade disputes to the arbitration of a Court in regard to which we have the highest guarantees to assure us that the Court will be what we say it will be. We commit these material interests to the hnn<i-s of men to whom w.e are content to commit the issues of life and death. Our High Court Judges have committed to their care issues of l if e and death. If one of our citizens is tried for his lifethere is an appeal from every Supreme Court to the High Court, and the Judge of the Arbitration Court can thereforesit in the High Court and decide questions of life and death. The present Prime Minister argued on tliese grounds-that the Judge presiding in the A r corbitration Court might safely be intrusted with the exercise of his discretion on theevidence on a question of preference to the in bad principle that, though a Judge might safely be allowed to exercise this immense jurisdiction over the lives of he is not to be intrusted to decidepreference to unionists should be granted in day-labour works under theThen he proceeded to o r and say on the same questionNow you can say anything you like about is possible under this Bill; but when youa matter to the decision of a Judge, whatever you may think of the opinion he mayhold, it is assumed that he is competent to a decision. But every one of these casescited presupposes that the Judge is going topreferbe a fool, and not an ordinarily intelligent being man. Is not the very reason of inquiry to preenable the Judge to find out what is theJudge, measure of justice in the claim of either side ? We have had Mr Justice Higgins presidining over the Commonwealth Arbitratio n if he Court. It has been said in some quartersdo that this Judge has been very sympathetic the with claims put forward by the workdismen ; but there has been no singlethe instance that I can call to mind' resince he has been presiding over that in which he has ordered judicial' to unionists. In every case of the where claims have been filed in the A r b it ration Court the union has claimed preference to unionists; but this Judge, who according to the Prime Minister, is not to be trusted to hear evidence as to whether preference to unionists shall be granted on works under the Commonwealth Government, has never in the history of the Court, since 1905, awarded preference to unionists on the evidence put forward.",50
363,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,Unknown,He did so in the Brisbane tramway case.,52
364,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I must correct myself to that extent; I remember the instance mentioned. In the Brisbane tramway case the Judge did not, in the first instance, award preference to unionists; he said, "" I do not wish to interfere with. the employers in their choice of their workmen, but if I find that the men are being victimized, the union may come back to me, and I shall be compelled to award preference to unionists."" True to the instincts of that type of employer, the manager of the Brisbane Tramway Company did go in for wholesale victimization of the men. who had banded themselves together to better the conditions of themselves and their fellow-workmen, and then, only then, did the Court say that, in order to stop such tyranny and prevent the employers from evading the decision of the Judge in regard to the conditions of labour, ho was compelled to give a preference that would protect unionists. That was a case in which the tramway company were doing what the Prime Minister has described in the speech I have quoted, when he spoke of the half-dozen miners banding themselves together to advance the interests of themselves and their class; but through some flimsy pretext of a falling-off in trade, the men who had taken leading parts in the union were sacked. Preference to unionists is to prevent victimization of that kind; and in the tramway case the Judge was obliged to give preference to unionists, in order to protect the men against the employer. If the number of workmen concerned was to be totalled up, it would probably be found that the President of the Arbitration Court delivered awards which governed the working conditions of at least a quarter-of-a-million of workmen, and the only instance in which he awarded preference to unionists was in connection with the employment of two or three thousand men. The next point I wish to deal with is what unionism has done for workmen and for the community generally; and on this point the Prime Minister was no less emphatic. He adduced arguments why workmen's organizations should be encouraged, and why their members should get preference over those who did not subscribe to the upkeep of the union. The honourable member argued that, in the interests of the whole community, such organizations should be encouraged, and to afford that encouragement it was necessary to give to them preference in their employment, so as to encourage other men to join the unions, which were a boon to society, and were making it possible for the workers to live on a higher plane of civilization than before. This is what the honourable member said It is generally recognised today, I think, by all intelligent men, that nearly'all that has come to labour by way of advancement has been per medium of these organizations. One can readily understand the feeling of the unionist when engaged in a dispute in defence of the privileges he already enjoys, and which he has hardly won by many years of arduous toil, when a man is brought into the arena to try and wrest those privileges from him. The free labourers, in these unionist centres at any rate, step into reap where they have not sown. It is that feeling which gives rise to hostility on the part of the unionist. Then the honourable member developed the case he was making out for the protection of unions and unionists. I venture to say, that upon the merits of the case alone, the Bill does right to give a preference to the trades unionist. I have already said that in my judgment trades unions have done more for the workers than, perhaps, all the other influences which operate tfo advance our civilization put together. That is not my opinion only; it is the opinion of those who have studied the question deeply, and who are in a sphere which enables them to detach themselves from the influences which operate with those who have had anything to do with these troubles. It is their opinion that trades unions have done a great deal of good to the country at large. Almost the last speech that Mr Gladstone delivered before he died furnished an opportunity for a statement of this kind. Continuing, the honourable gentleman quoted this statement by GladstoneI believe the trades unions of the world are the bulwarks of our modern Democracy. "" That,"" said the Prime Minister, "" is Mr Gladstone's deliberate opinion in almost the last speech he delivered."" And then the honourable member, giving evidence of his research and study, quoted Thorold Rogers. He saidThorold Rogers - will be admitted to be one of the clearest-headed men we have who has ever investigated this subject. He saysThc public is profoundly interested in the efficiency and independence of the working man. By the former, the industrial success of the country is guaranteed and secured. In the latter lies the only hope that we shall be ever .able to realise in our day what the trade guilds of the middle ages aimed at,. . and in some direction unquestionably secured. . . The trades unions of London and other large towns do not, perhaps, exercise the moral discipline over their members which they might do if their fellows more generally enlisted in the system, and they will do as they get stronger and better informed, but I am abundantly convinced that the trade unionists in England include in their numbers the most intelligent, conscientious and valuable of the working men. That is Thorold Rogers' view of trades unionists. He saysI confess to. having at one time viewed them suspiciously. A long study of'the history of labour has convinced me that they are not only the best friends of the workman, but the best agency for the employer and the public, and that, to the extension of these associations, political economists and statesmen must look for the solution of some among the most pressing and the most difficult problems of our own time. I shall hope to show this after I have dealt with the facts of the present situation. Those are the opinions of writers who have studied these questions deeply, and therefore, it seems to me, to be but a just recognition of the work of trade unionists and, apart altogether from its incidental bearing upon the Bill, that this preference to trade organizations should be given. We have seen cases in some unions in Australia where a minority of the organization has refused to abide by the majority's decision.' There have been cases in which there has been a decision by the union that work should be continued during some industrial friction; but a minority of members have broken away, and thrown the industry into chaos and strife. In order that organizations might be able to exercise discipline over a minority broke away and caused industrial when the majority of workmen in the industry desired that further should be given for a peaceful the Prime Minister argued that should be encouragement to men to join Mr J. H. Catts. the organizations. He contended that when industrial trouble loomed on the horizon, men who were not members of a union should be encouraged to join, so that the discipline of the leaders of the organization might be exercised openly, and so that disputes might be settled in a constitutional and peaceful manner. Preference should be the encouragement given to bring about industrial peace and the settlement of these disastrous troubles by reference to the Law Courts of the land. The honourable gentleman has made one effort to extricate himself from the position in which he finds himself. On 10th June, 1912, he went to Lithgow, the district which first returned him to Parliament, and in the course of a speech which he made, some questions were raised in regard to preference to unionists, and as to whether he had altered his opinion. The honourable gentleman replied, "" Oh, no, I have not altered my opinion. My opinion is what it was before; but other people with whom I was associated have altered their opinion. It is they who have done the jumping round."" That statement fastens upon the honourable gentleman the holding of these opinions from 1900 to 1912. When pressed to state in what way the others had done the jumping round of which he spoke, he said that he believed in preference to unionists before the unions took part in politicswhen they were purely industrial organizations-bu t since they were taking political action to secure the objects for which they were banded together, he now objected to preference. Before exploding that excuse, may 1 say that almost every object of a trade union is today the subject matter of political action? The workers band together to secure the payment of a minimum wage, a shorter working day, the provision of devices to protect them when working amongst machinery, better sanitary conditions, more breathing space, and separate lavatories that in factories for male and female workers, unrest, compensation in case of accident, and so forth . Almost every object aimed at by opportunity a union, as something to be gained by settlement, organization, is the subject of political there action. Surely if men are banded together and are paying in to their union a few pence a week to attain these objects, that fact should not debar them from securing preference. It might be necessary, for instance, for a union in Western Australia to send a deputation to the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General in Melbourne, to ask for an amendment of the navigation law, so as to provide for compensation to seamen injured in the discharge of their, duties. But the very moment that they spent money in sending that deputation here it would be said that they .were taking political action, and were to be put upon straight away. That, according to the Prime Min-. ister, would be an evil. According to his argument-if it be an argument-the men should go out on strike, throw the whole industrial community into a state of turmoil, and rely only on brute strength in fighting out the issue. They must not take constitutional measures to remedy their grievances. As a matter of fact, I can knock away that prop on which the Prime Minister is - relying. I find that he himself, when secretary of the Miners' Union at Lithgow, convened a meeting of the unions in the district, and proposed that they should combine to secure the re-"" turn of members of Parliament. I quoted the honourable gentleman's letter a few days ago, and now that I am linking him up with this question, it may not be out of place to quote it once more. It shows that the Prime Minister was in favour of preference to unionists at a time when unionists were taking political action. It is the last proof that need be given of his support of the principle. I have shown that he argued in favour of it in 1900, that in 1912 he said that he had not shifted from his original position, that he believed in preference to unionists when the organization was for industrial purposes and not for political action, and now, by quoting this letter, I shall show that he invited the tmions of the Lithgow district to join with him in taking political action to return members to Parliament. The letter is as follows:Having regard to a communication which recently appeared in the daily press purporting to have been written by the secretary of the Drivers' and Firemen's Association to the Trades and Labour Council, suggesting the fusion of the Labour forces of the district, with a view to returning a representative to Parliament whose sympathies should be entirely with the worker, I am directed by my delegate board to submit for your consideration the following proposition :-That two (2) representatives from each Labour organization of the Hartley district meet, at a time and place to be hereafter arranged, for the purpose of taking the necessary steps for the return of a Labour candidate at the next general election. The need for this has been emphasized by the unsympathetic, and actively hostile attitude assumed, by our present member throughout the long and wasting strike, in the midst of which our own organization is plunged at the present time. During the present crisis, Mr . Hurley has not failed whenever the opportunity presented itself to declaim against the tyranny and unrighteousness of the methods of our procedure, as well as having gone out of his way to be brutally offensive towards those members upon whom only we can rely to furnish us with the means of voicing our complaints in the Parliament of the country. Not only so, but very recently Mr Hurley gave expression to words in the House which ean only be construed as containing a direct challenge to the Labour organizations of this district. Furthermore, since the commencement of the present struggle Mr Hurley has never evinced the slightest desire to help in any 'way those of his constituents and supporters whose fortunes have been so adversely affected by the continuance of the strike, and, indeed, has shown in every possible way and manner the strong sympathy with those who in this struggle must be regarded as the opponents of trade unionism. In view, therefore, 'of the unquestionable attitude taken up by Mr Hurley with respect to the progressive developments cf the Labour forces of this colony, my Board is anxious to express its cordial agreement with the action taken by the Drivers' and Firemen's Association, and urge the earnest consideration of the above proposition as the best means of giving effect to that sympathy which exists amongst the various workers of the Colony, and which can only find fitting expression in that unity of action which shall secure to us direct representation in the Parliament of this Colony. Hoping you will give the matter your best attention, and do me the favour of an early reply. (Sgd.) Jos. Coox> Miners' General Secretary. In the face of all these arguments by the honourable gentleman in f a v o u r of p r e f e r ence to unionists, he put s up a colleague to move the m o t i o n for leave to in t r o d u c e the Bill , the m o t i o n for it s second readi n g , the m o t i o n for it s t h i r d r e a d in g - in f a c t , to Watch the Bill in the interests of the Government.

In view of the opinions of the Prime Minister, I submit that we ought to have further investigation before this question becomes the subject-matter of a Bill . The question ought to be referred to a Select Committee, who should have the. opportunity of putting the Bible in the hands of the Prime Minister and finding out on oath whether the man, who is claimed by the party opposite to have sufficient political wisdom to lead them and this country, really believes that the Bill to be brought before the House is one designed to serve the best interests of Australia.",54

[Quorum formed/] The proposal to refer the Bill to a Select mittee is, to my mind, a brilliant idea, because a Select Committee could inquire whether there is any sincerity about the suggestion of the Attorney-General and his satellites that we are afraid to go to the country, and that they are not. I noticed that, on Monday night, the At torney-General went down to the place called Sandringham, and said in a speech he made that he was putting an iron collar on certain people. It was not very complimentary on his part to suggest that this party is a dog. He said that naturally the hand that put on the collar, being the nearest, was the hand that was bitten. Of course we know that he is a very elegant gentleman, who always uses very elegant language, and sometimes adopts very elegant metaphor. But on this amendment I shall not be able to deal with that matter, aud shall have to refer to it at another stage. The honourable gentleman x said, "" I am against preference of any kind, judicial or other,"" That, no doubt, expressed his feelings.

396,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I take great exception thinks he does. to the class character of the Bill. I want the Select Committee to inquire if this the same Bill that was introduced last year. We have not been told yet that is - If it is, I am against it. I want Committee to investigate this part of ""No preference or discrimination shall be made for or against any person in refrom lation to any employment by the Commonwealth or any Department or authority thereof on account of his membership or non-membership of any political or inThe Attorneyat General, the dignified embodiment of and justice on'the public platform, of when the Women's National League are sitting there worshipping him, said that he had no objection to lawyers being brought under the Bill. I want the Select Committee to find out why. I should put in the witness-box, on his oath, and ask him why he has left the lawyers out of the Bill. A year ago I asked him this very question, and he said, "" I can assure the honourable member that the provisions the measure will' apply to the members of the legal profession as well as to memof other professions,"" and I believe that that was his intention at first.",57
397,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"He has done it . can Mr HIGGS - He has not, and he knows it. Why has he not carried out his promise? A few evenings ago I asked, "" Why does not the Bill apply to the professional classes?"" and the Attorney General said, "" It does; we are an organization, and it applies to us."" The Attorney-General is surely too good a lawyer to make a mistake like that. The Bill refers to members of an industrial or political association. As the honourable member for for Bendigo said the other night the Bar , Council is, no doubt a very industrious but it is not an industrial organi",57
398,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,How do you de,57
399,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member Atknows that the High Court would simply what dismiss them. The honourable member will ask me questions, but he does not contend him that a member of the Bar Council is a member of an industrial organization.",57
400,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Why not? I honwant light thrown on the subject.,57
401,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member wants a good deal more light than he Unfortunately, I am not permitted to charge him 6s. 3d. for is my advice. Some day I shall move that all members of Parliament be entitled to it appear before the High Court. We shall the see if the Attorney-General is in favour it : of preference to unionists then. Mr W . H . IBVINE - I do not think it would do us much harm.",57
402,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"That interjection shows that the honourable member is not given to pray, as Bobby Burns did , "" The Lord gie us a guid conceit o' oursels."" If it is fair to put the lawyers in the Bill , why haa not the Attorney-General done so ? Why has he his eye on the working classes al l the time? I said the other night that he hated them, but I believe he loves them so much that he could eat them without salt. The Attorney-General thinks this Bill a grand piece of electioneering. The Select Committee might inquire whether thero is any real value in this so-called test measure. I do not believe that the people will be misled into voting against the great Australian national Labour party, when they discover that the Bill is directed mainly against the people who earn their wages by manual or semi-manual labour. also want the Select Committee to """"go through the High Court rules, and through the law concerning the High Court, which empowers the Judges to make rules regarding the barristers and solicitors who may appear before them, and to fix the fees that shall be paid to them. All this goes to show that the lawyers' union is one of the strongest in the world.",58
403,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Does the Attorneyson. General still say that the Bill will apply to the members of the legal profession?,58
404,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"He will not answer my object question, but asks me for a definition an industrial association.",58
405,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,We shall have to get the High Court definition dustry.,58
406,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The H i gh Court definition of an industry would not include barristers. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Would it not? Why not?,58
407,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Will the Attorney General say that his proposed Bill the lawyers ? Mr W . H . IBVINE - I think so. None of us can say until the matter comes be decided by the,Courts.",58
408,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Will the honourable gentleman have any objection to put the word "" lawyers "" into the Bill ? Mr W . H . IBVINE - No suggestion has passengers. ever been made that there is such a thing as Government preference to lawyers.",58
409,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I have suggested it myself, and other people have suggested it . No one else can get preference. W h at occurred in Victoria only the other day? Mr Justice Hodges, I think it was, was trying a case, and a barrister came int o Court without having his brief marked. The Judge said, "" Why have you done this thing? A brief ought to be marked before a lawyer comes into Court with it."" Mr W . H . IBVINE - Is not that quite right ?",58
410,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I believe it is. ' Mr W . H . IBVINE - Do you know the reason for it ? ,58
411,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I think I do. Mr W . H . IBVINE - What is it ?,58
412,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am not in the witnessbox now, and the honourable gentleman will permit me to continue my speech in my own way. I Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I hope the honourable member will tell me, because I do not know.",58
413,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I believe that one reason is that a lawyer might go into Court with an understanding that if he won he was to get some money, and if he lost he should get nothing. The Attorney-General is not listening' now. Mr W . H . IBVINE - Yes , and I think the honourable member.has given the rea",58
414,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman d id not think that I knew it . The is to prevent litigation, and to preof vent gambling in the Courts. If the At torney-General is now satisfied that I know something about the matter, I may of an in - proceed to the next point. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The honourable member was setting it up as an awful example, and he now admits that it is a very proper practice.",58
415,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I say that it is a very proper practice for a lawyers' union. The Attorney-General argues that lawyer's get no preference, and I say that they covers are given preference by the Courts. Mr W. H . IBVINE - How ?",58
416,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Because no non-union to lawyer is allowed to appear before the Court. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No non-licensed chemist is allowed to sell drugs, and no non-licensed cabman is allowed to carry",58
417,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"It is quite righ t that no quack chemist or quack doctor should be allowed to practise. It is for the benefit of the public that there should be unions, but that is what the Attorney General cannot see. While it is for the benefit of the general public that there should be unions of lawyers, medical men, architects, and so on, it is for the benefit of civilization that there should be unions of carpenters, plumbers, labourers, and others. Mr W. H . IBVINE - Is the honourable member in favour of compulsory unionism for carpenters?",58
418,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I will not allow the Attorney-General to cross-examine me. He is trying to get me off the point, which is that lawyers at present are given preference by the Court. If the lawyer whom Mr Justice Hodges lectured in Court the other day was expelled from the union by the Bar Council, and applied to the Attorney-General for employment, t.he honourable gentleman, would not give him any. He would say, "" You are not a member of the union, sir, and we give preference to unionists."" But we have the Attorney-General's own case. He is a very strong unionist, and a thorough believer in unionism so long as it applies to the legal profession. Mr W. H . IBVTXE - I am in favour of unionism in every form.",59
419,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"So much in favour of unionism is the honourable gentleman that he will not meet one of his own colleagues in Court. I believe that the Hon. Patrick Glynn is quite qualified, but owing to some difference of opinion on the subject of the rules of the union",59
420,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,Mr Glynn is a solicitoi as well as a barrister.,59
421,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Owing to this difference of opinion the Attorney-General would not work with his colleague in the Court. . Mr W. H . IBVINE - Unfortunatel y for the honourable member he is a little inaccurate, because I have appeared in Court several times with the honourable gentleman referred to.",59
422,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I am quite willing to withdraw my statement if I have been misinformed. I was informed that the of the House. Attorney-General would not act with the Hon. Mr Glynn as a barrister except in certain cases.,59
423,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Excep t on constitufuneral, tional questions before the High Court",59
424,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Will the Attorney General say whether that is correct?,59
425,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member is not in order in asking the question.,59
426,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Ver y well, sir, I shall, not press the point. Wherever we turn we find these unions, and I should like a Select Committee to inquire Avhether there would be any disadvantage to the legal profession in granting preference to unionists; whether there would be anything disastrous to civilization in giving preference to medical men who might come up for employment in the Commonwealth Public Service; and whether there would be anything detrimental in granting preference to architects. We shall be requiring the services of architects in connection with the Eederal Capital, and I think that preference should be given to the union architect. I am sure that the honourable member for Kooyong, who is another union lawyer, will agree that that would be quite right. It is strange that the honourable member should be found voting for an anti-preference to unionists Bill. I do not know what is coming over the so-called Liberal party when they allow themselves to be run by the Tories, with the Attorney-General at their head. I want a Select Committee to make inquiries into the bona fides of a number of trade unions. Honourable members will no doubt recollect that the Hon. King O'Malley, when Minister of Home Affairs, issued an edict, in which he said, "" I find that we are only paying - builders' labourers 8s. 4d. per day. Pay them 9s. per day, and give preference to unionists."" I might have the builders' labourers' rules with me, but, if not, I could supply them to the Select Committee if it be appointed. I wish the Committee to inquire into the bona fides of the Amalgamated Carpenters and Joiners Association. It is stated that it was formed sixty years ago, when carpenters were getting 4s. 6d. a day. I find that it is claimed that the association has paid no less than £3,250,000 in benefits.",59
427,Mr HOWE,Unknown,I call attention to the state [Quorum formed.],59
428,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"This association claims to have expended £3,250,000 in sick, un- employed, accident, superannuation, and trade benefits, and its membership is more than 62,000. What are the entrance fees to this organization? They are 5s. per member, with contributions of ls. per week for full benefit members, and 4d. per week for trade benefit members. Now, is it not a fair thing to give preference to members of that organization who have raised wages from 4s. 6d. per day sixty years ago to what they are at the present time? Then let me take the case of the Australian Builders' Labourers Association. The objects of that body are thus set out, "" To obtain and maintain reasonable hours of work and fair wages and conditions, to improve, protect, and foster the best in terests of its members, to assist by just and equitable methods in the settlement of any differences which may arise between the members and their employers, to provide benefits to members when unable to work as the result of accident, and to establish a f u n d to carry out the foregoing objects."" Is there anything extravagant in the claims of that association? Let the proposed Select Committee ascertain. They will not find in the rules of that organization anything such as may be discovered in the rules of the High Court as to the fees which barristers may charge-the y will find no twenty or twenty-five guineas per day, with ten-guinea refreshers. All that the Minister of Home Affairs did was to direct that these builders' labourers should be paid 9s. per day, and that preference should be granted to unionists. The Attorney-General,'who is the idol of the society classes of Victoria, said, "" We will not permit you to have preference to unionists,"" and the Prime Minister, whose opinions were quoted by the honourable member for Cook to-night, knows perfectly well what is the work of a labourer. He knows that these builders' labourers who are associated together for these moral objects are entitled to preference at the hands of the Commonwealth,",59
429,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,He knows that he ought to employ the best men in the interests of the Commonwealth.,60
430,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"And the best men are to be found in the unions. Let the honourable member go to the Trades H all in any city, and he will there meet men who are good tradesmen in their respective avocations. If the presidents, secretaries, and committees of these trade associations considered themselves only they would have no need to be members of a union at all. But they have some sympathy with their fellows, and with the wives and families of their fellows, and consequently they meet together, and form these trade unions. Surely the Government ought to help these men in the groundwork which they are performing by granting them preference in any employment which the Commonwealth has to offer. It is not a very great deal of employment, it is true. Some honourable member said that it embraces only 2,000 or 3,000 men in the Commonwealth. The Attorney General will doubtless tell the public that we wish to interfere with the Public Service Commissioner and the Public Service Act . But that Act contains many sections directing how persons shall gain admission to our Public Service. To do so, they must first pass certain examinations. They have to be able to read and write, to know something of arithmetic and geometry, and, in some cases, of French or German. The Attorney General and our opponents, with the aid of the daily press-and I wish to say here that I recognise some of theexcellencies of the daily press-wil l attempt to blind the people as to the true merits of the Bill which the Government wish to introduce. I would like to see a Select Committee appointed to inquire into this matter, because I believe that the evidence taken by such a body would find its way into the daily press and act as a counterblast to the speeches of the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister. I do not know whether I ought to occupy any f u r t h er time in dealing with other trade associations. I hold in my"" hand the revised rules of the Amalgamated Coachmakers and the Rolling-stock and Wheelwrights Society of Victoria. By-and-by we shall be entering upon the railway business, and we shall have to employ wheelwrights and coachbuilders. Why should they not be granted a preference ? I read : ' ' The objects of this society shall be for the pur* pose of adopting such regulations from time to time as.will conduce to the benefits of members generally, to give support to its members when unemployed, to afford protection in cases of oppression, to assist them to obtain a fair remuneration for their labour, to abolish the system of piece-working, to use its influence in consolidating the system of working eight hours a day, to prevent any encroachment on the rights of the various trades, and for any purpose affecting the interests of members which the society may determine."" Will any honourable member opposite say that a union which has been formed to assist its members when unemployed should not get preference? Let the Select Committee which I desire to see appointed inquire into this matter. The Prime Minister should not object to that. I have read a speech which was delivered by him in his best Sunday afternoon clerical voice",60
431,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Nasty !,61
432,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"No , it is not. He has several voices. He has the voice of a lion sometimes, when he is attacking honourable members upon this side of the chamber,' but at other times he coos like a dove. The honourable gentleman knows all about the unemployed, and my desire is to get him into the witness box, and ask what he meant the other day when he spoke about a man deteriorating every hour when he was unemployed.",61
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I thought we discussing the question of preference?,61
434,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We are discussing the desirability of appointing a Select Committee to inquire into some of the honourable member's speeches on the question. If I were a member of the Committee I should ask the honourable gentleman, "" Do you think that an organization like the Amalgamated Coachmakers, RollingStock, and Wheelwrights Society, which provides unemployment benefits, ought to receive preference at the hands of the Commonwealth?"" That, I think, is a very fair question, and I now put it to the people of Victoria and of the Commonwealth. At present there is no comprehensive system in Australia for dealing with the unemployed. The Salvation Army may give food in return for certain work; and, under the circumstances, considering the poor response to the appeals for subscriptions, I suppose it is about the best that that body can do. But neither State nor Commonwealth afford any means of dealing with the unemployed, whereas the trade unions do.",61
435,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member deal with the amendment ?,61
436,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I desire that the proposed Committee should inquire into the bona fides of the society I have mentioned, and ascertain whether or not it ought to be given preference. again, there is the Operative Bakers Society. I do not know that the Commonwealth is likely to employ bakers, although there is, I believe, a State bakery in New South Wales, which supplies bread to public institutions at I d . a pound.",61
437,Mr OKCHARD,Unknown,And gives short weight and bad bread !,61

440,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The honourable member has suggested that the State Government of New South Wales are trying to poison hospital patients.,61
441,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Capricornia is not in order in replying to an irrelevant interjection.,61
442,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am suggesting that the. proposed Select Committee might ascertain whether the operative bakers should have preference in the event of were such men being employed by the Commonwealth. Further, the Committee might inquire as to the possibility of the Commonwealth entering into the drapery business, although I believe there is plenty of competition in that business now. The motto of the Shop Assistants Association, is as followsFor the cause that lacks assistance, For the wrongs that need resistance, For the future in the distance, And the good that we can do. The objects of the association are thus set forth- To educate its members to a high standard of commercial efficiency. To promote the interests of its members by fostering and promoting fraternal and sympathetic co-operation with each other. To obtain and maintain reasonable liours of work, fair wages, and conditions. The advancement of members, morally, socially, and intellectually.",61
443,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I call the honourable member's attention to the terms of the amendment, and to the fact that his remarks do not appear to me to be in any way connected with the question before the Chair.",61
444,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I am offering material on which a Select Committee might work.,61
445,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The amendment does not provide scope for such remarks.,61
446,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"If the Committee were appointed it would, I imagine, endeavour Then, to ascertain whether it is feasible to carry out such a Bill if it were introduced and passed.",61
447,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,On l y in relation to Government employment.,62
448,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I shall leave the drapers' assistants and deal with lift attendants. These latter follow a very - humble, but, nevertheless, a very necessary occupation. There are lift attendants in the Government service, and honourable members might be surprised to learn that they are members of an association. We must be approaching the millennium when we find all these workers organized. The objects of the L if t Attendants Association areTo obtain and maintain reasonable hours of work and fair rate of wage. To improve the industrial conditions and protect the interests of its members. How unselfish all this is i",62
449,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I remind the honourable member that what he is quoting does not appear to have any connection with the amendment.,62
450,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"As there are not many lift attendants in the service of the Commonwealth, I shall leave that point; but I think it will be admitted that the ""Federated .House and Ship Painters, Paperhangers and Decorators Association of Australia may reasonably come under the designation of Commonwealth employment. All this trouble has arisen out of the builders' labourers being paid 9s. per day and preference to unionists being granted in the Department of Home Affairs. I want a Select Committee to inquire into the rules of the Federated House and Ship Painters, Paperhangers and Decorators Association, with a view to ascertaining to what extent its members should be granted preference. great many carpenters are employed by the Commonwealth, and I would like a Select Committee to inquire whether the rules and objects of the Carpenters and Joiners Association are what they claim to be. If they are, the members of this association should get preference. The following are the objects of this association :The objects of this society arc to raise funds for the advancement, protection, and organization of the trade; to render legal assistance to members for the recovery of wages; and for the mutual support of its members in cases of sickness, accident, and superannuation; for the burial or cremation of members and their wives; for the loss of tools; for assistance to members out of work; and to assist (to a reasonable extent) any branch or district desirous of joining with other organized branches of trade with which our members are identified either in the ship or housebuilding industries, with a view to advancing the material conditions of the worker; also as directed in the following rules, to form a contingent fund, which shall be used for the purpose of granting assistance in cases of distress not otherwise provided for by these rules; to aid our own or any other organized trade to take legal proceedings under the Employers' Liability Act and Workmen's Compensation Act on behalf of members who may have been injured or met their death by accident in the British Isles and in countries where Acts of this description are in operation. The assistance to recover wages is very necessary. Sometimes employers refuse to pay their men. A lot of people talk about the advantage of capital to labour, but the carpenter does his work before he gets his wages, and sometimes he does not get his wages. I believe that if a Select Committee inquired into the justification for leave to introduce a Bill of this character, they would decide that leave sliould not be given. Should a Committee go through the rules of the hundred and one organizations of employees in Australasia they would see that associations formed for such highly moral purposes are entitled to preference to unionists. I doubt if they would find anything h i the objects of the Bar Council of the nature of the humanitarian proposals to be found at the head of the rules of indust r i a l organizations. If any one should get preference, it should not be legal members of the Bar Council, nor medical men, nor architects. It should be those men who have to use the plane and the saw, A and the pick and the shovel. I venture to think t h at a Select Committee would tell the Attorney-General and the Prime Miuister that leave should not be given to introduce a Bill of this character.",62
451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Would you serve on the Committee ?,62
452,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am not too keen on Select Committees or Royal Commissions. I have had experience of both, and they are very trying and arduous, and take a good deal out. of one. If some young honourable member would be will i ng to act on the Committee, I would be willing to give way to him ; but, of course, if no one else would act, I would be will i ng to take part, if requested by the House to do so.

453,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"Dalley) [10.32] - It is with some degree of regret that I rise to my feet to-night. I have spoken in connection with the motion for leave to introduce this question, and I regret that I find it necessary to address myself to the amendment, hut I cannot allow the opportunity to pass 'without some attempt to place before the House my opinions upon it. I speak with all due respect when I say that the motion itself implies that there is a desire, not so much to settle industrial troubles as to utilize a position which the Attorney-General has created in order to attain some end the Government have in view. That end is what? To, if possible, plunge this country into industrial unrest, and to make out of the industrial situation a condition of affairs which will enable them, if they possibly can, to limit the power which the Labour party has in this House, where the Government find themselves in a hopeless position, and also in another place, where we are perfectly satisfied, and have the Government under the whip. The Attorney-General has attempted to make much profit out of the situation. He has stepped out of the ordinary run of things, and, in his public utterances, has outlined a course of action which he thinks will aid his party. Mr JosTsru COOK - What are those new leaders in the corner concocting ?",63
454,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"We will concoct anynot thing we please, so long as we whip you.",63

462,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member address himself to the amendment ?,63
463,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"I will do so if Ministerial members will permit me. In our amendment we seek, if possible, to have this serious industrial question investigated by some Select Committee. I am much concerned about a Select Committee. If I could take the course of action I desire, I would fight the question out straight and clean, and there would be no Select Committee. But, nevertheless, if the Administration are prepared to meet us on any reasonable - basis, and we can refer this question to a Select Comto mittee, I , being desirous of peace, am that such a Committee should be proappointed to give the question such consideration as will enable the House to come to a determination on effective lines for a peaceful settlement rather than that strife which is implied by the course of action which the Government now seek to The honourable member for Cook referred this eventing to trade unionism and to the benefit it had been to the indust r i a l world, in England and elsewhere. Tie sought to make the point that peace - should arise by settlement, in contradistinction from the attitude taken by the - Attorney-General. I propose to quote from Thorold Rogers' Six Centuries of Work 4ind Wages, and I am sure the Prime M in ister and the Attorney-General will admit the value of the quotation I am about to make. They will not dispute the reputation of the author as an economist, while as a writer of the history of industrialism he is undoubtedly beyond question. I propose to quote from page 429, in which he - deals with wages and prices, my desire being to place in opposition to the statements of the Attorney-General the opinions expressed by a writer not less lacking in ability than is the honourable gentleman himself. Thorold wroteAs, therefore, wages do not rise with prices, JIO crime against labour is any expedients adopted on the part of Government which tend to raise prices.

465,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable membedding ber seems to misapprehend the nature the amendment. I would point out to him that it deals, not with the question of whether preference to unionists would be beneficial to the community as a whole, but with the principle of preference to unionists in relation to Government employment, the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the subject, and the question whether it appears desirable to prepare and introduce a Bill relating to preference to unionists in Government employment.",64

We have been seeking to consolidate the interests of Labour, and the Attorney General and those associated with him have put forward a proposition which we hold will not permit that consolidation. Therefore, we have moved an amendment providing for the appointment of a Select Committee to calmly and carefully review the situation. Surely no honourable member will take' exception to that. If we can by peaceful means bring about a general consolidation of public effort and social life, so that strife and warfare shall cease, we shall be acting in the public interest.

It matters not to me whether 200 or 300 or 2,000 or 3,000 persons likely to be affected; we must consider the likelihood of victimization. I feel sure, from my personal knowledge, there has been victimization in State and Commonwealth services. It exists, and will continue. Why, then, do not the Government permit a careful investigaword tion by a Committee, with the object safeguarding our public servants? We must protect them against even the possisocial bilit y of victimization. We must sider whether the conditions of their emdustrial ployment are such as will prevent victim ization. Is it wrong to ask for a Select Committee to inquire into these matters ? Under the Public Service Act certain in dividuals are guaranteed certain wages, and work under certain conditions. In addition, there are temporary employees who are engaged for six, nine, or eighteen months, subject to conditions imposed by Department officials. Men may be ready to accept casual work for the meanest possible wage. We hear the phrase ""freedom of contract."" Under the that system men may, out of their in experience, despair, and necessity, be forced to accept the lowest possible wage. Sweating is not unknown in the Public Service of the States and of the Commonwealth. In our Postal Department men have been forced to work extraordinary hours for the smallest remuneration that could be given to them - If this has happened in one Department, why s'hould it not happen in all? Do we not, therefore, need a Committee to inquire into the effect of freedom of contract in Government employment?

527,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"The Attorney-General would deny preference to individuals who are not permanent members of the Ser[Quorum vice; and he has been making much out of that attitude. The Commonwealth Act provides that preference m a y ' be nongranted; and, that being so, why should the Government deny it to trade unionists are who are prepared to do their work effectively? Of course, the Attorney-General would, abolish the Arbitratio n Courts and that give no preference whatever. He would favour the old laissez faire, which simply it means, "" Do the best you can, and to hell with the hindmost."" I do not use that offensively, but merely as an emof phatic expression of the view which I think the Attorney-General takes of our and industrial situation. Is there conany hope of a peaceful settlement of in strife in such an attitude as that? There is not; and if they desire anything in the nature of a solution of the problem, the Government and their supporters - will meet us by accepting this amendment. Of course, if the Government desire strife they can have it, for we on this side are not afraid to go to the country on such an issue. If , however, it be possible to meet and proceed together on some lines of peaceful reform, such as that suggested in the appointment of a Select Comniitteej we on this side shall be only too glad. Wliy should honourable members opposite object to the amendment? The Attorney-General has twice or three times to-night declined to accept it, with that determination so characteristic of hima determination which I admire, for it speaks of a strong man. But there is just a possibility that the honourable gentleman may reconsider the position, and tomorrow see the opportunity of getting into "" holds "" with us, not in a spirit of enmity, but in a spirit of association, with the object of finding an immediate settlement of a difficult and delicate situation. It is perfectly certain that a satisfactory settlement cannot be arrived at by fighting, to which at present we appear prepared to resort. As I say, we on this side are prepared to,hold out the olive branch, and it is for honourable members opposite to pick it up. ""We have been told that the Opposition are seeking to prevent legislation; but that charge is groundless. What we are seeking to prevent is what we regard, from our standpoint as a Labour party, as bad legislation; and, therefore, we suggest, as an amicable solution, the appointment of a Select Committee. We are face to face with a position that may plunge us into serious trouble. There is no doubt that if this Bill be passed in the form suggested, there will be found throughout Australia an organized force prepared to oppose it at all costs and hazards. If we can avoid that, and preserve peace, by all means let us do so; let us resort to intellectual methods, and not to strikes and disruptions, which mean so much harm to the country as a whole. Although the Attorney-General may be prepared to do so, I do not think that those sitting behind him are ready to face the issues that will arise when we on this side take up the cudgels, as we undoubtedly shall if this Bill be forced through the House. I do [36]- 2 not know what may happen in the Senate, but the Government may be able to force us to the country; and I urge that this extreme step should not be taken, unle'ss, it cannot be avoided. Let us have a Select Committee to ascertain how many public servants are concerned. Can the Attorney-General tell me how many are concerned ?",67
528,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,It is too late to answer questions.,68
529,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Dalley is not in order in asking a question in debate, nor would the Attorney-General be in order in answering it. Mr - HOWE - I bow to your decision, sir, but it is a question which, I think, might well have been answered without intervention from the Chair. The silence of the Attorney-General convinces me that the Government are not in possession of the facts, and cannot tell us whether 300 or 3,000 men are involved. What is there in the amendment that the Government and their supporters should be afraid of? Do they fear that the facts are against them, and that on investigation the Bill will be found to be valueless? Are they, after all, utilizing this little measure for ulterior motives-to gain some little end in their own particular interests. All the facts ought to be placed before the House, and a Select Committee presents the best means. What harm could a Committee do ? Hon orable members opposite are afraid to T answer. They are not concerned with the question of preference or non-preference, but they are concerned with a little cry that they propose to pour into the ears of their own people, in the hope that it will be carried from one to the other, and result in the defeat of the Labour party. If the Government and their supporters are not prepared to accept the amendment, we are prepared to meet them on any basis or any platform they like.",68

Last session the Prime Minister was warned, as he has been warned this session, that we as a party must lose no effort in trying to defeat the object of' Government. If there is any doubt in the minds of honourable members as to the real intention of Ministers in regard to the measure, when, through circumstances, fortunate so far as the Government were concerned, though unfortunate for us, the Bill was pushed through this House and taken to the Senate, the subsequent conduct of honourable members opposite during the recess, particularly the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, and their public statements, must have completely disabused the minds of any intelligent member of the community.",68
531,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,May I direct attenr tion to the state of the House? [Quorum formed.],69
532,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,-The matter of the prohibition of preference to unionists in Government employ is a clear indication of the. mind of the Government in regard to preference to unionists generally. Honourable members and the public have no doubt upon it. But may I offer this suggestion to the Prime Minister?,69
533,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,"I desire to draw attention to the state of the House. [Quorum formed.] ' Mr FINLAYSON - A very serious crisis had arisen in the Imperial Parliament, and that crisis was sought to be removed by just the means we have suggested to-night. In the House of Commons they did not refer the matter of the alteration of the Home Rule Bill to a Committee, but they held what are popularly known as "" conversations"" among the leaders of both sides, by which it was proposed to arrive at an agreement. So the Prime Minister will see that by the amendment submitted to-night we are striving to do exactly what was sought to be done in the Imperial Parliament. We are not actuated by obstructive tactics. We simply desire to find an honourable way out of what must be admitted is a difficulty. Honourable members opposite must be aware that the Opposition, by every means in their power, even to the last drop of blood-i l one may use the phrase-mus t oppose the proposal of the Government. But we.are willing to meet Ministers privately, and discuss the matter, and come to some understanding with them, because we are as anxious as honourable members opposite are to get on with the business of the country. Honorthe able members are aware that the discussion of this measure .will offer an extended source of obstruction to the passage of useful legislation. We cannot allow the Bill to pass if we can find the means to prevent it. Our very existence as a party depends on certain well-known and clearly-defined principles, and, as preference to unionists is one of those principles, we are prepared to stand by it at all hazards, and to use every constitutional means in our power in order to oppose any attempt to deprive unionists of the right to organize and secure that preference which the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated is their just and lawful due. If the Government are anxious to go on with useful legislation here is a way out of the difficulty. There are important social items that sadly need attention. There are urgent matters of legislation that we are willing tp support. There are quite a number of ""measures urgently needed. Therefore, why should we deliberately and wilfully have the pathway of the progress ""of legislation obstructed by the Government bringing in a Bill which will create obs'truction in the House, and excitement in public affairs, of which no honourable member can see the end? The principle of preference to unionists has been forced upon us. I have the authority of the Prime Minister for saying that the position of the workers today is due largely-if not entirely-to the unions, and their loyalty to each other, and their demand for the recognition of their rights. He has said It is generally recognised today, I think, by all intelligent men that nearly all that has come to labour by way of advancement has been per medium of these organizations. One can readily understand the feeling of the unionist when engaged in a dispute in defence of the privileges he already en]oys, and which he has hardly won by many years of arduous toil, when a man is brought into the arena to try and wrest those privileges from him. The free labourers step into reap where they have not sown. It is that feeling which gives rise to hostility on the part of the unionist. I have no desire ,to be referring continually to the statements of the Prime Minis-, ter in regard to this matter. They are so thoroughly well known, having been so repeatedly quoted in the House, that honourable members are quite well aware that the very things for which we ask, the very principles for which we stand, are those which have always been advocated by the Prime Minister, and from which, by word, he has never withdrawn, though-whic h is very important-by deed he has done so. The unfortunate position in which we find ourselves is just a repetition of ancient history. Unionism was forced upon the workers. When we remember the condition of our own kith and kin in the Old Country years ago; when we think of their absolute degradation-almos t slavery, if not worse in some cases-w e wonder that the Empire of which we are all so proud in certain directions should have reached even the power and glory that it has attained. T wish to give honourable members a glimpse into the history of industrial affairs in Great Britain. It marks the starting point of that movement which we now call the trade union movement, the demand for preference for members of unions based on the inalienable right of every member to stand by his fellow members, and the securing for each and every member of a union the proper return to which his labour entitles him. I quote from a very fine book recently published, and entitled The Church and the New Age, written by the Eev. Henry Carter. This book, on page 63, deals with mill-owners of England and their need for labour, and says The mill-owners systematically communicated witli the overseers of the poor, who arranged a day for the inspection . of pauper children. Those chosen by the manufacturer were then conveyed by waggons or canal boats to their destination, and from that moment were doomed to slavery. Sometimes regular traffickers would take the place of the manufacturer, and transfer a number of children to a factory district, and there keep them, generally in dark cellar, t ill they could hand them over to a mill-owner in want of hands, who would come and examine their height, strength, and bodily capacities, exactly as did the slave dealers in the American markets. After that the children were simply at the mercy of their owners, nominally as apprentices, but in reality as mereslaves, who got no wages, and whom it was not worthwhile even to feed or clothe properly, because they were so cheap and their places could be so easily supplied . . . . Children were - often worked sixteen hours a day, by day and by night. Even Sunday was used as a convenient time to clean the machinery. . . . They were fed upon the coarsest and cheapest food, often with the same as that served out to the pigs of their master. They slept by turns and in relays in filthy beds, whic(i were never cool,; , for one set of children were sent to sleep in them ns soon os the others had gone off to their daily or nightly toil. There was often no discrimination of the sexes; and disease, misery, and vice grew as in a hot-bed of contagion. . . . The catalogue of cruelty and misery is too long to recite here; it may be read in the Memoirs of Robert Blincoe, himself an apprentice, or in the pages of the Blue Boohs of the beginning of the century, in which even the methodical dry official language is startled into life by the misery it has to relate . . . During the whole of the period of 1800 to 1820, and even to 1840, the result of their sufferings was seen in the early death of the majority of the children, and in the crippled and distorted forms of the majority of those who survived. On the women and grown-up girls the effects of long hours and wearisome work were equally disastrous. Even adult men were treated as mere chattels. Under what was known as the Boundsman system, "" the Parish sold pauper labour to the occupiers of property at a certain low price, and made up the difference between that and the scale allowance. Sometimes the paupers were sold to the farmers at auction. At Yardley, Hastings, e.g., all the unemployed men were put up to sale weekly, and the clergyman on one occasionsaw a lot of ten men knocked down to one of the farmers for 5s. That is an extract from the report of the Royal Commission on Poor Laws in 1834. Well might Southey say, in a letter written in March, 1833, that "" the slave trade is mercy compared to it."" That is a picture of a condition of things from which, I am sure, honourable members on the Government side recoil with horror equally as much as we do. They are quite willing to dissociate themselves from anything of that character, and I would not for a moment say that any member on the Government side believes in conditions of labour such as are there pictured. But it was those conditions that brought about the movement in Great Britain, and has startled the movement into life in Aussome tralia, that has developed trade unionism, that great principle of comradeship, that exhibition of fraternity which is surely as great and grand as the world has yet seen. I cannot forget that from early ages, before the dawn of the Christian era, the workers of the world were banded together in indissoluble unions so strong, so effective, and so secure in their foundations, that no Avorkmen in any craft, and no man who had to associate Will his friends, or AVIIO Avas performing labour in the same calling as other men, Avas outside a union.",69
534,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I beg to call attention to the state;-of the House. [Quorum formed.],70
535,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"On a point of order. The honourable member for Gippsland, when you, sir, ordered that the bells should be rang, expressed pleasure that he was relieved for the present of what he was pleased to call ""this clatter."" I object to that word, and desire that it be withdrawn.",71
536,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have no knowledge of what the remark applied to, but the honourable member for Brisbane did not take exception to it. I do not know whether the remark applied to the honourable member who was speaking or to the ringing of the bells, but the word itself is not disorderly, unless it had an offensive application to an honourable member.",71
537,Mr FIJSTLAYSOST,Unknown,"I was trying to show that the workers were forced, by the unfortunate condition in which they were placed in the earlier days of the industrial movement, to band themselves into unions, and it is well known to every honourable member that unionism, even at that stage, partook of a very strong political character. In the objections of honourable members on the Government side, and their supporters generally, have expressed, stress is laid - upon the fact that the unionism of today is political, and therefore preference should not be granted to it. I desire to point out that the workers themselves were forced into political action. It was because the laws of the country were so shockingly opposed to the trade unions, and to their having any privileges or recognition, that the workers were at one time forced to abandon their unions, and later on to seek to obtain redress by parliamentary action. Honourable members will remember well how, on the introduction of machinery, and the consequent displacement of very large numbers of Avorkmen, very regrettable riots took place, notably the "" L u d d it e "" riots in 1811 and 1816,'when the Avorkers reA'olted against the introduction of machinery, and thought that by smashing the machinery they Would improve their employment. They learned better as years Avent on, and on page 65 Carter saysThroughout these years there were constant appeals to Parliament by the operatives to sustain their rates of wages, enforce the legal restrictions of the number of apprentices, or prohibit certain kinds of machinery. The appeals were founded on long established custom, tor from the sixteenth century Parliament had regulated wages and conditions of employment, or empowered Quarter Sessions to do so locally. But, in face of the Industrial Revolution, Parliament stood perplexed. The problem was unprecedented. The wage-earners' standard of life was confessedly degraded. Mediaeval trade laws, framed for the hand-working age, clearly needed revision in an age of machine labour. Parliament/ instead of helping the workers by its acts, hindered them, an'd shattered their hopes. Carter finishes a very interesting chapter by sayingI t was in these circumstances that the toilers - lef t to work out their own salvation-dre w together, developed organizations of defence, and the modern trade union movement was born. Rioting was f u t i l e; Parliament would not help; the workers must help themselves. For many years the workers had to depend on their OAvn organizations, but in those years those infamous combination laws were introduced, and the workers Avho had been denied proper wages and conditions Avere also denied the right to form unions and to secure those benefits which they ought to have obtained by combination and associative effort. On the other hand, the employers Avere well assisted in every possible direction by those very same laws. I could quote one or two rather striking illustrations of that fact. Laws in favour of the unions were quite unknown, but laws in favour of the employers were very strong indeed, and the consequence Avas that men were often compelled to abandon their unions, simply because they were unable to stand up against the law. I may later on quote a passage which gives several instances of men who, for infinitesimal offences against the law, aud simply because they were unionists and demanded rights in virtue of their unionism, Avere cruelly treated by the laws of their country. To show how the unions were treated at that time, and hoAv closely related the proposals of the Government, in Australia today are to those now effete and discredited laws, let me read the following passage to honourable members. On page 74 Carter says- ' The following is the actual wording of the ""Document "" which ironmoulders were asked? to sign during the period following the great engineers' strike, to which reference is made on a later page :Declaration made by the undersigned on engaging in the employment of . I , A.B., do hereby honestly, and in its simplest sense and plainest meaning, declare that I am neither now, nor will, while in your employment, become a member or contribute to, or otherwise belong to or support, any trade union or society which directly or indirectly, by its rules or any of its meetings or transactions of its business, or by any means of its omcers or funds, takes cognisance of, professes to control, or interferes with the arrangements - or regulations of this or any other manufacturing or trade establishment, the hours or terms of labour, the contracts or agreements of employer or employed, or the - qualifications or period of service. I do also declare that I have no purpose or intention to call in question the right of any man to follow any honest calling in which lie may desire to engage, or to make what - arrangement and engagement of the workmen he pleases upon whatever terms they choose mutually to agree. To show how closely that is allied, not only to the proposals of the Government, but to the continual actions of their supporters outside the House, may I remind honourable members of several cases in point ?",71
538,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I would remind the honourable member that he has already spoken on the main question, and he will be in order only by confining himself to the amendment, which deals with a proposal to appoint a Select Committee to inquire into the question of preference to unionists in Government employment.

The proposed Gommittee is to inquire into whether it is right and proper to introduce a Bill to prohibit preference to unionists in Government employment. I am trying to prove that i u order to legislate effectively - on the questiou of preference to unionists, not only in Government employment, but in any employment whatever",72
541,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member will not be in order in going outside the question of preference to unionists in Government employment.,72
542,Mr FIKLAYSON,Unknown,"The r e are two points to be considered in that connection. In the first place, the Government proposal has been accepted as a challenge on the whole principle of preference to unionists generally. It has been said by the Government that it is a challenge. In the second place, the Commonwealth has already in its employment a very large number of workmen, following various callings, and many of these belong to unions which demand certain rates of pay, irrespective of what may be the opinion of the Government of the day, since they are working under the awards of Wages Boards or of Arbitration Courts. Signed Mr SPEAKER - The question of * Dated what may or may not have been generally Witnessed admitted by the Government does not affect the terins of the motion; but the honourable member will be in order in discussing the question on the lines of the second point raised by him.",72
543,Mr EINXAYSON,Unknown,"If the Government are going to prohibit preference to unionists, what will be the position when the Commonwealth employs a still larger niunber of these men? If , for instance, an award of the Arbitration Court provides for certain rates of wages to builders' labourers, then, in employing such men, the Government must observe that award, since the Conciliation and Arbitration Court has been granted by this Parliament power to provide for preference to unionists. If this motion were passed, or if the amendment were rejected, it w ould mean that the men, in T such circumstances, would either have to face immediate dismissal, or leave their unions. The second alternative is what the Government would probably invite, and it is that very danger that causes us to oppose the Bill . My opposition is due, not to any desire to delay business, but to the fact that we are here up against the principle, the policy, and the platform of our party. We must fight this Bill by every possible means. The Government need be under no misapprehension. We are standing in the direct line of succession to men who, in the Old Country in days gone by, had to fight, and many of whom had to suffer, and even die, for the very principles for which we are fighting today. I propose to make a quotation from the judgment delivered by Mr Justice Higgins in the tramway case, in which he had to decide whether preference to unionists should be granted. The Brisbane and Adelaide companies were opposed, not only to preference to unionists, but to the principle of unionism, or, at all events, to all but a certain kind of unionism. Mr Justice Higgins said I find that the forbidding of the badge is, in the case of Melbourne and of Brisbane, merely part of the polioy of the companies to suppress 'unionism, and especially unionism. In the case of Adelaide, the position is somewhat complicated by the passion of the general manager for military and appearance. It is the old , keep away unionism as long as you can; and then, when it must come, create a dependent union, and attract the men to it by favours. Mr Badger and Mr Wilcox frankly that they have tried to prevent among their men; and I have no difficulty in finding that tliey have granted privileges, benefits, attractions of all sorts, to men to retire from the union, and that they have encouraged and bolstered up rival unions - what, thu men call the ""company's - in order to injure the men's union. "" Company's union "" is a name which, as one of the ""company's union"" members told me in evidence, is given by the men because they reckon the company ""gives us good things which the men's union does not get."" There is no doubt a bitter feeling between the two bodies. Melbourne, the company's union has about 70 members; the men's union, in spite of the company's antagonism, has over 1,500 in the Melbourne Tramway Company alone. gross revenue of the company's union subscriptions of the members is about £42 per annum, and all the rest of the comes from outside donations. be no rivalry of unions, and little or no friction, if the men were left to themselves. company's union could not last but for the company's coddling. This creating and fostering of a rival union, tins encouragement of its members and discouragement bers of the other union, is the root of such bitterness as there is; and the companies could easily get rid of the bitterness by ceasing to bestow exceptional favours on the company's union. The badge is not to blame. The word ""intimidation"" is much more applicable to what the companies have done than to the wearing of the badge. In 1004 Mr Badgeras he admits-dismissed several men for attempting to form a union; but he reinstated them on the condition that they would drop the idea. The tramway men in Brisbane en-' joyed the use of a recreation hall, which they much prized; but when Mr Badger formed his company's union, he handed the hall over to it, and forbade the others to enter. From the point of view of the companies, the endeavours to stifle unionism may seem justifiable; from the' point of view of this Court the endeavours cannot be treated as legitimate or reasonable. For the very Act which creates this Court expressly sanctions and encourages unions. Under section 2 (VI.) oue of the "" chief objects"" .of the Act is to "" facilitate Mr Finlayson. and encourage the organization of representative bodies of employers and of employees and the submission of industrial disputes to the Court by organizations."" The system of arbitration would be unworkable without organized unions; and it is my duty to carry out the Act and to give effect to the will of Parliament. I would emphasize the point that the provision in the Conciliation and A r b it r a federated tion Act for preference to unionists was deliberately inserted, as Mr Justice H i g formation gins said, as a guarantee of industrial device-first peace. In support of that contention, I would read the following quotation from a speech made by the honourable member admit for ""Wentworth, t i e Assistant Minister of unionism Home Affairs, as reported at page 729 of Hansard of 21st September, 1913. indulgences, The honourable gentleman said in this HousePreference to industrial unionists is prounion"" vided for in our legislation to encourage the formation of unions for the purpose of bringing about industrial peace. It is recognised in the Statute that the existence of men outside such organizations makes the securing of industrial peace by a Court more difficult. The law provides, other things being equal., In that preference shall be given to the membera of industrial organizations registered under the Act. The That, in itself, establishes our claim that from this question should be referred to a expenditure Select Committee, seeing that we are unThere would able, apparently, to settle it in Parliament. It is evident that this debate is The to go on indefinitely. It seems that there is to be at r i a l of brute strength; that we are to have a muscular tug-of-war of the mem- and legislation by exhaustion. If the debate is to go on as at present, it seems that we are to be here night and day, and that not u n t i l one side is beaten or exhausted will the matter be settled. The prospect is not at all attractive to any man who loves his country or desires to see any progress in our legislation. That Parliament should be brought w i l full y by the Government to such an impassethat we should be brought up against, » stone wall and forced to face an impossible situation-is neither creditable to the Government nor satisfactory to the but people. If the Government are able by this process of exhaustion to force the Bill through this House, there still remains to he considered the prospect of it s passing in the Senate. That prospect is gloomy in the extreme. Every honourable member knows that the Bill is doomed before it reaches the door of the Senate. ""Why go on with ness in that fashion? Is there no way out? We say that there is. Honourable members on both sides declare that legislation in connection with this question is necessary, though we do not agree as to the kind of legislation that is necessary. Therefore, the leaders on both sides have every inducement to try to arrive at an honourable arrangement. Is it too much that we are asking that the subject of preference to unionists in Government employment shall be submitted to a conference of leaders? There may be reasons which appear satisfactory to Government supporters for not giving preference to employees in the Government service; but not only is preference to unionists accepted in every country in. the world, but in some countries unionism is enforced by law. That is bome out by this extractThe following clause with regard to preference to unionists has been placed in the .schedule of the recently given award in the Nelson Tailor and Tailoresses case in the New Zealand Arbitration Court, before Judge Sim :-It shall be the duty of every employer, when engaging a worker, to ascertain whether he or she is a member of the union; and if - he or she is not a member of the union, the employer shall notify the secretary of the union accordingly within seven days of the date of engaging such worker. It shall be the duty of every non-unionist engaged as aforesaid to join the union within seven days after receiving from the secretary of the union a request in writing to do so. It shall be the duty of every non-unionist employed in the trade at the date of the coming into operation of this - award to become a member of the union within fourteen days of such date. Non-compliance with any of the above-mentioned provisions shall constitute a breach of award. No employer shall place any obstacle in the way of any representative of the workers' union in the collection of moneys due; provided that the collection shall not take place in any work-room oftener than onoe a fortnight, and that a representative of the union sball obtain permission from the employer previously to visiting such work-room. The tendency in industrial matters is towards an ever closer organization, the advance of unionism in Australia is paralleled by its advance in other parts of the world. There is also taking place a process of linking up, of consolidation, and of concentration that will make the trade union movement throughout the world practicably irresistible. The one special thing at stake is preference to unionists. We demand that preference to unionists shall be recognised in not only one, but every direction. That demand is not busi- based on any question of unfairness or prejudice, but on the recognition of the solid and incontrovertible fact that men and women have joined trade unions to better their conditions, to improve their opportunities, and to secure higher wages. It. is not more than ordinary justice that those whose efforts have gained the advantages which have come from organization should be permitted to enjoy them. The labourer is worthy of his hire, and one cannot speak on these matters without being reminded of the statement of the Prime Minister that the non-unionists are skulkers, and act unfairly towards their fellows. The proposal of the Government is to declare by Statute that preference to unionists shall not be allowed in Government employment. There would be less objection to such a declaration by Executive minute. A f t e r this Government took office, no one was alarmed when they abolished, by administrative act, preference to unionists in Government employment. That was expected, and it may be safely predicted that if the Labour party again get3 control of Commonwealth affairs preference to unionists will be recognised again. We shall recognise all the time, and every time, the unions that are recognised officially, and registered under the laws that we have passed. The proposed Bill aims a blow at a statutory provision, but does so indirectly and unfairly. If the Government earnestly desire to abolish preference to unionists in Government employment aud elsewhere, we are ready to debate the question with them in connection with an amendment of the. Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Governments of nearly every country in the world have repeatedly tried to discourage and to destroy the work of the trade unions. A Commission was appointed in Great Brita into inquire into the subject generally, and the Rev. Henry Carter, at page 85 of his book on The Church in the and New Age. states thatWhen the reports of the Commissions were issued they were seen to be more favourable to unionism than had been anticipated. A majority report went some way toward improving the legal position. The minority report, for which Harrison and Hughes were responsible, went farther, and recommended that "" All laws affecting contracts for labour should be repealed, and that no act done by a number of men together should be punished. as a crime if it were not criminal in itself."" Legal protection was also accorded to union funds. That was very little protection to the trade unionistsThe Times said "" True statesmanship will neither cease to augment nor to reduce their (tha unions) influence; but, accepting it as a fact, will give it free scope for legal development."" But the Government Bills, which followed in 1871, took away with one hand as much as they gave with the other. The good points of the minority report were conceded, but "" peaceful picketing "" in support of a strike, even by a single person, was definitely declared criminal. A storm of protest arose, but unavailingly, and the Bills quickly became law. Then follow some of the most disgraceful records in the Old Country in connection with this matterSeven women were imprisoned in South Wales merely for saying ""bah "" to a ""blackleg."" In 1872, a number of London gas-stokers were dismissed for complicity in a strike; others who refused to work until their mates were taken on again were prosecuted, and sentenced to twelve montlis' imprisonment. On page 101 reference is made to the decision of the House of Lords in the Taffvale Railway Case in 1901By this decision the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants were held responsible for the unlawful acts of certain of its members during a strike in South Wales, and the Taffvale Railway Company obtained £23,000 damages against the society.",72
544,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am unable to see the connection with the amendment. Mr ErNXAYSON- - This attempt to prohibit preference to unionists in Government employment is a political move, and I am showing that it is in line with what has been done by the Imperial Government - In Great Britain an attempt was made to prohibit unionism in connection with any employment. This Government, by the necessities of the case, is forced to propose the prohibition of preference to unionists only in Government employment. If Ministers are opposed entirely to preference to unionists, there is an honest, legitimate, and reasonable way of putting forward their views. What is now proposed will not do what is desired, but will breed no end of difficulties and trouble in the Government service. A large number now are, and in the future a much larger number will be, members of unions, and may be working under awards of the Courts which the Government will have to recognise. If these awards impose preference to unionists, in what position will the Government be? This attempt to prohibit preference to unionists will excitethe worse passions of the community, and will breed more indust r i a l strife than we have known im any period of our industrial history. When addressing the House previously on the original motion, I made referenceto this point; and I am so impressed with the dangers of industrial disputes and in dustrial strife that I am supporting this, amendment in the belief that it offers a. reasonable, legitimate, and proper w a y out of the difficulty. We do not desirestrife-w e do not desire industrial war. The history of the whole trades union movement is 'characterized by one factmore than any other, and that is, that those concerned have always sought, by every possible means, to establish harmonious relations with the employers. That they have not been able to do so ist not their fault, and that they have had to fight is possibly their misfortune ir* soine directions; but all this has certainly educated the workers of the world in the knowledge that, while they mayrely to a large extent on their own. powers of organization to secure certain benefits that they legitimately desire, and are honourably entitled to, there is a power in their hands that. they must use, and that they are in creasingly using in every country in the world, namely, the power of Parliament to protect them in the enjoyment of the i r rights. The Bill seeks to defeat that very purpose, and the amendment is an effort to avoid strife and disorder-that in dustrial upheaval which this proposal of the Government, if persevered in , is sureto bring about. The words used in the amendment are "" in order to effectively legislate "" ; and it is impossible to so legislate if the Government are going to be adamant in their opposition. If the Government have only one idea, and are not open to argument-if their minda are thoroughly made up to fight this question by every means at their disposal, and if they are prepared to set in motion the whole electoral machinery, and put the country toa cost of anything from £60,000 to £80,000, in order to establish this principle-the y must accept the responsibility for all that may follow. Certain it is that not only in this House, but in every town and place, the workers, and! the people generally, will be divided by a very Sharp line of cleavage and demarcation. There is no doubt that by this proposal the people of the country will be split into two antagonistic sections. Here we are, trying by means of conciliation and arbitration to bring about a better and a saner understanding between employer and employed, and yet the Government's proposal is to antagonize them and to create enmity; industrial peace is on their lips, but war is in their hearts. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, perhaps better than any other honourable member on his side, knows that if the principle of preference in Government employ, and trades unionism, were recognised, he would be saved any amoiuit of trouble, because then he could deal directly with bodies instead of being tated by irresponsible individuals. The honourable member is thoroughly aware that it is much easier to deal with an organization than with separate persons. We desire even more than the Government do to deal with this question of preference to unionists, because it is one in regard to which we are in deadly earnest, as meaning our very bread and butter. Indeed, it is a matter of death and life; politically it is our breath, and industrially it is our living. We demand that in this connection there shall be no unnecessary cleavage in the community. There is so much possibility of improvement, socially and industrially, that one regrets that such questions as these should be unnecessarily obtruded; and I hope that even yet the Government will see that the amendment is not in any way unfair or unreasonable, but an honest desire to promote peace in the community.",75
545,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Gwydir) [12.35 a.m.] - I should have been gratified if the Attorney-General had softened somewhat to the appeal made to him from this side, and had accepted the amendment as a way out of the ridiculous position in which he has placed, not only the House, but the country, in submitting the Bill. There is no doubt that this measure requires the fullest investigation; and the policy of the Government throughout its short reign has been to delegate-to Boards, Royal Commissions, or Select Committees anything and everything they did not understand. I may say that if the Government continue to remit to such bodies all questions they do not understand, we shall soon have nothing but roving Commissions all over the country. We were told that, in order to understand what the Tariff is, and what amendments are necessary, it was necessary to send it to the Inter-State Commission.",76
546,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member, but I see nothing in the amendment relating to the Tariff.",76
547,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I am only using this as an illustration, and pointing out that in the case of the Tariff, the Government deemed it necessary to have it fully investigated by the Inter-State Commission, in order that they might at some time arrive at a solution, though irri- they have not said when. I suppose that, so long as a solution is arrived at some time, the Government will be satisfied to wait.' Then, again, there is the Electoral Commission, although this body found nothing to inquire into. Everything was proved to be all right; but it was necessary to have an inquiry in order to remove the stigma placed on the Government by the charges they had heaped on the heads of members on this side. Another matter that puzzled the Government, though it did not puzzle many other people, was that involved in the question of whether powellised sleepers could be demolished by the white ants.",76
548,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I must call the attention of the honourable member to the fact that he is not dealing with the amendment.,76
549,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I wish to show why the Government should accept the amendment. Inasmuch as this course has been adopted in all the cases I have mentioned, and in other cases in which they failed to find guidance in their own intelligence, we ask them to submit this Bill to a Select Committee. The Attorney-General, in his last public statement, said that this Bill would mean giving preference only to men in the Public Service who are not provided for by Statute. I observe, however, that the honourable gentleman's leader does not wholly agree with him, and told the House that when the Government policy was disclosed it would be by the head of the Government, and not, I suppose, by the ""head"" that has controlled the Government so long. However, we wish to know whether the statement made represents a fact or not. How many men in the Service are provided for by the Public Service Act, the Conciliation and Arbitration .Act, and so forth? It is essential that these facts should be known, in order that the public may not be wholly deceived; and the Select Committee would give us those facts on sworn testimony, and Ave should then have tangible grounds on which to proceed. We might also be able to discover how many of-even the casuals in the Government employ were already in unions enjoying preference to unionists. should know how many of them are not under the obligation to respect preference to unionists, not only in regard to casual workers, but also in regard to those who should be encouraged to join unions, and so bring about that contentment and that measure of justice that should exist betAveen employers and employees. I believe that investigation would show that under the present conditions not more than 200 of those engaged by the Government would come under the operation of the Bill. Clearly, therefore, it is a waste of time discussing measures, having before us merely imaginary conclusions, statements not borne out by facts, and figures that cannot be supported. There is no justification for the Bill until, at any rate, a thorough investigation has been held. On all otlier matters the Government have not only agreed to, but have initiated, similar inquiries, with the alleged object of getting information to guide them. It is possible that a Select Committee would inquire as to the effect of preference to unionists on the general welfare of the Commonwealth, as to whether the action the Government propose to take Would improve public affairs, and as to Avhether the Government would run the risk of disorganizing the whole business of the continent. They could also ascertain Avhether the Government are prepared to do what no private employer is prepared to do; that is, to gather around a host of unemployed who are not members of unions, and who are the least capable tradesmen and give the least valuable return for the money paid to them. We are entitled to ascertain what good will emanate from giving leave to introMr Webster. duce the Bill. No doubt investigation by u Select Committee Would divulge astate of affairs that would put au end to the action of the Government. The only reason for the attitude of the Government toAvards the amendment is that they fear the result of the information that Avoulct be secured by a Committee of inquiry.. The Committee would necessarily extend its inquiries in order to investigate the effect of preference to unionists in all occupations, and Would make inquiries of men having the experience of union and non-union labour. If evidence was called from firms employing large numbers of We men, it would be found that in most casesthe doctrine of the Government would not be tolerated for five minutes. The bulk of employers know the value of unionism, to which preference to unionists is thenatural corollary. But the GoA^ernment burke inquiry. They know that an in vestigation would enable the people tounderstand the position without difficulty. I have been an employer and an employee. As an employee I always felt that I Avas. happier working amongst a body of men who had signed the same bond as myself,, and who contributed to the same union. It is thatcomradeship and brotherhood, among Avorkers that makes men feel happy in their AAork, and gives to employersr .a more steady, reliable, and profitable return than can be got by having a mixed! body of Avorkers, or by not recognising"" the right of unionists to enjoy the fruitsto gciin which they have sacrificed somuch in the past.' A Committee would fully expose the Bill as a mere scarecrow, and the Government for all timewould be known as the Scarecrow Ministry. And rightly so because measures-' L of this character that have no foundation, that are merely shadows and myths, in troduced for the purpose of deceiving the people, are exposed at once Avhen thelight of inquiry is throAvn upon them. The GoA ernmeni will, as a result, be comr pelled to withdraw this measure in disgust at the puny effort they have made to carry out the business of the country. them For many years there was no organization Avithin the Public Sendee, and at that time there-Avas nothing but continued discontent. No Postmaster-General, either under the State regime, or under that of the Commonwealth, had any possible chance of doing justice to his 0 Government Preference Department, or of giving faction to himself. It was a case of every man for himself, and each man cutting the other's throat. selfishness and inhumanity were evidentall the time, and Ministers were worn out listening to appeals, not from a body of men, but from individuals^ complaints were the result of the lack of organization in the Federal Service; but since the law has recognised organization, and granted the right of those in the Federal Service to go to the Arbitration Court, the Commonwealth employees have banded themselves into organizations for their common benefit. I guarantee that the files will show a very different state of affairs from the .times gone by, when Postmasters-General and members of Parliament were worried from Monday morning t ill Saturday night, and tortured by individual complaints and troubles that used to come to hand by every mail. That sort of thing went on, and I know that since organization has taken place in the Department the Government, by reason of their law, have encouraged men to join organizations for the purpose of appealing to the Court. And I would remind honourable members that the men cannot appeal to the Court unless they are organized; individual workers cannot appeal to the Court. If the Government were to succeed in introducing non-preference in the Government service, even amongst the casual employees, they would immediately undermine the advantages gained by the unionists in that Service, and, by so undermining them, would gradually substitute non-union labour, and bring discontent into other branches, where at present organization is a safetyvalve.",76
550,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I wonder why the Honorary Minister changed his mind. spoke very eloquently upon this subject on one occasion.,78
551,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The Honorary M in ister Bas proved by every action since he has been a Minister that he knows very little about these things, and the more he tries to do the more he falls in the esteem of his colleagues and of the country. He is not in the happy position of saying, "" Bless the day when I became a Minister,"" but must say ""Curse the day when I took office."" The honourable member had a reputation, up to that time; if it was not emblazoned on his banner, it [13 MAY , 1914.] Prohibition Bill. 941 satis- was, at any rate, in the crucible, and might have turned out something good. We want to ascertain by means of this The Select Committee how many men will be affected by the proposed Bill , how many among the casual employees are enjoying preference today, what unions they beIndividual long to, how many non-unionists are in the Government service today, and what changes the Government have made in the conditions that prevailed when their predecessors controlled the affairs of the country. The only method of discovering those things is by an independent in quiry,' not only into the preference which has existed in the Commonwealth service, but also into the inroads which the Government have made in that preference, and the intentions of the Government in substituting non-preference for preference. The' Committee would also report as to whether the Government proposals would be beneficial to the Public Service of the Commonwealth.",78
552,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"If the report were against you, would you object to it?",78
553,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot honourably object to an inquiry of this nature, seeing that he has already acquiesced in the appointment of Royal Commissions, which are today inquiring into other matters. If it was thought necessary to appoint Commissions to in vestigate the powellising of timber, the Tariff, and electoral matters, it is ten times more necessary that this question of preference to unionists should be submitted to a Committee, so that we may be able to feel certain of the effect which the Government Bill will have on the men working in the Service. We want to know to what extent the Government's proposals are likely to bring about disintegration in the Service, which has worked more harmoniously, successfully, and He satisfactorily lately than at any time since I have been a member of this Parliament. To a large extent there is contentment in the Public Service today, and that was brought about by inquiry. How, otherwise, was it possible for the Government to get at the core of the discontent that existed in the Postal Service in days gone by? A CommissiQn was re-, quired to not only uproot the evil, but to drag forward evidence, analyze it , and come to conclusions, and convince Parliament that the time had, arrived when the haphazard methods of the past should cease. Injustices had sprung up through the ahsence of organized effort, owing to the fact that only portion of the men in the Service had seen the wisdom of organization, whilst the greater number of men thought that by standing out of the organization they would curry favour with those for whom they worked. Accordingly, they did not attempt to come into the organization until the Postal Commission had reported and recommended that justice should be done, that an increase in salary should be given, that liours of labour should be reduced, that conditions should be improved, that overtime should be paid, that travelling expenses should be allowed, and that certain leave, never permitted before, should be granted.",78
554,Mr MCGRATH,Unknown,I beg to call attention to the state of the House. formed.],79
555,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I was saying that, under the old conditions, the Postal Service was nothing but a disorganized body. There was an attempt at organization, but there was no direct gain likely to come from it , because, in days gone by, most of the men appointed to the Postal Department were appointed by reason of political influence, and they had been taught to rely upon the influence and recommendation of individual members of Parliament to get them into the Service, irrespective of qualifications oftentimes, and to secure them promotion, - whether merited or unmerited. happens today that, through lack of a system of unionism, and to recognise the value of unionism, and the advantages that gained by united effort, the Public Service is still encumbered lot of worthless and hopeless men, who never have earned, and never will earn, the money that is being paid to them, under a system that gave them promotion by seniority and social influence rather than by merit. That is the result of freedom of contract, individual effort, and political influence bordering on corrupt i o n ; aye, worse than corruption, because it undermined the value and efliciency of the Service. The day came when the Public Service realized that there was something in being united, and today those meu having discovered that , by united effort, they could up lift each other, whereas by individual effort they often dragged each other down, the tide in favour of organization is rising faster even than does the tide in the Northern Territory. The organization in the Postal Service at the present time comprises nearly the whole of the permanent staff in the clerical, mechanical, and general divisions.",79
556,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Some of them have been before the Arbitration Court.,79
557,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The Postal Commission, which was practically a Wages Board, investigated every phase of their employment-and it was then that the value of organized effort was brought home to the Public Service. Parliament subsequently, decided that the General Division should come under the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Act. The result was that the men began to organize more thoroughly, and proceeded [Quorum to formulate cases to be put before the Court. In some of those cases a decision has not yet been given, but as the outcome of the judgments already delivered public servants are more convinced than ever of the value of united effort. The At torney-General speaks with two voices on this question. In the first place he declares that he is opposed to preference to unionists whether it be administrative or judicial, whilst, in the second place, he says that he believes in unionism. What a contradiction. Does not the honourable gentleman realise that unionism cannot progress without preference?",79

575,Mr HOWE,Unknown,"On the point of order, sir, I desire to explain that I was reclining here when some one placed a pillow under my head, and threw a blanket over me. I do not know who did this; but if any honourable member tries to take a thing from me by force, he will be met by force.",80

It was not in use at the time, and the honourable member for Dalley, appearing to be in an uncomfortable position, the pillow was placed I understand that the property has now been restored, and I hope that we shall not have a repetition of what took place a few moments ago.",80
579,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I fancy that the incident just closed was an attempt on the part of the Government Whip to prevent me from concluding my argument in the time allotted to me. I was proceeding to point out that the Commonwealth Public Service has gained everything by combined effort. Even the clerical division has been organized, and preference is practically given under the Statute law of the country to members of that branch of the Service. The whole policy of the Department is practically that of preference to unionists. The only section of the Service to which that policy does not apply is one which, if we are to believe the Government, does not actually exist today. We ask for an inquiry to ascertain, amongst other things, whether or not it does exist. What have tEe Government done in other matters in regard to'which they needed enlightenment? They have appointed Commissions, at great cost to the Commonwealth, to investigate and report on the questions concerned. I ask them to' refer this Bill to a Committee. It will then be seen that not 2,000 men, and not even 200 men, would be affected by it , because those who today are in casual Government employment belong to unions claiming preference. One cannot but admire the candour of the Attorney-General, although I doubt whether his leader likes it. He stated the other day that the Bill will not apply only to casual employment in the Public Service. We wish to examine him on oath before a Select Committee to disthere cover whether he really knows how many men would be affected by it . If that were done, the public would see the lowness of this proposal. The real desire is to undermine unionism, and to make the unionist think that the advantages that he has won are to go and skulker, to use a term applied years ago by the Prime Minister to the non-unionist, who is mean and contemptible enough to accept the benefits gained by the sacrifice, organization, and united eff o r t of the unionists. . General knows that the Bill is a scarecrow, and - the Government that ' he is tion. driving will be known in the days to come as the "" Scarecrow Government."" When the history of this Parliament written, and our youngsters have to learn who misgoverned the country 1914, let them read in large letters at the top of the page the words, "" R e i g n of the Scarecrow Government."" We know how much money has been spent on the Attorney-General's education. He, with his mighty talent, his forensic skill, subtlety and cunning, which has enabled him to delude his fellow-men, might now be expected to remember the land which all of us must ultimately go, to wish to undo some of his past work. He might be expected to use his great intellect, not for the undermining, but for the strengthening of unionism. Although he says that he is in favour unionism, he introduces a proposal which honourable member for Dalley. cuts the heart out of it . He might well be called the "" Tory-General,"" instead of the' Attorney-General. I am joined a union at the age of sixteen and a half years, when preference to unionists was undreamt of, the preference being all for non-unionists. Strikes were the order of the day. Who caused them ? lowers The non-unionists, who for decades, my knowledge, have created industrial unrest. The Attorney-General recognises that the organized army of Labour is so powerful that he cannot allow this proof posal to be submitted to a Select Comment, mittee. He knows that the verdict of an independent body of men on this protunity. posal would be such as would put an to his political existence.

608,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I was referring to preference in the matter of blankets merely as an illustration. One of the objections raised to the Bill is that it is intended to prevent something that does not exist, and, therefore, it. is suggested that a Select Committee should be appointed to ascertain the real facts. The Attorney-General last night informed his audience that if the Bill were carried, it .would prevent any future Government from giving preference to any section of the community; and that statement has been said to be as far from truth as heaven is from hell. A Select Committee would be able to inquire and report as to whether the Bill did contain one word that aflirmed a principle or established any machinery to carry that principle out. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The honourable member is singularly inaccurate, because if this amendment be carried, the Bill can never come before the House or any Committee.",82
609,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,The Attorney-General now says that the object of the amendment is to prevent the Bill ever coming before the House.,82
610,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"So it does. Your statement was that I had misrepresented the character of the Bill that the Government are asking leave to introduce, but if the amendment is carried the Bill the Government seek to introduce cannot be introduced, and will not go before the Committee.",82
611,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Certainl y the Committee will not inquire into the Government's Bill, but it will inquire into the I general question of preference to unionists, and it may report that the Government Bill deals ineffectively, or too extensively, with the'matter. Time after time in the history of Anglo-Saxon Parpapers, liaments Bills have been referred to Select Committees, sometimes with the idea of enlarging their scope, and somecusations times with the object of modifying them. Por instance, a Bill to repeal the duties journ from place to place. on leather was referred to a Select ComTariff mittee, and the Committee was instructed to report what should be done in the ter. The Committee now asked for may report that a Bill is unnecessary, or may prepare a measure that will deal officers, more effectively with the subject. Government measure is not a machinery Bill ; it is. merely the affirmation principle, and as an act of legislation worth nothing more than a resolution carried by a debating society. It has power of operation; it cannot be carried into effect. If , on the day after it passed, an official should give preference to a unionist there would be no power to punish him. If a Minister were to give preference to any section of the munity, there would be nothing by which he could be impeached, fined, or penalare ized in any way, or even held up to pubbe lic opprobrium. In fact, the measure a mere pretence. There is no machinery in it to carry into effect that with which it professes to deal. Mr W . H .

612,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honexample orable member must confine his remarks to the subject-matter of the amendment.,83

Therefore it is fair that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee.

It could travel comto the various naval works in Sydney Harbor, also to Jervis Bayj where there many men working. Would it not 'a splendid thing if it could ascertain is that a poor man who did not happen to belong to a union had gone to JervisBay, only to find he could not get work because he did not happen to belong to a union?

If the Government desired to secure adequate information they would be only too anxious to have a Select Committee appointed so as to secure all possible evidence in order to justify to the country i the enforcement of this measure. Everybody knows that the late Government were accused of giving spoils to the victors in all shapes and forms. It was said that all good positions in the Government service were given to friends of Labour Ministers, and those friends in turn gave preference to others who had been politically and industrially associated with them. At the Cotter River a large number of men are employed, and if a Select Committee were appointed they might elicit information which would enable the Government to expose to the country the iniquities committed by the Labour party - when they were in power. Then there are, at the woollen mills, men who were appointed by the Labour Government, and to whom preference was given, to the exclusion of non-unionists and free labourers who were not given a chance. The Committee could take evidence there, and what a tremendous illustration that would be of the tyranny of the Labour party! Would that not be a justification for the Attorney-General, in his fine flights of oratory about upholding the equality of all citizens before the law and the liberty of the citizens? Why should the honourable member not avail himself of all the opportunities which the prerogatives of the Chamber give him to secure all the information that is at hand? The honourable member»could carry the country by sheer weight of evidence, instead of having to depend on the mere generalities which he indulges in at present. Crib Point there are naval works where hundreds of men and bosses, appointed by the late Government, are employed. There, again, the Committee could take evidence. In fact, the world is full of possibilities, and if a Committee were appointed it would unquestionably supply us with a wealth of facts. Instead of having the affirmations of one party and the denials of the other, would it not be better to have before a Select Committee witnesses who would give their evidence upon oath and whose words would be recorded in black and white ? At Crib Point there is a clothing factory in connection with which the Labour Government are charged with having appointed officers because of their political and industrial association with the Labour party. Surely amongst all the girls and men employed at the factory there is a wealth of evidence lying to the Government's hands. From the clothing factory the Committee could pass on to the small arms factory, then to the cordite factory, and so on, from point to point, and place to place. Having done their work in Victoria and New South Wales, the Committee could pass on to South Australia, proceed to Port Augusta and ascertain what injustices have been done in connection with the transcontinental line. Afterwards they could travel by boat to Western Australia to examine the post-office site in Perth, pass on to Kalgoorlie and take all the evidence they could possibly secure there, proceed round the coast to Port Darwin, and go down the Katherine River, and on to Alice Springs, and miss not a single chance of taking evidence. The Committee might even examine the native races of the Northern Territory. Upon the evidence thus secured and submitted to the House we could proceed to legislate. If the Committee had not time to complete their labours before the end of the session, the Standing Orders would permit of their continuing their operations by order of the House. The work of a Committee travelling from one part of Australia to another in the manner I have described would be invaluable, because its opportunities would not be restricted to the one matter of preference to unionists. It could not travel from State to State without observing many things that might be of advantage, and the intellectual standard of the House would be enhanced. Members At of the Committee would come back with a wider vision, and we should all be gainers by the increased information which would be at our disposal. Now I come to the composition of the Committee. The Committee should, of course, comprise men of unqualified judgment, men who are able to rise above party bias, men of honour and understanding. It would necessarily follow that there would be some members who would be excluded. I would not make the Committee too large; but, at the same time, I would not exclude any member who wished to sit on it , so that if the Committee were large enough the amount of information that would be gathered in the course of its travels would increase from day to day. dishing, in his Law and Practice of Legislative Assemblies, tells us thatThe appointment of a few members, selected from the whole body, for the performance cf some particular duty, furnishes so obvious and convenient a means of facilitating the transaction of business, in a legislative body, or other deliberative Assembly, that it would be strange not to find the employment of committees a common practice in both branches of .Parliament from the earliest period. Accordingly in the most ancient of the Journals of the Commons, which are now extant, and as early as the year 1.554, there are entries of appointment of committees. It is remarkable that the first Select Committee of which there is any record was appointed as the result of an amendment to a motion for leave to introduce a Bill. That was in 3554. I find that, there was a Bill to avoid counterfeit steel; a Bill against the shooting of gags, that might have been; a Bill again3t the unlawful assembling of masterless and a Bill for avoiding sand out of the sea. In the first case, my Lord Willoughby laid out the Duke of Suffolk, who, with fifty-two others, was charged high treason, and the whole of thorn finally lost their heads. As a reward for his services, my Lord Willoughby the Commons to carry a Bill by which all the property of the Duchess of Suffolk would on her death pass to him. duchess asked to see the Bill. My Lord Willoughby opposed her request, and the Government, between the partisans both sides, found themselves in a quandary. The duchess got one of her supporters to move for leave to introduce a Bill relating to the matter, and my Lord Willoughby in the end had all his trouble for nothing. A Select Committee was appointed, and the weight of evidence secured by it was such that the Government had to retire from their position. That shows the value of Select Committees. ments upon motions for leave to introduce Bills have been allowed for centuries in the British Parliament, and I presume that this House, in adopting the procedure of the House of Commons, recognised that the power to move such amendments might at some time prove of value. It was recognised, no doubt, that there come a time when an effort would be made to burlesque legislation. I have heard some honourable members say that chi-i Bill is a mere burlesque. If a Select mittee were appointed it could determine Mr Anstey. the question. There are Bills which it is absolutely necessary to refer to a Select Committee in order that a matured judgment may he brought to bear upon them. On the 9th May, 1816, Castlereagh moved for leave to introduce a Bill to repeal duties on leather. An amendment was moved for the appointment of a Select Committee to report to the House. The Government, when introducing that measure, should have been in a position to go right on; but there were such big in the terests at stake that the House in its wisdom decided that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee. All the authorities go to show that the amendment in this case should be carried. If it were, other important measures which the Government say they desire to bring on could be dealt with at once. That being whatever so, we are really trying to assist the Government when we say that men, instead of arguing this question until doomsday we should refer it to a Select Committee for investigation and report, so that in the meantime with proposals for dealing with the financial situation, which the Government say must claim our consideration, may, together with other measures, be brought forward. wished We do not know what the decision of the Select Committee would be. It might, propose to enlarge the scope of the Bill ; The on the other hand, it might propose tomodify it . If it found that there was no value in the Bill at all, it would tell on us so. There is not a proposition in the Government programme-if any one happens to know what that programme is - that could not be dealt,with whilst the Select Committee was investigating this. question. Por all these reasons-becaus e of the universality of the practice; because from time to time Parliament hasdeemed it desirable to refer such questions to a Select Committee- I think that the Amend- Government would be wise in accepting our amendment.",83

627,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Not very long ago, when dealing with this subject, 1 think in Melbourne, the Prime M in ister stated that grave dangers were threatening the civilized world by reason of the militant attitude .of unionists generally, and he illustrated his argument.with references to what had taken place in Leeds, Johannesburg, Brisbane, and other places! In each of these places disputes arose as to the rights and privileges of unionists, including their right to preference under certain circumstances. In Leeds there were disturbances such as must be deplored by every person who has the welfare of humanity at heart.",86

An y sensible Committee that might be appointed would, of course, have to inquire into the facts of private employment. If a Committee were appointed to inquire into a certain Government contract, it would be absurd to say that questions should be asked about nothing but Government contracts. No doubt the desire of Ministers is to do justice to the majority of the people of Australia ; but we differ from them on a question of policy, and intend to carry the difference before the country.",86

638,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have candidate, already indicated that.",87
639,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On e of the questions which must go to such a Committee is that submitted by the Prime Minister himself, namely, whether this proposal of the Government is good for the try. My opinion is that the Bill, as mitted to the House, is not in the best terests of the people; and, therefore, ought to go to a Select Committee further investigation. Since 1904 Parliament has affirmed, by large majorities, the principle of preference to cludes the minor? unionists; and this Government, without a mandate from the people, and without f u ll consideration of the matter, propose to abandon a policy that has been recognot nised by a previous Administration. Seenot ing that the Government have done this, and have given reasons for their action, I am entitled, I submit, to show the ness of those reasons, which have been stated by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, and also to contend step? that further investigation will show them - aud , what is more important, will show the electors-that the Government prowhether posal will he injurious rather than ficial to the interests of the country genehas rally. The Attorney-General, who is charge of the Bill, has been good enough to give the public his views on the questhe tion, and he states that he is against ference by either a Court or the Governing ment. It we had a Select Committee, the Attorney-General, providing he would submit himself, could be interrogated to why he believes that preference is not in the interests of the community. At the present time, certain Courts have by law the power to grant preference to toilers, unionists; and three times this ParliaBill, ment has affirmed the principle. further, and assert that the result of the last election did not qualify, or set asido in any degree, this decision.  campaigns on that very question, and was returned to oppose preference to unionists.",87
640,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"No doubt; but there is equally no doubt that the honourable member was also returned to oppose certain other things. I hope it is not to a be assumed that the honourable member here solely because he opposed preference to unionists by the Government. I take it that the honourable member, as a opposed preference to unionists generally. ",87
641,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"That is quite apart from the present proposal of the Government, but it is a matter into which a counSelect Committee might inquire. The subAttorney-General, according to his reinported public statements, agrees with the it honourable member for Hume in his oppofor sition to preference by a Court, the this Executive, or by Parliament.

642,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Certainly ; but that is not the proposal before us now. If it is the policy of the Government, why is it laid before us by Ministers? Is there a good deal of political cowardice in submitting a proposal which some of the Government's own friends say is nothing, weakmeans nothing, and will do nothing?  gentleman object to the policy of step by steps, Mr FISHER - If the steps are good I am in favour of such a policy, the object aimed at be popular or beneotherwise. When the honourable member been a little longer here, he will find in that those who take the seemingly unpopular step are those who do the most for country. At present, however, he is preassociated with a party who are not seekto take what they consider a popular step, but a step by which they hope to gain something; and in every instance where as that course has been followed-soone r or later-and it has never been long delayed - thos e who do so suffer. The progress of the world depends on investigation. The who alone will be affected by this have won their rights despite ParI go liaments, autocrats, emperors, and all the powers that oould be arrayed against them. To-day organized wealth is adoptmind ing the same attitude as tyrants, whethat ther emperors, kings, or' feudal lords, fore us. have ever adopted. This Government holds up what they call the flag of "" liberty and equality,"" but it is the of neither one nor the other. cover of the words, "" neither preference nor discrimination,"" they propose to take to themselves absolute power to discrimition nate in the selection of their employees.",87

658,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If a Select Committee were appointed to inquire into the quesflag tion of preference and discrimination, Under would it be beyond the bounds of the order of leave if thab Committee were to inquire into the effect of non-discriminai n other nations? Honourable members are aware of what is taking place at say the present time in Colorado, America. Cable messages have been received showing that a state of civil war ptevails in the great mines owned by the Rockefellers, who have declared that tliey will not recognise any organization whatever the shape of a trade union-that they prefer to shoot down the people, or to tha is workers out, rather than that the should not be allowed torun their business in their own way. Is the Prime Minister prepared to say that Gothat is the correct position to take up? For it is the position proposed to be by the Government here as a any large employer. Hitherto, Governments have not been employers of labour in the sense that they are now; and, therefore, we can quite understand why preference has not been sought or given. The question arises how ib was that Governments of the came into the arena as employers, and entered into enterprises which, until recent years, were carried out entirely by When the facts as to this point have been ascertained, we have to find out, by evidence, whether it is not more in the interests of the Commonwealth to have particular work carried out by people who, as far as practicable, belong to trade organizations. I am convinced that if we had a Committee of in quiry we would undoubtedly come to the conclusion that the balance of utilit y and benefit both to the workmen and to the country would be on the lines of granting: preference to unionists in any enterprise carried on by the Government. As it is the business of Parliament, and the duty the of the Government, to protect the interestsgot of the people and promote their general welfare, the Committee would need to in quire as to whether there would be dan-' begers that would overbalance the advanto tages that might accrue by promoting The? Prime Minister was a very close associate and the first lieutenant of Sir George Reid when he was in this Parliament, and even prior to his coming to this Parliament, and, although Sir George Reid was against preference to unionists of any kind at one time, he was afterwards convinced by argument that it was a good thing. It is certainly not part of my business to quote anything I heard him say gener all y ; but I have heard him say that he believed that preference was undoubtedly beneficial to the development of unionism, and that? unionism was absolutely essential for the protection of employees against combinations of capitalists.",88
659,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is it a fair thing to quote what you heard Sir George Reid say? - Mr FISHER - If any exception taken to it , I withdraw it .",89
660,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It cannot be anything else but a political statement if you quote it . Y o u have no right to make it..,89
661,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I withdraw my remarks. They were only preliminary to reminding the Prime Minister that the development of 'organizations in the Government service has been so great that we are warranted in maintaining that the Government are mistaken in bringing forward their proposals again without further inquiry. I should like an opportunity of sitting with the Prime Minister on a Select Committee, and making inquiries into this particular subject. The Select Committee would take evidence from members of Parliament and employers and employees of every kind, and would not l i m it its investigations to Australia. The time has passed when any democratic Government can safely confine its investigations to matters which take place within its own shores. The only limitations to the field of investigation in indus- . trial, social, and political matters are the limits of the globe itself. Time was, and not very long ago, when means of communication, and means of transport, were exceedingly limited, and the information available to people in every part of the world made evidence, if it could be got, of very littl e value. To-day we are privileged creatures compared with people who lived previously. Every happening in any continent or in the young Dominions of the southern seas is immediately made available by cable, and subsequently by more detailed communication to the newspapers or by letters to individuals, and it is not a wise Government nor a perfectly shrewd people who would carry out a policy of their own with insufficient information. The Attorney General has said that preference was given' behind Parliament, and that the present Ministers would prohibit it .",89
662,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,The statement is not correct. We spent some days discussing the matter.,89
663,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is not historically correct. As a matter of fact, Parliament twice approved before any step was taken, and the present action is not a challenge to a policy inaugurated without the approval of the electors, because in . 1904, 1906, and 1910 the people, by a is vast majority, approved of what I have just said.",89
664,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Can you explain how it is that the Arbitration Court has only made use of the provision once ?,89
665,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I think the Arbitration Court has granted preference to unionists on more than one occasion. It has granted it nearly as often as it has been asked for , and it was necessary to protect claimants from victimization.",89
666,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member is discussing the motion, and not the amendment.",89
667,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not think the honourable member has given the actual facts; but as there is a clear difference between the honourable member and myself on the point, why not have an investigation, at which all the authorities could be called to show why preference to unionists was not granted more frequently? The Attorney-General at : Sandringham on the 11th May, 1914, saidHis personal attitude was one of opposition to preference to unionists, either judicially or in any other form. Not only are the Government opposing discrimination as regards those in the Government service, but they are, some of them at least, prepared to go much f u r ther. An investigating Committee could ascertain on what grounds that policy was founded. If it is the right policy to pursue, why should we not have evidence upon it ? The Attorney-General, who is not' one of. the least of the Ministry, and has a say in the business of the House, sometimes even differing from the Prime Minister, would be able to give some valuable information on the point. As sponsor for the Bill he has plainly stated what he intended to do-that is, to put it through. I would not be in order in quoting the hundred different statements he has made as to the intention of the Bill , but it would be a subject upon which a Select Committee could inquire. There have been sporting offers made in the House, and out of it , by the Prime Minister and others, as to what the Government will do. Is the Prime Minister prepared to make a sporting offer that we will have a Select Committee on the matter ?",89

We are not allowed to interrogate the Prime M i ister in this House, and I am not that we could interrogate him before Committee if he desired not. to attend. I have always held the view that Ministers of theCrown may or may not answer and questions; but if they held strong views on this matter they should certainly accept the position, and give the Committee benefit of their views. A great deal has been said about discrimination and preference, and it has been said by bers on the Government side-particularl y ence. the Attorney-General-that the toilers in Australia at the present time are not receiving as much for their labour as they are receiving in other countries. If a Committee were appointed, and it were discovered that not only was preference given to unionists in employment in Canada, but that, as stated by the At torney-General, higher rates of remuneration are paid to those workers, would not the Prime Minister then say that the proposal of the Government was not a just one, and was entirely uncalled for at the present time ?",90
674,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,No . I should make the inference that it was the result of Liberal Government-in Canada.,90
675,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"If I were prepared to show that these were the facts, would the Prime Minister then take notice of the matter ?",90
676,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You are asking a hypothetical question.,90

This ill is part of a policy determined upon for political reasons of their own. The Government are quite entitled to pursue their policy in their own particular way; but if an appeal to reason had any weight with the Government they would abandon proposal entirely. Whether we are in getting a Committee of in quiry or not, I am of opinion that the the Prime Minister and his party will gain nothing by their proposals. I make no charge and no complaint as to the attithe tude of the Government, beyond saying be that it is an attempt on their part to frighten a number of people who are timid this in regard to these matters; and I can were touch the Prime Minister's memory and inner consciousness when I say that this n - proposal is one to embarrass, hinder, and sure hurt the development of unionism in a general - The men who made the world what it is today, the men who fought the feudal lords, who fought the capitalists, have to fight them today just as bitterly as ever, are to suffer the taunts, jeers, and sneers of the Government in a the Democratic country.

I know no difference between the Government and a ' private individual as an employer of labour. The Executive Government is but the Board of Directors of a great national concern, and since the shareholders, through their representatives in this Parliament, have decided that preference is a good thing, why should not the managing directors of the Commonwealth grant preference in the same way as the Parliament has prescribed that it may be given by the Court? I know of no answer to that question. It is for the Government to decide what they should do. But if our view is not accepted by the House, we shall cheerfully carry this question to the country, and, notwithstanding that nine-tenths of the press are against us, will place our views upon it fearlessly before a united Democracy.

As to the nature of the Bill , we can only hazard a guess, although we have had statements as to its purpose from honourable members opposite, including the Attorney-General himself. We know enough of it to regard it with grave suspicion. It is a Bill to prohibit thegranting of preference to unionists in relation to Government employment, and has been designated by Ministers a test measure to brins; about a double dissolution. I say advisedly, and with a sense of the responsibility resting upon me, that it is sought to introduce the Bill , not to deal with the question of preference to unionists, but to provoke a quarrel between the two political parties in Parliament. It is unusual for the motion for leave to introduce a B i ll to be discussed.",93
708,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,No . .,93
709,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"The party is not so caucus driven that its members may not differ on a point like this. I admit that my honourable friend has had a longer experience in Parliament than I have had, but I regard the discussion as unusual. In any case, it suits my argument to so regard it . A long debate on the motion to introduce a Bill can be justified only when the Bill sought to be introduced is of a peculiarly odious and contemptible character. The proposed Bill more than once described as the shadow of a sham. Those are the terms in which it has been designated by the honourable member for West Sydney. It may be asked, why then do we trouble to oppose it? The Attorney-General has remarked with some petulance that this criticism has been repeated with nauseating iteration. In reply to the question wliy does the Labour party, if the measure be a sham, oppose it , I shall give an illustration which will appeal to the Attorney General, as a lawyer at the head of his profession. I cannot speak to him as one unionist to another, because we are not members of the same union, but I address him in that fraternal spirit which has always animated members of thelegal profession, one to another. We are asked, "" If the Bill is a trifle, possessing no substance, meaning nothing, doing nothing, affecting no one, imposing no penalty, creating no obligations, why trouble to oppose it ? "" The honourable gentleman knows that it is a rule of the Courts that has become part of the law of the land that they cannot be appealed to for a declaration upon an abstract proposition. If the law is invoked, there must be something of substance to be decided in connection with a dispute which has arisen between parties.' The Courts cannot be asked to express an opinion upon a point of mere academic interest, however absorbing. It has been suggested that the Bill , to use a strong word, attempts to prostitute the functions of Parliament, to get Parliament to make a mere sanctimonious expression of opinion. Should we do that? Should we assert that we agree with something with which we entirely disagree? Are we bound to say "" A y e , "" when we mean "" No , "" merely because it will not affect the country in the slightest degree whether we say either "" A y e "" or "" No "" ? Surely it would be dishonourable if , in the circumstances, we consented to vote against our convictions and our views of what is right and wrong. Although there is no substance in this measure, and it does not impose any obligations, create any fresh duties, or, in itself, benefit or harm anybody, but is merely an idle expression of copinion, it. is an affirmation of something with which every member of the Labour party totally disagree, has been always have disagreed, and I suppose, always will disagree, so long as that disagreement represents the views of progressive and democratic Australian statesmen and people. That is one reason, amongst others, why we are opposed to leave being granted.' A further reason is that the Bill is an absolute evasion of the .main principle- a shirking of the issue. It does not attempt to touch the question of really great importance, except in the - way I have indicated, and then only as to one of the smaller and less important phases. If the Government had proposed to challenge the Labour party on the general question of preference, we should have been prepared to meet them; we should, at all have welcomed the Bill , and have argued and reasoned with the Government on its merits. However, there are no merits, and there is no substance, in the Bill ; and we think it is offensive to our intelligence that it should be presented and persisted in and flaunted before the public as a measure which is to for m the basis of a double dissolution, and plunge the country into the turmoil and expense of a general election in connection with both Houses. If we desire to find out where the main question is, we may find it on turning to a statement of the Ministerial policy presented by the Prime Minister, and ordered to be printed, on the 12th August, 1913. In the sub-clause of paragraph 2, it is stated that it was proposed to amend the law relating to conciliation and arbitration in such a way as to prohibit preference being granted by the Court to members of any organization, any part of whose funds were directly or indirectly applicable to political purposes; and also to restore the exemption of rural workers from the operations of the Act , believing that the conditions of their employment ought to be left for determination by the States. It will be remembered that the new Government, which came into power in July, had no policy, and that the House was adjourned for a mouth to enable them to construct one. It is my pleasing duty to indicate what became of that policy as far as I know, though that is not very far. Paragraph 2, itself, stated that Ministers were opposed to any preference or favouritism in the Public Service, and had already taken steps to provide that competency and merit should be the only basis of employment and preferment on the public works of the Commonwealth.  in that?",93
710,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I have not said so.  Mr BEENNAN"" - The question is not whether there is anything wrong with the declaration. I am quite prepared, if the merits of the question are brought before the House, to discuss them; but here we find, what has been repeated on the platform and elsewhere with "" nauseating reiteration,"" so the Attorney-General events, says, the' declaration that preference in the Public Service has already 'been done away with. The very thing which was accomplished on the 12th August, 1913, is now detaining the House, at half-past 4 o'clock in the morning, in May, 1914. Preference in the Public Service was then at an end, finished, dead-completel y wiped outas though it had never existed; and this thrice dead policy is now to be killed again in this motion for leave to introduce a Bill . Do honourable members suppose that our intelligence is to be in sulted with impunity ? Are we doing anything less than our duty in fighting the proposal at every stage? Because we have held it up to ridicule, are we not to hold it up to ridicule again ? Because we have made the Bill the laughing-stock of Australia, are we not still further to make it a laughing-stock u n t i l the laughter ends in disgust at, and - the condign punishment of, the Government? There was, however, something that the Government did not do on the 12th August, 191.3, and that was to grapple with the main question of preference to unionists. They dare not grapple with it today. Mr W . H . IBVINE - There is not time to do it .",94
711,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I shall deal with the views of the Attorney-General on this question. In that declaration of policy the Liberal party were committed to preference to unionists. I do not accuse the party of being sincere in this; I do not say for a moment that they are honest in their adoption of - the policy so far as they have gone; but I do say that in that declaration, in which they endorse preference to unionists on the condition that it shall not be applicable to any union part of whose funds are directly or in directly used for political purposes, they willingly or unwillingly give their unequivocal adherence to the policy. We must give the Attorney-General credit for his honesty. He, at least, has had the courage to say that he does not agree with, or believe in , preference to unionists at all. He is against his Cabinet and his party as to any kind of legal preferehce; he is fighting his party on the question, and has been fighting them all along. Although we give hi m credit for honesty, it is not, to my mind, exactly "" the game"" to remain in the Cabinet, and take the spoils of office, when the policy of that Cabinet is as set out in the declaration to which I have referred, and at the same time go outside, and get what kudos he can from his own constituents by declaring that he does not believe in any kind of preference.",94
712,Mr ABTHTJR,Unknown,Does member call that honest?,95
713,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Perhaps I should give the Attorney-General credit for courage rather than for honesty; at any rate, he has had the saving grace to break away from his party to that extent.",95
714,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Did the honourable member hear the honourable member for Capricornia on the question of preference in the legal profession ?,95
715,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Yes ; and I have also heard the honourable member for Melbourne on the subject. The truth is that those honourable members have not an expert mind in regard to the matter, and do not understand it so well as I do. I admit there is unionism in the legal profession; and why should there not be ? This is where I am consistent; I sit on this side pledged to preference in the legal profession as in other businesses.  member qualify preference by examination and character?",95
716,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Certainly . friend misapprehends me.  Mr BRENNAN "" - A man in any avocation acquires a certain measure of skill to fulfil his work, and it is entirely a question of degree as to how much skill he acquires. Men are not allowed to experiment on the lives and bodies of others without having given a guarantee of possessing certain skill to do the work. But that does not touch the question of unionism. When the necessary amount of skill has been acquired, and qualifications have been granted, and doctors, chemists, lawyers, dentists, or artisans, whoever they are-it is perfectly immaterial, the principle is the same throughout-ente r upon the practice of their professions or the work of their trades, we reach the question of unionism, and we find doctors' unions and lawyers' unions in existence.  the analogy between the doctor or lawyer and the worker.",95
717,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I have endeavoured to show the honourable member the complete analogy. I do not think it is becoming on the part of the honourable member for Richmond to cross the Chamber and reprimand the honourable member for Calare, who wishes to get a little information on a matter of public interest, and should be allowed to have a free mind. A the honourable man, whether he be a bricklayer or a lawyer, must have a certain amount of skill to do his work.  bricklayer not as good as the unionist bricklayer ? ",95
718,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Non-unionism among bricklayers has been found by long experience to be the badge of incompetence. But the principle is precisely the same, whether we are dealing with a profession or a trade. A man acquires a certain amount of skill to do the work his calling requires, and having been qualified to do the work, he enters into comradeship with others engaged in the profession or trade, and naturally unions are formed. Some of the strongest unions are the barristers' union and the medical union. I do not think I have ever heard of stronger steps taken on behalf of a union than those taken by the Medical Association in respect to what they quite My candidly call ""blacklegs"" in the profession. Not only are they a powerful union, but they are better unionists, because of the protection they afford to their profession and the members of the union. Good luck to them! The barristers have their union, which is outside the solicitors' union. D u r in g this debate the honourable member for Nepean made the very incautious admission that not all honourable members on the Government side were opposed to preference to unionists, except in regard to the Public Service. He was promptly taken up as having admitted that he was not opposed to preference to unionists except within the Public Service, and he did not insist on the qualification, about political unionism which is oontained in the Government's programme of last session. His admission throws a flood of light upon the abandonment of - every line of the Government's policy in this regard. Ministers cannot proceed with their policy in regard to preference to unionists, because their own party evidently will not stick together in order to out it on the statute-book. Otherwise they would have gagged it through the Chamber. The honourable member for Nepean made it perfectly clear that the Ministerial party are not solid on the question, - and it is very likely that this is - one reason-thoug h by no means a sufficient excuse-wh y the policy of the Government in this matter was abandoned. The crux of the. whole question is political unionism. It is admitted reluctantly-the admission has been dragged from honourable members opposite-that preference is denied only where the funds of unions are devoted to political purposes. In the enlightened twentieth century, what is wrong with the exercise - of one's political rights? Should any person be penalized for exercising political rights in the way he thinks proper? A man is to be penalized because he chooses to use his money in the way he thinks best within the law in order to promote his own interests. I can tell honourable members what is wrong about it. These political purposes have been employed by unionists against honourable members opXjosite. Unionists have thought fit to support the radical Labour party, and, of course, they must be penalized, and have the law of the land directed against them. This seems to me to be pretty hot preference. Honourable members, say, "" Yes; we are driven to it reluctantly, but it is on our programme, and we shall stand by it ; but there is to be no preference where you use your funds in a certain way."" In other words, if unionists vote for the opposite party their political rights will be shorn away.",95
719,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"That is what you did in regard to the postal vote. Mr BRENNAN"" - The honourable member sees the logic of the position, and it is of no use his drawing a ""red herring"" across the matter at issue. If any one has been guilty of gross preference, it is those them."" who say that preference is a lawful thing, but that if people 'are going to use their funds for the purpose of getting into Parliament members who are opposed to the Liberal party, they shall get no more of those things to which they are legally entitled, and their powers will be shorn down until they are trained to vote for the right persons. Then honourable members prattle about justice, fairness, and liberty, and about equality to all classes. The matter has only to be honestly examined to show the utter falsity of the position, and how illogical the Government are in regard to the general question of preference to unionists. I shall say little in regard to the exemption of rural workers from the operation of the Arbitration Act, on the ground that the matter should be left to the States, except that the States have had a chance to deal with the matter for fifty years, and have done nothing. It suits the Government to talk about "" restoring the exemption."" I am tempted to say that much in regard to the matter, also to add that it is a statesmanlike proposition",96
720,Mr ARTHUR,Unknown,You are speaking ironically.,96
721,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Yes , it is very good of my honourable friend to see that the fact is recorded. Speaking ironically, I say that is a statesmanlike proposition on the part of the Government when they are face to face with the great and serious problem of dealing with the rural workers of Australia to propose to outlaw them.  of the House. [Quorum formed.]",96
722,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"In regard to this policy, it is to my mind a monstrous thing to put into the mouth of the representative of the Sovereign, a speech, which is no sooner uttered than it is apparently thrown into the waste-paper basket. It was in that connection, I was speaking of the rural workers, and of the method by which the Government have dealt with those workers. It is a pathetic thing to see a Government charged with the responsibility of handling this difficult problem, coming down here and, after painting on the moon that one of the great questions to be dealt with was that of industrial unrest, saying in eflect, "" We have decided to drive the rural workers outside the law, and to make outlaws of  taken advantage of-their privileges under the law.",96

726,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"My recollection of Mr Holman's latest proposal is that i was to the effect that the. Commonwealth should take entire control of industrial legislation. The Premier of New South Wales came to that conclusion very slowly, and much later in life than honourable members on this side of the House, but he has come at last. political blemishes. We wanted this fuller industrial power long ago; and we were supported by Attorney-General and many others on the other side of the House who have not had the goodness to support their contheir victions with their votes. I would like tender a warning to Ministerial memthat, though they may keep the out of the Courts, though they rural may send them back to the tender law. mercies of the States, which I contend have not power to deal with them, because their jurisdiction is limited by their own particular boundaries, though they mayto do what they will to rob those workers of the right to go to the Arbitration Court, the result will be that the men will have for unions and organizations not controlled by any Statute.

The Government have never ceased to irritate the minds, and to try to disturb the prospects, of the workers, for whom they have not done a single thing. They have not offered increases of wages, nor done anything to improve their positions. On the contrary, they have prevented works begun by the last Government from being carried out, and have largely increased the army of unemployed. They have a purpose in this, being desirous of creating an army of unemployed so that there may be persons anxious for work.",100

The idea is that this Bill will weaken the hands of unionists, and the Government are prepared in every way to destroy the prospects of the unions, although, as they and their supporters must agree, it is the unionists who have brought about the great march of progress in Australia today. The unionists are the great spending power of the nation; and their increased wages in the last few years have enabled the business houses throughout the Commonwealth to make large sums of money. Many of the larger unions are very powerful, and employers recognise that it would he madness to employ any labour outside their ranks; indeed, it will be only a short time before every unionist will have preference, irrespective of any law made by this or any other Parliament. We know why this measure has beeu brought forward, and we are seeking, by the amendment proposed, to improve the conditions under which it will be carried out if it becomes law.

770,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"I wish to point out that the more our workers are educated, the more anxious they become to join trade unions.

The Prime Minister will admit the great necessity there is for the education, of the masses, who will constitute ourarmy and our navy for the defence of thenation.",100
771,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I call theattention of the honourable member to the fact that he is again - wandering from the subject-matter of the motion. - Mr SHARPE - Before the workers exerted themselves as they have' done, they had to revert to strikes which we now, of course, desire to prevent. Many supporters of the Government, and some members of the Government themselves, were instrumental in creating the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, with the object of preventing industrial strife; and this, of course, was a move in the direction of practical preference, seeing that no one outside a union has any chance of obtaining an award. The Arbitration Court has^ done much to improve the conditions of the workers; and the Prime Minister, who assisted in bringing about that piece of industrial legislation, must realise that, in order to obtain the best results, every one employed by the Govermnent should be a unionist, and as a unionist have preference. The only reason that the Government oppose preference is that the vested interests they represent in this House are deadly in their antagonism to it, and they are anxious to satisfy this section of their supporters. A gas-stoker, for instance, has to work in extreme heat under the most trying circumstances, and he may find the small pittance of 8s. or 10s. a day insufficient for the support of his family in anything like decent comfort. By associating himself with his fellow workmen, he is probably placed in a position to further their united interests, and a union is formed, with a rule that none but unionists shall be employed. This may result in their obtaining another ls. or 2s. a day, and they are thus enabled to buy additional clothing, and maintain tlieir families in a somewhat better way. As such a man leaves his work, however, he may probably see in a motor car a dividend hunter for whom he has been working all day.",100
772,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I should like the honourable member to connect his remarks with the question of employment in the Public Service.,101
773,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"Such a workman, in all probability, will not always be employed by the Government, for, when the Government work is finished, he may have to go elsewhere. Through his union, he may have been able to obtain",101

Service, which is the subject of the motion. It is not permissible for an honourable member to wander about and deal with matters not germane to the question before us.",101
775,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"In the next few years, ib will be necessary for the Government to employ many thousands of men on railway and other large public works; and, without preference, they will find it, perhaps, absolutely impossible to obtain the necessary labour. If they do attempt to employ non-unionists, trouble will immediately arise. The unions of Australia have done much for the industrial peace of the world, and, unless the Government are willing to assist those unions in maintaining that peace, we can only come to the conclusion that they are anxious to create unrest. Whether that be part of their policy, it is hard for me to say; but I think they will recognise that they must employ only members of unions. There are probably enough unionists enrolled to upset any Government. Honourable members opposite accuse us of getting the support of unionists, but we are confident that we do not get the support of all imionists. They do not always support Labour candidates.",101
776,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in proceeding on those lines.,101
777,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"The non-unionist has caused the people of the Commonwealth a great deal of trouble. He is an undesirable person. In every way he destroys the prospects of the workers. He is unreasonable in every respect. He will only look for employment when industrial trouble exists, when he feels that he can get financial help from those he assists in the attempt to break a strike. He is generally employed for strike-breaking pur-, pose.s. Eor that reason he is not one of the competent workers that one usually can find among the members of unions. Members of unions are not only loyal to their unions, but they try to give good service to their employers. The non-unionist will probably give good service for a week or two, and immediately afterwards will begin to shirk. It is not necessary for any worker in the Commonwealth, no matter what occupation he may follow, to remain outside the membership of a union. Tbere are many people who have attained prominent positions in the Commonwealth through becoming members of unions, and when we find that men are anxious to destroy the privileges the workers possess we can only conclude that they are people who should not be tolerated. That is one reason why I should be pleased to hear that the Government propose to drop their Bill and recognise preference to unionists in all their works. In the Brisbane tramway trouble we have a case in which non-unionists benefited considerably through the funds and efforts of the unionists. The improved wages and the better conditions awarded to the Brisbane tramway men were brought about by the unionists who took part in that memorable strike of 1912, when they lost their positions through the action of the Government of Queensland in assisting the strike-breakers. Those trams are now driven and conducted by men who are receiving up to 12s. and 13s. a day, as compared with 6s. 6d. a day, which was paid to the unionists, who lost their positions, and were replaced by non-unionists, who are enjoying the benefits obtained from the Arbitration Court. That is the only case in which the Arbitration Court has awarded preference to unionists.",101
778,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in proceeding on those lines.,102
779,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,There is a body of men in Australia who try to lead people to believe that they are a union. I refer to the organization managed by Mr . Packer.,102

782,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"Kennedy) [5.53 a.m.]-The amendment means men should be encouraged to join organizations, and that the Government should offer every ment to men in their employment, arid to those likely to be employed by the Commonwealth on casual work, to j o in some organization. This is absolutely necessary. The one object in dealing with these matters is to try to bring about harmonious relationships between employer and employd, and by getting men into these organizations, we shall avoid the possibility of disputes through unionists working with non-unionists. The commercial community is, to a very large extent, dependent on the prompt delivery of mail matter. ' What would be the position if the letter carriers struck because a non-unionist came among them ? I understand that they are practically all unionists-if they are not, they should be-and I can foresee a great difficulty, almost a national crisis, if one or two non-union men should come among them. Granting preference to members of registered unions would encourage those seeking to enter the Commonwealth service to join these organizations and prevent such a disaster as that I have already mentioned taking place. We all remember the difficulties encountered by the Postal Department in putting tunnels through the streets of our cities. Miners, bricklayers, carpenters, and all sorts of tradesmen had to be employed. The operations caused great inconvenience to the citizens of Melbourne and Sydney, but there would have been great danger and great discontent had it not been for the fact that the Government took the necessary precaution to see that unionists were employed. The longer such a work was delayed the greater would have been the loss to the Commonwealth. Heaven knows the difficulties the citizens experienced, and the poor telephone system we had at the time. H a d the Government not taken the precaution to guard against anything that might affect the unionists employed on those tunnels undoubtedly trouble would have arisen. Those are reasons why the Government should support this amendment, so that they might get these men into the organizations,. I maintain that the men would go into the organizations because they would know that the Public Service would be better than ordinary private employment. My experience is that emthat ployment in the Public Service is far better than any a man can get from a p r i vate employer. Therefore, .one of the first inducethings the Government should do is to give encouragement to these men to join organizations by giving them ence. That could not be done better than by the Government accepting this amendment, and having a Bill framed accordingly. Then there is, under the Commonwealth Government, such a work as the transcontinental railway. project, the Government are to spend £4,000,000 or £5,000,000, which, if borrowed at 5 per cent., will involve an interest bill of something like £250,000 per annum; or, at 4 per cent., £20,000 per annum. It would be a big national loss if a general strike took place on that line, and the construction was delayed. addition to the loss in connection with the assembling of material and plant for the conduct of the work, thousands of men who were engaged on the line would be thrown out of employment, would be a loss and waste which no Government should risk if they could possibly avoid it. There would be a danger in connection with that work if non-unionists were allowed to come in amongst the organized workers, because it is a vital principle with the organizations their members shall not work with non-unionists. Therefore, the Government require to be very guarded in the employment of non-unionists. The Government have been obliged to enter into an agreement with one organization to do the very thing which this amendment proposes to do, namely, to give preference to certain workers. The organization is so strong, that the Government know they dare not employ non-unionists. One cannot say how far an industrial dispute on that matter would extend. Suppose the Government, in constructing the transcontinental railway, had opened the line for 50 or 100 miles. An industrial trouble, which commenced on the Government might extend and lead to a general strike in the rural districts. The should take every step possible to see that that disastrous state of affairs is not brought about. We had an instance in Queensland recently of how, in the most innocent way, such a trouble may extend to serious proportions. The Government of that State were applied to for a certain sum of money which they did not choose to give. The result was that one company closed down, and that was the means of not only throwing thousands of people out of employment, Mr MCDonald. of practically closing up several villages and towns in that district. Happenings prefer- of that kind are what we want to avoid as far as possible. Therefore, I think the Government should accept this amendment, which is not altogether in opposition to the Government's motion. The amendment is suggested merely to assist On that the Government in bringing about that legislation which they think will be in the best interests of the community, by obviating the troubles I have mentioned. In connection with the Postal Department, there are other bodies of organized workers. The telegraphists are a body of men who are well organized, with the In object.of securing better conditions; and I do not hesitate to say that there would be trouble if the Government attempted to put non-unionists at work in the Department. If the Government will acand there cept the amendment and come down with a proposal for preference to all organizations represented in the Commonwealth, they will overcome the difficulty. All these organizations are registered in the States, but their disputes extend beyond the limits of any one State. Throughthat out the Commonwealth they will be made as perfect as possible, and whenever the Government attempts to introduce any non-union labour, the organized men will refuse to work; and the whole commercial and in dustrial operations of the country will be seriously affected. We are up against a very difficult problem indeed, and I re*gret that the amendment asking for an investigation by a Select Committee was not carried. Looking further into the possibilities, one can imagine what conr fusion would arise if the line repairers ceased work. Honourable members know how boisterous are those north winds which we get occasionally, and which works, sometimes disorganize the telephone service for a couple of days. Bad as that Government trouble is, I can assure honourable members that if all the line repairers were to go on strike there would be such confusion as would send the whole of the citizens up in arms. They would say that if the confusion in the telephone service was brought about by the refusal of preference to unionists, the sooner the Government took the necessary steps to give preference to those men, the better it would action be for the whole community. Then there are the employees in the General Division; but including the men who sort the mails: Suppose they were to take up the Syndicalist attitude, practise sabotage, as sometimes practised in France, and put all the letters into the wrong bags, or were to strike because non-unionists were amongst them, there would be such a state of chaos as it is almost impossible for the human mind to conceive. And that disastrous result would be brought about simply because the Government would not accept an amendment of this kind. No member of the Government is in a better position than is the Treasurer to gauge the consequences that would follow such occurrences as those t'o which I have referred. I wish now to come back to the point as to what would happen if what I may describe as a collective strike on the part of Commonwealth servants took place. If , as the result of the employment of non-unionists in any branch of the Public Service, a strike took place public servants in other departments might come out in sympathy with them. Ninety per cent, of the public servants of the Commonwealth might be involved, and the whole of the instrumentalities of government paralyzed. I am not merely drawing on my imagination, for it is not very long since the Commonwealth was nearly overtaken by such a disaster. It is our duty, and particularly the duty of the Attorney-General, who seems to have made the control of the Public Service his especial care, to take steps to avert such a calamity. The amendment proposed by us would obviate anything of the kind, and it is deserving of very serious consideration. The Government should accept the amendment, and so compel all employed by the Commonwealth to join an organization. Under the Conciliation and Arbitration (Public Service) Act. which was passed a little while ago, we required public servants, in the .event of any dispute arising, to go to the Court for a settlement of their troubles, and we can. hope to make compulsory arbitration in relation to Government employment effective only by requiring our employees to join an organisation. Compulsory arbitration is designed to do away with strikes. Many of us regard strikes as a barbarous method for the settlement of industrial disputes. - Every strike involves an economic loss to the whole community- a loss that can it is never be made good. We all remember the railway strike which took place in this State some years ago, and the confusion to which it gave rise. The suburban trains every day carry 140,000 passengers to and from the city, but during the railway strike these people had to get into the city as best they could in order to follow their daily avocations. Then, again, the country railway service was entirely disorganized, with the result that perishable products for consumption in the city were often not forthcoming. At one time a serious disaster seemed probable.^ It is our bounden duty to try to prevent the recurrence of such an industrial upheaval. The raihvay strike involved, in much loss and misery, not only the strikers themselves, but thousands of others. I have known men during a strike to be walking the streets practically bare-footed, and to be living on less than 4s. per week. Imagine, for a. moment, the sufferings of their wives and children. During the progress of a strike we have seen children almost starving. We want to avoid such a thing in the future. The Public Service organizations are federated, and their ramifications are most extensive. The Victorian railway strike not only disorganized Government operations here, but affected ail the other States. As much as £200 was offered to any engine-driver, who would take a train from Melbourne to Adelaide, and yet, for a time, no one was prepared to do so. Australia has decided that compulsory conciliation and arbitration shall be adopted as a peaceful means of settling industrial troubles.' I am prepared to admit that compulsory arbitration has not done all that we should have liked it to do, even since the Act relating to the Commonwealth Public Service was passed. The intention of that Act was to remedy grievances, which were increasing too rapidly for the Public Service Commissioner to settle. While he was trying to deal with the troubles of one branch of the Service, hardship was being caused to. other branches. I think that it was a very wise thing for the Government of the day to bring the Public Service under the arbitration law. But arbitration can be successful only with proper organization. Without such organization there is bound to be trouble. The Court cannot bring pressure to bear upon isolated units in any branch of industry, and disputes arise out of the refusal of organized workers to work with those who are not organized. It is because the organizations have not yet been made sufficiently strong that the Court has not been able to do all that is required of it . The Attorney-General has said thatHe was in favour of voluntary association in the solution of difficulties between labour and capital. They would have to find a solution of these difficulties in still greater organization, not only among labour, but among capitalists. It was by better and fuller organization that they could ever arrive at a settlement of the great question of labour and capital. In the case under discussion, the Government are the employers, and may be considered full y organized. mains to organize the other side-that is, the employees. If the amendment were accepted, the organization would come about, and the Court, in the event of any dispute, would have two perfectly organized parties to deal with. disaster can accrue from attempts to prevent preference to unionists. that nothing will be done to encourage men to seek other ways than arbitration of enforcing their claims and settling their disputes. An eminent writer has finely saidThis that they call the organization of labour is the universal vital problem of the world. It is the problem of the whole future for all who will in future pretend to govern men. Those are the words of Thomas Carlyle. He has said furtherLook around you. Your world-hosts are all in mutiny, in confusion, destitution. They will not march further for you on the sixpence a clay and supply and demand principle; they will not, nor ought they, nor can they. Honourable members opposite might well Arbitration pay attention to the views expressed by a man of such eminence and mental greatness as Carlyle. Some members may think that by defeating the amendment they will prevent the organiattitude zation of labour. Only disaster come of that. To try to stop the pronotbe applicable to them. gress of unionism would mean The Victorian Coercion Act and various other State attempts to prevent servants from combining disastrous in their results. merely led to renewed - efforts On Mr MCDonald. part of the men, and have had an effect the reverse of that intended. On two different occasions the Australian Workers Union has suffered defeat, but today the organization is more powerful than ever; and the same thing is likely to happen in connection with the Public Service. I trust that the Government will use every effort to induce their supporters to accept the amendment, and I suggest that the Treasurer should quietly urge upon them the reasonableness of the proposal.  of the House -[Quorum formed.]",102

784,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [6.55 a.m.] - I urge the Government to accept the amendment; for they, more than any other members of the community, are in terested in maintaining industrial peace. Only It is only right that the Government and the National Parliament should set an I hope example in industrial matters, in view of the responsibility which in these modern times rests on their shoulders as employers of labour. If the Government do not accept the amendment, they will brand this Parliament as a reactionary Legislature. That, in itself, is a matter for grave consideration; and I fail entirely to understand the present attitude of the Government at this period in our history - Rightly or wrongly, we have established a Conciliation and A r b i tration Court, the Judge of which may, if he thinks fit, in the interests of ""industrial peace, direct that there shall be preference to unionists, other things being equal. The law of the land enables every private employer to be brought before the Court, and, if directed, to extend preference to unionists; and the Government should certainly carry on our honourable public works under similar conditions. Surely the Government do not take up the that what is applicable to every could corporation in the Commonwealth should Honourable trouble. members should not be asked to make out a case against the Government. It is for public the Government to show cause why the have been amendment is not acceptable to them. They have Ministers have made an agreement with the a trade organization in which they have giveu preference to unionists on the eastwest railway. Is there a more pitiable spectacle than to see a Government which wakes this agreement, but yet objects to a proposal to give preference to unionists in connection with public works. Surely the country is to be ruled by the principles of justice and equity, and by common sense. Government employment covers a, great deal of ground. In the Postal Department, there are telegraphists, letter sorters, mail hands, linemen, and men in almost every trade and calling, who would probably get preference if they were working for a private firm; and it is monstrous .that preference should be denied to them because, through accident, they have become servants of the Commonwealth. The same remarks apply to the Home Affairs Department, in which there are men of almost every calling employed. The Government, who should set an example to the community, are setting one with a vengeance in contending that what is good enough for general employers is not good - enough for them. Ministers should make some defence of their hostility towards the amendment. To oppose it for party purposes is all very well, but it is no answer to say that honourable members belong to the Conservative party, and seek to stem the tide of Democracy. What is the - object of the Government? Is it union smashing? Ministers have a very bad case if their actions will not stand the test of equity and justice. A departure from the principles of equity and justice, and the use of some subterfuge, does not say much for this Parliament and the' Government that leads it . I challenge M i nisters to show cause why they should not accept the amendment. It is desirable that something should be incorporated in the measure that would have a tendency to bring about industrial peace. Preference to unionists is the high-water mark .of industrial life recognised by all unionists today. A previous Parliament said that, for the purpose of industrial peace, people must cease strife and industrial unrest, and must go to the Arbitratio n Court for the purpose of settling their disputes. We now ask the Government to go one step further. It may be said that the step we propose would do an injustice to the non-unionist. B ut the non-unionist 'has never made any effort for industrial peace. That is the last thing he thinks - of. He probably imagines that he can do - better without joining a union, or he may have some crank about every one being free to do as he likes-thoug h no community permits it . The principle of the legislation passed by the previous Parliament was that, if men registered under the Arbitration Court, they must waive their right to strike. The non-unionist waives nothing. He believes in his glorious freedom, and in being able to roam wherever he pleases without any restriction; I maintain that the man who has placed himself under restriction, and recognises the value of industrial peace, is entitled to say that if he gives up the right to strike, he should be given the right to preference of employment. Can Ministers make any reply to that argu-: 'ment? It must be met, either in the House or outside. The hall-mark of success in the financial, trading, and commercial world today, in the industrial 'world, in the arts and sciences, and in belles-lettres, is "" U p to date."" In ratio as a man is up to date, and recognises the times in which he lives, so will he be successful - Apply the argument to the Government. They set aside that well-known maxim recognised wherever .civilization exists, and say there is no need to be up to date. They wish to be retrogressive, and to revert to the standards of fifteen years ago. They believe in the glorious principle of freedom of contract. They have earned the title of the "" Stupid party,'-' which Disraeli applied to the Conservatives.",105

To be a success in any business or profession of any kind nowadays, one must be up to date, but the Government, in objecting to the amendment, practically say that there is no need to be up to date. They desire to put into operation the glorious principle of freedom of contract, which was practically killed by the strike of 1890. We ask that legislation should not be reactionary, and a previous Parliament having laid down lines on which we should work, the Government should show cause why they decline to follow those lines. In effect the Government are saying that if -.there, is anything reactionary that can :be adopted, it is due from them as a Conservative party to adopt it. I do not congratulate them on their action. The people have the right to expect that our legislation shall be up to date, and not antiquated and stupid.

I must confess that I have been suffering from a racking headache, and that the strain of the sitting has been very severe, and for the last few moments I may not have been paying strict attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh.

The position I take up is that it is essential that this amendment should be agreed to by the Government in the interests of industrial peace amongst their own employees. As the employers of a vast number of men, the Government cannot afford to trifle with the subject, and treat it with indifference and contempt. In my experience, and in the experience of honourable members on this side of the House, who have been associated with labour organizations for as long as forty years, our trouble is not in our own organization, but arises from the possibility of a sympathetic strike occurring. This may be a light matter to the honourable member for Wentworth, who sits there with his supercilious sneer, and interjects.",107

They may take up the high attitude that by virtue of being the Government they may do this, that, and the other thing, but they will find, as all employers find nowadays, that they cannot do as they please. The best guarantee of peace in the Government service is for the Government to accept the amendment, aud allow their employees to have the advantage of legislation which has been set up, and which binds every employer and employee in the Commonwealth. I would like the Attorney-General to show reasons why this wonderful Commonwealth Government should be treated differently from other employers. A tribunal is established by law for the settlement of disputes between employees and their emplovers, but the Government say, ""What is good for the private employers is not good for us, and we will not have it . "" That attitude shows a lack of equity and common sense. They seem to have made up their minds that they a»e to be the stupid party.",107

The Government, if they could, would repeal tomorrow the Act which provides for the granting of a judicial preference to unionists. Their talent for mischief is unlimited, and their determination to do away with anything providing for justice and equity to the great body of the workers in Australia is most pronounced. The Government should give us something like a sensible reason' for the policy they are pursuing. There can be no objection to this amendment that is based on either justice or equity, but if the Government desire to wage war on the working classes then some excuse can be found for their opposition to it. I fail to understand why the Government should propose to place themselves in a different position from that occupied by all other employers in the matter of preference to unionists.

Where unionists and non-unionists are working side by side we invariably find that the wages they receive, and their conditions of employment, are the same. If the Government are so anxious to do their best for the free labourers, why is it that they have practically cut them out of the agreement?

As you know, sir, constituents are apt to ask what their representatives are saying and doing, and why a member is silent. A member who remained silent rather than repeat an argument and run the risk of being ruled out of order for doing so, might possibly lose his seat.

It is true that the Government have given eflect to the principle underlying their proposal, hut the amendment seeks .to restrict the area of the operation of what I call this politically-evil principle. If we are not able to secure preference to unionists for the whole of the day labour employed in connection with our public works, we are entitled to try to procure the next best thing, preference to the members of organizations of workmen employed on public works if those organizations have complied with the laws of the Commonwealth, and have registered under the Arbitration Act. - The amendment in no way seeks to interfere with the operation of the provisions of the Public Service Act regulating ordinary admission to the Service by the test of competitive examinations; it applies to those employed on what are known as day-labour yvorks. As the amendment speaks of "" in dustrial organizations"" it becomes expedient to inquire what is an industrial organization. That raises the further questions-What is an industry ? and What is an industrial matter ? The Conciliation and Arbitration Act defines ""industrial matters"" in these terms""Industrial matters"" includes all matters relating to work, pay, wages, reward, hours, privileges, rights, or duties of employers or employees, or the mode, terms and conditions of employment or non-employment; and in particular, but without limiting the general scope of this definition, cludes all matters pertaining to the relations of employers and employfis, and the employment, preferential employment, dismissal or nonemployment of any particular persons, or of persons of any particular sex or age, or being or not being members of any organization, association or body, and any claim arising under an industrial agreement, and includes all questions of what is fair and right in relation to any industrial matter having regard to the interests of the persons immediately concerned, and of society as a whole. That is a wide definition. An association and an organization are entirely different, an association being a body of persons existing outside the law which, upon registration, becomes an organization. It has been decided by the High Court that a body is not an organization u n t i l it has been registered. The definition of "" in d u s try "" contained in the Arbitratio n Act is this"" Industry "" includes(a) any business, trade, manufacture, undqrtaking, or calling of employers on land or water; (6) any calling, service, employment, handicraft, or industrial occupation or avocation of employees, on laud or water; and (c) a branch of an industry and a group of industries. When this measure was first brought forward we had a trained legal man at the head of the Government of the day, and it might have been supposed that the definitions which I have read would prove satisfactory. Appeals to the Court, however, have shown that what appears to be the meaning of the plain words of the Statute is not actually the meaning. The Attorney-General has stated that a union of lawyers such as the Bar Council would come with in the definition. Mr W. H . IEVINB - Do not lawyers follow an avocation?",109

On day-labour works, the Commonwealth employs mechanics, artisans, and labourers of all kinds. These workmen are associated together in organizations throughout Australia. I have no doubt that there are at least fifty or sixty organizations which group some classes of these workmen together. One of these very matters was raised in the judgment given in the case of the Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen's Association. What is their position ? There are a few stationary engine-drivers connected with various industries in the Commonwealth, and with various works being carried on by the Commonwealth Government. At the works in Canberra, and along the railway route, there are certain stationary engines operating cranes and machinery. It is necessary for us to see whether the workmen could be grouped together in an organization and registered under the Arbitration Act for the purpose of coming within the scope of a measure of this kind. The decision giver, in the Federated case is rather pertinent to the question raised by the Attorney General as to whether the Bar Council of Victoria would come within that category. In deciding what "" in d u s try "" meant, the High Court saidAn industry means an enterprise in which both employers and employees are associated, and does not include the vocation of persons doing a particular kind of work in connection with several different classes of such enterprises. In the case of the Bar Council, gentlemen are engaged not in any particular enterprise, but in dealing from time to time with various enterprises of the Commonwealth as a whole, and some of the litigation with which they are connected could not, I suppose, be brought within the definition of an enterprise. Quite clearly, v therefore, as laid down in the two cases I have cited, the Bar Council could not come within the scope of either the proposed measure or our amendment. Again, there is some difficulty in regard to registerable organizations. There may be a number of organizations covering the same class of workmen. Take the Amalgamated Engineers Society and the Australian Engineers Society. Both of these organizations cannot register at one and the same time under the Arbitratio n Act, for the reason that it contains this provisionThe registrar shall unless in all the circumstances he thinks it undesirable so to do, refuse to register any association as an organization if an organization to which the members of the association might conveniently belong has already been registered. Unfortunately it may be that two organizations existing side by side cannot come within the scope of this proposition, but the persons affected by such organizations must remember that the Labour party are not now putting forward what it conceives to be the ideal conditions. We arc circumscribed by the proposals of the Government and what would be relevant thereto. The proposition we put forward is the best that we can devise within the limits imposed upon us by the action of the Government and the Standing Orders. The line which separates the two engineers' associations is that the Amalgamated Engineers Society is a world-wide organization. It s general rules are framed at a congress held, I think, every seven years, in London. Whilst this centralization certainly gives to the whole body Anstey, throughout Christendom a great deal of Arthur, J.

Owing to the 'noise at the time, it was dimcult for any one to grasp what you actually ruled ; but I think that, in a deliberative assembly of this kind, all honourable members would be only too anxious, on an occasion of this sort, to hear what your .ruling actually was.",115
867,Mr JOSEPH COOE,Unknown,How do you know the honourable member for Illawarra wants to alter his motion? He has not said so himself.,115
868,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Mr Speaker says that is not in accordance with his ruling. I have tried to do my best, in a quiet way, to put the facts before the House. Y o u, sir, said that the motion of dissent was not in accord with your ruHng.",115

871,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I submit that if the honourable member for Illawarra has not statedhis point correctly, good practice will give him an opportunity of doing so; but I have yet to learn that the honourable member has claimed the right to amend his motion to make it in accordance with the facts as they actually took place.

881,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member is entitled to put his motion in his own way. Courtesy should give him that opportunity ; but I do not think he ought to ask you to help him to frame a motion in order to try to demonstrate to the House that you are wrong in the exercise of your duties. That is asking a little too much.,115
882,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"There is really no point of order before the House. All these speeches are irregular. The fact of the matter is that I have given a ruling, and if honourable members did not keep silent while I was giving it , that is not my fault.",115

891,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"After the amendment of the honourable member for Batman was put, sir, I rose to speak on the main question. You nodded to me, but you said that you were compelled, by the closure having been carried, to put the main question. You motioned to me to sit down.

894,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The debate on the motion of dissent wiil be adjourned t ill the next sitting day.,116
895,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I rise, sir, to a question of privilege. I think that, in their cooler moments, honourable members wil l recognise that they possess certain privileges. I u my opinion, certain comments of a disgracef u l character have been made on our debates by the Melbourne Argus, which I have within the past .half-hour read. As representatives of the various divisions in this great Commonwealth, we are entitled to conduct our proceedings without any objectionable, brutal criticism on the part of the editor of the Argus. I apprehend, sir, that it is not necessary for me to read a page of May as to the privileges of honourable members; but, in case some honourable members may not realise what their privileges are, it may be better for me to read a quotation.",116
896,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I rise to order, sir. The standing order relating to a question of privilege readsAn urgent motion directly concerning the privileges of the House shall take precedence of other motions as well as of Orders of the Day. It contemplates a condition of affairs precedent to the Orders of the Day being called on, and may not be interpolated during a discussion in the course of the sitting, unless it can be called urgent, and in some way curbs the privileges of the House. I suggest, sir, that the honourable member cannot raise a question of privilege as to something in a morning newspaper. The matter is not urgent, nor does it affect honourable members in the slightest degree. Unless some discretion is exercised by Mr Speaker, even on matters of privilege, there is nothing to prevent honourable members from rising to privilege in the morning and again at night, and all the time between. I submit that the honourable member for Capricornia is doing nothing but making a speech to call attention to something he has read in a newspaper. He has been making speeches all night, and there is nothing to stop him speaking later. Until he submits a definite motion asserting that the privileges of the House have been curtailed, or injured in some way, and, moreover, unless the motion shows clearly that there is urgency, in the very nature of the case, the honourable member may not proceed as he is doing.",116
897,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I chiim, sir, that the motion I desire to move involves a question of very grave urgency, because it seems to me that the extraordinary comments which I intend to read have had some effect upon honourable members opposite in dealing with a matter under discussion this morning. The ground of urgency is the extraordinary language used by the Argus.",116
898,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"What effect has it had on honourable members ? Mr HIGGS' - Honourable members opposite are taking a course which, I venture to tbink, they would not have taken but for the disgraceful criticism of the actions of honourable members on this side. That is the ground of urgency, sir.",116
899,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"M i g h t I offer a consideration to you, sir, on the point of order?",117
900,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! This is not a matter of urgency suddenly arising, but one which could be very well dealt with, as a question affecting the privileges of the House, on a motion which the honourable member could put on the notice paper. Standing order 283 readsAny member may rise to speak "" to order,"" or upon a inatter of privilege suddenly arising. Standing order 111 readsAn urgent motion directly concerning the privileges of the House shall, take precedence of other motions as well as of Orders of the Day. This point of order was really decided here yesterday, and that decision stands. According to MayBreaches of privileges may be divided into disobedience to general orders or rules of cither House; disobedience to particular orders; indignities offered to the character or proceedings of Parliament; assaults or insults upon members or reflections upon their character or conduct in Parliament, or interference with oflicers of the House in discharge of their duty. It cannot be said that the matter to which the honourable member desires to refer is one which has suddenly arisen during our proceedings.",117

1030,Mr WEST,Unknown,"East Sydney) [11.30 a.m.]. - I want to bring under the notice of the Ministe i of External Affairs, who I regret to see is not present, several questions relating to the administration of the Northern Territory. Some time ago the Department decided to send a battery to a place called Mahranboy, a new t in field. I am informed that the miners on the field are stopped from making any progress because the removal of the ore is very expensive. It is really impossible for them at present to make a living there. That, however, is not the worse feature. A large' quantity of the ore is so poor in quality that it does not pay to shift it from the mine, with I shall the result that it is thrown on to the B mullock heap, and a serious loss is there-by occasioned to the community. On I several occasions I have asked the M in ister to hurry up with the battery, which, as honourable members know, is already promised. A good opportunity is now afforded to the Government to improve the roads in this district. If it is not possible for the Department to expedite the transit of the battery to the district, which is situated about 60 miles from Pine Creek, and if they really mean to do anything to the roads a good opportunity is afforded to them to provide employment for the idle miners. I have been informed by the miners that 'the storekeepers have been very good in deed to them, but, of course, there is a l i m it to that consideration being extended. A part of the battery, I believe, is in Melbourne, and a part is in the Territory. But there seems to be no haste in endeavouring to get the battery up to the Mahranboy mine. There is another matter to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention. A short 'time ago certain gold reserves were proclaimed within the Territory, namely, at Umbrawarra, Yenberrie, and Ferguson. There is a regulation which provides that „ Chinese are not permitted on gold reserves until after a certain period has elapsed. I am informed that these goldfields are now overrun by Chinese, and that it is utterly impossible for white men to go there while the Chinese are in possession. According to the information I have received the Chinese are breaking the law. I ask the Minister to take some steps in this matter, because I am assured that if white men could gain admission to the gold reserves they would be able to make a living. Those persons who have had the opportunity of seeing the districts admit that the mineral reserves deserve some consideration from the Government. The advent of a mining population would, I believe, be the forerunner of the Territory becoming populated. The desire of some persons is to get an opportunity to peacock the best reserves for their own use. Another reason for running down the prospects in the Northern Territory is the fear that its development might involve a reduction in the population of the States. The settlement of people in the Territory is a matter of such great importance that I do not think I need - apologise for delaying honourable members for a few minutes from taking the rest to which they are well entitled. The tin proposition at Mahranboy is, I believe, one of the best tin propositions in the whole of Australia. I am informed by men who have gone there from Sydney that the tin field comprises an area of 25 miles by 8 miles. The shifting of the tin ore costs half a crown per ton per mile. If the Minister were to employ the idle miners in improving the roads it would save a distance of from 4 or 5 miles in the carriage of the ore to the railway. That would be a great consideration for the men out back, because it would mean a saving of 10s. a ton. At present there is thrown on the mullock heap a large amount of ore which, if put through the battery, would produce a very fair return. We ought not, if it can be avoided, to allow this ore to run to waste. If any enterprise would push forward the Territory, certainly it is mining. As honourable members know, miners have been the real pioneers of Australia. natural, of course, for the squatters to peacock the best land. It is the rascality of Governments which has permitted the best reserves in the Territory to be peacocked. Sooner or later the Minister of External Affairs will have to resume some reserves in order to secure proper roads, and to throw open to settlers a bit of good land. To my mind very little has been done by the present Government"" to develop the Territory. On the contrary, everything that has been done has been in the way of butchering those who have made an attempt to settle there. These persons have met with nothing but disappointment. If this treatment is continued they will have to leave or starve. I believe that honourable members on the other side would, if possible, exterminate the white residents because they are jealous that the Territory may Mr West. become a field for those who have a little energy and determination, and a desire to better their conditions by going there. Nothing but poison is poured into the mind of every person who desires to open up the Territory. I hope that my honourable friends opposite will get into a better frame of mind aud deal with this great question in a way which will bring credit to Australia^ and promote the development of the Territory. The inB tention was that as soon as possible after Federation was accomplished some action should be taken in order that this part of Australia should not remain virtually a desert. I shall avail myself of every possible opportunity to impress upon the Government the necessity for taking prompt measures so - that the back door of Australia shall become peopled by persons of our own race.",124
1031,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Adelaide) [11.40 a.m.]. - I desire to bring under the notice of the House replies to some questions which I received from the Postmaster General a few days ago. The questions were as follow:1. Is the Postmaster-General aware that an instruction class for telephone mechanics has been started in Adelaide? 2. Is he also aware that the Deputy Postmaster-General, Adelaide, refuses to recognise same ? 3. Will he ascertain the reason or reasons for the Deputy so acting? The Postmaster-General furnished the following answers:It is 1. Yes. The class for instruction to telephone mechanics was started at Adelaide on the 11th February last. 2. The Deputy Postmaster-General, Adelaide, states that he did not refuse to recognise this class, which is being conducted by officers of the Department in accommodation provided for the class on Departmental premises. 3. Answered by 2. The information I have is that the class was established in Adelaide on the date mentioned, and in accordance with an order which was posted in the Department. The bottom of the notice readsI shall be glad to receive on or before Monday next the names of officers who are willing to conduct one of these classes. The class met on the 11th February, at the first meeting Mr Brooks, of Adelaide, being the instructor. It was convened in the presence of Mr Hill , the assistant engineer for telephone equipment, and in a room measuring 24 feet by 22 feet. It is fitted with benches, and on each bench there ridge for the work to be carried out there. This is the only seating accommodation which is provided for the members of the class, consequently it is most uncomfortable for them, to sit on the benches and 'listen to an instructor. These mechanics recognise that they are not as efficient as they should bo. Now, it is to the advantage of the Department that they should have, efficient rather than inefficient mechanics. meeting of the class, which was held on the 11th February, was attended by no less than eighty-three mechanics. At the meeting on 18th February, there were thirty-seven present, the reduction being explained by the fact that, on that evening, the mechanics were holding a benefit social to one of their esteemed presidents, who is now deceased. On the 25th February, the total number present was 57; on 4th March, it numbered 64; on 11th March, 56; on 18th March, 57; on 25th March, 60; on 1st A p r i l , 45; on 8th A p r i l , 4 1 ; and on 15th A p r i l , 44. will be seen, therefore, that the classes have been well attended throughout.' When they were first established, it was proposed that the instructor should receive a fee of £ 1 ls . per. meeting; but, so far, he has not been paid for his services. Some time ago, a deputation, consisting of one member of the Assistants Association, one from the Lines Branch, one from the Mai l Brancli, and one from the Lettercarriers Branch, waited on the Deputy Postmaster-General in Adelaide. In his reply, that gentleman said that, as a matter of fact, the whole thing was premature, and that he had not given instructions, for the class to be formed. Ye t his reply through the Postmaster-General wasThe Deputy Postmaster-General, Adelaide, states that he did not refuse to recognise this class, which is being conducted by officers of the Department in accommodation provided for the class on departmental premises. Yesterday, I received the following wire in regard to the matter: Location class shifted to Exchange basement to-night, when ' assembled instructor ordered to leave building by foreman's orders. Nothing yet heard from Deputy. I am informed that the Department is experiencing a difficulty in getting telephone attendants, and that it iB even proposed to introduce, men from overseas. That being so, I hope that the Postmasteris a General will look into this complaint, with a view to remedying it at the earliest possible moment. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.52 a.m. (Thursday). The first It",125
