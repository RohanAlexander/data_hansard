2,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I present the restate port of the committee entitled The long road to statehood: report of the inquiry into the federal implications of statehood for the Northern Territory, together with of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",17
3,Mr SLIPPER,COMMITTEES,"On 9 May 2005 the Attorney-General referred to the committee the task of convening a seminar to inquire into recent developments in the Northern Territory on the question of statehood, including any proposals to advance statehood, and emerging issues which may have implications for federal arrangements. Honourable members would be aware that the people of the Northern Territory narrowly rejected a model of statehood at a referendum in 1998. However, many Territorians appear to be in favour of the idea. Statehood is now back on the agenda in the Northern Territory following the announcement of a community focused campaign by the Northern Territory Chief Minister in 2003. The prospect of creating a new state raises a host of unresolved constitutional, policy and administrative sues that may impact on current federal arrangements. These issues include Aboriginal land rights, representation and legislative arrangements, mining and uranium resource issues and national parks and marine protected areas. Unlike the original states, the Northern Territory is subject to the legislative power of the Commonwealth under section 122 of the Australian Constitution. The Territory is represented by two senators in the federal tee parliament in contrast to 12 senators from each original state. The votes of Territorians in national referenda are counted only once in the overall tally, but not counted towards a tally, which is the second criteria for a successful referendum. The Northern Territory is also without certain state-like responsibilities in the areas of uranium mining, land the minutes and some national parks. From 14 to 16 November 2006, the committee held a statehood seminar in Alice Springs and Darwin. The committee had the privilege of hearing from over 60 speakers representing a range of stakeholders in the Territory, including Aboriginal service providers and land councils, Territory and Australian government and opposition parliamentarians, Supreme Court justices, and union and business representatives. I have to say that the committee was quite grateful for their enthusiastic participation in the seminar. The most contentious issues raised at the seminar centred on the representation of the new state in the Australian parliament, the future treatment of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, and the role of the Commonwealth government in assisting the Territory to achieve statehood. Territorians were uncertain of the current position of the Australian government on isNorthern Territory statehood. Historically, the Commonwealth position on statehood has been that it would consider the matter only at the request of the Territory. It was considered that statehood was a domestic matter to be resolved by Territorians alone, with the in-principle support of the Australian government. However, without Commonwealth involvement, the Territory government would not be able to put before its people a model of statehood that contained specific proposals on crucial issues such as the level of representation of the new state the Australian parliament. Any vague model of statehood would be doomed to fail at a referendum. People want details. Without discussions with the Australian government over the nature of the details, there is a strong risk that the issue of statehood will remain unresolved. That is why the committee has recommended that the Australian government update and refine its position on Northern Territory statehood and recommence work on unresolved federal issues. By refreshing its position on statehood, the Commonwealth would assist the Northern Territory in developing further its own position on statehood and allow the Territory government to consult its citizens with more concrete proposals. I would like to thank the members of the committee who worked so conscientiously during the course of the inquiry. Our report is unanimous. On behalf of the committee I would also like to express my great appreciation for the contribution and assistance of Northern Territory Statehood Steering Committee and the Legislative Assembly Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and, in particular, Ms Barbara MCCarthy MLA, who chairs both committees. I would also like to convey my thanks to the staff of the committee secretariat. The report demonstrates the complexity of creating a new state in the Australian Federation and makes one recommendation. I anticipate that this inquiry will assist Territorians in their discussions on statehood and help open up a dialogue between the Territory and Commonwealth governments in discussing the possible way forward on the road to statehood. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",17
4,Mr TOLLNER,COMMITTEES,"I welcome the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled The long road into statehood: report of the inquiry into the federal implications of statehood for the Northern Territory and sincerely hope it does progress statehood for the Northern Territory. As the report points out, it seems an anomaly that the Territory does not have the status of statehood. The Northern Territory is, after all, the historic national stage of the Aboriginal land rights movement, home to some of the key mineral resource regions in the country, a gateway to Asia and a World Heritage environment with a growing and diverse population. The NT faces a lot of state-like issues, but it will surely be a long and winding road to statehood, with no end in sight, unless the representational and legislative arrangements of statehood are dealt with comprehensively, ensuring that the Northern Territory has full and equal rights with the states on all matters. I fully endorse the recommendation of the committee that the Commonwealth needs to take a greater role in assisting the progress of the statehood and in resolving federal issues. These issues are many, and include: repatriation of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act; industrial relations; mining resources, particularly uranium royalties; environment and national parks, including marine protected areas; financial relations; representation; and, legislative arrangements. Equally, I must castigate the Northern Territory Labor government for their lack of action on removing obstacles to statehood and any meaningful consultation with the federal government. They have not progressed the statehood issue since announcing a five-year timetable back in 2003. They have also done little to build a coalition of support for statehood; there are certainly no new approaches to statehood. While the level of bipartisan support for statehood is encouraging-and I congratulate the Minister for Statehood, Syd Stirling, and the shadow minister for statehood, Terry Mills, on their cooperation-its impact has been muted in the wider community. Future arrangements for the land rights act still require clarification from the Territory Labor government, a crucial issue if the way is to be cleared for statehood. I have to express some disappointment, too, at the lack of enthusiasm by the Northern Territory public on the issue of statehood. In the words of the committee, Territorians ‘still have a long way to go before they come to a community decision on whether they want statehood and, if so, on what basis'. Views are diverse and divided. At the 1998 referendum, over 51.3 per cent of the Northern Territory's citizens voted no to statehood. Non-Aboriginal groups supported the proposal, but an estimated 74 per cent of Aboriginals voted no to statehood, and they make up 30 per cent of the NT population. Until we get Aboriginal people onside, statehood is a dead duck. As mentioned, statehood is an issue not just for the Territory to decide; it will require Commonwealth action to prepare the way before statehood can be imposed or voted on in the Northern Territory. Firstly, how is the Commonwealth to accommodate full representational equality? Anything less than a state entitlement of 12 senators and the minimum five MHRs is not equality. I do not think it is acceptable that, if the Territory is to be the seventh state of Australia, we should have any less representation in this place. Secondly, how will the Commonwealth resolve future land rights legislation? Until these two issues are resolved, statehood will not come to pass. I will now deal briefly with the Aboriginal land rights act issue, because its removal from the statehood debate is essential, in my view, or else we will go nowhere. My view is that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 should be repatriated to the Northern Territory as soon as possible, basically in its current provisions, with the Commonwealth installing some safety clauses to guarantee its provisions if it sees fit. The removal of this issue from the statehood debate altogether is essential, or else we will get nowhere. Will land rights be repatriated to the Territory or will that remain under Commonwealth administration? Every Territorian, in particular, Aboriginal Territorians, needs to know the answer to that question before they are asked again whether they should become a state. Finally, I join with the chairman of the committee in thanking all the committee members for their support during this inquiry, and I thank all those people and organisations who gave evidence at our hearings in Canberra, Alice Springs and Darwin. This is a very important issue for the Northern Territory, indeed for all Australians, and those people who participated in the inquiry and seminars have done a great service to Australia. I thank them for their support.",18

9,Mr GARRETT,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"This Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2007 has previously been presented in the House-most recently, almost a year ago to the day, by the member for Grayndler. It comes on a day when a statement released by university economists on climate change, signed by some 75 professors and 271 university economists, says: The Kyoto Protocol represents the first step towards a major international effort to deal with climate change in the long term. The refusal by Australia and the United States to ratify the Kyoto Protocol is undermining global efforts to tackle climate change. The government has in the past not allowed this bill to be debated, notwithstanding that the Kyoto protocol represents the single most significant international instrument concerning dangerous climate change and that, to date, some 173 countries have ratified the protocol. I urge the government to consider this bill. Let us hear the arguments against ratification. Let the Australian public know exactly why the government refuses to contemplate Kyoto. Since this private member's bill was introduced last time, the arguments for ratification have grown stronger not only because more nations have ratified or because the discussions about the next phase of Kyoto have intensified and Australia cannot be a party to the important discussions but also because the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide and in Australia continues to rise. The impacts of climate change are better understood, and for Australia the prospects are dire: drier and hotter summers in the southern and south-western parts of Australia; sea level rises affecting south-east Queensland and Tasmania; salt water incursion into Kakadu; and a range of hazardous and damaging climate change induced impacts across our tourism, agricultural and regional economies. The prospects of up to a quarter of a million climate change refugees worldwide, with wide-ranging effects from the Amazon to the Arctic, make clear the need for concerted international action and cooperation on climate change, of which Kyoto in this phase and post-2012 in the next phase is absolutely central. If passed, this bill requires the Australian government, first, to ratify the protocol within 60 days of commencement of the act and, second, to ensure that Australia meets its greenhouse gas emission targets set out in the protocol. Third, the minister for environment and heritage is required to develop a national climate change action plan setting out a national strategy for meeting our greenhouse emissions targets. Fourth, the minister must establish an annual greenhouse gas inventory and publish the results. Fifth, the minister must additionally develop a framework for participation in the international trading of carbon. This would include emissions trading but also clean development mechanism projects in developing countries. It would ensure that Australia and Australian companies are eligible to directly participate in joint implementation projects under the protocol. Given that the government assures us that Australia is on track to meet our emissions targets, there is no plausible reason for Australia not to ratify the Kyoto protocol today. Participation in other discussions and regional agreements is not inconsistent with ratification of Kyoto but, by remaining outside the protocol, Australia does not have a direct place at the negotiating table for the future of the protocol and neither do Australian companies have direct access to the trading schemes that are part of Kyoto. This is an extraordinary situation, all because of the ideological blinkers of the Howard government. I urge the government to take them off. There has never been any convincing argument offered by this government that Australia will suffer from ratification and the claim that Australia of itself can initiate a new Kyoto is fanciful. That task is being undertaken by nations like Japan and Germany, who are parties to the protocol, as are China, India and members of AP6 other than the US. It is possible to play a constructive role in a number of discussions and agreements in relation to climate change but, by signalling an intention to sign Kyoto, getting a good deal and then subsequently taking a constructive stance on the protocol, Australia's reputation and businesses have been damaged. Companies like Global Renewables have taken their business offshore. Ratification of Kyoto would signal to the world that Australia is serious about addressing climate change. It is not the whole answer to addressing this critical issue but it is central global deliberations on future action to address dangerous climate change. As long as this government maintains an illogical prejudice against the Kyoto protocol, we are lessening our efforts on climate change and reducing our capacity to influence others to that end. I note that Sir Nicolas Stern has said that Australia is ‘seriously damaging' international efforts to fight global warming. He said: ‘Look at Australia. It won't sign the Australia protocol.' I commend this bill to House. (Time expired) Bill read a first time.",20
10,The SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Order! In accordance with standing order 41, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Small Business",21
11,Mrs GASH,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I move: That the House: (1) notes the contribution of small business to regional economies; (2) acknowledges that small, micro businesses employ many people and are worthy of protection against predatory behaviour by conglomerates, including organised trade unions; (3) acknowledges the role small, family-owned businesses play in creating employment opportunities in smaller communities; (4) recognises the disadvantages faced by small business operators in competing against major chains in regional areas; and (5) calls on the Government to take all steps necessary to ensure that small business in Australia remains viable in the face of the many threats confronting small business operators. In New South Wales small business is doing it tough. By small business, I mean those to micro businesses that are run and operated almost exclusively by family members. In regional and rural areas like the electorate of Gilmore these businesses provide a significant level of employment opportunities, whether they hire employees or people are self-employed-businesses like corner shops, plumbers, builders, service industries associated with tourism, cleaning contractors and a host of other activities that the big companies do not touch. They are there because the market catchment of rural and regional areas is far too small to attract operators but, when they do arrive, they have the capacity to devastate the small business sector simply through their sheer commercial power. The small businesses simply cannot compete and, over a long period of time, they eventually wither and die. I am very concerned at the concentration of market advantage that these large conglomerates exercise and their effect on local communities. Not only do they have a huge commercial advantage, but their capacity to purchase huge volumes of commodities at a significantly lower wholesale price means they can sell the products far cheaper. They have the advantage of sinking bucket loads of money into advertising and influencing consumer behaviour. On a volume-to-volume basis, small business is out of the race, and its profit margins reflect that. Small business is disadvantaged in the negotiation of fair rents and basically has to accept what is on offer-again, a cost that comes straight off the bottom line. These businesses deserve protection against unfair, unequal, predatory practices and I do not believe sufficient is being done in that regard. The ACCC needs to be given more power to act and expose these big businesses that are colluding at the expense of small businesses. I include the oil companies in that statement. The Trade Practices Act prevents any business from gaining an advantage over its competitors by engaging in unconscionable conduct or through anticompetitive practices. The government's recent strengthening of the TPA allows small businesses to compete more effectively with large business. The amendments to section 46 will allow the courts clearer scope to determine misuse of market power, including predatory pricing by large business. But I do not believe that the New South Wales government is doing enough to stimulate rural and regional economies, preferring, it seems, to focus on the big Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong-the primary political base of the ALP. New South Wales barely avoided sliding into a technical recession in the December quarter. In the December quarter just gone the growth rate of New South Wales was half that of the national average. The headline of an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday, 18 May 2007 about the New South Wales government said it all: ‘After fifty days, still stuck in first gear'. The article states: The overwhelming feeling in the business sector is that there is a lack of urgency to address many problems facing the state at a time of the electoral cycle when it is possible to make decisions. The greatest urgency for the New South Wales government is to stimulate a bleeding economy, but very little is being done. They just do not care, and the evidence for that is a collapse of the building industry, which takes all those businesses that rely on it downstream. I am reliably informed that an indicator of retail health is radio advertising which, according to the Financial Review, has plummeted in New South Wales. That is because business cannot afford the cost of advertising in the light of falling profit margins. Who feels that the most? It is the mum and dad businesses that are the backbone of our communities, like those in my electorate of Gilmore. It is the role of government to stimulate business activity through fiscal and monetary policy. There is no doubt that the federal government has played its role because we have a buoyant national economy and things could not be better overall. But bring the magnifying glass down to places like Nowra, Ulladulla and Bateman's Bay, which are regional centres in Gilmore, and an entirely different picture emerges. The ALP have been vigorous in protecting union jobs, but they do not care about the major creator of jobs in rural and regional areas and those who employ themselves. We in government need to recognise the significance of the small business sector and their role in the community. We need to take urgent and responsible steps to protect small business from intimidation by big business, big union and big government. Without due protection, they are the real underdogs.",21
12,The SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,Is the motion seconded?,23
13,Mr CADMAN,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,I second the motion.,23
14,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Gilmore. This is an important motion and I agree with many of the comments made by the member for Gilmore, particularly with respect to her concerns that larger conglomerates have a greater concentration of market power and therefore place many small businesses in a vulnerable position, and that should not be tolerated. There is an inherent contradiction in some of the comments made, intentionally or otherwise, by the member for Gilmore. On one hand, she would argue that the federal government has done all it can and refers to the buoyant economy; on the other hand, she says that little has been done to protect businesses from larger businesses. Notwithstanding the rhetoric, it is the case that this government has not been a protector of small businesses. Despite the mantra from many ministers and indeed from government members, there has not been sufficient protection for small businesses to enter the market, to allow them to conduct their business in a way that provides them an opportunity to succeed. Therefore, while I agree with much of what was said by the member for Gilmore, there has to be some blame directed towards a government that has been in power for 11 years. I would understand if this were the first term of the Howard government and a government member wanted to draw to the attention of the executive the failings of a government policy, but this is the fourth term and the 12th year of the government and there is no excuse for the failings-which I am sure the shadow minister for small business will articulate fully soon after I have spoken. It is symptomatic of a tired, out of touch and arrogant government that presumes support of a particular group of people or a particular sector and then really does not do much to attend to their needs. It is as foolish for the coalition to think it can presume overwhelming support from small business proprietors as it would be for Labor to assume that union members would vote for them. That is not the case. The fact is that significant numbers of those two groups, for example, do not vote for one party; they vote for both and it should never be assumed that there is a particular constituency which will, without fail, vote for a particular political party. I believe the government has begun to believe its own rhetoric with respect to the support it has among the small business community. This has been pointed out by the small member for Rankin and others in a number of debates in recent times. When you look at it, you see that small businesses are looking for assistance, but what was the first thing government chose to do with small business when it was elected to power? It was of course to force them to be tax collectors for the goods and services tax. And what did the government do after that? After that it made the business activity statement so complex so as to make businesses very difficult to run. If you own a very small business-the businesses to which the member for Gilmore referred, the mum and dad businesses-the last thing you need is to spend your time weighed down by and buried in red tape having to deal with departments requesting more and more information of you when you are just trying to go about your core business. That is a failing which has not been attended to sufficiently by this government, largely due to the fact that it presumes small businesses vote for it and will continue to vote for it. That is why it was quite interesting to see the results of a recent survey by MYOB software company which showed that no, there was not an overwhelming groundswell of support by small business for the Work Choices legislation. In fact, more people believed they would not employ people as a result of Work Choices than those who said that they would employ people as a result of Work Choices. Indeed, 44 per cent were dissatisfied with the Howard government. This is after 11 years in power. A government member quite rightly puts a number of things to the parliament but the government have failed to attend to those matters. In the term it is all too late. It is symptomatic of government that assumes people will vote for them, that they will have to vote for them. In the end, small businesses, like any other cohort, will make their decisions as individuals and they will not be voting for the Howard government. (Time expired)",23
15,Mr CADMAN,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Mitchell) (12.57 pm)Nowhere is small business more important than in regional and rural Australia, where small businesses comprise the majority of businesses. As it is in Australia, 96 per cent of all businesses are small businesses. It is estimated that 39 per cent of Australia's economic production is generated by the small business sector. Small businesses are vital to Australia's economy. In the 2005-06 financial year, there was a net growth of 25,753 small businesses. This sector is very large, important and significant. The current government has made substantial changes, for instance to the Trade Practices Act, to allow small businesses to compete more fairly against large businesses. The Trade Practices Act amendments are very significant and must be continually monitored because small business can come under threat of large business acting in an unconscionable manner. Some of the amendments to the Trade Practices Act deal with strengthening the operation to allow small business to compete more effectively. The proposed amendments to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act will give courts a clear escape to determine the misuse of power, including predatory pricing by large businesses. Also, we have allowed small businesses-whether they be trucking businesses or farmers-to group together to make a claim against or to negotiate with large businesses for the terms and conditions under which they will sell or supply goods. For instance, recent changes in the budget to capital gains tax giving concessions to small fourth businesses to grow and prosper have been welcomed by small business-that is, a capacity to pass on the benefits of the work and the goodwill of a business to realise it in a fair way. In addition, there have been changes to and standardisation of the definitions of small business. Put simply, a small business is a business with a turnover of less than $2 million per annum. That applies to the capital gains tax and a whole range of other concessions-the goods and services tax, the filling out of the business activity statement and the fringe benefits tax. Unlike what the previous speaker, the member for Gorton, said, the workplace reforms have been welcomed by small business. Where has the growth, represented by over 200,000 additional jobs, and touching on another 300,000 jobs, come from, if not from the small business sector? Small business is now living without fear of reprisal and of having to pay $10,000 a head for employees who make claims for go-away money. That was the situation in the past. Time and again, a claim for payment of goaway money was nothing but a try-on. The protection of basic employee rights is still there in small business. Whether it is in the area of discrimination, long service leave or a range of other factors, those protections still in place, by law, and universallyincluding with respect to the payment of superannuation. The principles that ensure safety in employment are there, but the unfair dismissal aspect for small businesses has been removed. This has been welcomed by employers and employees alike. There has been a change to simplification processes. The threshold for cash accounting processes that businesses can use has been lifted from $50,000 to $75,000, and there is a simpler and fairer workplace relations process. The government has moved to provide skilled workers. In June 2005, approximately 391,000 people were engaged in apprenticeships. When this government came to office, there were fewer than half that number. We have doubled the number of effective apprenticeships and traineeships by applying funds and care to that area. Mr Beazley admitted in 2000 that the Labor Party had never intended to be a small business party, and Mr Rudd made similar statements in 2001. The weekend announcement by the Prime Minister that the Bells Line of Road would be investigated as the site of a new expressway across the Blue Mountains has been welcomed by small business communities in places such as Bathurst, Lithgow and beyond, because they know they will benefit from such a change. Unlike the federal government, there is no vision on the part of the New South Wales government, which has rejected a proposal for a study to establish such a freeway, which would provide access and new opportunities for the people of central western New South Wales. Eric Roozendaal has rejected the proposal. (Time expired)",24
16,Dr EMERSON,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"The inspiration for this private member's motion appears to be an adjournment debate contribution made by the member for Gilmore, who is also the mover of this motion. There are has been a degree of controversy in the last few days about the naming of businesses. I note, for example, that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been criticised for doing so, yet she made it clear in her statement that ‘it is not really about one place'. She went on to say, ‘I certainly don't blame small business.' While we are on that subject, I refer to an adjournment debate contribution by the member for Gilmore in which she did far more than name a particular business. She said: I have been given certain information that suggests that the principals of the franchisors of Bakers Delight engaged in practices that I can only describe as not only dishonest but possibly criminal. She went on to say that ‘there may have been breaches of criminal law'. She spoke of the ‘orchestrated robbery' of a person's business by the franchisors of Bakers Delight. Further, she went on to say: It is totally unacceptable that any small business can be subjected to intimidation, commercial or criminal, without recourse to some form of effective protection. It is totally unacceptable that an organisation that engages in practices such as these is allowed to continue trading. She went on to say that ‘this government must intervene on behalf of all small businesses'. I do not think you can get a more blatant example of a government member naming businesses and, in fact, accusing them of possible criminal behaviour. The member who moved this motion has called on the government to intervene. The government has been in office for 11 years, and we learn in the media that the government is finally going to bring forward some amendments to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. We will have a look at those amendments, but if the member for Gilmore is making criticisms, surely it is the case she is making criticisms of her own government, after 11 years. And those criticisms are valid. Let us understand what this motion is all about. It is about criticising the Howard government for its sloth in not dealing properly with pro-competitive legislation to ensure that there is proper competition amongst big businesses and small businesses and between big and small businesses. So let us not hear anything more about how terrible it is to name a business. Certainly, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not accuse anyone of criminality, of orchestrated robbery or of intimidation. This is extraordinary. The fact is that this government has had a full 11 years in which to do the work that the member, here today in the parliament, is calling upon the government to do. I am very pleased to be able to support this motion. I support the small business community in our country. Almost two million people are small business owners and operators; 750,000 of them employ other people in their businesses and 1.1 million are non-employing small businesses, many of them independent contractors. Certainly, it is a relevant consideration that the Labor leader, Mr Rudd, has appointed a shadow minister for independent contractors, whereas no such government minister exists. Labor has put forward a range of measures that would make life for small business much easier, one of the most striking of which is BAS Easy. Again, it is extraordinary that the previous speaker, the member for Mitchell, who has left the chamber, said in a recent debate that he would not support BAS Easy-a way of making the GST bookkeeping requirements for small business so much easier. It is an option; it is not obligatory. But if the government was fair dinkum about supporting small business, it would deal with that the No. 1 small business paperwork burden-that is, the GST. I welcome the private member's motion, but let us understand the inspiration behind it-the member's discontent with the Howard's government's inaction on competition policy. We look forward to getting the detail of the legislation. But, in the meantime, if the member for Gilmore has a complaint to make, she is obviously making it about her own government.",25
17,Mr HARTSUYKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"It is with great pleasure that I have the opportunity to speak on this motion in relation to small business. A clear contrast is shown between a member who is passionate about small business-who understands small business and realises what small business can do for the community-and the member for Rankin. The position taken by that member is nothing more than an ALP fraud. The ALP, the Australian Labor Party, do not care in the slightest about small business. When you look at the issue of small business, it is not about listening to what they say; it is about observing what they actually do. What is the Labor Party's response to small business? They of course have the ability to create hot air and the obligatory rhetoric. But when you look at what they propose to do, you wonder: ‘How is that going to impact on small business?' I have to say that when I question people in my electorate, they recall the time when Labor was last in power. They certainly recall the negative impact that 21 per cent, 22 per cent and 23 per cent interest rates had on their businesses. They do not look too fondly on Labor's reign in charge of the economy. They remember what high inflation did to the economy. They remember what high unemployment did to their customer base. They are very aware of the contribution that the Australian Labor Party made to small business. When we move forward to 2007 and look at the suite of policies which are going to be embraced by members opposite in pursuit of improving the lot of small business, we see that one would have to go a long way before finding a better example of how out of touch they are than the proposal by the Australian Labor Party to repeal the unfair dismissal legislation. They should answer: ‘In what way does dragging a small business owner down to a tribunal to sit there all day and waste time affect small business? In what way does it improve small business for a small business owner to perhaps have to pay $5,000 go-away money to someone who is shonky or stealing from the business?' That is what the Labor Party are about. The Labor Party are not about supporting the sorts of people who make an organisation strong and help small business to grow. They are about supporting the members or the employees of an organisation who have no interest in that organisation. They are interested in looking after the philanderers and the go-slows. People who are in small business know that it is a very competitive environment, and everybody involved in that small business has to work hard. There is no room for Labor's proposal to wind back the unfair dismissal legislation. There is no room in small business for people who do not have the interests of that small business at heart. It is about time the Labor Party woke up to that fact. It just shows how out of touch they are and how out of touch the member for Rankin is in relation to this matter. When you look at the issue of the Lilac City Motor Inn, you see a family-run small business with hard working people. They have worked very hard to build up the goodwill and the patronage that supports that business. My understanding from reports of the staff is that they are very happy working there. The staff of that institution are very supportive of their employers; it is a good place to work. So what does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition do? She picks a name out of the phone book and decides to trash that business. I can imagine that small business owners must be living in fear that perhaps the Deputy Leader of the Opposition might open the phone book on swimming pool operators and pick one, saying: ‘Yes, X and Y swimming pools; it is time to trash them today. And when we've finished trashing the swimming pool industry, we will turn to another page of the yellow pages.' Mrs Elson-Pick on business day!",26
18,Mr HARTSUYKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Make it pick on business day, as the member for Forde said, with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying: ‘Yes, we could pick another operation-perhaps motor vehicle repairers. Let's pick any motor mechanic out of the phone book, make up some sort of absurd claim and trash and damage their business.' They just do not understand small business. The Labor Party do not understand the fact that it can take a lifetime of work to build a business up, and it can take the Deputy Leader of the Opposition 15 seconds to drag it down again. It is an absolute disgrace. They are a disgrace. They are anti-business, and for them to claim anything else is absolute hypocrisy. The member for Gilmore understands small business and the way in which small business helps to employ people and build stronger communities. The Labor Party's position is a disgrace. This government supports small business. This government gets the settings right to make small business prosper and grow, and I am absolutely supportive of the member for Gilmore and her efforts to get people in her electorate better employment outcomes and to assist businesses to grow. She is a passionate member with small business at heart.",27
19,Ms OWENS,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Parramatta) (1.12 pm)My electorate of Parramatta is a special one. I am sure all members say that, but when it comes to business, it is. It has one of the largest CBDs in the country. But, within a few minutes from that, it also has suburban areas. So, in my electorate of Parramatta, some of the biggest businesses in the country and suburbia live side by side. It is necessary for both the biggest businesses in the country and the smallest ones to flourish in my electorate. We do have some extraordinarily large businesses. We have Coca-Cola, Unilever and Westfield Parramatta, all of which bring an incredible flow of people and business opportunities to the electorate, and they should be well and truly appreciated for that. But, down the road, just a few minutes away we have some very small shopping centres. It is easy to see over time that the power of those large businesses, with their buying power, their ability to cut prices, their marketing dollars and their capacity to seek opportunities elsewhere can slowly suck the life out of some of the smaller centres nearby. I am struck on a daily basis when I visit those centres at how fragile some of those businesses are. They are incredibly fragile. They are affected greatly by some of the smallest changes in economic fortunes, in availability of parking, in bus routes-you name it. The fragility of those businesses is stark, relative to that of the large businesses. I would like to say how incredibly important those small shopping centres are. Their value extends beyond just the transaction between the person buying the tomatoes and the person selling them. Those small shopping centres provide a place where people meet, where on a daily basis they see people who know them, where they can be recognised and where people who may perhaps have no other contact with people whom they know well can feel seen on a daily basis. They form an incredibly important part of community life. And, for many people, they also form part of their memories. The same person who sold them their papers when they were a kid, or the same person whom they perhaps worked for as a child, is still selling them their papers today. You cannot underestimate the value of the community function of those very small shopping centres. One of the speakers on the government side spent quite a bit of time today attacking the state governments on small business regulation. I would like to put on record that the plight of some of our incredibly important small shopping centres in both the cities and the regional areas is so serious that it really does require all three levels of government to take this issue seriously. But today I am in the federal parliament, and I am in the federal opposition, so I am going to talk about federal responsibility. The government has talked for some time about the effectiveness of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in protecting small business. In March 2004, the Senate Economics References Committee brought down a report encouraging the government to amend the Trade Practices Act in favour of protecting small business, but the government is yet to act on that. We have had reports lately that there is a bill to be introduced into the parliament, and we welcome that action, finally; we really do. This is so overdue-it is at least four years overdue-and we really cannot wait any longer. It is sad that, with a government that has been in power for 11 years, all we see today is yet another backbencher calling on the government to do something about this, but it really is well and truly overdue. We on this side of the House welcome the report that the government will amend the market power and unconscionable conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act. We appreciate that the government is finally acting to strengthen competition laws to protect small businesses from large companies that are abusing their market power. But, as I said before, this is coming at least four years too late. It is of course an election year, and we have got very used to the government making a few extra promises every time an election comes around-and we are seeing it once again. But I say again that it is about time this happened, and we really look forward to debating the bill in this House.",28
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Removal of Indigenous Children,29
21,Ms MACKLIN,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I move: That the House: (1) notes that: (a) 26 May marks the tenth anniversary of the Bringing Them Home report, which documented the systematic removal of up to 100,000 indigenous children from their families between 1910 and the 1970s, and its serious, and ongoing pact; (b) the Howard Government's decision not to apologise for this systematic removal has compounded the distress of survivors and held us all back from achieving genuine reconciliation; (c) research subsequent to the report has shown that indigenous children who were removed: (i) were more likely to have been victims of family violence (38 per cent compared to the figure of 23 per cent for the broader indigenous population); (ii) were 2.3 times more likely to experience clinical depression and behavioural difficulties; (iii) had double the rate of both alcohol and other drug use than other indigenous children; and (iv) were more likely to end up in jail; and (d) a recent Urbis Keys Young report commissioned by the Government described the Government's response to date as “poorly coordinated and insufficiently targeted” and also revealed that some Bringing Them Home and Link-Up counsellors are struggling to cope with up to more than 80 clients each, compared with the average caseload of 25 for a mental health worker in mainstream services; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) apologise for past policies and practices that resulted in the systematic and forced removal of indigenous children from their families; and (b) immediately implement measures to address the continuing adverse social, physical and mental health outcomes impacting on the Stolen Generation and subsequent generations. im- When I was growing up, it was almost impossible to find a family that had not been affected, either directly or indirectly, by World War II. Sons, fathers, husbands and brothers had been to war, and many of them did not come back. Many Indigenous children were forcibly removed-or stolenfrom their families. Although there are fewer and fewer members of the stolen generations every day, the profound loss continues to be felt by Indigenous families everywhere across Australia. So much of our childhood is about learning to trust, to depend and to belong. If a child is separated from his or parents, these fragile ties are shattered, and that can have lifelong consequences for that person's well-being. Page upon page of the Bringing them home report tells of children being taken away and left unloved-children who grew up to be adults who themselves did not know how to love. The Bringing them home report was seminal, because it was our first proper attempt, as a nation, to acknowledge the loss felt by Indigenous people. It recognised that this nation needed more than the cold facts about the forced removal of thousands of Indigenous children and babies. We all needed healing. Today, I want to reiterate Labor's commitment to a formal apology, in government, to the stolen generations. It is the just and decent thing to do. An apology is not an empty gesture; it can, I think, be a circuit breaker. If we acknowledge past wrongs and assess honestly and rigorously what needs to be done, we can all move forward-and move forward we must. Just last week Labor announced that, in government, we would make available to members of the stolen generations more than $15 million in funding for Link Up services. I am very pleased to table today a petition from nearly 40,000 Australians calling on the government to close the 17-year gap in Indigenous life expectancy. This petition, organised by Get Up!, demonstrates the enormous support around Australia for closing the gap. I seek leave to table this petition. Leave granted.",29
22,Ms MACKLIN,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Labor has committed to closing this life expectancy gap. From now on we want every single baby born to an Indigenous mother to have the same chance in life as every other Australian child. It is so warming to see that there are so many Australians who stand with us to close that gap. her Just this weekend Labor announced a $260 million comprehensive child and maternal health program for Indigenous mothers and their babies-for early development, family support and literacy and numeracy programs in the early years of a child's life-as our down-payment on meeting this target. We think that, if we are to turn this around, the place to start is with the children who are being born today. I hope that the Prime Minister will join with Labor in committing to closing this gap in life expectancy. In moving forward from the trauma of the stolen generations, I hope we can make our promise to Indigenous children a bipartisan one, because there is no question that support will need to come from both sides of politics if we are to close this gap within a generation.",30
23,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,Is the motion seconded? Ms Annette Ellis-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,30
24,Mr WAKELIN,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter. The federal government is committed to addressing the traumatic legacy of past practices of Indigenous child separation. There is no doubt that these practices represent a tragic part of Australia's history. Viewed from a present day perspective, the government has recognised that these practices were misguided and caused great suffering, and it has established programs to assist those affected to move forward. I quote there from the parliamentary secretary, who was then responding to the Bringing them home report and to the Senate report. As the member for Jagajaga has said, this is a tragic matter and the issues of trust, child separation and all the consequences are very difficult things for a nation to come to terms with, but come to terms with it we must. The government has expressed sincere regret and recognises that pain and hurt. The committee which responded to the Bringing them home report did not produce a consensus report. The majority report of the committee, which was signed by no government member, contained 10 recommendations, of which nine were relevant to the Commonwealth. The government supported either in full or in part five of the nine recommendations. We agree with the committee's first majority recommendation that it is timely for all relevant parties to evaluate the original response to Bringing them home. This is a long standing process. Over that time. I believe we have come a significant distance-not all the distance but a significant distance. It is my sad duty to acknowledge in this place that, as I understand it, the removal of Indigenous children continues today. Statistics available some three or four years ago suggested that Indigenous children are six times more likely to be removed for child welfare reasons and 21 times more likely to be removed for juvenile detention reasons than non-Indigenous children. I am sure there are statistics that update those, but they still highlight the huge challenge that we in this country have, remembering of course that the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families made 54 recommendations. In the time available to me, I acknowledge the government support that has been given to this matter over the past decade. But, in saying that, I think we need to also address the jurisdictional issues which to this day predominantly remain with the states and territories of this Commonwealth. That is by no means attempting to divert the responsibility, but we need to understand that this cooperative effort if we are to make the genuine progress that we must. I conclude by acknowledging the symbolism of the 1967 referendum of 27 May, 40 years ago, and of the Bringing them home report of 10 years ago on the same date. With these issues still very much in front of us, the Weekend Australian stated: While Aboriginals were politically enfranchised, they have been economically disenfranchised. I challenge these ‘voices on the Left of politics,' quoting from the Weekend Australian: … among them the Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd, ALP president, Warren Mundine and former Labor minister Gary Johns, are promoting the cause of responsibility rather than welfare … These are the challenges of practical reconciliation and these are the challenges of where we as a country need to go. I thank the House for the opportunity to make those remarks.",30
25,Mr ANDREN,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Those of us who attended the 10th anniversary of the Bringing them home report-a gathering I was privileged to cohost with other House and Senate colleagues-could only have been impressed by the incredible forbearance of our Aboriginal peoples. Despite the shocking health statistics of life expectancy being no greater now than in the 1920s, despite the bitter disappointments of seeing structures of self-determination and self-governance dismantled, despite the lack of an apology for past practices that separated kids from families and set in train an intergenerational grief-despite all this and more-the Aboriginal peoples of this nation politely seek our understanding of their prior ownership of the land and ask us to support but not dictate their lives and to say sorry. Our health minister tells them to be patient. Tens of thousands of Australians took part in the first Sorry Day in 1998, a year after is a the Bringing them home report was tabled in this parliament. One million people signed the Sorry Book and marched for reconciliation. A year later the journey of healing was launched. There were great expectations. But a decade later there has been no formal apology and two-thirds of the recommendations of Bringing them home have been ignored. Last week the National Heart Foundation of Australia and the Australian Medical Association reported a disturbing lack of access by Indigenous Australians to health programs, which many see as a result of institutionalised racism. It is a health system that still means an Aboriginal child in Australia likely to die before his or her counterpart in Bangladesh dies. The difference in life span between an Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal person is around 20 years. Twenty years ago in Orange I saw how Aboriginal mothers were reluctant to take their kids, many with serious inner ear infections, to a baby health centre because of a deep suspicion, a reluctance to deal with a non-Indigenous health system, however committed the workers. It is still happening, as several reports in the past week show, which underlines the reality that mainstreaming services is not the answer. Specific training and services delivered by communities and a properly funded Aboriginal health service would seem the only way forward to address these terrible statistics. As this motion details, the impact of the removal of children in mental health care is still having enormous social and health impacts several generations down the track. The Urbis Keys Young report into stolen generation mental health services has revealed that many counsellors are struggling with more than 80 clients each, compared with the average case load of 25 for mental health workers in mainstream society. Why has it taken this report, stemming as it did from the stolen generations document a decade ago, to prompt the government into some action on these statistics just last week? The Urbis Keys Young report listed those continuing health and social consequences. The minister has promised 22 extra Link Up places. I learnt this morning that the New South Wales Link Up service has over 200 cases-counselling and family reunion cases-per worker. Has the government even begun to do an audit of the demand for these services? There are 8,000 Indigenous people in New South Wales waiting to go homenot only the victims of the stolen generation but a subsequent generation or more of chilis dren adopted or fostered out. Contrast this with Canada where $4.8 billion has been set aside to meet the aftermath of that country's child removal policies. This includes a truth and reconciliation commission charged with uncovering the whole story of the native Canadian residential school legacy. There is half a billion dollars for a healing foundation to provide proper counselling and parenting programs. And, yes, there will be compensation for every surviving stolen generation child. On top of all that there is a commitment to a national apology after the findings of the truth and reconciliation commission are handed down. Importantly, some compensation has come before the apology. There was no fear that an apology would lead to claims. I apologise to our Indigenous peoples and call on all fair-minded Australians to insist that this vitally symbolic act of acknowledgement of pain and suffering is delivered now and that this nation sets in train a process no less comprehensive than the Canadians' to address the long-term consequences of government policy now and past.",31
26,Mrs ELSON,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion today. Having travelled to many Aboriginal settlements in remote Australia and seen first hand some of the serious issues these isolated communities face, I have a very strong personal interest in Aboriginal health and welfare. In the final sentences of this motion, the member for Jagajaga talks about ‘the continuing adverse social, physical and mental health outcomes' of the so called stolen generation. I am strongly of the opinion that the saddest and single worse ongoing outcome of the national obsession with the notion of a ‘stolen generation' is the reluctance to remove today's Indigenous children from living in situations that place them in extreme danger. There have been many reports about violence, sexual abuse and neglect in Aboriginal communities. We all know it exists. There have been a lot of well documented cases and much political discussion. I myself raised this issue during a grievance debate in 1988. Back then I quoted Courier-Mail journalist Laurie Kavanagh, who at the time had said: ... the community compassion [about this issue] is exactly the same as that which drove past governments to save the lives of mixed-race children, the so-called ‘stolen generation'. I find that and hope any action taken to stop the bashing of innocent Aboriginal women and children today will be seen by future generations for what it is ... community action to protect the innocent. Unfortunately, I do not believe enough action has been taken in the past nine years since to stop the violence and the abuse in Aboriginal communities. Motions like this one that we are debating continue to dwell on perceived past injustices rather than address the concerns of today's Indigenous women and children. The fact is there has been much injustice meted out in the past-and not just in Indigenous communities. In the same time period that the stolen generation was alleged to have taken place, we had boatloads of young English children separated from the only life that they had ever known and sent to Australia. We had a society where the adopting out of babies was forced on unmarried women. These were very different times and society had a very different approach to a whole range of matters. Unfortunately what occurred in Aboriginal communities last century has been viewed this century through a moral prism that assumes the motives of those involved in it were racist. I believe that is plain wrong. Furthermore, the focus has been on the disadvantage that these people suffered by being separated from their families. But there has been little or no focus on the advantages they gained by being removed from what in many cases were very unhealthy and dangerous situations. It is certainly not the claimed members of the stolen generation whose children and grandchildren are the most disadvantaged Indigenous Australians at present; it is those living in remote settlements, not those in cities and regional areas. A report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that in 2002-03 the rates of substantiated reports of child maltreatment in Indigenous communities were, on average, ironic 4.3 times higher than those for nonIndigenous children. In the Northern Territory it was 5.5 times higher. In South Australia it was 6.6 times higher. These are only the substantiated reports. Studies show that, especially in Indigenous communities, the majority of incidences of violence go unreported. This is the issue we should be focusing on-that and the fact that the life expectancy for Indigenous Australians is about 17 years less than for the rest of us. That is an appalling figure, and one we have to collectively work together to address. I know how hard the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mal Brough, is working to address Aboriginal disadvantage. I think he is doing a great job. The government largely had its hands tied in the past, with ATSIC being responsible for these matters. It was a strong decision and the right decision to abolish ATSIC three years ago, and the progress that has been made since is significant. I know the minister is devoting a huge amount of time and resources and taking a holistic approach to addressing issues like housing, health, employment opportunities and changing the culture of violence. He is doing it on a community-by-community basis because he knows that a ‘one size fits all' approach will not work. He is working closely with the state and territory governments because issues like enforcing law and order and providing educational opportunities are largely the responsibility of the states and territories. This is a constructive approach that focuses on genuine assistance-not symbolic gestures or just throwing more money at the problem. Real reconciliation will not be found in saying sorry for something done long ago by well-meaning people. Real reconciliation will not come by providing more services, as this motion calls for, to feed a guilt industry that does not actually help the most disadvantaged Indigenous people. I respectfully suggest to the member for Jagajaga that there are more serious, more pressing and more important issues today when it comes to addressing Aboriginal disadvantage than dwelling on the past-as she does with this motion. Indeed, continuing to do so actually holds back real progress in the Aboriginal community.",32
27,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"Page 48 of the Bringing them home report states: Because [my mother] wasn't educated, the white people were allowed to come in and do whatever they wanted to do-all she did was sign papers. Quite possibly, she didn't even know what she signed ... The biggest hurt, I think, was having my mum chase the welfare car-I'll always remember it-we were looking out the window and mum was running behind us and singing out for us. They locked us in the police cell up here and mum was walking up and down outside the police station and crying and screaming out for us. There was 10 of us. It is with a mixture of both great sorrow and frustration that I rise to speak today on the motion moved by the member for Jagajaga commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Bringing them home report. I commend her for moving this motion. I would also like to commend the remarks made by the member for Calare earlier in this debate. My sorrow is caused by the fact that we as a nation had such dreadfully destructive policies, destroying the families and lives of Indigenous Australians, and impacting on the victims of forced removal. My frustration is at the lack of progress made in the decade since this report was completed. This report brought some promise to those stolen generations. They believed the heart-wrenching stories in this report would help us all to understand. Ten years is a long time and it is a very long time for Indigenous Australians who suffered terribly at the hands of successive Australian governments who sadly perpetuated the policies of forcible removal of children from those families. It is easy for us to forget that real people are living this horrible part of Australia's history every day. For them it is not just an anniversary that comes around every year; for them it is every hour of every day that they live with the consequences of the past. The quote that I read out a moment ago in my view demonstrates the depth of the sorrow, the depth of the trauma. Ten years is also a long time to wait for an apology. The word ‘sorry' costs nothing but is worth everything to those that have been wronged. A formal apology has been given by every other Australian government but not here in this place. I look forward to the not too distant future when a Labor Prime Minister will, hopefully, be in the position to deliver that long overdue apology-an apology we are dedicated to. I am very pleased that we have made that commitment. We need to draw that line in the sand to help those whose lives were ripped apart to move on and to begin healing. The victims of the stolen generation have been working very hard to overcome the problems that they inherited from this policy of forced removal. They are trying to get their lives in order overcome additional levels of social disadvantage that the policy created. When I was first elected to this place some 11 years ago, the inquiry that formed the basis of this report was still conducting hearings and taking evidence. As the inquiry process rolled on, it became very clear that this inquiry was long overdue for our nation as a whole, not just for the victims. Australians of all ethnic backgrounds needed to know the truth about what had happened up until the 1970s. This report dispelled the myth that these were practices from only our early days as a nation. Forced separation of Indigenous Australians from their families had been happening with the full support of governments at the time. This report shone a spotlight on one of the darkest times in our nation's history and it gave non-Indigenous Australians some understanding of this shameful part of our history. In my own experience, seven years ago this month, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, of which I was member, tabled a report into Indigenous health in this chamber. Seven years later we are still seeing the same atrocious problems mentioned in the same newspaper headlines and the same poor health outcomes driven by the same lack of services and funding for Indigenous health. We must move this debate forward. We must act to improve the lot of Indigenous Australians in health, education, employment and in their communities. We must address the generations of social disadvantage that the misguided policies of the past, including the forced removal of children, have created. We must stop the blame game. We must start providing solutions. As a parliament, we must break the cycle of our mistreatment of Indigenous Australians and work with them to to move forward for the benefit of all Australians.",34
28,Mr SLIPPER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"I was chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs when we got the reference for that inquiry, but I was no longer chairman by the time that inquiry reported to the parliament. I was concerned that for a very long period successive governments in Australia were endeavouring to redress the ongoing issue of Indigenous disadvantage by throwing money at the problem. There was far too much emphasis on process rather than on outcomes. I share the concern of the honourable member for Canberra, who has just spoken, that, despite the fact that all sides of politics appreciate that it is simply unacceptable that Indigenous people do not have the same health outcomes or, for that matter, economic outcomes as other Australians, we continue to have this problem in 2007. This government has focused on the issue of practical reconciliation. Our efforts on practical reconciliation have not always been greeted by support from members of the Indigenous community. In referring to the inappropriate process of removing Indigenous children from their homes, I think that we ought to recognise that many of those people who did what we now deem to be completely unacceptable did so for what they believed were the right reasons. We ought not to judge the actions of those people in those days by today's standards. Having said that, what occurred was completely unacceptable. This government does have a proud record in the area of Indigenous affairs. In my view, we have been getting many of the policy fundamentals correct. The honourable member for Canberra is correct when she says that, even though there seems to be the best will in the world, the outcomes that we have seen and continue to see are not what we would always want to achieve. When I was on that inquiry and the member for Canberra was an active participant, I became worried that what was happening so often was that, while huge amounts of money were being spent, we were not achieving the positive outcomes that everyone would want to occur. I am particularly mindful of a visit to Kintore in the Northern Territory. I think the member for Canberra was present at that time. What we saw was enough to make one's hair stand on end. We ought, however, to look at the positives and they are that there is an appreciation that we need more than money to redress Indigenous disadvantage. Indigenous disadvantage in 2007 is an unacceptable situation. But the government has been endeavouring, through the actions of the minister and the department, to improve the situation and I believe that there are some very bright spots on the horizon, some glimmers of hope. People like Noel Pearson, who has indicated great enthusiasm to work with governments generally, are people who have an important leadership role to play in the Indigenous community. I suspect my time is about to expire, but let me say that we must continue to do whatever we can",35
29,The SPEAKER,AVOIDING DANGEROUS CLIMATE,"The member is correct. It being 1.45 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member for Fisher will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed on a future day. NA Club Fogolar Furlan",36
30,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise this afternoon to congratulate Club Fogolar Furlan of Thornbury, in my electorate of Batman, on its approaching 50th birthday. Melbourne's Club Fogolar Furlan's 50 year celebration is a significant milestone and represents its strong community presence and years of achievement. Not only is Melbourne's Club Fogolar Furlan celebrating its 50th anniversary on 21 July; it is also the second-oldest Furlan club in Australia. Since becoming the federal member for Batman, I have enjoyed a good relationship with the Furlan Club and am pleased to say that it is accessible to all local residents. It currently holds daily lunches for senior citizens, local sporting teams use its facilities and it runs a range of cultural events and programs. It is the second-largest club of its kind in the world, with 420 members, primarily made up of local family members, and has two remaining foundation members, Gilbert Martin and Anna Fratta. The 50th anniversary is an achievement that displays the club's dedication to maintaining its cultural heritage originating from the north-eastern Italian region of Friuli. The club formally introduced the oldest game, bocce, to Australia. In the 1980s it also hosted the world bocce championships and has since produced Australian and international bocce champions. I congratulate the club's staff and committees, and the club members on making Melbourne's Club Fogolar Furlan such a success story. I commend the club on its historically strong community involvement and on ensuring that the club is a family-friendly venue. (Time expired) Portugese Millipedes",36
31,Mr HENRY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I wish to talk about millipedes-Portugese millipedes, an introduced species that has been encroaching on our borders since it was first spotted in WA in the 1980s, causing great distress to home and business owners who, at this time each year, are literally under siege. No-one knows for certain how they got here and until now there has been little chance of ridding them from our homes. Generally, they have been restricted to the Perth Hills areas, like Lesmurdie, Kalamunda and Roleystone, but now they can be found across the metropolitan area. According to Mark Widmer from the Department of Agriculture in South Australia, ‘the only way you can eradicate them is broadscale spraying, and you're going to take out every other native invertebrate as well.' That was until Kalamunda resident Joe Italiano from my electorate of Hasluck and his friend Jason Watkins found a very simple solution. They have invented an environmentally friendly solution to eradicate Portugese millipedes. After noticing that millipedes are attracted to light and that there were a lot millipedes in Joe's pool, especially during a full moon, they discovered the solution. They set about inventing a light source which would attract and trap millipedes. They developed a solar-powered trap which attracts the millipedes and kills them in the waterfilled dish below. These traps double as garden lights and are made from recycled plastic. I wish them well with this innovative yet simple solution which above all is environmentally friendly and will assist in eradicating these dreadful pests from homes and businesses in the hills. (Time expired) Western Suburbs Leagues Club, Campbelltown",37
32,Mr HAYES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Saturday, as the patron for Wests Leagues Club Campbelltown, I had the privilege of attending the ninth annual Wests sports council awards. The presentation was not only a recognition of our many fine junior and amateur athletes, but also an opportunity to recognise the contribution of many of those volunteers-coaches, managers, administrators, canteen workers and club people generally-without whose help many of our young people would simply not have a sporting opportunity. I had the honour to present Australian sports achievement awards to four people who were outstanding in their contribution to their respective clubs. Stephen Stewart and Paul Belgre from the Magpies Cricket Club both have in excess of 20 years of service with their clubs and received life membership. Steve has also spent five years as the president of the Wests council. An award went to Narelle Cullen, who has had in excess of 15 years with the Campbelltown district's softball club as well as the Campbelltown City Kangaroos Rugby League Football Club and is a prominent local personality. Another went to Julie Foster, a remarkof able local sportswoman and noted triathlete from the Macarthur Triathlon Club, who not only successfully competed at regional and state levels and also at the national level but has represented this country on a number of occasions. It is only right that we acknowledge the contributions of people who make local sport and competition possible for the children and the youth of my area. (Time expired) Drought Forum in Warragul",37
33,Mr BROADBENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Friday we pulled together farmers and interested people looking at what more we could do after interim EC was declared in the area of south Gippsland and surrounds, particularly the shires of South Gippsland and Baw Baw. We found to our distress, out of that meeting, that many farms were suffering losses of between $150,000 and $250,000-some up to $300,000 for the year. The availability of water was difficultin one area alone $16,000 a month was being spent to bring in 1½ megalitres of water. The pasture availability was at crisis point, and, if I am struggling, it was very difficult to actually sit at the meeting and talk to the farmers and those gathered around about the difficulties they are facing in what is normally one of the most precipitant areas in Victoria. Whilst the government has been generous-some $17 million a week on drought payments to farmers-I have today called on the government to look very closely at full EC for this area of South Gippsland and surrounds. These people are in distress. They are competing unfairly with those who have been declared. I am pleading with this House to consider those people who are under an enormous amount of stress in South Gippsland. Gorton Electorate: Medicare Office",37
34,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The electorate of Gorton does not have a Medicare office. The population explosion in the west of Melbourne has not been matched with an increase in appropriate Commonwealth public services. Medicare is a basic health service and yet there is not one Medicare office in the entire electorate. With the single notable exception of the funding of the Deer Park bypass after a concerted community campaign, the federal government has neglected the needs of Melbourne's expanding western corridor. Areas of my electorate, in particular suburbs like Deer Park and St Albans, have a disproportionate number of elderly residents. These elderly residents remember a time, not that long ago, when they did have access to a Medicare office in their own community at Deer Park. However, that office has been closed. The ideal location for such an office would be the rapidly expanding Watergardens Town Centre, which is quickly becoming the major shopping and transport hub for the outer western suburbs. It is also the centre for one of the fastest-growing corridors anywhere in Australia. Until the government announces plans for a Medicare office in my electorate, voters in the electorate will rightly see the absence of such a basic health facility in their community as a sign of the lack of regard the federal government has for their needs. I hereby table a petition of 3,831 petitioners demanding the government locate such an office in the electorate of Gorton. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the failure of the federal Government to establish a Medicare office in the federal electorate of Gordon. Recognising the rapid expansion in population in the western Melbourne corridor and the associated need for federal government services, your petitioners call on the House to support the establishment of a Medicare office in the federal electorate of Gordon. from 3,831 citizens. Macquarie Electorate: Roads",38
35,Mr BARTLETT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Friday in Bathurst the Prime Minister announced a commitment of $10 million, conditional on a matching commitment from New South Wales, to commence planning for an expressway standard road across the Blue Mountains, probably approximating the Bells Line of Road. This project would be a massive boost for the central west, providing much quicker and safer access to Sydney and injecting a real boost into economic development in that part of the state. Sadly, the state Labor government is refusing to support this proposal, preferring to put party politics ahead of the interests of the central west. Just as disappointing is the deafening silence of federal Labor and its refusal to apply any pressure at all to its counterpart. Clearly Labor is not interested in the benefits this project would bring to the central west of New South Wales. These benefits would be very substantial. I call on the New South Wales government to match the funding from the Australian government so that planning can commence. Australian Football League",38
36,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The Australian Football League has begun an inquiry in Melbourne to investigate why the Melbourne based teams are not enjoying the success that the interstate terms are. It was against that background that I found most curious an article that appeared last week in the Herald Sun in Melbourne which was very critical of the AFL having arranged yesterday's first-grade home and away match here in Canberra between the Western Bulldogs and the Sydney Swans. In fact, the facts really need to be explained clearly to this particular journalist. The Sydney Swans have made a decision to play matches in Canberra for the next three years-a full and total commitment to the code here. They were not paid to come to Canberra from Sydney; they are here for the exposure of the game and the promotion of their code and their brand of football as a means of extending the game. I have to say that the near record crowd yesterday saw a wonderful game-and I have to declare an interest inasmuch as I am a very strong Swans supporter. Having seen the game, I know that the crowd and the hundreds of young children participating beforehand in an Auskick superclinic, which was free to them, really showed a good and proper investment in the extension of the code as a national sport here in the national capital. ACT business and the local community are to be commended for getting behind the extension of AFL as they are doing here state in the ACT. There will be another match in August and I am hopeful that this journalist can come to that game. (Time expired) MCPherson Electorate: Vocational Education",39
37,Mrs MAY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Last Friday evening I had the pleasure of attending the Burleigh Heads Rotary Workplace Excellence and Community Service Awards at Bond University. These awards have become an annual event that continues to grow every year. Bren Milsom, the president of Burleigh Heads Rotary Club, and his team are to be congratulated on developing the awards and encouraging local businesses to nominate their outstanding employees to be recognised for workplace excellence. The awards are also about recognising volunteers undertaking community service with not-forprofit organisations. The range of services provided to the community was outstanding and certainly demonstrated a high commitment by local people to give something back to their communities through volunteering. On the evening a special award was given to an employer-a man who is committed to training young people who are still at school with skills in the building industry. A former teacher himself, Ian Anderson has developed an unusual concept whereby young men and women finish their high school studies at his institute by learning skills in the building trade. It is a remarkable story and one I hope to bring to the attention of our Minister for Vocational and Further Education. The students are building a house-real on-the-job training. The evening was certainly a night to encourage workplace and service excellence in our Gold Coast community. The special guest speaker was Normie Rowe, a man who needed no introduction but who certainly inspired the audience with his speech on sion and love and service to one's community. I hope the awards continue well into future. They are a credit to the Burleigh Heads Rotary Club and the Rotarians who participate in putting the evening together. Keswick and Hampstead Barracks",39
38,Ms KATE ELLIS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I would like to take this opportunity to raise my concerns with a Defence proposal to close a number of barracks in South Australia, including two in my electorate-the Keswick and Hampstead barracks. This has caused a lot of concern within the community, particularly for Lieutenant Colonel Murray Alexander of the Defence Reserves Association and Jock Statton, the president of the South Australian RSL. There are some very real concerns about the impact any such closure would have on recruitment and retention, particularly amongst reservists. Today call on the Minister for Defence to conduct a formal study consulting with all of these stakeholders before any decision is made so that we can all be clear about what the consequences of any such cost-cutting measure would be. Water Recycling",40
39,Mr MCARTHUR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise in favour of the major water recycling project in the Geelong region-the Barwon Water proposal for a water reclamation plant in northern Geelong. I have been supporting this proposition for the past 18 months. This is a Barwon Water proposal to help save water, recycle water and deliver increased water for home use by people of Geelong's northern suburbs. The Shell company has supported this proposal and committed to support recycling water from the Shell refinery plant. The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Turnbull, has been carefully anapas- lysing the proposal from Barwon Water to see if it meets the criteria for funding from the the Australian water fund. Minister Turnbull was so interested in the proposal that he accepted my invitation in January to meet with Barwon Water and Shell officials on site in Corio. This project should go ahead and I strongly support it. I look forward to a final analysis by the government and Minister Turnbull. It is of concern that the federal Labor candidate for Corio has suggested that, under a future Labor government, any federal funding should be tied to Shell's investment and employment arrangements. This is a water recycling initiative and should not be confused with ALP or trade union policies on employment or business investment. It is not clear whether federal Labor support Barwon Water recycling or not. Labor should act I quickly to remove any uncertainty that they would put unreasonable caveats on the funding for this project. Water Recycling",40
40,Mr ALBANESE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Grayndler) (1.59 pm)In April the Leader of the Opposition and I announced our support for $20 million from the Australian water fund for the Shell water recycling project, in partnership with the Victorian state government, which would contribute the same amount, and Shell, which would contribute $24 million. We did that after representation from our candidates for Corio and Corangamite in Geelong. This is a very important project and Labor has been announcing support for practical water projects around the nation. Just last Friday we announced a $40 million commitment to build the pipeline to complete the missing link from the Mardi Dam through to Mangrove Creek Dam on the Central Coast-an $80 million project that will complete the water grid and provide water security for the people of the Central Coast. I call upon the Howard government not just to support rhetoric such as the speech from the member for Corangamite but to support this project. (Time expired)",40

42,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be absent from question time today and tomorrow. He will be in New Zealand on official business. The Minister for Trade will answer questions on his behalf. I also inform the House that the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources will be absent from question time this week. He is hosting the APEC energy ministers meeting in Darwin. The Minister for Trade will answer questions on his behalf. The Minister for the Environment and Water Resources will be absent from question time this week. He is in Alaska attending the international whaling conference. In his absence, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services will answer questions on his behalf. Finally, I inform the House that the Minister for Small Business and Tourism will be absent from question time today. She is addressing the Australian Tourism Expo in Brisbane. In her absence, the Minister for Trade will answer questions on her behalf. NA",41
43,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS," Mr Speaker, could I have the indulgence of the House to advise the House of some arrangements which impact on the sitting of the parliament in relation to the APEC meeting in September?",41
44,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS,I call the Prime Minister.,41
45,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS,"I inform the House that, in partnership with the APEC meeting, there will be five bilateral visits of economic leaders. There will be bilateral visits from President Bush, President Hu Jintao of China and President Putin of the Russian Federation. Those three bilateral visits will all take place in Sydney, the visits from President Hu and President Putin taking place immediately before the APEC meeting and the visit from President Bush immediately afterwards. There will be two other visits of a bilateral kind: one from His Excellency Mr Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, and also a bilateral visit from the Rt Hon. Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada. It is proposed that the sitting of the parliament now scheduled for Monday the 10th will not take place and that the parliament will sit the following day. I have invited the Prime Minister of Japan to address a joint sitting of this parliament. It will be the first time that a Japanese Prime Minister has addressed the parliament. I think it is entirely appropriate. I spoke to him on Thursday about this, and he is greatly honoured at the invitation that has been extended. It is also my intention-and I have already done soto invite the Canadian Prime Minister to address the parliament the following day. This will reciprocate a courtesy extended to me in May of last year, when I had the privilege of being the first Australian Prime Minister since John Curtin in 1944 to address the Canadian parliament. I think those arrangements are entirely appropriate. So the intention is that the parliament will not meet on Monday the 10th, that the bilateral visits of the Prime Minister of Japan and the Prime Minister of Canada will take place here in Canberra on Tuesday the 11th and Wednesday the 12th respectively, with the three other bilateral visits all taking place in Sydney, in and around what will be the most significant gathering of economic leaders that this government-and indeed this nation, more importantly-has ever hosted. I know that all members of the House look forward to the APEC gathering. It is a significant opportunity for the great virtues of this country to be on display to our region, and I know it will be an enormous success.",41
46,Mr RUDD,PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS," Mr Speaker, by way of indulgence, can I add a few words to what the Prime Minister has just said?",42
47,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS,I call the Leader of the Opposition.,42
48,Mr RUDD,PARLIAMENTARY SITTINGS,"On a bipartisan basis, to extend also our support for the Prime Minister's invitation to Shinzo Abe, it is a very important initiative given the history of our two countries over a long period of time. It is a great gesture, one which we support on this side of the House. Also the suggestion that the Canadian Prime Minister will do likewise is welcomed by the Australian Labor Party, as we welcome APEC and the visit to this country by so many foreign heads of government. NA Workplace Relations",42
49,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement on 4 May, in which he said in relation to his changes to Work Choices: The economic circumstances of the firm can be taken into account, the employment opportunities and experience of the individual employee can be taken into account ... Prime Minister, were the changes to Work Choices as explained with those words intended to go into operation on 7 May? Was a different policy announced this morning in media reports on this matter which referred to the fact that in the government's legislation only companies facing a short-term crisis that might send them broke would get a limited exemption? What are the specific circumstances that relate to your exemption under changes to Work Choices? Has the legal definition of those circumstances changed in the last three weeks?",42
50,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The legislation will be introduced this afternoon and there will be an explanatory memorandum provided. Workplace Relations,42
51,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House of the appropriate procedure to be followed with regard to allegations that companies may have unfairly treated their employees? Is the Prime Minister aware of cases where that procedure has not been followed?,42
52,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowper for his question. There is a procedure that should be followed, and that procedure is that, before conclusions are reached and serious allegations made, concerns about alleged mistreatment of workers by businesses should be referred to the Office of Workplace Services-soon to be known as the Workplace Ombudsman-so that those allegations can be investigated. I can certainly confirm that this procedure has been followed in relation to a company called WorkDirections and, hopefully, the investigation by the office will determine whether any mistakes of a dishonest or honest kind have been made. I notice that, in relation to that company, the Leader of the Opposition last Thursday sought to provide an explanation, although that explanation has in recent days been significantly disputed by the previous owner of one of the businesses taken over. These matters will be dealt with in the course of the investigation. Although any conflict between what the Leader of the Opposition said last Thursday and the reality is a matter he has to deal with, I do not seek to add anything other than to make the observation that this issue should be dealt with by the Office of Workplace Services. Can I say that the treatment of this case is in very stark contrast to the treatment of other allegations that have arisen over recent months. I think the most notorious example of a different treatment occurred last week in relation to the Lilac City Motor Inn, owned by two struggling and courageous people, a small business man and woman, Mr and Mrs Doolan. In that case a newspaper reported a story making allegations about the AWA at the Lilac City Motor Inn in Goulburn. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition conducted a doorstop interview and then rang into the John Laws program and said, ‘John, I was ringing about this situation with the Lilac City Motor Inn and the Australian workplace agreement.' Then, over the weekend, we were treated to a denial of the undeniable, with the claim being made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she never attacked the Lilac City Motor Inn. The truth is that she did. The Leader of the Opposition does not escape censure on this matter. The Leader of the Opposition also conducted a doorstop, and he said: I read the report in the Telegraph about the AWA which is being introduced by the HMAA and I think that example, in itself, points to the continuing problems of Mr Howard's unfair industrial relations laws. Through you, Mr Speaker, I make the observation to the Leader of the Opposition that there was no allowance made here for an honest mistake. There was no allowance made here for the fact that there might be a decent explanation for this. We can get an idea of the reaction of the owners of the motel. Bear in mind that this is a couple who started the business only a couple of years ago. They started a small business in a drought affected city and, as a result of the publicity given, fanned and exaggerated by both the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, they have received emails from as far away as Norway. One of the owners of the motel, Don Doolan, said on the Friday night Channel 9 news when he was confronted with the claim by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she was not personally attacking him: By hermeaning the Deputy Leader of the Oppositionsaying she wasn't personally attacking me, well, what was she doing? She's using my motel as an example to get political leverage. Given those words, I say to both the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that there has been a lot of anguish around the kitchen table in the Doolan household over the last few days. This is a couple who started with nothing, who have toiled to build up a small business. They have won the esteem and the affection of their employees and they should not be subject to disgraceful attacks by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We have heard a lot over the past few days about a lot of things, but this issue has nothing to do with modern marriages and it has nothing whatever to do with conflict of interest; it has everything to do with the hypocrisy and the double standards of the Australian Labor Party. Workplace Relations",42
53,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that a mother working in a retail shop under the Victorian Shops Award would currently receive at least 14 days notice of a change in her roster? Prime Minister, if that hard working mother were today offered an Australian workplace agreement, couldn't that award condition be stripped away from her, despite your changes to Work Choices? Prime Minister, is it fair for a mother who needs to arrange child care to be subject to sudden roster changes?",43
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say in reply to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I have grown accustomed to checking the facts of anything put to me by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and in this case I will do the same thing. I would invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to extend her concern about those mothers to the mothers who are involved in running small businesses like motels. The opposition might also extend it to any mothers who might have been caught up in the attack that was made on 9 October last year on Martin Donnelly Electrical Services, a local small business electrical outfit in Queanbeyan, when the Leader of the Opposition and her predecessor as spokesman on industrial relations matters conducted a press conference at the site of the new Prime Minister and Cabinet office building, at which they alleged that the workers were being forced onto AWAs which slashed wages. They did not ask any questions. They did not go to the Office of Workplace Services. They did not allow for some kind of honest mistake. The then Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth asked questions on this matter in question time. In particular, the member for Perth alleged that the AWAs removed a range of allowances for overtime and bonuses and all sorts of other things. On that occasion I said I would examine the matter and on the following day I was able to report to the House that every single allegation made by the member for Perth was completely false-every single allegation, not even an honest mistake. Every single allegation was completely false. I borrow a phrase used by the Treasurer on many occasions. On this issue I say to the Australian Labor Party: thy name is hypocrisy. Taxation",44
55,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of the results of the latest OECD Economic Outlook. What is the importance of taxation policy to ongoing economic management?,44
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. Again, I pay tribute to the work that he does on the coalition finance and treasury committee. He would be aware that the OECD has released its Economic Outlook, providing an assessment of all its member countries, including Australia, over the weekend. The OECD forecasts that growth will pick up in Australia, particularly as climatic conditions emerge from the drought-we hope-and we see the agricultural sector, which has been detracting so much from growth in Australia recently, come back to production again. In addition, the OECD noted that the recent budget included personal income tax cuts, substantial investment in education and increases in childcare subsidies, which the OECD said will enhance the economy's supply potential in the longer term. Certainly, the budget was directed towards improving the supply capacity of the Australian economy in the longer term. One of the things we are finding now, with unemployment at lows which we have not seen for 32 years, is that, rather than having a shortage of jobs for workers, we now have a shortage of workers for jobs. As far as problems go, that is a good problem, but in order to do something about it, we have to increase supply measures. Our most recent tax cuts have dramatically cut tax for people in the range of middle incomes. For example, three years ago if you were on an income of $30,000 you paid tax of $5,172. On 1 July you will pay tax of $2,850-a cut in tax of 45 per cent on that same wage over a period of three years. Who will that attract back into the workforce? It will be people who are earning in the range of $30,000-a lot of part-time workers. They might be married women who have a couple of children at home and want to do a day, two days or three days a week. They are typically the people who are earning around $30,000 and the tax on an income of $30,000 over the last three budgets will have been reduced by 45 per cent. That is what good tax policy does. We will be very interested to see if the Labor Party has a tax policy at the next election because there seems to be a marked reticence from the Labor Party these days on tax matters. Tax is just one of the areas where this government has improved work incentives. It has been a coordinated, concerted effort of balancing the budget, repaying debt, having an independent monetary policy, introducing the GST, cutting company tax, cutting capital gains tax, reforming the waterfront and improving industrial relations. All of those measures have put more people in work than ever before in Australia. It has been a good period also to be in the job recruitment business, under all of these reforms. It has been very good period to be in the job recruitment business. We wish well to those companies that have prospered under coalition economic management. In fact, if it were not for this government, there would not even be a Job Network. It was this government which introduced the Job Network. If it had been for the Labor Party, there would be no Job Network; it would all still be run by the CES. The Labor Party opposed that reform. The Labor Party have opposed all of the substantive reforms, including the establishment of the Job Network, includingMr Wilkie-Where's the workplace management",44
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Member for Swan!,45
58,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On cue, the member for Brian Burke comes in. On cue, he comes into claim credit for the Job Network. When we go back through all of the economic reforms that this government has introduced, including the Job Network, including Work for the Dole, including monetary policy, including industrial relations, including tax reform, including tax cuts, including company tax, the Australian Labor Party voted against all of them. There is no trick in politics in being wise in hindsight, seeing in hindsight what needed to be done. The trick in Australian politics is knowing what has to be done prospectively. That is where the coalition has led all the way, and that is where the Labor Party has lagged all the way. Volunteer Small Equipment Grants",45
59,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to an Audit Office report into the Volunteer Small Equipment Grants program which found that the department's grants recommendations were overruled by the then minister, Larry Anthony. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Audit Office found: The only factor that had a statistically significant a and independent influence on the minister's decision to increase the number of VSEG 2004 Round One grants provided to an electorate was whether the electorate was held by the National Party. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Audit Office's conclusion?",45
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do agree with the Audit Office's conclusions because it found that ministers accepted 99 per cent of departmental recommendations and varied the decision in only one per cent of cases-in other words, the minister changed 120 out of 6,818 recommendations. Ms Macklin-120 rorts!",45
61,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Jagajaga!,45
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ANAO found that overall for these programs the political party holding an electorate did not have a statistically significant independent impact on either average grant size or the success rate applications in electorates. Indeed, the Local Answers program funding actually favoured ALP electorates. Ms Macklin-Just ignore the National Party.",46
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Jagajaga is warned!,46
64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So I am very happy to accept the conclusions of the report and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Workplace Relations,46
65,Mr HENRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister inform the House of the levels of industrial disputation in the building and construction industry? How does this compare to previous levels of industrial disputation? Is the Prime Minister aware of reasons for the reduction? Are there any alternathink tive policies?,46
66,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hasluck, a Western Australian member who knows the importance of peace on the building sites of Perth, as other members know the importance of peace on the building sites of other major capitals. I can tell the House that there has been a dramatic reduction in industrial disputes in building and construction. The September quarter of 2006 showed that 1.6 working days were lost per 1,000 employees, compared to the June quarter of 1996 where a staggering 534 working days were lost per 1,000 employees. This change is a direct result of two things: the general industrial relations law changes the government has made and the specific changes which led to the introduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which flowed from the first royal commission conducted by the Hon. Terry Cole QC. On Tuesday, 15 May, the Master Builders Association suggested that the removal of of the building commission-bear in mind, the dismantling of this commission is declared ALP policy and if the Labor Party is elected it will take away this watchdog, which has brought peace, prosperity, hope and optimism to the building and construction industry all around Australia-if those laws were repealed, would potentially result in higher building costs all around Australia. Today the Financial Review reports: Australia's biggest builder, led by Leighton Holdings chief executive Wal King, have warned Labor leader Kevin Rudd that the ALP's industrial relations policies would be ‘very risky and damaging' to the $50 billion construction industry. To get an idea of who is licking their lips at the prospect of a Labor victory, I need go no further than my copy of the Weekend Australian where you see a photograph of Kevin Reynolds on a sparkling Perth morning having his breakfast reading his Australian-I the West Australian is banned by the Labor Party over there, given current disputes between the state government and the editor of that newspaper-as he looks over all that he hopes one day in future to survey. As the paper says: He can look across the Swan River to the cranes that pepper Perth's exploding CBD, knowing that should Labor win the next federal electorate, his nemesis-the only authority in 20 years to rein in his hardline and volatile union-will be destroyed. In other words, Kevin Reynolds is counting the days to the arrival of that great moment when, according to Greg Combet, the unions will run Australia all over again. Greg Combet gave us a glimpse-perhaps an understated glimpse but a glimpse nonetheless-of the world that would be inherited by people like Kevin Reynolds. Mr Cameron Thompson interjecting",46
67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Blair is warned!,47
68,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us understand that the princes who would hold the power if Labor were to win at the end of the year would not be people like Mr and Mrs Doolan of the Lilac City Motor Inn in drought ravaged Goulburn, two struggling small business operators; it would be the likes of Kevin Reynolds. Kevin Reynolds does not muck about. He is very blunt, he is very open, he is very transparent and he cannot wait until Rudd gets there. He is desperate for a change of government and on Saturday he had this to say: “I live for the day when (the ABCC staff) all working at Hungry Jack's or Fast Eddy's or Kentucky Fried Chicken.” MCDonald told The Australian recently. That is Reynolds's mate. He continued: “That is what's waiting for them. They're all expolicemen and they can go and do whatever excoppers do. I'd suggest that John Lloyd and his matesand Lloyd runs the ABCCwill be unemployed before I will be”. That is the mentality-the payback mentality; the mentality that says when Labor wins, the union bosses run the country again. Greg Combet gave us a glimpse, and people like Kevin Reynolds are starting to fill in the blank spaces. What Kevin Reynolds was saying to the construction industry on Saturday, as he looked at the vista from his luxury apartment overlooking the Swan River in Perth, as he took in the vista of all that once more he will survey, in plain language, was: ‘I can't wait for Labor to be in power again, and once again the unions will be running Australia.' Advertising Campaigns",47
69,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his statement in the parliament last Thursday in relation to the proposed taxpayer funded advertising campaign on climate change, when the Prime Minister said: I repeat what I said yesterday: the government has not approved this campaign. I have not, my department has not and my office has not. Can the Prime Minister confirm whether one advertisement in this non-existent advertising campaign has an elderly lady in it talking about practical responses to climate change while boiling the kettle?",47
70,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can only repeat what I are said: no campaign has been approved. Taxation,47
71,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House how Australian families have benefited by changes to Australia's tax system over the past decade. Treasurer, are you aware of any alternative policies?",47
72,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I can tell him that not only has the government reduced tax-and I gave an example a moment ago to the House of somebody on $30,000 who, over three years, has had a reduction in their tax bill of 45 per cent-but the government, in addition to that, has introduced family tax benefits. So if you happen to be a family with children, you have not only got the benefit of tax cuts but you have got the benefit of family tax payments as well. Let me give the House another example. A family on average weekly ordinary-time earnings, with the second partner working part time for one-third of that amount, in 1996-97 would have had a disposable income of $52,052, in today's dollars. As a result of both tax cuts and family tax benefits, that family will have a real disposable income of $67,151, an increase of 29 per cent in real disposable income. That is your classic family in Australia: one partner, usually the father, is on average weekly ordinary-time earnings; mum has gone back into the workforce for a couple of days a week and is on one-third of average weekly ordinary-time earnings; they have two children, because they have not yet taken up the invitation to have one for the country; and their real disposable income in 2007-08 dollars has increased from $52,052 to $67,151-a 29 per cent increase in real disposable income. As we all know, on 30 June this year, we will be celebrating ‘fundamental injustice day'-the day which the Leader of the Opposition proclaimed as the day which will be written as the fundamental day of injustice of the 20th century, when this government reformed the tax system. As we move downand I am going to move down to ‘fundamental injustice day' over the next 33 days-we are going to look at how ‘fundamental injustice day' has affected Australian families. Well, there is a classic Australian family in 2007-08 dollars, will have had an increase in their real disposable income of 29 per cent. I am asked: are there any other policies? seems to be an open question as to whether the Labor Party can find anything wrong with the tax system, because if they can, they are not saying it, and they are certainly not putting forward a policy for the next election to address it. If Labor will not put their policy out before the election, we are entitled to conclude that it is no vote winner. In fact, if they will not put their policy out before the election, we are entitled to conclude that it can only be moving one way-and that is to the detriment of Australian families. We have evidence of this, because the Labor Party has form. The last tax policy that it put out, for the last election, was going to make families worse off. It was going to make them worse off by taking away the $600 per annum per child family payment. I have previously read to the House one of Australia's great literary works on this subject, The Latham Diaries, which explains who the author was of taking away the $600 payment and what the rationale was. I was a little surprised to read in the Australian on Saturday that The Latham Diaries are contested on this point. I was a little surprised to read the member for Lilley saying of the tax policy in the 2004 election: We did a fantastic job ... The problem was the design flaw that was inserted at the insistence of our previous leader. It did not have anything to do with the member for Lilley! Here he is, dumping on one of Australia's stay-at-home fathers, suggesting that it was all the work of Mark Latham and it had nothing to do with him. He even got up in parliament last Thursday after I raised this in the House-and, by the way, I again tender the names on the front of the tax and better family payment plan: Latham, Crean that, and Swan-and claimed that he had never said that this was not a real payment. So I went back through my file of cuttings and I found in the Australian on 9 September It 2004 a clipping titled ‘$600 will disappear, ALP insists'. It states: ... Mr Swan said the $600-a-child payment was a “fool's gold”. It's not real - it disappears. Oh really? He never claimed it was not real! This is a quote in the Australian on 9 September 2004. Mr Swan interjecting",47

75,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"by saying that he never said it. There it is in the Australian of 9 September 2004; it is in black and white: It's not real - it disappears. You will not get away, the member for Swan, by trying to blame Mark Latham. Mr Swan interjecting",49
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Lilley has been warned. He has continued to interject. He will excuse himself understanding order 94(a). The member for Lilley then left the chamber.,49
77,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,49
78,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, that was real, that little incident there. He was the author of policy. He is now trying to deny it. He tried to mislead the Australian public. He tried to mislead this House. He cannot blame Mr Latham. It was all his own work. It was a bad decision. It was a decision that would have made Australian families worse off. It is no surprise that he is walking away from that tax policy because the people of Australia know that Labor's last tax policy would have left them worse off when it is the coalition that is looking after the families of Australia. Advertising Campaigns",49
79,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I again refer to the Prime Minister's statement in the parliament last Thursday that neither he nor the government had decided on any taxpayer funded advertising campaign relating to climate change. Prime Minister, if the government had not decided on any climate change campaign last Thursday, can the Prime Minister confirm whether these non-existent government advertisements were in production in the first part of last week?",49
80,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct the Leader of the Opposition to exactly what I said last Wednesday or Thursday, and I stand by it. Drought",49
81,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House the importance of public and political support for small businesses struggling with the worse drought on record?,49
82,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hume for his question and recognise his very strong representation not just of those struggling farming families in his electorate of Hume who have sought assistance from the government during this severe drought but all farming families across Australia. It is that timely that we remember that the drought still exists and there are still many people, both from farming families on the land and working families in our regional communities, who are suffering from the worse drought that this country has ever seen. Since 2002-03, we have been very openhanded with our assistance on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia. With the prosperity that this country is enjoying we have been able to ensure that we have given rural communities across Australia the sort of assistance they have needed during the severity of this drought. There has been about $1.6 billion worth of assistance since 2002-03. Despite some recent welcome rains in some parts of Australia, which certainly lifted spirits and lifted opportunities, we need to recognise that this drought still exists and is still having a profound impact on communities across many parts of regional Australia. We should recognise that as a government we have helped not only the farming families and operations in those rural areas but also the businesses that operate in those rural communities. We took a decision in November of last year to extend support to small businesses which could demonstrate that they depend on the farm sector for their existence. We saw it as being a very important measure to assist those businesses that were almost entirely reliant on the farm sector for their business. We should also remember other businesses in regional communities that rely very heavily on the economic strength of their local communities in terms of their viability and their ability to ensure the sustainability of the jobs that they provide in their community. It is very important that politicians, part of their leadership positions, understand just how hard some of these people in small businesses across regional Australia are battling in drought affected local economies to continue to provide those jobs. The member for Hume, who represents the regional centre of Goulburn, would well recognise how hard those businesses are battling away in the face of a very severe drought and the circumstances of a lack of water in the city of Goulburn, and how hard that plays on the minds of those people in that community. When thinking about businesses battling in communities suffering from drought, I was drawn to an article in the Australian newspaper last week. It was headed ‘Hotelier's hell after Gillard's attack' and, of course, it is about the Doolans, who run a motel in Goulburn and are trying to sustain jobs in that small business in the community. They were very unfairly attacked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and have been severely vilified in trying to manage their business and trying to grow the level of employment in their small business in a community that is severely affected by drought. That was very evident from the comments in that article from Nerida Corby, who works for the Doolans. She said: “I am happy to be working here, they are great, they are very nice people. They are just a young family trying to run a business.” They are just a young family trying to run a business and employ people and maintain job opportunities for young people in that community. Ms Corby also said-and this is her most important comment: “If they don't get the business we don't get the jobs.” And they need those jobs, because jobs are scarce in regional communities that are suffering from drought. Whilst the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party as are in the mood to forgive and forget, first off they should apologise to the small businesses they have unfairly vilified in this debate, who are just trying to generate and provide jobs for young people in those regional communities that are suffering from drought. Advertising Campaigns",49
83,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Prime Minister, and it refers to his previous answer, in which he denied that he had approved this taxpayer funded climate change advertising campaign. Did the government sign a contract with a government relations firm to conduct this taxpayer funded climate change advertising campaign back in April, in addition to commissioning Blue Moon Pty Ltd to conduct the market research for that campaign?",50
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I simply refer the Leader of the Opposition again to my earlier answers. Workplace Relations,50
85,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of any changes to the workplace relations system that protects the conditions and entitlements of working Australians? What types of agreements will be covered by any changes, and are there any alternative policies?",50
86,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Ryan for the question, and I note that the unemployment rate in the Ryan electorate is 1.8 per cent. The Australian government will today introduce reforms to the Workplace Relations Act that will provide a stronger safety net for over 7½ million Australian workers on collective agreements and Australian workplace agreements. The new fairness test will be applied to workers with a base salary of less than $75,000, and therefore it is going to cover more than 90 per cent of workers. The fairness test will ensure that workers who trade off benefits like penalty rates, allowances and loadings will receive fair compensation. The starting point for fair compensation is more money. If nonmonetary compensation is agreed between the employer and the employees, it must be of equivalent monetary value or of significant value to the employee. So it is a high hurdle. The fairness test is very similar to the no disadvantage test. However, it is technically different in one significant way: under our laws, annual leave and sick leave are not tradable, as they were under the old laws. This fairness test put in place a higher level of protection for workers than the common law agreements which the Labor Party believe are the cornerstone of their industrial relations policy. Under the fairness test, tralian workplace agreements will be individually and independently assessed for fairness to ensure that people are properly compensated for losing penalty rates, leave loadings and so on. Under the Labor Party's common law contracts, it is left to the employers to undertake the test. When employers undertake such tests, such benchmarks, of course they make mistakes. It is far less likely that you are going to have those sorts of mistakes under an Australian workplace agreement, because we have put in place the mechanism that ensures that the Workplace Authority will test every agreement. We do not know how the Labor Party are going to vote on this bill. The Labor Party are awaiting the instructions of the trade union bosses. On 2 May this year, on The 7.30 Report, Greg Combet said: That is within John Howard's power now. If he is concerned about people losing take-home pay and their penalty rates and their public holiday pay and the like, he controls both houses of Parliament. He could fix that now. So Greg Combet, who has been notably absent in the last few days, has already instructed the Labor Party to support the fairness test. This fairness test increases and improves the safety net for Australian workers. I would expect that the Labor Party would support that. But, given their history on this, they are hypocrites. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition pretends she did not criticise the Lilac City Motor Inn when she was on the John Laws program. In fact, she rang old John Laws to expressly criticise that hard working family business. The Labor Party are hypocrites when it comes to industrial relations, because all of their policy, all of their work and all of their deeds are written by the trade union bosses. Advertising Campaigns",51
87,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Prime Minister. If the govAusernment has not approved a taxpayer funded television advertising campaign, can the Prime Minister confirm that Mr Richard Davies, the senior communications adviser from the Prime Minister's own department, is the confirmed contact for that advertising campaign?",51
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I can confirm is the letter, the substance, the spirit and the totality of the answer I gave last week. Skilled Migration",52
89,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Would the minister advise the House on how Australian companies are using 457 visas to continue to build their businesses to the benefit of the Australian economy? Are there any alternative policies?,52
90,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I can report to him that, with a national unemployment rate of 4.4 per cent, there have been resultant shortages, particularly of temporary skilled workers, in some industries. That is why the 457 temporary skilled visa program is important. This program provides for skills assessment requirements. It also provides for a minimum salary requirement of $41,850, or the relevant industrial standard, whichever is the higher. In today's Australian I read that there was support by one of the leading Job Network providers in Australia for this program. This leading Job Network provider was quoted in today's Australian as saying: What Australian employers are telling us, particularly out of the coal industry, is they are screaming for skilled people-highly skilled peopleand the coal industry in Germany is winding down. So there are many people in Germany who are very skilled, who use the same kind of equipment that the Australian coal industry uses, who are out of work or about to be out of work and ‘there is demand here that cannot be met, despite repeated advertising.' This leading Job Network provider went on to say: So we're trying to meet a need and our conditions are that people are paid well. She is right. People on 457 visas are paid well. Indeed, the average annual salary paid to 457 visa holders last year was $70,000. In the mining sector-and reference was made to the coal industry-the average salary last year was $87,000. I ask: who are some of the biggest users of 457 visa programs in Australia? Indeed, the state Labor governments in Queensland and Western Australia have recently entered into 457 labour agreements to sponsor workers in industry sectors which are experiencing workforce shortages. But the greatest user of 457 visas in Australia is none other than the state Department of Health in the Labor state of New South Wales. This is an important visa program for Australia. The government has committed an additional $85.3 million over the next four years to maintain the integrity of this temporary skilled migration program. Employer compliance will be targeted under this program to ensure that if any employers misuse the program then they will be investigated and indeed will face significant additional new penalties. We in government are committed to maintaining a migration program that meets the needs and the interests of the Australian economy. That is, in effect, what the director of this Job Network agency was saying. This is someone, who is very close to the Leader of the Opposition, saying that 457 visas are very important for the future of the Australian economy and, as a consequence of that, also to the jobs of many Australians. It is a great pity that, hypocritically, we have the Australian Labor Party running around seeking to undermine this program. Advertising Campaigns",52
91,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm whether or not the theme of his non-existent taxpayer funded television advertising campaign on climate change is entitled ‘Climate Clever'? Given that the Prime Minister and his government are selfconfessed climate change sceptics, isn't this campaign just a little too clever by half?",52
92,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that it will not be called ‘double standards' out of hypocrisy. I can certainly inform him that, beyond that, I do not have anything to add to the previous answers that I have given. Medicare",53
93,Mr TICEHURST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister update the House how the Howard government's Medicare safety net is helping people with the cost of medical treatment, especially in my electorate of Dobell? Is the minister aware of any policies to cut Medicare expenditure and what is the government's response?",53
94,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Isn't it interesting that the Labor Party never mention bulkbilling anymore. They never mention it anymore because overall bulk-billing figures are at all-time record highs. I know that the member for Dobell will be pleased to know that the GP bulk-billing rate in his electorate has gone up by 19 percentage points since 2003, in part, because there are now 10 more doctors on a full-time equivalent basis than there were in 1996. When bulk-billing figures come out these days, Labor ignore them and instead talk about gap payments. I suppose that is fair enough, because no-one likes high out-of-pocket medical expenses. It is just that this government has a policy to deal with them. It is called the extended Medicare safety net, which Labor want to abolish. We have more hypocrisy, more double standards from the Labor Party. They complain about something and want to abolish the very program that is designed to do something about it. Last year the extended Medicare safety net stood to benefit about 1½ million Australians. Last year Medicare spent $258 million on higher rebates to people who had high health costs. In Dobell, for instance, almost 11,000 people were eligible for higher Medicare payments, thanks to the safety net. In Gellibrand, the seat of the shadow health minister, almost 8,000 people qualified last year for higher medical benefits, thanks to the safety net. In Griffith, the seat of the Leader of the Opposition, more than 15,000 people qualified for higher medical benefits under the safety net. All of those people will have higher Medicare benefits ripped off them if Labor ever gets into government. I want to know why the member for Gellibrand thinks that people in her electorate should lose nearly $2 million in higher Medicare benefits. I want to know why the Leader of the Opposition thinks that people in his electorate should lose nearly $3 million in higher Medicare benefits. I think at least in his case there is an explanation-it is because the Leader of the Opposition is probably one of the few people in this House, certainly there is no-one on this side, who thinks that Medicare spending should be cut. He thinks that Medicare spending should be cut, as he has said before. He will be reminded of this quote day in, day out until he explains himself. He told Jon Faine: ... Well when you look at the amount of money which is wasted in duplication overlap in the health and hospital system ... I believe there is great scope to extract significant savings. He needs to explain himself. When I asked him to explain himself last Thursday, he had a press conference. Good on him for having a press conference. I think he should have another press conference this afternoon. I suspect that questions on health this afternoon would be a welcome distraction from some of the other things he has on his mind. Advertising Campaigns",53
95,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer to his answer to my previous question where he confirmed that a taxpayer funded television advertising campaign does exist. How, Prime Minister, does that statement confirmMr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition is verballing the Prime Minister.",53
96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition has begun to ask a question. I will hear the question.,54
97,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer to the Prime Minister's answer to my previous question when he confirmed that a taxpayer funded advertising campaign on climate change does exist. Prime Minister, how does that square with your assurance to this parliament only last Thursday that neither you, your department, your office or anyone else had authorised such a television advertising campaign on climate change? Prime Minister, have you not now confirmed out of your own mouth that you have misled the parliament?",54
98,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he should not use the words ‘you' or ‘your'. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition, in that question, said that the Prime Minister misled the House. He may only do that by way of substantive motion and the question is out of order.",54
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have said to the Leader of the Opposition that he should not use the words ‘you' or ‘your' in his question. He did not use any words like ‘deliberate'. The question is in order.,54
100,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I can prolong the horseracing language, I think the Leader of the Opposition is pulling up a bit lame on this issue. I again direct the Leader of the Opposition to the answers I have given-the answer I gave last week and the answers I have given today. I do not have anything to add. Older Australians",54
101,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. What financial benefits have older Australians gained under the federal government? Are there any threats to the financial well-being of older Australians?",54
102,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. Since this government came to power we have focused very much on families and older Australians, who have contributed to the well-being and the financial strength of this country. Even though many are now in their retirement years, they still deserve to share in the wealth and the bounty that this country continues to enjoy under a Howard-Costello government. It was one of the earliest commitments that the Treasurer made, back in 1996 I think it was, when he linked the pension to 25 per cent of MATWE, male average total weekly earnings. In practical terms what that now means is that, as a result of that decision, a single aged pensioner today has $66.20 per fortnight more in their pension pay packet than they would have had otherwise had the Labor Party policy continued. For a pensioner couple it is $111.40. That is a tremendous bonus for those families and those couples in their older years. From 20 September this year they can expect a further down payment on what the Commonwealth government has been able to achieve through good economic management. As a result of the halving of the pension taper rates, from 20 September this year a single retiree homeowner could have an additional $177,000 of assets before losing the age pension. Mr Costello-A very good reform.",54
103,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A very good reform, as the Treasurer points out. A couple could have $294,000 of additional assets. These are very practical measures which help our older Australians. Let us just have a look at how much they could earn today before they pay tax. As a result of the senior Australians tax offset these Australians pay no tax up to an annual income for a single person of $25,867 and $43,360 for a pensioner couple. That is as a result of the initiatives of the Howard government and good economic management. That is not unlike the average Australian family. The average Australian family with two children pays no net tax today before $50,800 of income. That is an unbelievable achievement when you consider that, just a short 11 years ago, for every dollar earned over $50,000 they were paying 48½c in the dollar. I am asked if there are any risks to this and if this is under threat. The reality is that you cannot provide the bounty of this nation to our older Australians if you run deficits. The opposition ran deficits on nine out of the 13 occasions they had the opportunity to sit here on the Treasury benches. They continued to run up debt. They did not reward older Australians in this country for the contribution they had made in tougher times to this nation's well-being. I guess you do not think too much about older Australians on those incomes if you really genuinely believe that someone on over $200,000 is a struggler, as the Courier Mail reported on 30 April. The article says: Households earning more than $200,000 a year have been identified as Kevin Rudd's “strugglers” and will carry him to electoral victory. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: what about the pensioners? What about the self-funded retirees? What about the bonus the Howard government has just been able to deliver them so they can also benefit from these measures? I remind the member for Melbourne and all of our senior Australians, as we have not had a clarification at this point, of what he said in this place when last in government: We should have an inheritance tax or some tax of that nature. Mr Costello-Lindsay was big on that.",54
104,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, he was big on that. He continued: We are one of the few major countries that does not have some form of taxation for these circumstancesget thiswhere tax is the most equitable, the most efficient to collect and the least painful for individual taxpayer. That is what you are going to get from a finance minister in a Labor Rudd government. Those are the sorts of beliefs that they hold dearly, not the struggling pensioners who are being rewarded by the good economic management of the Howard-Costello government. Climate Change",55
105,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that after a decade of denial on climate change, he has also sought now to deny the existence of his taxpayer funded advertising campaign on climate change? Prime Minister, is there any chance that Australians will have the existence of this taxpayer funded campaign on climate change confirmed when they receive the Prime Minister's letter and pamphlet in their mailbox and when they start seeing the TV as?",55
106,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for asking me a question about climate change.

We have no intention of embracing a target that is going to do damage to the great coal industry of Australia. I can imagine the impact that the devastation of the industry would have on hundreds of thousands of small businesses, including many thousands of motels dotted around the country, that would be adversely affected. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that when we receive this report it will be made available to the Australian public and it will represent this government approaching the issue of climate change in a methodical and systematic fashion. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: are you ruling that he can talk about anything to do with climate change whatsoever?",56

Although climate change is seen generally as an environmental issue, the character of those decisions will be overwhelmingly economic. It is therefore essential that those decisions be taken by people who have a long-term commitment to the continuing strength and competitiveness of the Australian economy, by a group of people who have a long-term commitment to a flexible industrial relations syson tem, by people who have a long-term commitment to the important role of small business in the Australia community, by a group of people who believe that one of the best things you can do in life is toMr Garrett- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.",57

148,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate ministers: Immigration The humble Petition of the Citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth: That we re affirm our support for the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia which states “Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth…” (Constitution Act 9th July 1900) and the affirmation of 69% of our Australian population that they are Christians, and the statement of one of our founders that “this Commonwealth of Australia from its first stage will be a Christian Commonwealth” (Sir John Downer 1898), and the Opening Prayer of the Parliaments “Almighty God we humbly beseech Thee to vouchsafe Thy blessing upon this Parliament. Direct and prosper our deliberations to the advancement of Thy glory” and recognises the importance of these beliefs in ensuring the ongoing stability and unity of our Christian nation. Your petitioners therefore pray the Parliament of Australia will: 1. Review our Commonwealth Immigration Policy to ensure the priority for Christians from all races and colours, especially from persecuted nations, as both immigrants and refugees. 2. Adopt a ten year moratorium on Muslim immigration, so an assessment can be made on the social and political disharmony currently occurring in the Netherlands, France and the UK, so as to ensure We avoid making the same mistakes; and allow a decade for the Muslim leadership and community in Australia to reassess their situation so as to reject any attempt to establish an Islamic nation within our Australian nation. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Causley (from 9 citizens) by Mr Michael Ferguson (from 12 citizens) by Ms Hall (from 38 citizens) by Mr Hartsuyker (from 63 citizens) by Mrs Hull (from 31 citizens) by Mr Melham (from 24 citizens)  by Mr Ruddock (from 2 citizens) by Mr Schultz (from 9 citizens) by Mr Anthony Smith (from 2 citizens) by Mr Tuckey (from 12 citizens) by Mr Wood (from 1 citizens) Immigration: Asylum Seekers To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the Town of Port Hedland draws to the attention of the House, the current severe accommodation shortage in our town. This shortage has come about as a direct result of the very strong resources boom across the Pilbara and the North West. Your petitioners therefore urgently request the House to draw to the attention of the Minister for Immigration and in turn to the Federal government to the need to use the currently mothballed Port Hedland Detention Centre as residential accommodation. by Mr Burke (from 145 citizens) To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Federal Parliament of Australia assembled: We, the undersigned citizens of Australia, are totally-opposed to any Australian involvement in the development, testing or operation of the United States' Ballistic Missile Defence system. This includes use of facilities in Australian territory for any of these purposes. We request that the Australian government disengages from planned involvement in this system and ensures that the Pine Gap joint communications facility will not be used in the Ballistic Mis- sile Defence System. If this means closing this base, so be it. And your petitioners will in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Edwards (from 60 citizens) Water To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House its objection to send water from the Northern Rivers of the State of New South Wales to Queensland. The petitioners therefore request the House to reject any plans to send water from the Northern Rivers of the State of New South Wales to Queensland. by Mrs Elliot (from 75 citizens) National Capital Authority: Draft Amendment 53 To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the Australian Capital Territory and surrounding areas of the State of New South Wales. Draws to the attention of the House widespread opposition in the Canberra community to the NCA's proposed Amendment 53 in relation to proposed development of the Albert Hall precinct due to: Pine Gap - The failure of the NCA to properly consult with residents, local and national cultural groups, over fundamental changes to the Albert Hall Precinct (Amendment 53) in central Canberra - The failure of the NCA to guarantee existing access by community and cultural groups from the ACT and surrounding areas to the Albert Hall which is Canberra's “Town hall” - The NCA proposal to surround the heritagelisted Albert Hall with inappropriate intensive commercial development The NCA proposal to encourage an eightstorey development in the precinct, on the lakeshore of “Lake Burley Griffin” - The NCA's failure to incorporate the results of a major traffic study into its considerations of the area. Your petitioners therefore request the House to - Require the NCA to withdraw Amendment 53 - Require the NCA to work with the ACT government to guarantee existing access for community and cultural groups to the Albert Hall - Require the NCA to protect and maintain the heritage value of Albert Hall and its precinct and conduct a heritage study of the area. - Require the NCA to consult directly with residents local and national cultural groups about options for any future development of the Albert Hall Precinct - Require the NCA to wait for the traffic study before making changes to Flynn Drive and Commonwealth Avenue. by Ms Annette Ellis (from 3,364 citizens) Airport Development and Aviation Noise Ombudsman Petition to the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: The petition of residents of Australia draws the attention of the House to residents' right to: - want airports to impact less on their quality of life; - complain against how airports affect their quality of life; - have complaints heard fairly, independently and impartially; - see that airport businesses are not above the law. - The petitioners call upon the House to establish an Airport Development and Aviation Noise Ombudsman who will: - investigate residents' complaints fairly and impartially; - communicate with residents promptly and honestly; and - see that airport companies abide by the law by Mr Georganas (from 137 citizens) Commonwealth Dental Scheme To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House, the long dental waiting lists and under funding of our public dental scheme. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to: - Re-introduce the Commonwealth Dental Scheme and restore funding to public dental health; - Reduce waiting times for public dental health services; and - Train more public dentists by Mr Georganas (from 865 citizens) In-Vitro Fertilisation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of the undersigned draws to the attention of the Senate, the significance of IVF in our community, the opportunity that IVF offers to couples who would otherwise never have a family, and that 1 in every 35 babies born in Australia are as a result of IVF treatment. Your petitioners therefore request the House of Representatives ensure no changes are made to current Medicare funding of IVF treatments as proposed by the Howard Government. by Ms Hall (from 8 citizens) Depleted Uranium To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We, citizens of the Shortland Electorate, call on the Federal Government: - To put an end to the purchase and use of all uranium-containing weapons - To allow scientists to freely investigate the human and environmental costs of the use of such weapons Immediately commence an independent study of all civilians in conflict zones and Australian combatants, to investigate the nature and extent of radiation and heavy metal sickness - Grant immediate compensation for all combatants affected by radiation and heavy metal - Commence an immediate clean up at the US, UK, and Australian Governments expense, of all areas contaminated with DU residue - Provide information for the public on the sites where DU was used in Australia prior to 1990, and evidence of subsequent clean up efforts (if any) - Immediately end negotiations over the use of Australian land for weapons testing Your petitioners therefore respectfully request that the House do everything in their power to ensure that the issue of Depleted Uranium is addressed as a matter of urgency by Ms Hall (from 43 citizens) Telstra: Privatisation To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That we object to any sale of the remainder of Telstra as it belongs to the citizens of Australia, and we wish to retain it. - That it is not in the best interests of AustraWe lians to dispose of an asset generating such a vast profit. - That we do not wish to risk overseas ownership. Your petitioners therefore request the House to: Vote against any legislation allowing further sale/privatisation or Private/Public/Partnership (PPP) of Telstra. by Ms Hall (from 16 citizens) The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives. This petition of citizens draws to the attention of the House that the majority of the Australian population believe that the decision about whether or not to terminate a pregnancy should be up to the woman concerned and her doctor. Furthermore, this majority is growing. The majority pro-choice public opinion should, in a democracy, be reflected in the law and government policy. That means: (i) all criminal and other laws that codify/limit abortion access should be repealed, so that abortion is not subject to more restrictions than any other medical procedure; and (ii) abortion services should be made freely available through the public health system, with full Medicare coverage for terminations. Your petitioners, therefore, demand that the House reject any attempt to limit Medicare coverage of abortion. by Mr Kerr (from 319 citizens) Steiglitz Historic Park To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House Of Representatives assembled in Parliament. We, the undersigned, are residents of, and/or visitors to the township of Steiglitz, in Steiglitz Historic Park, which is part of the Brisbane Ranges National Park in Victoria. We deeply lament the closure in November 2005, of The Courthouse, which houses a unique Gold Mining Museum. declare that this event has been to the detriment of this little settlement and a great disappointment to the many tourists who continually flow through the area. We hereby ask The House respectfully, to consider reversing this decision and to restore the associated funding for on-going tourist works here in this township. by Mr MCArthur (from 533 citizens) Drought To the Honourable the Speaker and the Members Abortion of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House the crippling effect that drought has on our nation, the sovereignty of God in matters over which we have no control, such as the provision of rain, and the fact that prayers are already said in this place at the beginning of each sitting of parliament. Your petitioners therefore request the House, during any time that there is a Commonwealth Exceptional Circumstances (EC) declaration of drought in place for any region within the Commonwealth, the following be added to the prayers said under Standing Order 38: “Lord God, we pray that during this period of exceptional circumstance and need, you would send rain on this land”. by Mr Ruddock (from 58 citizens) Dental Health To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. Draws attention of the House of the inadequacy of Dental Health Care which can lead to life threatening diseases. Your petitioners therefore request the House that we, the undersigned, implore you to introduce a National Dental Health Scheme, as a matter of urgency, to be funded by a 1% levy of taxable income, this amount to be added on to the Medicare levy. by Mr Windsor (from 1,080 citizens) Petitions received. PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS Road Accidents",58
149,Mr JOHNSON,PETITIONS,"I move: That the House: (1) recognise the tragic loss of 1,605 lives on our roads in 2006, including 336 in Queensland; (2) recognise that road crashes remain the biggest killer of young Australians aged 16 to 25 and that in any given year, people aged between 18 and 24 are twice as likely to die in road smashes than other drivers; (3) also recognise that researchers at the University of Queensland have calculated that the death and injury from road accidents costs the national economy some $17 billion a year, or the equivalent of 2.3 per cent tralia's gross national income; and (4) commend the Government for extending the AusLink Black Spot program, which has already eliminated some 700 dangerous crash sites in Queensland alone, for a further two years, from 2006-07 to 2007-08, at a cost of $90 million. I am pleased to speak in the parliament today on a very important issue. It essentially concerns the number of road fatalities in the state of Queensland and generally across Australia. Queensland's road fatalities as of last Thursday, 24 May, stood at 144, and we are not even halfway through the 2007 calendar year. That figure represents 18 more than at the same time last year. If this trend continues, Queensland will record its worse annual road toll figures since 1997, when 360 people were tragically killed. We will be seeing death figures around the 400 mark if this trend continues. This is terribly sad and a shocking probability. University of Queensland research contends that, on average, every death and injury on our roads has an impact on at least 10 other people, including family members, friends and the wider community. In 2006, the state of Queensland suffered its worse road toll in 10 years, with 337 fatalities. For the benefit of the House, I will give the figures from the previous years. In 2005 there were 328 fatalities; in 2004, there were 311; in 2003, 310; in 2002, 322; in 2001, 324; and in 2000, 317 Australians were tragically killed on Queensland roads. The national figure in 2006 was well in excess of 1,0001,605 Australians lost their lives on our roads. My own federal electorate of Ryan has experienced the trauma of its own residents being killed in road fatalities. Last December, the tragic deaths of two young Australians, Daniel and Toby East, two brothers of Ausfrom Pinjarra Hills in the beautiful western suburbs of Ryan, touched the electorate in a way that I have not seen during my time in the area and certainly not while I have been the federal member. These two young students had a full and rich life ahead of themtwo lives that gave so much joy to their family, loved ones and friends. Every life is precious, but all of us will perhaps feel especially sad when we consider that road crashes remain the biggest killer young Australians aged between 16 and 25. Each year in Australia about 300 young men and 80 young women aged under 25 die in car crashes, out of a national road toll of around 1,600. This means that in any given year Australians aged between 18 and 24 are twice as likely to die in road accidents as drivers in any other age group. Per kilometre driven, the death rate of drivers aged under 25 is more than four times that of drivers aged between 25 and 54. I do not believe there is one single solution but rather that we must implement a suite of measures to bring down the number of fatal road accidents. The Australian government's AusLink Black Spot Program is an initiative that is certainly making pact on keeping down road fatalities. The program is a great example of the practical way in which the federal government is working to reduce the road toll and is addressing the problem at the local level, on local streets and at local intersections. I understand a statewide online survey conducted by the RACQ in February last year of more than 10,000 Queensland drivers found that the most preferred options for cutting the road toll were identifying or ing potential road and traffic hazards, with which 99 per cent of respondents agreed, and fixing black spots with known crash histories, with which 99 per cent of respondents also agreed. The AusLink Black Spot Program is now in its 11th year. Since 1996 it has eliminated some 750 dangerous crash sites in Queensland through more than $97.6 million of federal funding. The Black Spot Program has been extended by the Howard government for a further two years at a cost of $90 million. The Ryan electorate will share in these funds, with $287,000 allocated to fix the traffic signals at the intersection of Westminster of Road and Clarence Road at Indooroopilly. Anyone who knows the local roads of Indooroopilly will realise that this intersection is in desperate need of upgrade. Ryan has benefited in the past and I hope that it will continue to benefit from this worthwhile program. Another initiative that I believe will have a long-term impact is the introduction of compulsory defensive driving courses for all new drivers. Last year I called for defensive driving courses to be made compulsory for new drivers during the licence application process. The incredible feedback I got from Ryan mums and dads was overwhelming.

150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Cameron Thompson-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,63
151,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,PETITIONS,"I rise this afternoon as the shadow minister for transport, roads and tourism to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Ryan. I note that, while there is a long-term trend in reducing the loss of lives on Australian roads, we are still a long way from achieving our 2010 fixtarget of 40 per cent below the 1999 benchmark. Most concerning is the fact that since the end of 2004 a substantial gap has opened between actual and required outcomes. In fact, in the 2006 reporting year road deaths were 2.5 per cent higher than in the previous year even though they were down almost 15 per cent compared with 1999. Sadly, in Tasmania we have achieved no gains since 1999. On an international basis, Australia ranks 11th out of 26 nations in terms of road deaths per 100,000 population. I think we would all agree that, while we perform better than the OECD median, this is not good enough. National improvements in the number of road fatalities since 1999 have been concentrated in three areas: vehicle occupants in multivehicle crashes, pedestrians and cyclists. Since 2002 there has been a marked decrease in the number of road deaths involving articulated trucks. Despite the fact that the number of kilometres travelled by articulated trucks increased by 13 per cent between 2000 and 2005, the number of fatalities and fatal crashes involving articulated trucks tually decreased by 19 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. These are very important achievements because, in coping with Australia's rapidly growing freight task, heavy vehicle travel will be the major component of total growth in vehicle travel over the next decade. Consequently, we must continue to focus on ways to reduce heavy vehicle related road trauma, including reducing heavy vehicle aggressivity, exposure and crash risk, and improving light vehicle crashworthiness. As the member for Ryan noted in his motion, the AusLink Black Spot Program is a very important Australian government initiative aimed at reducing road trauma-and it has the federal Labor Party's support. In government, the Labor Party would retain the Black Spot Program. I welcome its continuation with increased funding until 2014, the end of the AusLink 2 period. I note that the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics is currently evaluating the success of the program to date. I look forward to seeing that report in the near future because it is essential that the program be targeted to achieve the best possible national road safety outcomes. I say that because the Black Spot Program is too important to be abused in the same way that we have seen the Howard government's abuse of the AusLink Strategic Regional Program in the lead-up to the last election and over the last few weeks. Ignoring departmental guidelines and eligibility criteria, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has over the last two weeks doled out $250 million, based on electoral map considerations of where road funding should go rather than on proper transport criteria, including road safety issues. Since the budget, the minister has showered largesse on safe and marginal coalition seats, acspending $205 million or more than 80 per cent of the total fund on 72 projects in just 30 coalition seats. By contrast, 10 projects in six Labor electorates received only $27 million or about five per cent of the total fund. I am hopeful, given the seriousness of its objectives, that we can keep the Black Spot Program away from political considerations and guarantee it ongoing transparency and honesty in decision making. Based on the previous BTRE evaluation in 2001 of the first three years of the program, it is estimated that from 1996 to 1999 the program generated $1.3 billion NPV and a benefit-cost ratio of 14. The evaluation showed that greater benefits accrued in urban areas and that certain engineering treatments were more successful than others. Roundabouts were highly successful in improving safety in both capital cities and regional areas. It also showed that the use of traffic lights, medians, non-skid surfaces and traffic islands on approaches were successful. In regional areas, signs and new traffic lights had the most success. By contrast, despite its popularity as a treatment, there was no evidence that sealing road shoulders in cities had any significant impact on road safety. Hopefully, the lessons learned from the BTRE evaluation have been applied over the last few years to deliver even better results from the Black Spot Program. I commend the motion to the House.",63
152,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,PETITIONS,"It is a pleasure to speak in this debate today and to congratulate my colleague the member for Ryan for raising this matter. He is a strong campaigner on road safety issues in his electorate. I know he has taken a very strong stand in the campaign against hooning, something that I think he really does deserve some credit for. It is good that he proceeds with that, because I know that there is a lot of concern in the community about people behaving badly on the roads and the risks that that creates for dents. My congratulations and support go to the member for Ryan on his steps in that regard. Today we are speaking about the Black Spot Program. In the electorate of Blair, we have had quite a lot of success in attracting road funding for black spot projects. The Commonwealth funding for these projects has been well received in our area and it has certainly been of assistance. I would like to speak about some of the projects that have been funded under the Black Spot Program, in particular a couple of recent announcements. One involves a project outside the Brassalls Shopping Centre at Albion Street and Workshops Street which is being funded to the tune of $113,000 by the Commonwealth. That was just announced late last week. I saw the local councillor at the weekend and she endorsed that project and said what a good thing it was that the Commonwealth has come to the party on it. I visited the SES at the weekend in the electorate of Blair where there is to be some work at the intersection of Thorn Street and South Street, in the vicinity of the SES-$35,000 is to be allocated there. These projects are allocated according to areas of need. So it is important that we get adequate assessment of the areas of need and the dangers as well as the remedies being proposed when we undertake these projects. There are some very good black spot projects being undertaken in country areas within the electorate of Blair. For example, up near Jimna on the Kilcoy to Murgon road, funding has been received for work on 17 kilometres of that road. It is a windy gravel road and that work is well received. In the area of Brassall, $40,000 is being spent on the Vogel Road and Haig Street intersection. However, I would like to turn to the behaviour of the Queensland Department of resiMain Roads in relation to one particular black spot project-that is, the ill-fated project to modify the signals and lanes at the intersection of East and Limestone Streets. That was a black spot project recommended by the gurus in the state main roads department for which the Commonwealth allocated $300,000. The money was paid in November 2006 and fully acquitted with the Department of Transport and Regional Services in December 2006. Then it was ripped up in March 2007 because it was a total waste of taxpayers' dollars. The main roads department in Queensland and its minister have an appalling record in dealing with traffic difficulties in the Ipswich area. Mr Ripoll interjecting",65
153,Mr CAMERON THOMPSON,PETITIONS,"As we know, and the member for Oxley knows, the proposal for the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway is an absolute travesty, and he continues to cling to that, despite the opprobrium of everyone in his electorate. Here is another example of Main Roads making a total as of themselves with a proposal. They took $300,000 of Commonwealth money and basically produced a project that did not work. It was condemned by everybody locally and laughed at by the city council, and was ripped out three months after it was completed. Now $300,000 would do a lot in black spot funding. It is a very important project and they completely stuffed it up, as they have done with their plans for the upgrade of Ipswich Motorway. It is great that the Commonwealth has funded the Goodna bypass instead.",65
154,Mr RIPOLL,PETITIONS,"I want to start by acknowledging John and Gillian Grant and the 51 club crew who are in the House today. They have come to see our national capital and how the parliament works, and I know they have not been disappointed today. Speaking in this place on road issues is always important, whether they be roads of national importance, state and local roads or black spot funded roads. If you listened this government, you could be excused for thinking that what was returned to us from our taxes for road funding for critical road infrastructure was only by the good grace of this government, and that it was some sort of reward for having voted the right way the last time around, that you might get a few crumbs off the table for urgent road upgrades and safety needs in your area. The motion today from the member for Ryan on road funding has as much credibility as the Prime Minister does when he talks about caring for workers. The reality is that, when it comes to road funding in Queensland, the Howard government has an 11year track record of abysmal neglect. That is the reality. No matter how many times the member for Blair smirks on road issues, it is 11 years of doing nothing-that is the reality. We have barely been provided with enough crumbs for the past decade-plus to keep our struggling federal roadsMr Johnson-Have you read the proposal?",66
155,Mr RIPOLL,PETITIONS,"in a barely safe condition, but now that the polling is going very badly for the government, suddenly we see the massive promise of big money-$2.3 billion, in fact. Mr Johnson interjecting",66
156,Mr RIPOLL,PETITIONS,It is amazing how much road funding can be promised when polling suggests you just might lose some key marginal seats. Mr Johnson interjecting,66
157,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,The member for Ryan is warned!,66
158,Mr RIPOLL,PETITIONS,"Of course, I am referring to the $2.3 billion and the little that has been done for 11 years. If you did the sums-and I will let other people do that-then you would know exactly what I am talking about. to Tragically, even with the plans for the Goodna bypass and other road funding projects, including those for black spots-and we will not hear much about the Goodna bypass from the member for Ryan because he dare not speak those words in his electorate, that is for sure. Mr Cameron Thompson interjecting",66
159,Mr RIPOLL,PETITIONS,"When the time comes for budgets and to actually allocate funding, after 11 years we are still waiting. That is the reality: nothing has actually been delivered yet. Mr Cameron Thompson interjecting",66
160,Mr RIPOLL,PETITIONS,"They are promises for the future, after the next election; not now, not yesterday, not last year but after the next election. Mr Cameron Thompson interjecting",66
161,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,The member for Blair is warned!,66
162,Mr RIPOLL,PETITIONS,"That is a long time to wait and to sit on your hands and do nothing. That is exactly what we are now getting as a further promise from this government. What the members for Blair and Ryan and this government are promising is that they will spend $2.3 billion of your hard-earned money, but they will make you wait another five years at least before you are allowed to use the road they want to provide you-five more years on the Ipswich Motorway, five more years at least in the traffic jams, with the safety issues and everything that we have been waiting for. Mr Cameron Thompson interjecting",66
163,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,The member for Blair has been warned twice and will remove himself understanding order 94(a). The member for Blair then left the chamber.,67
164,Mr RIPOLL,PETITIONS,"It is about time the member for Blair was ejected from this House for not caring about the good people of Blair, Ipswich and the western corridor. As he skulks out of this place, I know they will remember him at election time for the things he has not done. In his own electorate of Blair they have missed out for a very long time and they are still missing out. At least I can say that in Oxley I have delivered the Ipswich Motorway upgrade in my section. Along the Oxley corridor, $600 million was spentMr Johnson interjecting",67
165,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,The member for Ryan will remove himself understanding order 94(a) as well. The member for Ryan then left the chamber.,67
166,Mr RIPOLL,PETITIONS,"not because this government somehow wanted to give that money to people in my electorate but because, after a long time of campaigning by the community, can I say, and by me assisting them, we have delivered that funding, because I wanted that money and I wanted that road upgraded. Members opposite have opposed it and they have gotten exactly what they desired since they were elected: nothing, because they wanted no money to come to the area and that is what they got. If you are a member of the government and you tell your roads minister, ‘I don't want any money to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway in my part of the world' then you will not get any, because that is easy to do. But if you are trying to achieve funding, that is a little bit more complicated. The reality is, if you want a full plan that will deliver roads and infrastructure way beyond 2030, you need to have a complete plan, a full plan. You do not need just one road. I am not a one-road man. I think the Ipswich Motorway upgrade is essential and critical and should be the first cab off the rank, but I also believe you need other roads in the area. You need a road to the south, and that is the extension of the Centenary Highway, through Springfield and the Ripley Valley and back to Ipswich. With it comes a brand new rail corridor and rail, which will do an immense amount for relieving traffic and pressure off the Ipswich Motorway. You also need a proper western bypass-a real one, not a Goodna bypass that was dreamt up by the member for Blair and maybe a couple of his cronies; a real one that is studied and done properly, with a fully accountable and transparent process where the community has some involvement. People will get a choice. They were not given a choice but they will have a choice at the next election in three, four or five months time. I think they will be voting with their feet and telling this government exactly what they think about road funding in Queensland. Bring on the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway. (Time expired)",67
167,Mr ANDERSON,PETITIONS,"I say at the outset that I commend the mover of this motion, who sits immediately behind me, for his efforts in bringing this matter to our attention. I think we are all rightly concerned about the tragic loss of lives on Australian roads despite the very real progress that has been made since road trauma and crisis galvanised the attention of the Australian people back in the early 1970s. Briefly, it is worth making a couple of points of history in relation to our early days in government. One is that in those days we faced a very real budgetary crisis in this country: government outlays were in a mess, government debt was huge and rapidly expanding and we faced real constraints in the early years in relation to road funding. I think it is fair to say that, in my case, I was rather taken aback at how quickly economic growth started to increase the load of the transport task in this country. That immediately highlighted two issues, not just the obvious one of the need to find more money for roads but another issue-that is, despite the fact that we were a century or so into Federation in this country, we had never developed a properly coordinated national transport plan. It had not happened. One of the things that disappoints me a little is that there is precious little recognition, even to this day, that we now have one. We do not run tax policy on the basis of complete ad hocery or political expediency-you do not run health policy on that basis, you do not run a defence policy on that basis and you should not run your transport policy on that basis. AusLink, which was very strongly resisted by the states for a long time, it has to be said, is an integrated, thought-through national transport plan for this country. In the first instance, as evidence of that, it gives us a national highway system which is matched by a national railway system. We have a national highway system because the states do not have adequate interest in national and international connectivity; the federal government does, on behalf of all Australians, and it ought to construct and maintain the national highway system to a high order. But, almost by definition-it is so obvious that it is like the nose on your face; you really should not miss it if you think about it-you need a matching rail network for freight. Under AusLink we secure that. A vital part of road safety in this country is in ensuring that there are no more trucks on the road than makes economic, social or environmental sense. That is why we now have a real federal commitment to operating a national rail network, which over time will take more and more pressure off our roads-not a commitment to operating trains, which governments are no better at doing than they would be at operating trucks. It will make our roads safer, drive the road funding and, I think, produce valuable environmental outcomes. A comment about the subsets of AusLink is that very often, to be quite frank, those of us who are elected to this place need to make sensible decisions about the funding of infrastructure. The truth is that the Roads to Recovery program, which funds local roads everywhere in every council area across Australia, is not only popular but makes common sense, but no BCR model would support it. A benefit-cost ratio conducted by economic gurus in this town would tell you that Roads to Recovery or the FAGs grants for local roads cannot be justified on economic grounds. All of us would recognise what nonsense that is. We might as well say, ‘We're no longer going to kerb and gutter our suburban streets' because I do not think you could make a BCR stack those up either. Common sense tells you that virtually everything we produce, everything we value add, everything we export starts its life on a local road. There is a very powerful case for upgrading local roads. We have brought the crash rate, the accident rate, down dramatically in terms of the distance and kilometres travelled by Australian people over the last 35 years. Better cars, better roads, better training, seatbelts and drink-driving laws and their pursuit have all helped. The reality is: we need to do more. Our road toll is still too high, particularly amongst young men. The Black Spot Program is part of it. I see the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads at the table; I urge him to do whatever is necessary to get the road training trial up for young people. It is now about 2½ years since I committed to doing that. It is time we rolled it out. We must do more to get young people to drive sensibly within their skill It is not simply a question of expanding their skill set; their skill set needs to be observed and recognised.

168,Ms HALL,PETITIONS,"I endorse the words of the previous speaker; there is no issue that is more important. The majority of my contribution to this debate will deal with young people and the need to address the issue of the loss of life of young people on our roads. This motion highlights the impact and the enormous cost to our nation of death and injury caused by road accidents. It also recognises the impact of the Black Spot Program, a fine program that I and members of this House support, and recognises how it has worked to eliminate dangerous crash sites. The biggest cause of death and disability for young people aged 15 to 25 is car accidents. The enormous cost of road accidents involving young people was brought home to me very graphically last week when the son of one of my children's friends was killed in a road accident. A young 18-year-old hopped in a car with a driver who had been drinking-an action that many young people dowent down to the shop to buy something and was dead five minutes after he left home. This highlights the issue of the danger of young people and driving. The World Health Organisation has identified road crashes as the leading cause of death of young people under the age of 25 worldwide. Road traffic collisions cost an estimated $US518 billion worldwide. New South Wales statistics for 2004 for 17to 25year-olds recorded 856 casualties of road traumas and 187 deaths. These young people only hold 15 per cent of the licences but are involved in 28 per cent of the crashes. It is a very sad indictment of the failure by all levels and all persuasions of government. I call on all governments to work together to try set. and solve this problem. Research has shown that we need to look at changing behaviours and, at the same time, put in place laws that are going to prevent young people from losing their lives. Other statistics show that young people account for only 15 per cent of licence holders, but a third of road accidents fall into this group. First-year P-plate holders are four times more likely to be involved in an accident than a driver over the age of 26. Nearly half of all trauma admissions to New South Wales hospitals in 2005 were serious injury road trauma and, of these, 28 per cent were aged 15 to 24. It is very sad to hear about the high level of accidents but it is well reported, and I think members of this House know that. Every year drivers are killed or injured in road traffic accidents. As I have highlighted already, statistics show that this younger group has the highest number of accidents leading to death and disability. Research shows that risk and behaviour education, like the NRMA forums throughout New South Wales",69
169,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member for Shortland will have leave to continue her remarks when the debate is resumed. Education and Skills,69
170,Mr GEORGANAS,PETITIONS,"I move: That the House: (1) recognises that the Federal Government needs to invest in education and improving the skills of Australians to ensure that all dents have the opportunity to complete Year 12 at high school and ensure that they have appropriate entry-level training for their chosen trade or vocation; and (2) condemns the failure of the Government to invest in education and skills for Australia's future, particularly when the commodity boom moderates. It is imperative for the future of Australia and Australia's next generation that we recognise the need to invest in education and improving the skills of Australians. We need to ensure that all students have the opportunity to complete year 12 at high school and/or have the appropriate entry level training for their chosen trade or vocation. The federal government has shown a lack of commitment to investing in the future education and skills of Australians and continues to rely on the mining boom to support our nation's economy. It is common sense that the more you invest in education, skills and training, the more you invest in your country's future. Labor is willing to commit to that investment. It has set goals for Australia's education system that will ensure Australia's economy remains prosperous and productive. We on this side of the House make a commitment to placing training centres in all secondary schools. We make a commitment to providing educational avenues to all young Australians so that they can achieve their best. Not everyone is suited to university and many see their future within the trades sector. Skilling up and learning a trade is something that Labor and I, personally, support. For over a decade Australia's education system has suffered at the hands of this federal government. Our education standards have slumped, and as a result Australia is now in the middle of a skills crisis. Australia no longer has a strong skills base that indusstutry is able to draw on. Unless we educate our young people, Australia does not have a future. The income and prosperity of an individual is often strongly tied to the education and skills that they have obtained over the years. Australia's goal should be to have the most qualified and the most trained workforce in the world. Australia therefore needs to meet two great changes: one, to improve learning at high school level; and, two, to increase the skills of our workforce. There are many schools within my electorate of Hindmarsh that are calling out for a greater emphasis on vocational education within their education program. The Labor Party has given them a solution. That solution is to give these schools the opportunity to obtain funding for trade workshops, computer laboratories and design labs. I am constantly approached by schools that have students who see their future in studies outside the university sector and who are well suited to pursuing future training in the trades sector. As a nation we need to be aware that young people in the many schools in our own neighbourhoods need to be able to make choices that will make them successful and productive members of our society. We need to encourage vocational education and training within schools, thus building a skills base for Australia's future. There is currently no national plan for the future education of Australian students. Labor has made a commitment to increasing retention rates in schools from the current level of 75 per cent to 90 per cent by 2020. In the midst of a skills crisis, Australia needs to look at why young people are not continuing their schooling and not seeking further training or education. It is estimated that 120,000 Australians aged from 18 to 24 who have not completed year 12 are not engaged in the nation's workforce. If these individuals were meaningfully engaged in the workforce, this would go a long way to meeting the estimated skills needed for the next five years. We need to improve our retention rates at schools. We need to give students more opportunities at schools. We need to provide training in skills associated with a particular trade while allowing young people to continue to study and finish high school. Increasing retention rates has the potential to contribute enormously to our economy. Increased retention rates would add $9 billion to Australia's economy by the year 2040. In the future we will face more intense competition from regional trading partners such as China and India. In addition to this, our ageing population will take many of the skills Australia's workforce has today into retirement. Australia needs to invest in the education of its students so that, as a country, we can be competitive in the growing global market. The mining boom the country is currently experiencing will not last forever. That is why it is important that we engage Australia's youth-they are the key to our country's future. As a country, we can no longer deny training opportunities to our young people. Nor can we allow our education system to focus on a ‘one size fits all' policy. A versatile, innovate education policy will ensure our future. That is why Labor is investing in our nation's education and in our country's economic prosperity.",70
171,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Is the motion seconded? Mr Adams-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,71
172,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,PETITIONS,"I rise to speak to the private member's motion moved by the member for Hindmarsh. Investing in education is absolutely essential to improving skills in Australia's workforce. It is all very well for Labor to monotonously attempt to target the Howard government in a political sense over its education policies and track record, but let us just consider the facts. They show that it is the Liberal Party side of politics that is in fact equipped to invest in education in an effective manner and in a way that actually values education and the educational choices of young people. And let us not forget the need to be able to position oneself to be able to make the hard decisions that are necessary for education reform. I would say that one of the Howard government's greatest achievements is to have inspired the Labor Party to show an interest in vocational and further education. We have not heard the Labor Party's policies on vocational education until recent months. In fact I understand that the word ‘vocational' did not even appear in their 2004 election policy. They do not have form on this. They have no interest, except for the fact that it is the Howard government that has recognised that the skills shortage in this country is not simply a skills crisis, as Labor would have us believe, but that it is a skilled labour shortage. It is a problem brought about by having more jobs than there are people to fill them. An outstanding example of a Howard government initiative to boost the trade skills of young Australians is of course the Australian technical colleges. I am not sure that the member for Hindmarsh even mentioned the Australian technical colleges. They are a great success around the nation. They are a new innovation, and they are successful because of the quality of the facilities and the teaching staff and, very importantly, the close guidance and involvement of local industry, which of course knows the needs of industry better than anyone else. Two thousand students across Australia are already benefiting from being able to do their year 11, obtain their year 12 school certificate start an apprenticeship at the same time and, having completed two years at an ATC, to have knocked off the first year of their apprenticeship. The Australian technical college in northern Tasmania, which I anticipate the member for Lyons will unequivocally support in his contribution, which I will remain in the chamber to listen to, is moving ahead in leaps and bounds-much to the contrary, I suspect, of what the Labor Party said would happen. The northern Tasmanian ATC was obstructed, molested and harassed by the Labor Party. They said it would never work. They said that students would not take up the option, that the courses would not be filled and that, in any event, students would not come away with an effective apprenticeship until something like 2012-just lies; just hampering a really good and useful initiative for young people. In fact, the opposite has occurred; there are only 150 places in an Australian technical college in its first year. In the northern manian example, over the Launceston and Burnie campuses, all the courses are full. They have been oversubscribed. That is a great testimony not only to the value of the initiative itself, the policies of the Howard government and the enterprise of former minister Brendan Nelson and the present Minister for Vocational and Further Education, Andrew Robb, in carrying these initiatives through but also to the local initiatives of our industries in northern Tasmania and to the students and the families who have taken their chances with it and are already finding that it is giving them wonderful skills and abilities with which to contribute to the local workforce. It is a great success and it ought to be celebrated. I have to say that, when I spoke to a group of students in my electorate two weeks ago, I was asked a fair question: ‘Why and is it that the Howard government gives more money to private schools than to government schools?' It was similar to the wording in this private member's motion, which is completely prejudicial and based on a lie promoted by the Australian Education Union. It hides the fact that recognition is given to government schools but that equally this government supports choice. In fact, you will find, on average, a government school student-taking into account the total taxpayer contribution-receives double the amount which the average student in a nongovernment school receives. In concluding my remarks I simply again state on record that if we could have a legitimate debate on this issue, if we could have some honesty in politics and if we could have members in this place championing education, they would not say the things they do about the Howard government. (Time expired)",71
173,Mr ADAMS,PETITIONS,"The honourable member for Bass fails to give Tasany credence to the history of the Australian Labor Party support for trade training, which goes right back to the workers institutes that grew out of the railway workshops of Invermay that we would otherwise not have any knowledge of. This motion is to point out the sad state of affairs that exists in vocational education and training today. Despite some half-hearted attempts by the federal government to develop new training places, they have concentrated on bricks and mortar and everything that does not count instead of focusing on courses, encouraging students to take them up by providing incentives to young people and also modernising our trade training and our skill development. There are around one million Australian students in grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 in government, Catholic and independent secondary schools who could benefit from federal Labor's trades training centres in schools program. At the moment, these young people are not being given incentives or encouraged under current programs to continue their education or get into training. Many tertiary courses are just not suitable for young people and there is a need to start earlier to prepare them for the future. Federal Labor has come up with a real education revolution-one that would turbocharge the training and skills of the next generation of Australians. One of the biggest challenges we face in the future is to preserve our prosperity when the once in a lifetime mining boom comes to an end. We need to be able to fill the skills gap, a gap which is holding many of our enterprising firms back as they are unable to find the workers they need in order to grow. Not every Australian kid wants to go to university and this plan responds to their needs. We must ensure that these students are given the best possible education and training so they can develop the skills and education they need to secure the job they want in the future. That means providing real career paths to trades and apprenticeships, real choices and real opportunities. Many of the secondary schools in Tasmania, particularly those in Lyons, now do have some vocational education and training programs, but under the Howard government they have limited access to funds, therefore the programs are not as able to give the outcomes many would want and they have to travel to the cities for further education. Federal Labor's trades training centres in schools program would provide between $500,000 and $1.5 million to secondary schools to build or upgrade trade workshops and information, communications and technology labs; metal or woodwork workshops; commercial kitchens; hairdressing facilities; automotive workshops; plumbing workshops; graphic design laboratories, computer laboratories; and facilities for other trades to meet the day-today needs of employers. This would allow students to train and pick up work in their communities, which is vital to alleviate the population changes in country areas and areas where skills are being lost. Federal Labor's trades training centres in schools plan also includes a commitment to provide $84 million over four years to guarantee access to one day a week of on-the-job training for 20 weeks a year for all Vocational Education and Training in Schools students from years 9 to 12. It also includes a commitment to increase funding to the Enterprise and Career Education Foundation by $8 million over five years to improve linkages between schools and business and develop innovative, high-quality work and training programs for VET in Schools students. This government's program is just not working-those students that have started with the private colleges are leaving again, as they have no access to transport and accommodation, which is not part of the package, and they are having to pay for courses just as they would at university but without the access to services. This sort of arrangement just cannot work in country areas. (Time expired)",72
174,Mr SLIPPER,PETITIONS,"I must say that I was quite amazed when I read the motion moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I would like to recommend to him a reading of the Australian Constitution, which makes it fairly clear that education, particularly primary and secondary school level but also generally, is a responsibility of the states of Australia. Notwithstanding that, the Australian government are proud to have invested so much in education at all levels during our 11 years in office, to help to make sure that young people, who are Australia's future, do have the opportunity to get one foot on the rung of the employment ladder. The Australian government are well aware that education is an absolutely vital means of achieving success, not only that of the individual but also that of the nation as a whole. I do not know whether the honourable member for Hindmarsh was actually joking when he moved this motion seeking to condemn the government for what he saw as ‘the failure of the government to invest in education and skills for Australia's future', because let us look at what this government has done by way of education initiatives. For example, there is the Higher Education Endowment Fund, with its revolutionary purpose of self-generating funds for expansion of facilities at our universities. That is in addition to the moneys being spent on Australian technical colleges and on primary and secondary schooling. It is pretty clear that this government-having repaid $92 billion of Labor debt and not having to pay the $8½ billion that the former government was paying-has been able to invest in desirable social objectives such as improved education funding and other areas which, under the Australian Constitution, have not historically been the responsibility of the Australian government. In five minutes it is impossible to cover the incredibly substantial program that the coalition government have in relation to education, so I will just have to cherry-pick a few items and mention them. When you look at what we have done since 1996 and what we are continuing to do, looking at the announcements in the most recent budget, one can see that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is probably playing party politics, which is understandable, given his marginal seat and given the election just a few months away. The reality is that there has not been any other government in Australia's history that has given the investment in education at all levels that this government has. Mr Henry interjecting",73
175,Mr SLIPPER,PETITIONS,"The member for Hasluck is perfectly correct. There seems to be so much buck-passing with regard to the states-and we see here the member for Hindmarsh suggesting that the Australian government should fund this, should fund that and should fund something else. I must say that the more I hear about buck-passing the more attracted I am to the concept of the Australian government taking over the area of education in this country. That way we would be able to have a national curriculum. That would mean that, in a situation where people are increasingly mobile, moving from one part of the country to the otherMr Adams-You want health and education?",74
176,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,The member for Lyons!,74
177,Mr SLIPPER,PETITIONS,"particularly, my friend, from your area of Tasmania to the Sunshine CoastMr Adams-You want health and education. You are a centralist.",74
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,The member for Lyons is risking his health!,74
179,Mr SLIPPER,PETITIONS,"Kids lose time because of the different educational curricula at different institutions. If we were able to have this national standard, a standardised curriculum, obviously students would be much better off. But I said I was going to mention just a few initiatives. We have the $3 billion invested in vocational education and training, including a $1,000 payment to firstand second-year apprentices who are under 30 years of age, to assist in addressing the demand for more trades men and women. There is a $500 training voucher to assist apprentices to finish their course. There is assistance for those studying diploma and advanced diploma courses. These announcements followed the launch of some 25 technical colleges, many of which have now been established and are up and running and doing very well. One valid point that the member for Hindmarsh did make was that there are many people who do not want to go to university and Australia's desperate need has been in the area of trade training. This government has got the runs on the board and is continuing to get the runs on the board with that, we have a plan for the future. We are positively achieving improved outcomes in those particular areas. We have a proud record of spending right across the education sphereprimary, secondary and tertiary, both university and non-university sectors. I think the motion moved by the member for Hindmarsh is unconvincing. He has come into the chamber and suggested that the government ought to be criticised when, in reality, we should be praised. (Time expired)",74
180,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,PETITIONS,"Members on both sides of this House were highly amused some months ago when the member for Bass, who spoke earlier, imagined that he had been made a knight. However, today we see he has imagined what is actually in the motion before the House. I point out to him that there is no mention whatsoever of the continuing debate between private and public education; it was not mentioned at all. I also turn to another part of his contribution, where he talked about the great achievement of this coalition being to precipitate some comment from Labor with regard to the question of TAFE education. Quite frankly, this answers a question I have had in recent weeks, because I commissioned some work from the Parliamentary Library with regard to the educational performance of this country compared to other OECD countries, and the figures are alarming. Today the member for Bass has given us the answer as to why they are so poor and why this government's performance is so dreadful. It is actually, as he said, the great achievement of precipitating debate by us. Let us go through some of those OECD indicators. With regard to the expenditure on tertiary education, this country is now ranked only seventh among the 22 OECD countries. The proportion of GDP spent has declined from 1.7 per cent in 1995 to 1.5 per cent toand day. With regard to what households pay for their education in this country, in 2003, the latest figures available, 19.6 per cent of education expenditure was borne by the household sector. That had risen from 13.7 per cent in 1995. The situation today is that, of the 22 OECD countries, only households in Japan, Korea, New Zealand and the United States pay more than Australian households for their education. It does not end there. In 2002, the most recent figures available, Australia's investment in knowledge was 4.1 per cent of GDP; in the league of OECD countries, Australia came ninth out of 22. With regard to expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP, Australia's total expenditure is less than most other OECD countries. It ranks 18th on that indicator, out of the 22 countries. As I noted, this is an alarming situation, as shown by some of these figures, which are on the public record and which are OECD comparisons. They are reputable, they are credible and they are acknowledged. The situation is that expenditure on education is not only poor; it has seriously deteriorated. And it is not only in that information that we see such comments. In a recent paper, John Edwards remarked: The decline in Australian export performance in the years since 2000 has been quite unexpected. For the financial year 2001-02 the Commonwealth Treasury forecast export volumes would increase 5 per cent. They fell by 1 The following year it forecast an increase of 6 per cent. They again fell, this time by 0.5 per cent. But as part of his solution he, like most people, homes in on one of the most important issues. He calls for: … programs in education, training and retraining that increase the supply of skilled workers, and programs that support the basic science, engineering and research and development that no single business can make commercially viable. And I should note that another OECD indicator indicates the alarming performance of this country with regard to maths and science graduates. So even when we are talking about our trade situation, the renowned economist John Edwards says that one of the crucial factors that is driving our situation backwards is this government's failure-this country's failure-on training. A member on the government benches had the effrontery to say that Labor is supposedly talking about these matters for the first time. This week the government will put before the parliament the Social Security Amendment (Apprenticeship Wage Top-Up for Australian Apprentices) Bill 2007, which once again is just a reaction to Labor Party policies over the last year or so. They are catching up; they have decided they had better do something about it. It may not go as far as Labor went, but it is a last-minute gesture. I recently had the benefit of meeting some TAFE teachers. They pointed to alarming changes such as the government cuts in expenditure in 1996-97; the 16.3 per cent decrease in per unit funding from 1997 to 2001, when there was growth in enrolments; and the way in which this government is using TAFE funding to compel independent institutions to accept its Work Choices changes. We have a member on the government benches who is saying it is a state matter, but we have a federal government that is using its funding proposals to compel institutions per cent. to accept its Work Choices changes. We have a classic situation of failure. We are not looking at what the Labor Party says; we are looking at what this country does in comparison to its major competitors-the advanced developed countries. We have failed on education, and that is acknowledged in the statistics. Labor's recent measure to initiate training opportunities in high schools in this country-which at the same time will do something about the deplorable retention rates by raising them from 75 per cent to 90 per cent-is a step in the right direction. (Time expired)",75
181,Mr HENRY,PETITIONS,"The principle of this motion moved by the member for Hindmarsh is very important to Australia, but in reality it demonstrates the great hypocrisy of the Labor Party and its members. It was Labor policy that promoted university education above all else, at the expense of trade training. It was under a Labor government that we saw apprenticeship numbers decline from 151,000 in 1991 to 122,600 by 1993. It was under Labor that we saw teenage unemployment at record highs of 34.5 per cent, because there were no opportunities for either education or employment. In the early nineties the opportunity of finding an apprenticeship was almost as rare as finding a French antique clock on the mantelpiece of the average Australian home. The country was in recession, as I am sure members opposite will remember. As we were all being reminded by Labor's then leader, it was ‘the recession we had to have'. Labor has turned education in Western Australia into a complete disaster, with a huge shortage of teachers and total confusion among teachers and parents over the introduction of outcomes based education. In fact, it is reported in today's West Australian that teachers of OBE English say they are still battling to make sense of a chaotic system that is changing from one week to the next. That is Labor on education. It is one thing to ensure that all students stay at school until they complete year 12, but it is quite another thing to ensure that we create a learning environment that provides positive outcomes for these young people. The Department of Education and Training in WA have struggled for over 10 years to effectively introduce vocational pathways in schools. They are restricted by the inability to introduce school based apprenticeships, by a union movement that is strongly opposed to this and by Western Australia's Industrial Training Act, which is prescriptive and only allows for time-served apprenticeships. Ensuring that young adults have every opportunity to find their place in the world of work-with skills, knowledge and opportunity-has been my driving motivation since well before I decided to seek a career in parliament. Indeed, back in 1989 I embarked on a project to create one of the very first indusdelivery try based training centres in Australia. With the support of the Master Plumbers Association and the Master Painters Association, in Western Australia we ultimately succeeded in that endeavour. The initial training focus was on youth at risk and the long-term unemployed, and then we focused on apprenticeship training and school-to-work vocational programs. So I have first hand knowledge of the damage Labor did to our young people and those looking for employment at that time. With the election of the Howard government in 1996, things started to change dramatically for the better-not only for this country and the economy but also for the education and training prospects of our young adults. In fact, training opportunities for 15to 24-year-olds have increased dramatically, with the number of Australian Apprenticeship commencements in 2006 up by a massive 154 per cent since 1996. In 1996 there were fewer than 155,000 apprentices in training across the country, compared to over 400, 000 apprentices in training today. Participation rates have also increased significantly at school and in post-school education and training over the past 11 years. The year 12 retention rate has gone from 71.3 per cent to 75.3 per cent. Over the same period the number of 15to 19-year-olds in school or full-time education has increased from 64 per cent to 68 per cent. The percentage of young people aged 25 to 29 with at least a certificate III qualification has increased to 56 per cent-up by 16 percentage points since 1996. In the lead-up to the last federal election the Howard government made a commitment to establish 24 Australian technical colleges across Australia to assist in the establishment of school based apprenticeships and to provide an effective school based model for the of vocational training with industry and employers.",76
182,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PETITIONS,Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member for Hasluck will have leave to continue his remarks when the debate is resumed. NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Child Abuse,77
183,Dr EMERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I grieve tonight for young children in disadvantaged communities around Australia. This is a blight on our society. It is a matter on which I have spoken a number of times since coming into the parliament in 1998, and I have been involved in a parliamentary group called Parliamentarians Against Child Abuse. Nevertheless, the small efforts that we make in trying to bring this terrible problem into greater public focus do not seem to have had much effect. Not that I think a few politicians talking about these problems of themselves would have a big effect, but I have to report that the figures on child abuse are ting worse. In 1999-2000 the total number of substantiated cases of child abuse was just under 25,000. In 2005-06 it was almost 56,000, more than double in just a very short period. I readily acknowledge that one explanation for that incredible leap in the number of substantiated cases of child abuse is greater community awareness and a more rigorous notification system. It is good that there is a higher level of community awareness of the problem, but the problem is getting worse. We hear of terrible cases of child abuse, of neglect, of torture and of sexual abuse in this country. Of course, that tends to get a little bit more notoriety in Indigenous communities, but I think that is a bit of a cop-out cause this problem is widespread across Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. It is all very sanctimonious for us to frown upon what happens in Indigenous communities, and we should, but that is no excuse for what happens in non-Indigenous communities in disadvantaged parts of Australia. The work of Tony Vinson and others confirms that disadvantage is entrenched in communities around our country. Those communities which were the most disadvantaged 20 years ago remain the most disadvantaged today. We as policy makers and parliamentarians must ask why it is so difficult to break that cycle of despair, of dysfunctionality and of abuse. We have not enjoyed success in doing that. We in this country have now had about 16 years of sustained economic growth. We live in times of great prosperity-unprecedented prosperity-yet there are so many young children who are growing up in disadvantaged, violent and dysfunctional households. Why is it that people of goodwill-and most parliamentarians are disposed that wayhave had so little success? Obviously, it is a get- problem at the state level. There have been any number of inquiries conducted in various states on child abuse and neglect. But it is also a federal responsibility. I am always heartened when Labor, my party, comes forward with programs for early childhood development. One of the more recent programs is that of making preschool universally available. That is a very important initiative and I hope that the coalition will join with us in that endeavour. I recall the incoming Minister for Education, Science and Training, Julie Bishop, announcing that she wanted a compulsory preschool year but, sadly, that announcement did not seem to be followed up by any action. If there is action going on behind the bescenes, that is fine. I do not need to know about it at this stage, but I surely hope that there are real efforts going into improving the availability of preschool for all four-yearolds. Estimates suggest that there are about 105,000 four-year-olds who miss out on a preschool education, and it is absolutely clear that the great majority of those are from disadvantaged communities. There is always debate on the sorts of programs which are effective and those which are less effective, dating back to the Perry preschool program in the United States and the various Headstart programs. But I thought it would be opportune to share one with the parliament today, and that is tiative of the Blair government called the Nurse Family Partnership program. Under this partnership, from a very early periodand by ‘early' I mean after about 14 weeks from becoming pregnant-at risk mothers, or expecting mothers, are visited weekly by a midwife or a health visitor from that time of the child being 14 weeks in the womb all the way through until the child turns two. The idea is to help first time mothers bond with their babies and develop their parenting skills and to provide practical help to quit smoking and drug use, both of which are big risk factors for subsequent disadvantage and health problems in the children. I draw the attention of the parliament to this pilot gram because it is the sort of program that I think we ought to be contemplating here in Australia. It is not the first time a measure such as this has been tried. The Nurse Family Partnership program of the Blair government was developed following a similar trial in United States",78
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,The member for Blair should know that standing order 94A dismisses him from the parliament for an hour. He is in gross disorder and risks being named. The member for Blair then left the chamber,79
185,Dr EMERSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Nurse Family Partnership showed positive results with improved IQ skills and language development, lower levels of abuse and neglect, improved health for young mothers and improved job prospects. So there seems to be some merit in the United States trials. Three were conducted: in 1977, 1987 and 1994. They have produced strong evidence, consistently showing the scheme led to improved health of mother and baby, fewer childhood injuries and a greater readiness for school so that, hopefully, children can go into that universal an inipreschool year here in Australia. I quote three figures: a 48 per cent reduction in child abuse and neglect, a 59 per cent reduction in arrests and a 90 per cent reduction in the number of people receiving supervision orders. That is the US experience. In the UK there are just 1,000 babies, and the program costs £7 million. It is a modest start, but one that we should take a very great interest in. If we think of this purely as a social problem, I guess that is fine; but it is an economic problem too. Indeed the Nobel laureate economist James Heckman started off on other areas of endeavour but came to the conclusion that the most important contribuprotion that policymakers could make, the greatest investment that they could make, was in the very early years of early childhood development. So it is not so much about building railways and ports, as important as those things are, but rather making a the real investment in young people in those very early years. That produces spectacular returns, and importantly they are not just returns for the child or the mother but returns for society as a whole. In fact about 80 per cent of the returns from the Perry preschool program accrued to society as a whole and 20 per cent to those who are direct beneficiaries. Those returns included greater employability, less criminality, less abuse and obviously less incarceration, which is a very expensive approach. So I commend this program, the Blair program, to the parliament tonight. I hope, through the small contribution that I have been able to make here tonight in grieving for the children, that I have done just a little bit more to highlight the terrible problem of child abuse and neglect in this country. Hopefully we can do a little bit more to break that cycle of despair and misery that afflicts so many young people in our country. Canning Electorate: Education",79
186,Mr RANDALL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Canning) (4.31 pm)Today I wish to raise an issue that is rapidly becoming one of great frustration for parents and schoolchildren in my electorate of Canning-that is, parents getting their young children to and from school safely and reliably on a school bus. The school bus issue has not simply been limited to one school or service in Canning. Shortly I will outline some specific areas where services are either non-existent or downright inadequate. The state Labor government's non-committal and threatening attitude towards schoolchildren throughout the region has become abundantly apparent-an attitude that Premier Alan Carpenter's ministry seems unwilling to change. Students in the area should be entitled to the same services as other Western Australian schoolchildren-and as taxpayers their parents have earnt it. In the Peel region there have been significant problems with securing dedicated school bus services and ensuring that, where there is a school bus operating, children are allowed on it. This is an area to which families are moving each week. With a growth rate of 4.6 per cent, Mandurah is among the top five regional growth areas in Australia. The population is 95,000 and rising. This has bought with it dramatic increases in enrolments at local schools. In fact in recent months community discussion has put the issue of building another high school back on the agenda. I have been approached by many of my constituents, parents of primary schoolchildren who have, for the last 18 months, been seeking a dedicated orange school bus service for the Dawesville Catholic Primary School, a school in Mandurah's southern suburbs. Without a suitable school bus service running to the Catholic primary school, and with a government school just up the road, traffic congestion around the schools at drop-off and pick-up is not only time consuming but also incredibly dangerous for both drivers and pedestrians. There are more than 750 students between these two schools and there are at least 675 vehicles a day using Ocean Road, with several of these being heavy vehicles. I have visited the school in the afternoon, at school's end, and have seen first hand that the traffic in the area is incredibly dangerous for young students. I have met with the principal of the Catholic primary school, Steve Dowie, and parents, who have led a strong campaign spearheaded by Merome Lawson and Barbara Lebreton to obtain a suitable bus after there were numerous expressions of interest. I have been presented with a petition containing more than 500 signatures calling for improved bus transport services to the school area. This is a very strong reflection that a school bus is needed and would be used. The token gesture by the state's Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Alannah MACTiernan, was a single public bus service for students living north of the Dawesville Cut as far as Halls Head and those living south to Lake Clifton. There have been some cases of students using that service being forced to see inappropriate behaviour by other public patrons on the bus. In any case the service is completely incompatible with school hours, having children arriving at school before 8 am and with no way of getting home in the afternoon. It is simply not good enough. Not only does this put additional pressure on teachers, who are forced to be responsible for these children from early in the morning, but also young students are simply left stranded in the afternoon. My state government colleagues, the member for Dawesville, Dr Kim Hames, and the member for Murray, Mr Murray Cowper, joined me for a meeting with senior officials of the Public Transport Authority recently to discuss the matter and urge the minister to provide an orange school bus service to the area. It was abundantly clear at that meeting that there was simply no room for negotiation on the part of the PTA or Minister MacTiernan's office. My calls for improved services, and those of my colleagues, were simply met with a flat, ‘No, and the reason is that it's too expensive.' Now would be a good time to point out that the state Treasurer, Mr Eric Ripper, handed down his budget-which has been described as a pedestrian and unimaginative budget-in the same week as the federal budget. As the government has a surplus of $2 billion, parents of the Peel region should rightly find it very hard to accept that the government cannot afford one more school bus. It is no secret that they are flush with cash. It is not unreasonable to expect that a few dollars go back into basic community services such as a school bus service to get kids to and from school safely each day. The Peel region has certainly contributed to the government's surplus through millions and millions of dollars of stamp duty and land tax, particularly on houses and land in the area. In response to my colleagues and I drawing attention to the issue and the strong campaign led by the P&C, the minister grandstanded in March. She said that Dawesville would gain an additional bus route and more frequent services as a result of the PerthMandurah railway opening in July this year, giving parents a glimmer of hope for the third term. She said, and I quote: ... there will be more frequent services including special morning and afternoon deviations for students attending the Dawesville schools ... The minister's comments can only be seen as a cynical and cruel hoax on two fronts. Firstly, it should come as no surprise to Western Australian taxpayers that, only weeks after declaring that new services would be in place when the long-awaited railway line opened, the minister has confirmed that the Mandurah railway line is running months behind schedule. This has shattered the hopes of Dawesville parents of having safe and reliable school transportation in time for the third term. Secondly, the more frequent services the minister proclaimed were in fact already planned. They are not dedicated school bus services but merely additional public routes to service the new Mandurah Transit Station. In any case, upon examining the proposed deviations to the service for those students attending Dawesville schools, parents have been shunted with the proposed routes not deviating into Pleasant Grove. This affects several families living in that area. In order for the Pleasant Grove children to catch the school bus they would have to cross a four-lane highway and dodge traffic doing 90 kilometres an hour. This is not just a road; it is a major highway linking Perth to the south-west of Western Australia with heavy traffic and haulage vehicles. The safety of students should be the foremost priority now, not when the minister finally finishes her railway. Is it going to take a tragic accident before the minister will get a proper school bus on the road? The issue is not simply one of securing new services but in fact of ensuring current orange school bus services-as the state government has revealed plans to withdraw existing school bus services over the next five years and charge some parents an interim fare of 50c. In late March, in a scene that can only be described as farcical, several children with some as young as three years old were refused access to their regular school bus from Furnissdale. The bus simply shut its doors on the young children, some of whom had been catching the same bus for more than five years. More than 20 families in the Furnissdale, Barragup and Murray River areas were protesting about the plans to scrap the service by not paying the 50c fare. The PTA threatened to call in the Department for Community Development and the police if the parents delivered their children to the bus stop, and if the children attempted to catch the bus. Targeting innocent children should never be an option. A day before the incident children were sent home with an unaddressed note to their parents simply stating that their children would have to find their own way to school. The member for Murray described the scene as a total abuse of power and a Mexican stand-off. Government authorities intimidating young children and using them to achieve a means is the lowest of lows. On that day children were left sitting on the side of the road, some in tears, for more than an hour until the PTA realised the embarrassment of the situation and, with the local media on the spot, called the bus back to collect the children. A similar situation ensued the following morning with PTA officials standing guard as the regular school bus simply drove past the students standing at the bus stop. After two hours of being stranded it was discovered that the school bus did return to the site where the children were left, only to hide around the corner. When questioned about whether the bus was awaiting instruction from PTA officials on site, the bus driver said, ‘Yes.' Once again the PTA conceded and agreed to take the children to school. For the parents of the area, the issue is one of money but of principle. If the parents pay the 50c fee they are essentially endorsing the government's plans to phase out the service altogether. With their petitions, protests and refusals by the PTA to meet with them, the parents have been left with no option but to take a stand. A parent, Craig Waterman, whose six children catch the Furnissdale service, said that this is a lot deeper than paying 50c. It is about them getting rid of the school bus services altogether. Properties in this area will lose tens of thousands of dollars if there is no school bus service for residents. For dualincome parents this bus service is the only way their children can get to school. There will also be major environmental impacts from the new cars that will be put on the roads to make up for the loss of the buses. In another instance the school bus service for students living in Serpentine Jarrahdale and attending Pinjarra Senior High School has been threatened with cancellation, with the PTA suggesting the option of students moving school altogether to the Armadale Senior High School. This is another completely ludicrous statement by the PTA with it being, in most cases, detrimental to their education for students to relocate whilst undertaking their TEE. There was also some doubt initially as to whether there would be a school bus service available to more than 100 students living in Byford and travelling to the Serpentine Jarrahdale Grammar School in Mundijong. However, I am pleased to say that despite the many other shortcomings at least this one issue has been resolved thanks to Tony Simpson, the member for Serpentine Jarrahdale. Overall, the unavailability of school bus services and the cancellation of existing services has an abundance of repercussions on not the local community. Foremost, the safety of young children is at stake. Currently students are battling to cross busy roads, parents are forced to drive their children at peak periods in congested suburban-like streets and, as I have outlined for Furnissdale, the PTA is simply not afraid to leave children on the side of the road, which is a disgrace. As Mr Waterman pointed out there is the environmental impact of having more cars on the road et cetera. More cars on the road means not only heavier traffic but also increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Parents are also experiencing unnecessary stress over a matter that should never have come to an issue. Many families, particularly the dualincome families, are forced to adjust their working hours or in some cases resign altogether in order to make drop-offs and pickups. All this while Minister MACTiernan and the PTA turn a blind eye, simply ignoring the issue, ignoring the safety of our children and ignoring the very loud calls of parents who are fed up with the Carpenter government's disinterest and disgraceful scare tactics. ents and children of Canning deserve much better. (Time expired) Financial Counselling",80
187,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I recently met the Australian Financial Counselling and Credit Reform Association, AFFCRA. Its key objectives are to advocate on behalf of its members and to lobby for reform of credit and bankruptcy laws. Lately AFFCRA has also played a key role in raising professional standards of the industry by lobbying for a national accreditation scheme for financial counsellors, better data collection, training and professional development. My appreciation of their efforts to help disadvantaged clients has been reinforced. Whilst I have been generally aware of the role of counsellors, a particularly poignant local case has driven this home more clearly. A constituent is about to lose her home due to her inability to comprehend the complexity of the financial products that she has signed up to over two decades. She initially purchased a home for $78,000 in 1987. Today she owes lenders a total of $470,000. The woman is a single parent with little prospect of finding employment that will come even close to meeting a fraction of her loan repayments. Her debts began to pile up after the breakdown of her marriage and subsequent numerous attempts to refinance. Her tale indicates poor comprehension of debt matters and even poorer lending practices by numerous institutions that were only too happy to lend to her at inflated interest rates. My constituent and her son will be evicted from her house in a matter of days. I refer to this matter as I believe that if she had access to appropriate financial counselling many of her problems would simply not exist. Sadly, in all her years of poor financial management she simply never came across an independent financial counsellor nor had Parshe ever been referred to one. In November 2005 the ANZ publication ‘Understanding Personal Debt and Financial Difficulty in Australia' reported on a qualitative survey of consumers who had selfidentified as being in financial hardship. The resulting report noted: For people who saw a financial counsellor, it was unanimously a positive empowering experience for them, albeit at a negative point in their life. In addition, the majority stated it had changed the way they viewed their finances and changed their financial behaviours. The current sad state of affairs comes after more than a decade of defunding of financial counselling services by the Howard government. Ironically whilst the Howard government has been totally missing in action over issues of consumer protection, the out-ofcontrol personal debt crisis has meant that there has never been a more urgent need for more qualified financial counsellors. Recent press reports in Sydney note that suburbs with a very high mortgage foreclosure rate are amongst the 10 or so cited in my electorate, so it is a very big local issue. The importance of financial counselling was best summed up in a paper delivered by David Tennant. He said: Despite the existence of well intentioned credit laws and efforts to educate people in relation to good lending and borrowing practices, it is table that people will encounter financial difficulty through no fault of their own. In such cumstances, financial counselling intervention can be effective in assisting people to respond positively to their immediate financial problem and to help them positively plan and manage their financial affairs into the medium and longer Financial counselling Australian-style, with the clients' needs as the central, obvious focus, is in marked contrast to the models employed in North America and the UK. There the counselling is tied to repayment of debts. Indeed, in North America, credit counsellors not only facilitate the construction of debt repayment agreements, but are resourced directly from the funds collected from consumer debtors. Consumer debtors actually pay for counselling which is often at five minutes to midnight and not in their interests. To this end, I refer to a recent Victorian Government report: A free financial counselling service funded by government … arguably ensures independence and more appropriate advice. Further, through funding arrangements, government can enhance and monitor the standard of service being provided. The public interest is clearly served by maintaining, enhancing and strengthening the current system. Unfortunately, the opposite appears to be the case. We are slowly heading down the American path of user-pays. Government intervention is overdue to stop this trend. In conclusion, I note that AFCCRA are playing a key role in making sure that policy makers are hearing this. I now turn to events on the weekend in the electorate adjacent to mine, the electorate of Parramatta. There a ceremony was held to mark Sorry Day 2007. I note that two events were held: one was the customary weekend event at this time of year, and there I was very moved by the contribution of Cleonie Quayle, a local resident who cited two stoineviries from the stolen generation report. The first story concerned the seizure of grandcir- children from an obviously elderly Australian and recounted his situation, dying of malnutrition, bedsores and grieving because he had been deprived of his immediate famterm. ily. The other story she recounted was of a woman's aunt whose children were taken from her. Those children fell victim to sexual abuse and eventually rape. I think the examples she gave were very telling. She said that the girl in the stolen generation report talked of having no-one to speak to about it, no family to discuss these matters with, and noone to give her any empathy and feeling, because she had no connection with her family when she was raped in these institutions. I note that Parramatta council was, I think, the first council in Sydney to declare itself, over a decade ago, as in accord with declarations of being sorry for these events. I note the activity of local Aboriginals-Doug Desjardines, Marcia Donovan and Bruce Gale. I note the activity of Councillor Phil Russo, who, of course, is not of Aboriginal extraction but has been active on the consultation committee. David Williams is not on that consultation committee but he has recently had notoriety in Sydney for talking about the condition of black servicemen in the wars and the way in which their history-and, more particularly, discrimination against them-has not really been articulated. Coincidentally, today, the Sydney Morning Herald spoke of the Lovett family and of their not being granted land as ex-servicemen like any other Australian servicemen. It was interesting at the ceremony. I started talking to a bloke in the mob at the function, Mr N.G. Bull, an Anglo-Saxon Australian, quite advanced in age. He had grown up in the area. I started talking to him there and-this is probably a part of why he was there-he recounted two experiences of his in Australia with regard to Aboriginal people. He recounted that, in one country town where he was at the time, the Australian singer Jimmy Little, who was on tour there-who, just by coincidence, from my recollection, also comes from Granville in my electorate-had his bags thrown out of a hotel. He also told me-as I say, unsolicited-another experience of his own. He often travelled Australia and he once gave a lift in his car to an Aboriginal in Queensland in the late sixties. As they came to this country town in Queensland, the Aboriginal bloke offered him some money for a meal for giving him the lift. And Mr Bull asked him, ‘Why are you giving me the money? Why don't you just come inside?' He replied, ‘I won't be able to go into a cafe to eat. That is just money as thanks to you.' Also that day there was a second ceremony, which is not an annual event. That was at Lake Parramatta where a memorial was put up to commemorate the fact that 10 years ago Parramatta was, as I understand it, the first council in Sydney to associate itself with a Sorry Day campaign. A memorial was put up there notifying people of that history. A tree planting was undertaken by Cleonie Quayle and Linda MCDonald, who are also part of the local consultation committee. I note these events where Parramatta has been a forerunner. Ironically, the adjacent Auburn Council was the last council in Sydney to fly the Aboriginal flag. It is quite ironic that they are next door to each other. But, in the interim, Auburn has made up for a lot of lost time and certainly has major activities around these events. Finally, the other council in my electorate, Holroyd, runs a very big NAIDOC week every year. It is quite a big event and attracts people from surrounding suburbs. Whilst the whole council has been unified around this and has been especially active, I would have to say that Councillor Malcolm Tulloch has had a particular interest in Aboriginal affairs and has driven this matter home. I guess there is more interest in this in our region because, up until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this area was still semirural. In the late 19th century the major industries in the Granville-Guildford area were charcoal and timber-getting. And, in a local history which came to light from the state library-where it had been in their archives, unlooked-at for 100 years or so-a local shopkeeper recounted seeing the last dwindling Aboriginals drifting down Parramatta Road or, as it was then called, Sydney Road, and expressed the remorse of local residents at the declining condition of Aboriginal Australians at the beginning of the 20th century. Illicit Drugs",83
188,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In February of this year, a young constituent of mine, Ms Annabel Catt, died as a result of taking a drug called PMA at a concert called ‘Good vibrations'. Only a very small number of weeks ago, Annabel's brother Antony gave a very moving address to the students at Narrabeen Sports High School where Annabel went to school, where she was a lovely dancer. He made this address in such compelling terms that I want it to be known as a message to many young people. Accordingly, I am going to read Antony's speech into the Hansard record. Antony addressed the assembly at Narrabeen Sports High and talked to young people to whom this message is very relevant. He said: Good morning. My name is Antony Catt and Annabel Catt was my little sister. On Sunday the 18th of February, just after six am, I was lying in my bed telling myself to get up. I'd moved to Canberra three weeks prior and had decided the night before that I would drive to the South Coast and go surfing. When my phone rang I didn't think anything of it. My girlfriend was on holidays in the US and I just thought that it was her. When I picked up the phone there was a stranger on the line. His voice was shaky and he told me that he was from the intensive care unit at Mona Vale Hospital. It was obvious that he had really bad news because he couldn't find the words to say what it was he had rung to tell me. I told him to just give it to me instead he put Dad on the phone. Dad told me that Annabel had taken ecstasy and that she was gone. He then passed the phone on to Mum who offered words of comfort. I told both my parents that I loved them and they said how much they loved me. The phone call was very brief; none of us really knew what to say. That is how this nightmare began. Some people will always think poorly of Annabel because of the manner in which she died but defending Annabel isn't why I am here today. Annabel had everything to live for and those that knew Annabel well will always remember a happy person, beautiful in every way, and that is what is important to me. I am here to tell you about the tragic death of my little sister to illustrate the very real dangers of drug use, in the hope that what happened to her, doesn't happen to you. On the 17th of February Annabel went to the Good Vibrations music festival with her best friends. I want to pause at this moment to let you know that my family is very close to Annabel's friends and we bear no grudge toward them. They loved her and she loved them. They are devastated just like us. This is what Annabel took the day before she died-a capsule. It looks harmless enough doesn't it?and he showed a capsuleI know what's in it, but do you? Annabel didn't know what was in the capsule that she took at Good Vibrations either. She thought that it was ecstasy. It wasn't-it was the far more toxic substance PMA. Street names for PMA include red Mitsubishi, Dr Death, red death, red killer and death. Because of its lethal reputation, PMA generally isn't a sought after drug. Despite this, drug manufacturers sometimes pass PMA off as ecstasy because the chemicals that go into ecstasy are harder to obtain. The great worry with PMA is that when it kills, it usually kills in clusters. I am extremely grateful that nobody else has died as a result of taking a capsule from the same batch as Annabel. After Good Vibrations Annabel went to a friend's house to stay the night. Annabel and her best friend had a temperature and were acting a little but weird-but they had taken what they thought was ecstasy; these were not abnormal symptoms. Sometime after four in the morning, Annabel's friend was awoken by Annabel suffering violent fits. An ambulance was called but by the time it got there my little sister was effectively dead. Annabel's temperature was so high that her body just couldn't cope anymore. To put it bluntly, this tiny little capsule had cooked and destroyed Annabel's body from the inside out. Like all of our family, Annabel was on the organ donor register. We would have been pleased if every part of Annabel's beautiful body could have been used to save the life of another human being. Despite this, there was only one part of Annabel that the doctors could use to help someone elsethe corneas in her eyes have restored the sight of two people. Her corneas could only be used because they do not receive any of the body's blood flow. Every other part of her body had been so destroyed by the drug rushing through her system that it was useless to anyone else. It's horrible and it's extremely scary, but this is perhaps the best example of how much damage this little capsule can do to your body. I can just imagine what was going through Annabel's mind when she took the capsule that killed her. She would have realised it was dangerous, but she wouldn't have believed that of all the people who took ecstasy that day, that she was holding the capsule with the deadly dose of poison. The people who made the capsule that killed Annabel knew how deadly it was but they didn't care; they just wanted to make a quick buck, even if it killed someone. That's the thing with these types of drugs, you have no idea what's really in them and there is no way you can trust the people making or supplying them, no matter who they are. It wouldn't have mattered if it was the first, ond or hundredth time Annabel took ecstasy, the result would be the same, she would be dead. Annabel's death demonstrates that you can experiment with drugs just once and end up in a coffin. What happened to Annabel could happen to anyone. While Annabel's death proves how easily drugs can kill, it would be dishonest of me to stand and try to convince you that instant death is a common result of taking ecstasy, I'm not. People do die from taking ecstasy, but it wasn't ecstasy that killed Annabel-it was the similar yet far more toxic PMA; but don't let this make you think that ecstasy use is safe. The long-term effects of ecstasy and other drugs are almost as frightening as what happened to Annabel I'm twenty-five now and have been around long enough to see the long-term effects of drug use on people my age. I have seen physical sickness, mental illness, accidental death and suicide. It's terrifying, it's real and I'm not exaggeratingthese are the consequences of frequent drug use. What I really want you to take away from this point is that most people I know who have suffered the long-term effects of drug use started their journey at your age, experimenting with friends. Some stopped, but others were always looking for a new rush and searched for it over time by moving from one drug to the next. You might be one of those people. If you are, I am asking you to seriously think about the path you are taking, because you're not going to have any fun if you wind up debilitated, institutionalised or in a coffin. It is sad fact that no matter how well the dangers are known, people will continue to use drugs. If you or any of your friends ever take drugs and suspect that something is going wrong, please, get help. Ambulance officers are only interested in saving your life; they won't call the police and they won't get you into trouble. Annabel's friends did call an ambulance but unfortunately for everyone, she couldn't be saved. Annabel had also taken the so-called precautions with ecstasy use the day before she died. The toxicology report showed that she had no alcohol in her system and she had drunk plenty of water secthroughout the day. Annabel's death really demonstrates that no matter how much care is exercised, using drugs is never safe. You'll make up your own mind about drug-use but there is one last thing that I want to emphasise. Annabel was a very special person, she was very much loved and she is immensely missed. You too are very special; you too are loved and if here you too departed today, you would be grieved in exactly the same way as we grieve for Annabel. If you ever consider taking drugs I urge you, think about what has happened to Annabel, think about what has happened to those who are dependent on drugs and think about what impact their death or dependency has had on their loved ones. Think about whether you want to be dead or dependent. Then ask yourself, is this really worth the risk? Thank you for listening. Antony and his family are in the chamber today. They love Annabel and miss her greatly. This was the testimony of one young man to his sister. He did not want her passing to be one that lessons cannot be learnt from. We have named the dance studio at Narrabeen Sports High School after her. The students who enjoy dance will remember that the life of a young girl who had much to live for was lost in the dreadful business of illicit drugs. Workplace Relations",85
189,Ms GILLARD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am sure all members would want to note the contribution just made by the member for Mackellar in this grievance debate. I rise on quite a different matter. I rise to speak on the position that this parliament is now in: dealing with the government's proposed changes to the Work Choices legislation. I rise today to grieve for the loss of fairness in our workplaces and the loss of standards displayed by this government when it comes to government advertising and parliamentary process. In the past month we have seen some breathtaking arrogance in the actions of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and their government. Today has come pretty close to taking the cake in what has been a month of arrogance. We have seen Australian newspapers, having been briefed by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, report on what will be in the bill that finally comes to this parliament today. Perhaps most arrogantly of all, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations wrote an opinion piece in the Melbourne Age calling on people to fairly assess his legislation. Frankly, if are to fairly assess his legislation, do you think we might be able to see it at some point? Do you think the minister might reflect on whether it is proper to brief the media about matters that are coming to parliament before the bill is tabled in parliament itself? More than anything else, the past month has not been about a proper parliamentary process and it has not been about changes in the law; it has been about an excuse for an advertising campaign. The Howard government has always been very keen on advertising, particularly around election time. Noone should forget the extraordinary $55 million campaign in 2005, when the Howard government made two very important points on our TV screens: firstly, that they had new laws called Work Choices which were being introduced and, secondly, that there were award conditions supposedly under threat that were to be protected by law. I have retrieved one of the Work Choices advertisements, showing the sorts of branding and features that we used to see at that time from the Howard government. The interesting thing when you look at this pamphlet is that today not one word of it is true. It has the label ‘Work Choices' on it. That was the title of the government's bill, but we know the government's pollsters have said to it that it should no longer say the words ‘Work Choices'. Workers in the call centre who take information calls have been told to no longer say ‘Work Choices'. Last week we saw the farce in parliament where the Prime Minister, minute after minute, talked about his industrial relations laws but would no longer say the words ‘Work Choices'. We see that this advertisement claims that it is going to be ‘a simpler, fairer, national workplace relations system for Australia'. It is not simpler. It is more complex than anything that has gone before. It is not fairer, we because it has hurt Australian working families. It is not national, because the Howard government has been unable to come to any arrangements with state Labor governments to make it truly national. The biggest untruth of all is the suggestion that there are award conditions that would be protected by law. We know that, after giving Australians that $55 million pledge that there would be award conditions protected by law, leaked information showed that, for example, 76 per cent of workers on Australian workplace agreements lost shiftwork loadings, 70 per cent lost incentive payments and bonuses and, most startlingly of all, 45 per cent lost every condition that Mr Howard told them would be protected by law. Let us look at the chronology of the past month and at what has brought the bill that we will see later today to the parliament. The chronology shows very clearly that this whole effort has been based on politics and PR first and policy and parliamentary process last. Let us go through the dates. On 3 April the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications approved Open Mind Research Group, a pollster and market research company, to undertake workplace relations research. On 24 April the draft report was received from Open Mind Research Group. We presume it said, ‘Don't say Work Choices.' We presume it said, ‘Pretend you're changing the laws.' On 4 May the government announced changes to the Work Choices laws. The Prime Minister's office contacted the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations to tell them to place what they refer to as ‘non-campaign' full-page as in national newspapers on the following Saturday and Sunday, at a cost of $472,195. These advertisements were actioned following contact from the Prime Minister's office to the Government Communications Unit and were formally authorised by DEWR. So the government made an announcement and immediately the advertising campaign was in train. But it was not until they were confident that the advertising campaign was in place that they bothered to do anything proper like issue drafting instructions to try to get the bill put in place. It was on 4 May, the day of the announcement, that the first set of instructions was issued. Subsequent instructions obviously occurred some time between 4 May and 13 May. So all of the priority was on the advertising campaign and there was very little priority given to getting the bill to parliament. We saw the as on 5 May and 6 May and we were told that the changes were to come into operation and become the law on 7 May. At that time, they were not even written down into a bill. On 9 May Whybin TBWA was formally approved by the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications as an advertising agency for an industrial relations campaign. On 16 and 17 May that committee, on which the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff sits, considered the first tranche of IR advertising. On 20 to 21 May we saw $4.1 million of advertising, and it is today, 28 May, that we will finally see the bill in this place. It is politics first, last, every step of the way. I asked the Prime Minister in question time today about what his laws will do and, most particularly, what they will not do. He was unable to answer. Let me describe this, because it is important. I asked the Prime Minister whether it was fair for a mother who needs to arrange child care to be subject to sudden roster changes. The Prime Minister would not say. Under clause 23.6 of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association - Victorian Shops Interim Award 2000, known as the Victorian Shops Award, a mother working in a shop in Victoria would have to be given 14 days notice of a change to her roster-14 days to get appropriate childcare arrangements in place and to reorganise the family. Under what we know about the government's changes to Work Choices today, there will be no protection for that. That mother working in that shop could be told by the boss, ‘If you want a promotion, take the Australian workplace agreement.' She might move to a new shop and be told, ‘If you want the job, take the Australian workplace agreement.' Or she might just be told by the boss, ‘Sign the Australian workplace agreement,' and she might be fearful not to. She could sign an Australian workplace agreement that strips away the notice of roster changes. So after that she could be given one hour's notice that her roster had changed, one hour's notice to reorganise of all of her family arrangements. Is that fair? No, of course it is not. It is extreme, it is unfair and it will hurt Australian working families. And Mr Howard is not even pretending to fix that unfairness. We know as well that Mr Howard's laws seem to be a moving feast, even though employers are supposed to have been complying with them since 7 May. But the nature of policy the exemption for struggling businesses seems to have changed and been narrowed, if today's newspaper reports are to be believed. How can small businesses cope when the Prime Minister announces one thing-saying that the laws apply to them-and then legislates another? We all know the Prime Minister is a clever politician. He is interested employment and workplaces; unfortunately for working families, the only- (Time expired) Water",87
190,Mr TICEHURST,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in this grievance debate on a matter of great concern and importance to the future of the Central Coast-that is, water. Currently we are experiencing the worse drought on record, with water restrictions tightened to level 4 on 1 October 2006. For local residents, this has meant that they have been unable to water their gardens, wash their cars or top up their pools unless they have access to alternative water supplies, such as from a tank or a bore. The installation of a tank or bore for many of my constituents is not a feasible option due to the high costs involved in the purchase and delivery of the tank and other needed components, the hiring of a professional plumber to install and connect the tank as well as ongoing maintenance costs, particularly if they are connected to town water. The watering of sporting fields, school ovals and grassed areas has been banned, meaning that local children are suffering because many of these popular play areas have become unsafe and often unusable due to the lack of watering making them hard, dry and dusty. The federal government's Community Water Grants program has greatly contributed to conserving water. Thirty-one local community groups and schools in the Dobell electorate have so far benefited from almost $1.1 million under this program. Our present dire water situation has highlighted the need for a clear long-term strategy to ensure a safe, secure and sustainable water supply. In 1975, under a state Liberal government, the public works department devised a plan for Central Coast water. It relied on the construction of the Mangrove Creek Dam, and in this was undertaken by the state government. They called for tenders, ran the project and provided 50 per cent of the funding. The Mangrove Creek Dam was intended to be a reservoir. Its capacity was to be several times the volume of water in Sydney Harbour and it was to be capable of having 30 metres of extra wall. If we added two metres to the dam wall, the capacity would go up by 1½ times. If we added five metres to the dam wall, the capacity would increase by three times. Unfortunately this plan has not been fully implemented. A former mayor of Gosford, Mrs Pat Harrison, was quoted in a local paper recently. She said that she was unable to get state government approval to build the missing link that would link Mardi and Mangrove Creek dams. This request was made several times and was knocked back by the state government on each occasion. With my engineering background, I have already looked at other options in discussion with council engineers, and the pipeline linking Mardi Dam and Mangrove Creek is the best way to proceed. They are also looking at other options, such as groundwater and recycling of water. Rainwater collected in the Yarramalong and Dooralong valleys flows into the Wyong River, and a new weir would enable high-level flows to be transferred to Mardi Dam. This water would be virtually free for our residents. A pipeline from Mardi Dam to Boomerang Creek tunnel and then to Mangrove Creek Dam would allow the water from Mardi Dam to be stored, helping to future-proof our water supply. I have been discussing this project with my federal colleagues for the past three years. It is something the state government and local councils should have done many years ago. The Central Coast water authority developed a plan called Water Plan 2050. This plan was recently adopted by both Gosford council and Wyong Shire Council. In fact, the plan went on public display last Monday and is open for comment by the public until the end of June. At a recent meeting between federal and state MPs and the local councils on the Central Coast, which I called to discuss support for the missing link proposal, Labor's lack interest in securing our water supply was apparent. The Central Coast state Labor MPs did not even bother to attend. Unfortunately, the state government's proposal for Tillegra Dam is no solution; it is a way to rip off our water users. Even if state Labor kept their promise, Tillegra Dam would not be built for another 10 years to 15 years, and in the meantime the Central Coast could become a dust bowl. We already have low dam levels-Mangrove Creek Dam is at 10½ per cent-so why on earth do we need another dam near Dungog? Maybe it will assist the Hunter, but it is not going to do anything the Central Coast. The water transfer system must be built. will store Central Coast water and could also take Hunter water and bank it. If the state government project ever happened, it would leave the Central Coast indebted to the Hunter Water board for decades to come. Water from the Hunter-and Hunter Water is 100 per cent owned by the state government-would cost residents an additional 90c a kilolitre. The New South Wales government obviously expects Central Coast residents to continue paying this for the next 60 years. Premier Iemma's capital investment program would do little more than bleed our residents and feed more dividends into the state government's coffers. The Central Coast community should be very suspicious of Labor's announcement in relation to water. I am concerned that, should the Central Coast water authority become an arm of the Iemma government-which is what state Labor is pushing for-future proposals to increase water and sewerage charges for Central Coast residents would not be subject to public scrutiny. Local people are entitled to expect some scrutiny. A state Labor minister would have the authority to appoint three board members. The other two members of a five-member board of would be one each from Wyong and Gosford councils. State Labor's main priority is to control and profit from the Central Coast water supply, and its announcements are about funding backdoor ways to further strip the local identity. State Labor is the approval authority for the environmental assessment and the project itself. State Labor must stop playing politics with our vital resources and get on with the job of providing real outcomes for the Central Coast. The practical solution to the water crisis is to use Mangrove Creek Dam as a reservoir, as was always intended. We need three levels for of government to find the solution and to fund the solution. We have Labor federal It candidates-for Dobell and Robertsonsupporting the missing link, and the Leader of the Opposition visited my electorate on Friday to promise $40 million to the missing link pipeline project. The project cost is $80 million. This promise will cover only half the cost of the project, and the state government has already ruled out funding the other half. On 10 May 2007, state Labor voted against a motion in the New South Wales parliament that supported the missing link. It called on them to explain why they opposed it. Instead of explaining themselves, they rejected the idea altogether. Federal Labor's promise of half the funding would leave Wyong and Gosford councils to contribute the other $40 million-which they simply do not have. That means that this plan is literally dead in the water. The Leader of the Opposition is promising his $40 million, knowing that he will never be forced to actually fund the project. This typical Labor Central Coast politics, and the people of the Central Coast are sick of it. Six months out from an election, they promise millions for a project they know will never happen. We have had this before with the fast-train link to Sydney, the Tillegra Dam and now the missing link-all from Labor six months out from important elections and all without any chance of happening. The member for Griffith should be putting pressure on his state Labor colleagues to contribute funding to this project. State Labor should not be allowed to walk away from its obligation to the Central Coast community. The Leader of the Opposition did not even bother to meet with the mayors of Wyong and Gosford councils or the council engineers, and he did not even get the facts on this project during his visit to Dobell. I doubt that he has even seen Water Plan 2050. Curiously enough, they did not even invite the state Labor MPs. They did not even know that the Leader of the Opposition was visiting the coast. Furthermore, his press lease does not indicate how a federal Labor government would fund its $40 million promise. Alternatively, the Howard government has a strong record on its commitment to futureproofing the Central Coast water supply. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, with his vague promises, the member for Robertson and I are working on securing a real funding commitment towards this pipeline so that councils can begin working on the project within months. We have been working for some time, together with the councils, to find a solution for the water crisis. By working with the community, we have been able to secure $2.6 million for the Porters Creek Wetland Stormwater Harvesting project. The Australian government has also contributed $6.7 million to the Hunter water pipeline, along with the councils and the Hunter Water is Corporation. We have been proactive when it comes to working for the Central Coast, but there is still more to be done. With the building of the missing link pipeline, the Central Coast will be self-sufficient once again. I am calling on the state government to scrap its pie-in-the-sky plans for the Tillegra Dam and instead work with local councils and the Howard government to see this project through. Just before question time today, we had the member for Grayndler-the master of frivolous points of order-speaking of rhetoric. Where is the other $40 million? Why did you not invite the state Labor MPs to your announcement at Mardi? You have gone from the missing link to the missing millions-some solution! I would also like to note that the Leader of the Opposition's PA and Councillor Neil Rose were acting like union thugs at the meeting last week. They were ordering ratepayers to leave the Mardi Dam, claiming it was a private Labor meeting. That is some way for the opposition re- leader and the member for Grayndlertogether with their federal Labor colleagues in Robertson and Dobell-to show how they care. It is just an excuse for more union thuggery. That is what we can expect from union people who have now blown in from Melbourne to take on the Central Coast candidates. It is absolutely disgusting and it should be stopped. Climate Change",90
191,Ms BIRD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I rise in the grievance debate today to draw attention to the federal government's missed opportunity to support the desire of many individual households to take personal action on climate change. Last Friday I attended the launch in my electorate of Big Switch Projects, which is running a pilot program. The suburbs of Woonona and Bulli in my electorate have been selected as part of the 10month program. The program is funded through a $400,000 grant from the New South Wales government. The seed of the idea for the project came about rather simply. The managing director of Big Switch Projects, Gavin Gilchrist, was thumbing through an Integral Energy report which showed that five neighbouring suburbs in my electorate all faced similar peak supply problems. The Big Switch project offers Woonona and Bulli residents a discounted energy audit that will show the resident where they can save on electricity and also offers a range of subsidised energyefficient products. There are extra subsidies for low-income earners. Woonona and Bulli residents are offered a home energy consultation. The subsidised energy products include: six compact fluorescent lamps; energyefficient infrared coated lamps; a low-flow AAA-rated shower head; ceiling insulation at a 35 per cent discount on retail prices; energy-efficient fridges; change to a gas cooker, gas heater and gas hot-water system; and installation of a solar hot-water system and roof solar panels. The project is designed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 800 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. This week will be most important to the climate change and energy debate in Australia. As we read in the press, the Prime Miniscling terial Task Group on Emissions Trading will provide their report to the Prime Minister later this week. Events to try to address mate change and energy consumption have gathered pace over the last two years. Just last week the British government released its white paper on energy; the G8 prepared to meet under the chairmanship of Germany, where climate change will be the dominant agenda item; and Japan shifted its position ahead of the G8 meeting by announcing a global target of 50 per cent reduction on global greenhouse emissions by 2050. I acknowledge that the APEC summit later this year will also be discussing climate change, but despite the apparent new discovery of climate change by the government it cannot escape the fact that for over a decade it has refused to concede that climate change is an enormous challenge both domestically and internationally. In this fast-changing debate, I am also mindful of the impact of climate change measures on the poor and disadvantaged. I am mindful of the point made by the Brotherhood of St Laurence in November last year. That is why I was so pleased to participate in the launch last Friday of Big Switch Projects. Wollongong and the Illawarra region generally, as many are aware, are heavily involved in coal mining and steel production. We host the Southern Hemisphere's most competitive steel production plant, at Port Kembla. But, at the same time, we are playing our role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and considering energy supply more efficient. BlueScope Steel is considering building a cogeneration plant at Port Kembla worth between $500 million and $900 million. It would generate electricity of 120-megawatt baseload and up to 220megawatt peaking. BlueScope has substantially reduced its use of fresh water in all plant production through an in-house recyprocess. On the foreshore of Lake Illawarra, a modern gas-fired power station is under construction on the site of a longcliclosed-down coal-fired power station, formerly known as Tallawarra. And, at the moment, carefully anchored just off Port Kembla, is the wave generation machine that uses the natural power of wave movement in the ocean to generate electricity. As climate change and energy continue to rank as major concerns among the Australian community, I am very pleased that Wollongong and the Illawarra region generally is playing its part in better and more efficient use of energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and innovation by research and development in renewable energy sources. The point was made by several speakers at Friday's meeting that it is equally as important to find new and cleaner methods of energy production as it is to find new, better and more efficient ways to use the energy that we do produce. There is no doubt that many people in the community are increasingly keen to play their own role in their own homes in contributing to that effort. That is why on 29 April this year, the leader of the Labor Party announced that a federal Labor government would introduce a program to offer Australian households low interest rate loans of up to $10,000 to help make existing homes greener and more energy and water efficient. Some of the items Australians will be able to purchase under this plan will include: solar panels; rainwater tanks; roof insulation; solar hot water heaters; highefficiency gas hot-water heaters, replacing electric storage systems; awnings; greywater recycling systems; and energy-efficient lighting. It is along the lines of the excellent state program that I saw on Friday. Federal Labor's $300 million solar, green energy and water renovations plan for Australian households is a practical way for Australian families to make a real difference on climate change. This is part of federal Labor's overall and comprehensive plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent on 2000 levels by 2050. The solar, green energy and water renovations plan for Australian households will save families money over time on their energy and water bills. So this plan not only will provide efficiencies in the use of energy for the greatest impact on greenhouse gas emissions but also has the potential to bring down the cost as a family budget item. This plan could generate up to $2 billion worth of green-inspired investment and benefit the small business sector, especially tradespeople. I am conscious of the vitality of the small business and trades sector based businesses, providing to homes things like water-recycling systems, water tanks, solar energy solutions and gas connections. In my electorate, I certainly see many of these businesses popping up now in once-vacant places. Labor's plan will make it easier and more cost-effective for families to refit their homes. Many programs at the moment focus on the requirements for newly built homes. I have talked to a lot of people who have established homes who are disappointed that their capacity to participate in this effort is limited by their ability to find the money up front to make the required changes. Labor's plan would introduce low interest rate loans of up to $10,000 to 200,000 Australian households with household incomes of up to $250,000, by 2012-to be repaid in line with their capacity to pay. Government accredited environmental audits will be carried out to identify how these households can cost-effectively reduce their energy and water use in their homes. There will be a free green renovations pack, which will provide tips for green living, energyefficient light globes, a shower timer and a water efficient shower head. There will be an option for families that prefer to borrow through their financial institutions to generate carbon offset credits through the voluntary carbon trading market. There will be help for households to save up to $800 a year on their energy and water bills and increase the value of their homes. I am sure many people are increasingly conscious that as they go to resell their homes the informed buyers are more often than not looking now for these innovations in the household. There will be a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by up to 15 million tonnes over the lifetime of the scheme. This one program is equivalent to taking around four million cars off the road for a year or planting another 15 million trees. The low interest rate program will begin in January 2009 and is expected to support 200,000 households over the period till 2012-13. As with all government programs, this plan will be revised based on the take-up and the success of the program. Federal Labor understands that governments, families and individuals can be partners in reducing household greenhouse gas emissions and reducing pressure on our stressed water systems. Water tanks, solar power, insulation and eco-friendly building materials can all make a big and important difference to the energy efficiency of a home. The more homes that can participate in such a program, the more efficient and eco-friendly our communities will become. (Time expired) Trade Unions",92
192,Mr HARDGRAVE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The past 11 years have been typified by a replenishment of the role of the individual in our society. Individual liberty has been most definitely at the forefront of the actions of this government. The fear is that later this year, because of some attraction to the jockey-do not mind the jockey; let us look at the horse-we could see a circumstance in Australia in which a government could be returned that does not govern for Australia but governs for the Labor Party and the trade union movement. ‘No ticket, no start' will be the mantra of their conduct. There would be an absolute attack on personal liberty, because the collective would override the individual at every turn. Let me put the case for why this would be so. One example would be the Commonwealth Public Sector Union, which, only a couple of months ago, commented that, if a Rudd government were returned at a later point in this year, all Commonwealth public servants would be required to join the Commonwealth Public Sector Union. This, it said, would not only make the union flush with funds but also give it the power, because of those funds, to purchase affiliation prowess within the Labor Party and the labour movement, give them additional leftwing votes and create the possibility for them to influence who was in the cabinet. Let us unbundle that. Individual public servants would be told, ‘No ticket, no start; you have to join the Commonwealth Public Sector Union.' Not only that; when they joined, the handful of people at the top of the tree in that union would start to decide who was in the cabinet of the country-the supreme policymaking body, which affects the lives of everyday Australians. Currently, only 17 per cent of people in private enterprise are in unions. But all of that would change with a change of government. No ticket would mean no start. The example of the Commonwealth Public Service would start a knock-on effect as every other union would begin to take a role in trying to suppress the growth of the Left through the Commonwealth Public Sector Union. We are already seeing this in places in Queensland, where a forced amalgamation of councils comes hand in glove with a statement from the Queensland government that members of the Australian Workers Union-a right-wing union-will in fact be placed, like worms in an apple, in every council that has been forcibly amalgamated with another one in order to coordinate the way that council operates. Am I hearing correctly? Yes. The state Labor government in Queensland will pay union officials to go and park themselves in councils and decide who stays and who goes; who is hired and who is fired. This is an insight into the way in which a federal Labor government would operate. There will be a union official beside every cash register in every small business in every part of Australia. They will decide who is hired, who is fired, what services are offered, what goods are made available, what time you open and what time you close. There is no doubt about it. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has entered the chamber and he will correct me if I am wrong, and I know that he will not correct me. Greg Combet is looking forward to the time when unions will run Australia again. Today in the House we heard another example of the way in which that CFMEU thug in Western Australia, Kevin Reynolds, is yearning for the opportunity to get rid of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner established by this government in 2005. Why did we establish that office? To get building and construction on a proper and legal footing and to allow individuals who want to work hard to get the opportunity to work and to progress. What we are now seeing in Western Australia-where the CFMEU have run roughshod over the Western Australian building industry for so many years and where the ‘blue flu' took people out of work sites for hundreds of days each year-is unemployment down to around two per cent. We have an example in Queensland and we have an example in Western Australia. Kevin Reynolds wants to see the end of the ABCC because they are using powers to hit unionists with individual writs of some $28,600 if they breach the agreed conditions, such as entry to work sites. Reynolds says that they are going to put their shoulder to the wheel to assist campaign to unseat the Howard government and that they are going to have the biggest celebration possible on the night that it is defeated. Labor's captivity to its union masters is a source of enormous concern for each of us on this side, and it should be of enormous concern for all thinking Australians. There will no promotions within state or federal government organisations or within businesses unless you are a member of the Labor Party. The Labor Party policy on industrial relations is all about this. They talk about workplace democracy, but what it means is that as long as a simple majority of the total number of workers in a particular workplace participate in a ballot then everybody else can please themselves. There was a fantastic article in the Courier-Mail of 24 May by Dr Paul Gollan of Macquarie University, who warned that if union heavies could get 51 per cent of a workplace to participate in a ballot then all they would have to do would be to get 51 per cent of them to vote one way to get what they want. You could end up with just 26 per cent of the total workforce telling the other 74 per cent what to do and how to go about it. You would see the good, the bad, the ugly, the lazy and the productive all getting paid the same. Individual enterprise, the freedom to negotiate and choice in the workplace would be denied people. I just do not understand why the Australian Labor Party cannot follow the advice of Rod Cameron, who said, quite rightly, the other week that people do not want unions back in their lives. They do not want a circumstance where they are told what to think by a selective group of people in a smoke filled room with the Tammany Hall logic of ‘If you don't agree with us, we'll get you' prevailing. I certainly do not want to see a Commonwealth Public Service that is as heavily politicised as we see in states like in the Queensland, where Labor Party membership means promotions, where loyalty to the Labor Party ahead of loyalty to Australia could create a seditious kind of environment-but that is exactly what the Australian Labor Party have planned for Australia. They have planned the return of the great tomato sauce strikes where, if you do not see tomato sauce in your workshop canteen, it is: ‘All out, brothers. All out until we get the tomato sauce.' These things happened in years past. We saw the great dim sim strikes at Darling Harbour because of the smell of dim sims wafting up from Sussex Street. It was not the smell of Labor Party headquarters; it was the dim sims from Chinatown which caused all the workers to go out on strike until they got a dim sim allowance. That was 20 years ago, and we have spent the last 11 years repairing the mess caused by the stupidity of the sorts of circumstances where wharfies went on strike if they were not allowed ‘the nick'that is, anything they could flog from any container that happened to have been opened. All I would say to anybody in Australian business-if you still decide to stay in business after this election if a Rudd government is returned-is: do not have a part container delivered to an Australian wharf, because we will be back to the situation where ‘the nick' will be back in vogue. We do not want a nation where allegiance to this political party, the Australian Labor Party, first and foremost is the way in which every business place, every state public servant and every federal public servant will operate. We do not want to see a circumstance where if you speak out, you will get kneecapped just like the poor member for Charlton who has been so poorly treated by the Australian Labor Party. She-and her father, with 48 years of membership of the Labor Party-spoke out against the union movement and she was simply abolished from the party, told to leave. It is a disgrace that the member for Charlton has been treated in the way she has been treated. We see the Queensland government advertising currently on radio and saying, ‘In small business if you need a workplace mentor, someone who understands how a small business operates, contact the Queensland government'-another worm in the apple, where a union affiliated public servant will arrive at your business, start to unpick it and then start to tell you how you should affiliate yourself with the Australian Labor Party at every turn. I promised myself 20 years ago that I would find an occasion to put on public record the time when I was a member of the Australian Journalists Association and I resigned from it when it affiliated with the ACTU. It went from being a professional organisation to just another union. After I rejoined, when I briefly worked for the ABC, I was told that my resignation of two years earlier was not officially recognised and I owed two years in back dues. That is the way the union movement in this country wants to operate again. How can it be fair in the workplace if you cannot be sacked for stealing from the boss, but you can be sacked if you do not join a union? Real workers are left out of the equation in Labor's planning for the workforce. Unions and their members are simply political playthings-a numbers game. The ALP has members in this place who are union members but they have never been on the tools. As far as I am concerned, this pompous lot opposite should never be given the chance to administer Australia in favour of the Labor Party. Stick with the Howard government which actually administers Australia in favour of all Australians.",95
193,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The time for the grievance debate has expired. The debate is interrupted and I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (A STRONGER SAFETY NET) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Hockey. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,97
194,Mr HOCKEY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"North Sydney-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (5.41 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Introduction Today I am introducing the Workplace Relations Amendment (A Stronger Safety Net) Bill 2007. This bill establishes a fairness test to strengthen the safety net for agreementmaking in the national workplace relations system. The new fairness test will enhance the safety net for over 7.5 million Australians making workplace agreements. It will allow employers and employees to modify or exclude protected award conditions, but only where employees are fairly compensated. The fairness test will guarantee employees fair compensation in lieu of conditions such as penalty rates and overtime and shift loadings. With this bill workers must be paid more, not less. The stronger safety net will provide significant additional protection for vulnerable employees, including young people and workers from a non-English-speaking background. This bill will reassure Australian workers that when they enter into a workplace agreement, it will be a fair one that has been approved by an independent statutory authority. This bill builds on the important employment and workplace relations reforms undertaken by this government in 1996 and again in 2006. This bill is an important part of an employment and workplace relations system that has helped reduce unemployment to a rate of 4.4 per cent and create more than two million jobs over the last 11 years. This bill will ensure that Australia's future economic prosperity is bolstered by a flexible and modern workplace relations system. It was never the intention that it may become the norm for protected award conditions such as penalty rates to be traded off without proper compensation. There was concern amongst some in the community, however, that trading off penalty rates and other loadings, without fair compensation, might occur with adverse consequences for final take-home pay. The introduction of the fairness test is accompanied by the establishment of two independent statutory offices-the Workplace Authority Director and the Workplace Ombudsman-to play pivotal roles in maintaining the safety net. This bill will require the Workplace Authority to apply the fairness test to ensure that workplace agreements provide fair compensation in lieu of protected award conditions such as penalty rates. If an agreement does not pass the fairness test, it will need to be changed so that it is fair and the employer will have to make up any back pay. The Workplace Ombudsman will ensure that employers comply with their legal obligations in regard to the fairness test. The Workplace Ombudsman will strengthen the policing role which has been undertaken by the Office of Workplace Services. The government is providing significant funding to ensure that these functions are well resourced. This legislation will make it clear that employers cannot dismiss an employee because a workplace agreement fails or may fail the fairness test. The legislation will also make it clear employers cannot coerce existing employees into modifying or removing protected award conditions. Finally, the legislation will also make it clear that when an employer takes over a business they cannot require an employee to sign an Australian workplace agreement as a condition of continued employment. For outworkers, the prohibition on the reduction of their special protections is retained unchanged. The changes introduced in this bill will ensure that the opportunities inherent in the national workplace relations system are used but not abused. The national system The Workplace Relations Act 1996 provides a national regulatory framework for Australian workers. The framework offers flexibility and choice for employees and employers in agreement making. This choice and flexibility is producing good outcomes for the economy, with sustainable and strong jobs growth and historically low unemployment a dominant feature of the economy. This choice and flexibility is essential meeting the work and family needs of working women and men. Australian working women and men also want a fair and robust safety net of working conditions protected by the law. And the system provides this, as well as strong, enforceable protections against discrimination and breaches of freedom of association. Since the reforms commenced in March 2006, more than 326,000 new jobs have been created-85 per cent of these are full-time. Significantly, the unemployment rate has dropped to 4.4 per cent in April 2007, its that lowest level since November 1974. Real wages, which have risen by 23.4 per cent over the life of the coalition government, have continued to grow, and strikes in 2006 reached the lowest level since records were first kept in 1913. The fundamentals of the government's reform remain intact. The goal of employment and workplace relations reform is to achieve better outcomes for both employers and employees through greater flexibility in employment arrangements in the workplace. and flexibilities The safety net Under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 entitlements such as minimum wages, annual leave, personal and sick leave and maternity and parental leave are set out in the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Agreements must still provide benefits equal to or better than the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard-that is, the entitlements in the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard cannot be traded off when workplace agreements are entered into. Protected award conditions are penalty rates, including for working on public holifor days and weekends, shift and overtime loadings, monetary allowances, annual leave loadings, public holidays, rest breaks and incentive based payments or bonuses. These protected award conditions are not mandated in agreements because to do so would limit flexibility in agreement making. However, they will not be able to be traded away without fair compensation. Fairness test The fairness test will apply to workplace agreements lodged on or after 7 May 2007. Where an agreement, including an agreement made before 7 May 2007, is varied the whole agreement will be subject to the fairness test if the variation excludes or modifies protected award conditions. The fairness test will apply to Australian workplace agreements covering employees with a gross basic salary of less than $75,000 per annum who are employed in an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions are usually regulated by an award, where the agreement excludes or modifies protected award conditions. There are more than 4,000 awards. In addition, all collective agreements covering employees in an industry or occupation in which the terms and conditions are usually regulated by an award and where the agreement excludes or modifies protected award conditions will be subject to the fairness test. How will the fairness test be conducted? As is currently the case, workplace agreements will operate from the day they are lodged with the Workplace Authority. The fairness test will require the Workplace Authority to be satisfied that a workplace agreement provides fair compensation to an employee in lieu of the exclusion or modification of protected award conditions. Protected award conditions will be drawn from the federal award which binds the employer or from the transitional instrument based on the relevant state instrument that applied prior to the commencement of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 on 27 March 2006. If there is no such instrument and the employee is working in an industry or occupation usually regulated by a federal award, the Workplace Authority will be able to designate an appropriate federal award. In deciding whether a workplace agreement passes or does not pass the fairness test, the Workplace Authority may inform itself in any appropriate way. In many cases, it will be able to assess an agreement based on the agreement and information lodged with it. For example, when the agreement is lodged employees will be able to include information about their personal circumstances, including their family responsibilities and the significance they attach to the particular workplace flexibilities for which they have traded off protected award conditions. The authority will also be able to contact the employees and the employer where necessary. Employees already receive an information statement when they are offered an AWA or collective agreement. This requirement is retained and will now also inform employees of their rights in regard to the fairness test. The fairness test will not involve legalistic hearings. The Workplace Authority will not arbitrate agreement outcomes. When considering whether a workplace agreement provides fair compensation, the Workplace Authority must first have regard to the monetary and non-monetary compensation that the employee or employees will receive in lieu of the protected award conditions. The bill defines non-monetary compensation as compensation for which there is a money-value equivalent or where a money value can reasonably be assigned and which confers a benefit or advantage on the employee that is of significant value to the employee. A meal provided by an employer to an employee who is regularly required to work overtime will not constitute adequate compensation in lieu of penalty rates for overtime. This means that, contrary to misleading claims that have been made, a slice of pizza will not constitute non-monetary compensation. In most cases it is expected that a higher rate of pay will be agreed to in lieu of protected award conditions that have been modified or removed. In establishing what is fair compensation the Workplace Authority must consider the work obligations of the employee or employees under the workplace agreement. For example, the Workplace Authority would consider whether employees were required to work shift work or on weekends and would otherwise have been entitled to penalty rates. The Workplace Authority may also have regard to the personal circumstances of employee or employees, in particular, their family responsibilities. For example, an agreement may well meet the fairness test where a parent wants an Australian workplace agreement that enables him or her to leave work one hour early on a weekday to collect his children from school and make up the time on a Saturday morning and be paid the normal hourly rate rather than the higher Saturday rate. Only in exceptional circumstances and where the Workplace Authority is satisfied that it is not contrary to the do so may the Workplace Authority also have regard to the industry, location or economic circumstances of the employer and the employment circumstances of the employee or employees in deciding whether fair compensation is provided. The Workplace Authority may decide it is appropriate to consider the economic circumstances of an employer when a workplace agreement is part of a reasonable strategy to deal with a short-term crisis. For example, employees working in a canning factory in a regional town negotiate a one-year agreement that excludes penalty rates so that the factory can remain competitive where the business is struggling due to the impact of the drought. This will keep the business alive and maintain jobs. This is similar to the public interest test that applied to workplace agreements prior to the commencement of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005. The changes I introduce today deliberately limit the circumstances in which agreements that would normally fail the test are able to operate. While it is necessary to allow for the situations where such agreements are appropriate, such agreements should be very much the exception and must not be contrary to the public interest. In the case of a collective agreement, the Workplace Authority must be satisfied that, on balance, the collective agreement provides fair compensation in its overall effect on the employees. This is similar to the way the previous no disadvantage test applied to workplace agreements. Like the no disadvantage test, where protected award conditions are removed or modified, employees will most often be compensated with a higher rate of pay for public interest to each hour worked. What if an agreement fails the fairness test? Where an agreement does not pass the fairness test, the Workplace Authority will provide advice to the employer and employee on how the agreement could be changed to make it fair. The employer and employee will have 14 calendar days to make the agreement fair. Fixing a failed agreement could be done by varying the agreement or making an undertaking, which would be enforceable. If an agreement is not fixed, it will cease to operate at the end of the 14-day period. The entitlements of the employee or employees will revert to the arrangements that would have applied to them had they not made the unfair agreement. This could be an earlier workplace agreement or the award. An employee with a designated award (and where no other workplace agreement is in place) will retain an entitlement to the tected award conditions from the designated award. Where an agreement initially fails the test, but is satisfactorily rectified, the employee will generally be entitled to compensation or back pay for the period during which the agreement was unfair. The employer will be expected to make up any back pay from the time the agreement was lodged for any entitlement the employee would otherwise have been entitled to. Where an agreement does not pass the fairness test and an employer does not compensate the employee or employees, the Workplace Ombudsman will be able to recover any shortfall in entitlements on behalf of the affected employees. A court may also impose a penalty if compensation is not paid. Will a proposed or draft agreement meet the fairness test? The Workplace Authority will offer a prelodgement assessment of proposed agreements against the fairness test. Either an employee or an employer can request a prelodgement assessment of a proposed agreement. This process helps people make fair and clear agreements from the start. It helps them to know where they stand in regard to protections, entitlements and obligations. It minimises the risk of a shortfall in payments where an agreement fails the fairness test. The pre-lodgement assessment of a proposed agreement is an administrative, rather than a legislative process. This is because the legislative fairness test can only be applied to a properly made and lodged agreement with identifiable parties. Where a pre-lodgement assessment is requested, the Workplace Authority will provide written advice indicating whether or not prothe agreement would pass the fairness test. Provided the circumstances have not changed when the agreement is lodged, prelodgement approval will result in consideration of the agreement being fast tracked on lodgement. The Workplace Authority The bill establishes the workplace authority director and deputy directors. The workplace authority director is to be appointed by the Governor General ensuring the independence of the office. In addition to conducting the fairness test, the workplace authority director will undertake the functions of the Employment Advocate, such as accepting the lodgement of workplace agreements and providing information about agreement-making. The Workplace Authority will have particular regard to the needs of workers in disadvantaged bargaining positions, such as young people and workers from a nonEnglish speaking background. The Workplace Authority, together with the Workplace Ombudsman, will receive extra funding of $370 million over four years to ensure its increased responsibilities are met. The Workplace Ombudsman The bill establishes the Workplace Ombudsman to be appointed by the Governor General, also ensuring independence of the office. The Workplace Ombudsman will undertake the functions of the Office of Workplace Services, such as assisting employees and employers in understanding their rights and obligations and promoting, monitoring and investigating compliance matters. The bill confers upon the Workplace Ombudsman the function of investigating breaches of the Workplace Relations Act, including in respect of the fairness test. The Workplace Ombudsman will be assisted in discharging his or her functions by having the power to appoint workplace inspectors. One of the key new roles will be enforcing the prohibitions on employers from dismissing an employee because an agreement has failed the fairness test, or coercing an existing employee to agree to give up their protected award conditions. The Workplace Ombudsman will focus on ensuring that young working Australians are not being unfairly treated in the workplace and conduct regular random audits to ensure employers are meeting their obligations to young people. The Workplace Ombudsman will receive extra funding of more than $60 million dollars-that is out of that $370 million-over four years to ensure its increased responsibilities are met. Conclusion This government has worked hard to create a balanced workplace relations regulatory framework that encourages job creation and allows Australian businesses to compete and grow. This bill provides a stronger safety net to underpin what is already an efficient system for a modern Australian economy. The flexibility and opportunity created by the government's workplace relations reforms have played a role in contributing to the growth of our economy and the economic prosperity shared by working Australian families. The changes I will introduce today build on this strong foundation. The changes ensure that choice and flexibility remain the fundamental building blocks of successful workplace arrangements. The changes reassure working Australians that protected award conditions cannot be traded away without fair compensation and the approval of an independent statutory authority.

Question agreed to. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 24 May, on motion by Mr Dutton: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Dr Emerson moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, House calls on the Government to implement Labor's BAS Easy option for simplifying GST bookkeeping requirements on small business with an annual turnover of less than two million dollars”.",103
197,Mr CREAN,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I rise in relation to the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007 to support the amendment moved by the member for Rankin. This bill provides some important measures to help small business. We support those measures but we strongly assert that they do not go far enough. In fact, these measures are too little and too late to deal with the mountain of paperwork and red tape that is swamping small business in this country. It is another desperate attempt by this government, after 11 years of, effectively, inactivity on the alleviation front but a lot of activity in adding red tape and burden to small business, to show that they are doing something because of the continuing complaints that come from small business about their inability to get on with what they want to dorunning effective businesses and being able to spend more time with their families instead of just filling out forms for the government or becoming unpaid tax collectors for the government's GST. Having said that there are some important initiatives in this legislation, the government have still baulked on an important measure, which I will come to later, that could alleviate or give the option to alleviate a significant burden that falls on business in being that GST tax collector. As for the measures in the bill which we welcome, effectively this legislation introduces a standard $2 million turnover threshold to obtain tax concessions. Prior to this legislation, there were a range of thresholds for different concessions. This was a terribly confusing situation. It was another example of the red tape nightmare that the govern the ment imposes on small business. So this step is welcome. Labor also supports the standardisation and the three definitions of aggregated turnover to determine if a business satisfies the threshold. We also support the provisions in this legislation to increase the capital gains tax maximum net assets threshold from $5 million to $6 million and we support the decision to remove the $3 million depreciating assets test from the simplified tax system. We, of course, support the GST cash accounting threshold going from $1 million to $2 million. But we are still very concerned that so few small businesses take advantage of the simplified tax system. In Senate estimates hearings last year we learnt that less than 30 per cent of small businesses access that system. Under the arrangements, small business can group assets and depreciate them much quicker to improve cash flow in the early years. This, you would have thought, was a welcome initiative, so why is it that so few avail themselves of it? I hope when the minister responds he can enlighten us more as to why so few businesses take advantage of this system. Finally, we support the increase in the GST registration threshold from $50,000 to $75,000. This is an initiative that the Leader of the Opposition called for earlier in the year, and we welcome the government embracing this initiative that Labor put forward. As welcome as those measures are, they do not go far enough in easing the pressure on small businesses, the burden of red tape. After 11 years of inaction and of promising when they came to office to have the amount of red tape, these measures are too little too late and a further desperation in the government's desperate throes to try to pretend that they are doing something that they have neglected for so long. I remind the House of the Prime Minister's commitment back in 1996, when he made a promise to ‘cut red tape for small business by 50 per cent'. What happened when the government won office? We had a review, the late Charlie Bell review, soon after the government came to office. That was followed by a report, a big launch and a lot of words, but no effective action. And then we had another report, the Banks report. Not only did those reports not ease the problem; plenty of additional measures added to the red tape and the paperwork. The most significant measure that added to this red tape, of course, was the introduction of the GST and the mountain of paperwork that that involved. Instead of saying to small businesses: ‘We want you to do what you're best at. We want you to get on with running your business. We want you to have the time to spend with your family,' this government turned every small business into an unpaid tax collector for them. Tax collections through the GST now net in excess of $40 billion-a tax, I might say, the government say is not really theirs. I was almost gobsmacked last week when I heard the Treasurer get up in this House in question time and argue that this budget will see a lessening of the tax burden in proportion to the GDP. The problem in arriving at that proportion is that he left out the GST; he left out the $40 billion.",104
198,Dr EMERSON,MAIN COMMITTEE,The orphan tax.,105
199,Mr CREAN,MAIN COMMITTEE,This was the great saviour of the nation that he now does not want to own-the orphan tax. That is what the GST is. Mr Dutton-Are you still opposed to it?,105
200,Mr CREAN,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Why don't you count it honestly, Minister; that is my point. You are the ones who have argued for it, you are the ones who have imposed the burden.",105
201,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,Order!,105
202,Mr CREAN,MAIN COMMITTEE,The minister has asked the question and I am trying to respond.,105
203,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,Ignore the interjections and keep going.,105
204,Mr CREAN,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Why is it that the government are not honest with the Australian public and admit it is their tax? If they do admit that, as everyone else accepts-including the Australian Bureau of Statistics, who counts it-then the proportion of tax under this government has increased and will continue to increase despite the tax cuts that are included in the budget. They are the highest taxing government in the history of this country. The only way in which this government can try to pretend they are not is by ignoring and not counting the $40 billion of GST revenue. No person in business can ignore the tax. No person can pretend it is not there. They have to collect it and they have to go through the paperwork to satisfy the government's needs, but this government want the luxury of pretending it is not their tax. We did have an attempt on the part of the government to not have the tax imposed. I remember when Mr Macfarlane, a former minister for small business, wanted to run a fundraising function for his seat of Groom and operated on the basis of advice from the Liberal Party in Queensland that GST was not required to be paid. I remember something like that. There was supposed to have been a tax report clearing the minister of these wrongdoings. That report has never seen the light of day. This was a former minister for small business who thought it was such a fantastic tax that every small business in the country should collect it and pay it, except his FEC. What sort of double standard is that, Mr Deputy Speaker? Six years on from the introduction of this GST, we now have a massive compliance burden. The government has not reduced red tape by 50 per cent. It has not reduced it at all. It has sively increased it. What did the government then embark on? It said that it would have another review. The Banks review was established in October 2005, it reported and the report was released in April 2006. It highlighted many of the concerns of small business concerning regulation, red tape and compliance. This bill attempts to adopt a number of the recommendations. But I want to use the time that is left to me to go to the GST compliance issue, because I think this is terribly important and there is an easy solution. Labor has been proposing it since 2001. It is called BAS Easy. Mr Dutton-You've never been in small business, not one of you.",105
205,Mr CREAN,MAIN COMMITTEE,"The minister wants to parrot on in ignorance and ignore the real solutions that will help ease the red tape burden on small business. Labor proposed a concept called BAS Easy as far back as 2001. It was developed when I was the shadow Treasurer and with the assistance of the member for Rankin. Previous leaders of the Labor Party announced it, including me in that role. At the time this initiative was announced, it was criticised by the Treasurer. He had not even read the detail but he criticised it. He then moved to a position in which he criticised it, on the one hand, because it would cost business more but, on the other hand, because it would cost revenue more. How can it do both? The Treasurer, as always, was never across the detail. He is only the show-pony performer in this chamber in question timealways lazy on the job, lazy on the detail and not prepared to understand the sorts of burdens that small businesses are under. He has ignored a real proposal that could have had strong bipartisan support. The proposal that we put forward was called the ratio method. It effectively said, masbased on one's past history in terms of GST remittances, let us give small business the option of a system for GST tax remittance that would essentially involve two boxes. One box, on the approval of the tax office, would include the ratio of GST that should be submitted and the second box would contain the turnover of that business for the quarter in question. The quarter in question was the calculation that businesses had to make-but they have to do it anyway. They have to know what their turnover is. The simple calculation would have been the turnover for the quarter times the ratio. We made sure that there would be no requirement for reconciliation at the end of the accounting period. You cannot get a simpler system than that. Why wouldn't it be embraced? The truth of it is that the government has embraced it in part. But if it has embraced it in part, why not extend it as an option to all small businesses? I ask the minister to tell us, when he gets up to respond in this debate, why he has not done it. I said that there would be two simple boxes. The ratio could be arrived at by two methods: a snapshot method where the business could opt to have it determined at two different points in a 12-month cycle or a business norm. Business norms, interestingly enough, are already embraced by this government when it comes to the mixed food business, so it is possible and we know that the tax office has already identified business norms in certain professions. From memory, it has identified them for a whole range of initiatives in the case of retailers of mixed businesses. It has identified those norms in relation to, for example, retail trade at 0.87 per cent; the wholesale trade at 0.77 per cent; accommodation, cafes and restaurants at 0.87 per cent; property and business services at 0.76 per cent; cultural and recreational services at 0.65 per cent; and personal services at 0.80 per cent. Clearly, there is the capacity for the tax office to identify the norms. We ask: why shouldn't small businesses be able to exercise this option in whatever category they operate? As I said, we proposed this initiative six years ago. Small businesses in this country could have had the relief we were urging six years ago. We also proposed the $2 million threshold. We are pleased that the government have at least embraced the $2 million threshold but we want to see the BAS Easy notion extended to small business. Interestingly enough, the government have introduced what are called SAMs, simplified accounting methods, but only for retailers that sell food. That is what they did way back. Under division 123 of the tax act the commissioner can create SAMs that some retailers can choose to exercise. It does not provide the past history method but it does provide for the schedules method, the business norm method. It only goes to, if you like, the one form of simplified BAS Easy and it is limited in its application only to those that sell food. In 2006 the Banks review said it should be extended to restaurants, cafes and caterers, and in October 2006 it was extended to them. But the question that I again pose to the minister for response when he gets to the table is this: if it is to be extended to other food retailers, why not make it available to all businesses? The machinery is there, the option is there, the principle is there, so why does it have limited application? In the 2007 budget we had the interesting circumstance where the government claimed it was adopting this BAS Easy approach. It basically said that the SAM could be extended to all entities that have mixed supplies, taxable and GST-free, or mixed businesses. But from my reading of the bill-and perhaps the minister can enlighten us-it still seems to be restricted essentially to food businesses, because the businesses have to be mixed suppliers of both taxable and GSTfree goods. Why not all businesses? That is the question that I pose to the minister. Labor has come forward with an initiative, a practical initiative, that can ease the red tape burden on small businesses as the unpaid tax collectors of this country. This government has ignored Labor's call to embrace it in a bipartisan way; the government is pretending to have embraced it. We have seen no legislation come forward to amend the tax act to extend the BAS Easy option beyond the food sectors of industry. I ask the minister: if the Treasurer announced on budget night that he was going to extend the principle of the SAM, when we are going to see the legislation that extends it to all businesses in this country? That is what the small businesses of this nation want to know tonight. They want to know from this government when it is going to lift the red tape burden. I say this to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley: Labor are committed to lifting the red tape burden. We have been committed to doing that for some years. This government has ignored those calls. This is smart policy. It deserves bipartisan support. But, as usual, the government has squibbed it because it has failed to understand the important ramifications for small business.",106
206,Mr DUTTON,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (6.23 pm)-in reply-I start by thanking those members who have taken part in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007. I will address very quickly the contribution made by the member for Hotham and, on behalf of small business in this country, say to him that they, like me, would shudder at his response and the suggestion that he, a former ACTU boss",108
207,Dr EMERSON,MAIN COMMITTEE,I knew it wouldn't take long tonight-straight into it!,108
208,Mr DUTTON,MAIN COMMITTEE,"and his esteemed colleague ‘the Academic', the two of them, were able to come up with as a way forward for small business: ‘We're here from the ACTU and we're here from the university and we're here to help you.' ‘We're the champions of small business,' the Labor Party say, but none of them has been in small business. They are the champions of small business, but none of them has run a small business successfully. Certainly, in the case of 80 per cent of them, none has had the capacity to indulge in a career outside of the union movement. And they are expecting small businesses in this country to believe that they have the capacity to show small business the way forward and to improve the Australian economy.",108

211,Mr DUTTON,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Of course, the point that the member for Rankin failed to add in his contribution was that it started out as a business and then he worked it into a small business. That is a point that needs to be made.",108
212,Dr EMERSON,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order.",108
213,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"This had better not be a frivolous point of order, Member for Rankin.",108
214,Dr EMERSON,MAIN COMMITTEE,"No, it is not. I find that offensive and it is totally incorrect. I ask that the Assistant Treasurer withdraw that comment.",108
215,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,There is no point of order.,108
216,Mr DUTTON,MAIN COMMITTEE,"The point here tonight is that the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007 amends the law to make it easier for up to two million Australian businesses to determine their eligibility for a range of small business concessions. The current tax laws contain a number of special concessions for smaller businesses. The issue is that the law defines ‘small business' in different ways and, in the past, each tax type has had its own set of eligibility criteria based on the particular group of taxpayers being targeted for assistance. Each definition was tailored to the specific characteristics, policy objectives and constraints of each particular tax concession. The managed separate eligibility criteria determining what is a small business, however appropriate when considered individually, are a source of complexity and unnecessary compliance costs for small businesses. This bill collapses all of I those many definitions into just one based on aggregate turnover. The bill also delivers on a number of the government's 2006-07 budget announcements, including increasing the capital gains tax maximum net assets threshold from $5 million to $6 million, increasing the goods big and services tax cash accounting turnover threshold from $1 million to $2 million and extending the rollover relief available under the uniform capital allowance system to small business entities who use the simplified depreciation rules. This bill demonstrates what the government has demonstrated time and again: its commitment to reducing the red tape and compliance costs for Australian businesses-in this instance, Australian small businesses. Over the past decade, the government's strong economic performance has seen both individuals and businesses benefit from lower taxes and greater incentives to save and to invest. Now 80 per cent of individual taxpayers have a top marginal tax rate of less than 30 per cent and businesses face a top tax rate of 30 per cent. Real household wealth has doubled since 1996, and business profits are now at record highs. These results have not been achieved by good fortune alone but as a consequence of a clear economic philosophy and experience. The member for Rankin has moved a second reading amendment asking the House to call on the government to implement amendments to the GST law to assist small businesses. The member might not have paid attention to the budget speech, but the government announced four initiatives to make the GST easier for small businesses. Firstly, would like to note that the GST was part of the A New Tax System package, which is the most comprehensive and successful tax reform in Australia's history and one Labor opposed at every step. The GST replaced a narrowly based and inefficient tax system and broadened the tax base to cover the services sector. What Labor always refuse to acknowledge about the introduction of the GST is that it removed sales tax, it removed stamp duty on marketable securities, it removed the BAD tax and it removed the FID-it removed all those taxes and moreand that is part of the reason why this economy is in good shape today. People who are listening to this debate night, particularly those in small business and those who are trying to balance their family budget, should recognise that Labor opposed this economic reform every step of the way. They stand condemned for that stance again tonight. Although Labor now make themselves out to be economic conservatives and people who could continue to manage the Australian economy well in the future, they have opposed every step that this government has taken, particularly in relation to tax reform. The states and territories are much better off with this broad based, secure and growing revenue source. The GST is expected to generate $42 million in revenue in 200708-and I remind the House that it is the states and territories, not the federal government, that benefit from every cent of GST revenues. This government recognises that tax compliance can present a challenge for small businesses. There is no doubt about that. The government has demonstrated time and time again, though, that where possible we take steps to simplify taxes for small business. To that end, the budget included four measures to simplify the GST for small I business. Of course, those measures are in addition to the significant changes that are contained in the bill that is now before the House. The government announced a start date of 1 July 2007 for all these changes and, in accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement on Commonwealth-State Financial Relations, changes to the GST base require the unanimous agreement of the states and territories. The government has sought the relevant approval from the states and territories and, once that approval is obtained, I will move quickly to bring the changes before the parliament. I do suggest tonight, though, that Labor members contact their state Labor colto- leagues if they wish to expedite the process-and while the member for Rankin is talking to his Labor colleagues about this, he may also wish to discuss the payroll tax that they rip out of business. His comments about inconsistent payroll tax bases are a matter for the states and territories, and this government cannot be held responsible for Labor's continuing mistakes in running the state governments. The member for Rankin also raised concern about the take-up rate for the simplified tax system. The take-up rate for the STS has been reflective of any new system, in that the number of taxpayers entering the STS has steadily increased since its introduction in 2001-and some 850,000 small businesses are in the STS. The bill before the House today introduces a new small business framework. The framework removes the elect-in element of the STS and, from 1 July 2007, small business taxpayers will be able to access any of the STS concessions so long as they are a small business entity. This bill is expected to further increase take-up of the already successful and popular STS concessions. Through all of these debates the point remains that the coalition government has been responsible for reducing interest rates for small business from where they were under Labor-at about 20 per cent-down to the levels they are at today. The government has been responsible for driving the unemployment rate down from over 10 per cent under Labor to 4.4 per cent now-a 32-year low. We have employed 326,000 people over the last two months, and two million since we have been in government. The Labor Party have opposed us on every measure that we have put up to help small business, to reform the Australian economy, to make sure that we can build on the successes that we have maintained over the last 10 years and to set ourselves up for continued economic prosperity into the future. People, particularly those in small business, should be reminded of those facts on a day-by-day basis. In particular, they should be reminded that the Labor Party, which is now dominated by the unions-with more than 80 per cent of their front-bench having been either a former union boss or a union hack in some other form-would stand against small business in this place if they were ever elected to government. People in small business recognise that small businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy. If we want to see small business in this country broken, then we need a return to a Labor government. Small business does not deserve that, Australian families do not deserve that and the Australian economy does not deserve that. I thank those who have participated in this debate, and I commend the bill to the House.",108
217,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Mr Quick)the The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Rankin has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. There being more than one voice calling for a division, in accordance with standing order 133 the division is deferred until after 8 pm. Debate adjourned.

218,Mr MCARTHUR,RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"Prior to the break in this debate on the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2007 and cognate bill, I noted that this legislation provides for the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation to be replaced by a proposed new company, Forest and Wood Products Australia. This new company will, for the first time, be able to use levy funds promote the environmental values of the use of wood products and the use of wood products harvested from forests. The new company will invest industry funds into research and development to support improvements in productivity and efficiency in the industry. The research work of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation has been well respected by those in the industry, and we look forward to the new organisation delivering results to help improve the competitiveness of the forestry and wood products industry. During the budget sitting week, I had the pleasure of escorting around the parliament Mr Stuart Bennett, Director of Midway Wood Products. Mr Bennett formerly managed a very successful timber mill at Birregurra in the Corangamite electorate and maintains an active involvement in the industry. Mr Bennett indicated to me that a need exists to do more work on plantation tree species, especially for hardwood and sawlogs. Mr Bennett stated that the improved genetics of pine trees had resulted in a 15 per cent boost to yield over time, demonstrating the benefits of research. This is an endorsement of the current R&D corporation and justification of the government's policy to 2007 maintain support for forest and wood products research and development in the new company. From a processing perspective, Mr Bennett advised that the quality of wood is better when sourced from plantations because the trees are the same age and of consistent type and are therefore less costly to process than timber sourced from forests. But, in a cautionary note, Mr Bennett made the point that it has not yet been proven that a suitable quantity of sawlogs will be grown in plantations to meet long-term demand. This is a key challenge for the domestic timber industry. Where will the industry source suitable to timber supplies? I note that, in his second reading speeches on these bills, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry confirmed industry support for the legislation, for the establishment of a new company and for its new, broadened roles. The industry supports these measures because they will help timber workers and timber communities respond to challenges facing the sector. The challenges include: difficulties in attracting private investment for plantations, an undersupply of softwood and hardwood sawlogs, restrictions on harvesting from native forests and ongoing attacks on the industry from radical environmental extremists. Finally, the establishment of the new company, Forest and Wood Products Australia, through these bills will be necessary to support the forestry industry, because it is an industry under threat as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, would know. There has been a determined campaign waged against the forestry sector over many years which has sought to marginalise the industry and put the future of the industry and forest workers' jobs at risk. Opponents of the sector have gone about the total destruction of the industry with a religious-like zeal. Not only have our foresters been forced out of many of the nation's forests but there are also groups which now seek to wipe out the plantation sector. Mr Anthony Amis, representing the misnamed Friends of the Earth, recently wrote in the Age newspaper, dated 4 April 2007, attacking the plantation sector and blaming it for causing all kinds of ills from water pollution, air pollution and toxic waste to crumbling roads. There could be no more renewable an industry than the timber industry, where you can grow a tree, cut it down and coppice another tree to grow in its place. This simple fact of life seems lost on Friends of the Earth, who want to force foresters out of forests, close down plantations and presumably source the future supply of Australia's wood and paper needs from environmentally devastating and ethically bankrupt logging in the Amazon and sensitive environments in Third World nations. While Friends of the Earth would see sensitive world forests bulldozed to supply Australian timber, the Prime Minister has recently announced the establishment of a Global Initiative on Forests and Climate. The Australian government has committed $200 million to kick off this measure to protect world forests. In announcing this initiative, the Prime Minister recognised that almost 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from clearing the world's forests. More than 4.4 million trees are removed every day world wide. In contrast to the arm waving by Friends of the Earth, the Howard government's $200 million commitment to this initiative will support new forest planting, limit destruction of the world's remaining forests and promote sustainable forest management. This is a key, practical measure to help stop denuding forests in developing nations. The government's clear support for Australian timber workers and a sustainable forest industry can be contrasted with the Labor Party, which proposed a disastrous policy for Tasmanian forest industries at the last election. Former Labor leader Mark Latham sold out Tasmanian timber workers and their families during the 2004 election. It is good that this legislation allows the forestry industry to promote itself. Concerns about Labor's policy remain within the forestry industry. Even some Labor MPs are concerned about Labor's policy, as was taken to their national conference just a few weeks ago. Steve Lewis, writing in the Australian on Monday, 2 April 2007, reported: One frontbencher expressed concern at the draft policy, which is based on “no overall loss of jobs in the industry” while leaving open the prospect of locking up further old-growth forests. “You can't have it both ways because Tasmanians can't be conned,” the MP said. That is right. The opposition leader cannot have it both ways. He tries to walk both sides of the street on most issues, but the Australian people know that is not possible. It is disappointing that the opposition environment spokesman is not contributing to this debate. It would be very helpful if the member for Kingsford Smith would come in here and speak in support of the timber workers, but we all know that he will not because he wants to close the timber industry down. The opposition spokesman wants to force timber workers out of native forests. That is why he will not step into this chamber and speak in favour of this particular legislation. Labor MPs know the opposition spokesman cannot be trusted on this issue. I, again, quote Steve Lewis in the Australian, of 3 April 2007: Although Labor MPs believed Mark Latham's 2004 Tasmanian forestry policy was dead and buried, Peter Garrett seems determined to resurrect at least part of it. Labor's climate change spokesman says he is determined to hold on to that part of the draft policy platform which clearly states that Labor in office will consider further protection of Tasmania's old growth forests. In the context of the threats faced by the forestry and wood products industry, I note the comments by Tasmanian Premier, Paul Lennon, following the ALP national conference: “I'm fed up with Tasmanian forestry workers and their families being election bait … “I don't want the looming federal election to be another period of uncertainty and worry for them … Premier Lennon was obviously unimpressed with the federal Labor Party's position, which, once again, has the potential to sell out timber workers. The Forest Industries Association of Tasmania is quite clear on what it thinks of Labor's policy. FIAT Executive Director Terry Edwards told the Hobart Mercury on 30 May 2007 that if Labor's policy is: … exactly as it reads-additional reservationthen as happened at the last federal election we'll be campaigning against the Labor Party. It is disappointing that Labor is sending such negative signals to forest workers. It is a sign of just how much these new reforms are needed to allow the forestry industry, working cooperatively as a whole, to promote their industry and the benefits of sustainable timber harvesting. I am pleased to speak on these bills in support of our forest industries, timber workers and their families. I personally have been a long-time supporter of sustainable forest industries and the use of good science in forestry. The Howard government has supported our timber industries and contributes to research and development which promotes improved tree species and a more competitive production timber system. I commend these bills to the House.",111
219,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to address the issue of the forestry industry and what I regard as an important bill, the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2007. The opposition is also paying close attention to the outcome of the Senate committee's consideration of this matter. In response to the comments by the member for Corangamite, it is interesting to note that the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources has not chosen to speak in this debate. Many in the industry are fearful of the minister's real views because we all appreciate that he represents an inner-city, very Sydney-centric seat which is becoming more and more marginal. It contains what is best described as a large percentage of doctors' wives, who have a particular view about the timber industry-which is, close it down at the first available opportunity. If the polls continue as they are currently, then we will wait and see what the environment minister's real, private position is-if it is publicly declared-with respect to the future of the forestry industry, especially given his decision to close down the mining industry on Christmas Island. He has put at serious risk the future livelihood of many workers on Christmas Island in his endeavour to play to the gallery and say, ‘I am the saviour of rainforests in Australia.' This debate cuts both ways. Just as I am very supportive of the community forestry agreement in Tasmania-which, I remind the member for Corangamite, provides for additional reserves-I am also concerned about the future of Christmas Island. It is an island that has very serious economic challenges ahead of it because of its long-term dependency on the superphosphate industry. It is our responsibility during this process of transition to work with the local community to, if possible, transfer some mining reserves to some forest reserves. It is very clear on the basis of the evidence to date that reforestation is working very successfully on Christmas Island. So as far as I am concerned, the member for Lingiari is correct. The minister for the environment, Mr Turnbull, representing a very inner-city seat, has chosen to basically put the future of Christmas Island at risk because he is not concerned about the long-term viability of the forestry industry in Australia; he is more concerned about potential Green preferences. I raise those issues here seriously because this is a very serious debate. That is why we support the proposal to establish a new company under the Corporations Act 2001 to be called Forest and Wood Products Australia. This new body will replace the former statutory authority, the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. As its name implies, this was focused on research into and the development of the forestry industrywhich is exceptionally important. The forestry industry is not an industry that is ing still; it is an industry which is vitally concerned with research and development. This new body will not only accept research and development responsibilities but will also be expanded to appropriately take on marketing and promotional activities as well. As a former shadow minister for forestry and someone who is vitally concerned with rural and regional communities in Australia, I think this initiative is long overdue. I would like to see the industry expand, especially with respect to the growth in plantations in Northern Australia. Such an initiative-now that we have some stability with respect to the future of the managed investment schemes, which the member for Corangamite has such serious concerns aboutmight encourage investors in Aboriginal communities to pursue plantations, which would create long-term, viable employment opportunities and economic opportunities for those people in Indigenous communities, which are seriously suffering economically at the moment. Research and development, especially in those tropical regions, is therefore vitally important to the future capacity to expand the forestry industry in Australia. As we appreciate, the industry faces great challenges, some of which were touched on in passing by the member for Corangamite. We know that that is partly related to the fact that, because of public pressure, there is an ongoing campaign, based not on scientific evidence but on emotion, to lock more and more forests away from commercial forestry. Further loss of resources has occurred through bushfires. The industry faces threats to its markets through misguided campaigns against Australian forestry and timber products more generally. Sawmills and timberprocessing facilities are struggling. They are struggling to keep going and to make the innovations and investments needed to maintain a viable industry for the future. Let us standhope that this new company, Forest and Wood Products Australia, can play a driving role to advance the industry and secure that future. The selection of its board is very important. Again I find myself supporting the comments of the member for Corangamite. The board must comprise members who represent all the stakeholders in the industrywith the appropriate qualifications, skills, knowledge, expertise and energy to drive the future of Australian forestry. They must also be prepared to stand up and be counted in terms of being committed to the industry. I therefore encourage the government to include the National Secretary for the CFMEU's Forestry and Furnishing Products Division, Michael O'Connor. He has always fought courageously for the industry, its workers and its communities dotted around regional Australia. Sometimes, unfortunately, Michael O'Connor has found himself standing alone. It has sometimes been hard for some employers to have the courage to stand in the front line with him. Michael knows that in parts of rural Australia when the forestry industry goes so does the local community-the local doctor, the local school, the local sporting or netball team, the chemists and a variety of other facilities disappear from these communities if the forestry industry disappears. It is central to the future ability of many small and medium sized communities in rural, remote and regional Australia. So we have to make sure that we get on this board people who are committed to the industry and have the knowledge and expertise to actually drive it so that we can guarantee a viable future for the industry. I would also add that Timber Communities Australia has been a strong, tireless and loyal advocate for the industry. Having a member representing that organisation would add strength and diversity to the board and recognise the significant contribution of that organisation to Australian forestry over many years. It has also been a courageous advocate for the future of this industry. That is about strength, because the industry has many enemies. The success of this new organisation may well make or break the industry. It will be essential for it to focus on internationally competitive, environmentally sustainable practices, innovation and the production of high-quality forest and timber products. Just as importantly, it will defend Australian forestry and timber products in domestic and international markets through its promotional and marketing activities. As I have said many times before, no forestry policy will ever go far enough for the Green movement. They will simply shift the goalposts at every opportunity. There will be no end to this struggle in their minds. As far as they are concerned, nothing short of shutting down forestry, coal and airline industries in Australia will ever be good enough. It is forgotten that Australia's forest and wood products industries contribute about two per cent of Australia's GDP and directly employ more than 83,000 people. This is one of our largest manufacturing industries and it is the lifeblood of many rural and regional communities throughout Australia. Although we are both a net producer and exporter of timber in volume terms, we unvifortunately have a significant trade deficit in forest products of around $2 billion. So it is important that we grow both our domestic and export markets to offset that deficit. It is economically smart and clever for Australia. If collectively the industry, the unions and the timber communities do not conquer the agenda of the Greens and their fellow travellers, the truth is they will conquer our great forest industries and Australia will be the poorer for it. That is why it is absolutely essential for the friends of the industry to unite on issues like certification, fire management, catchment management and the role of forests in climate change policy. We, as a nation, have unfortunately spent the last 30 years increasingly locking Australia's forests away from the forest industries in national parks. But the managers of our forest conservation assets could learn a lot from the forestry industry, and I hope this will also be a focus of Forest and Wood Products Australia when it comes to research and development, marketing and promotion. Four years ago the Pilliga State Forest in New South Wales was one of the world's finest timber resources for white cypress pine. White cypress pine needs to be managed. It needs to be thinned to allow it to grow, and it germinates only in rare events initiated by favourable climatic conditions. These germination events may be several decades apart, and when they occur the young seedlings come up so thick that, as legend would have it, ‘a dog cannot bark in it'. If the seedlings are not thinned they quickly reach a stage when their growth is curtailed. That means that trees in a forest might be 50 to 80 years of age but still only few metres high and with diameters of only a few centimetres. In that situation they create a monoculture, and a monoculture in a forest is not desirable because it leaves no ground cover and creates perfect conditions for erosion and land degradation. Let us deal with a bit of science. We understand that the Greens and their fellow travellers are not interested in such a complex debate. It goes to proper management: when such forests are managed, biodiversity flourishes and erosion and fires can be controlled and managed. There were an estimated 15,000 koalas living in the managed part of Pilliga State Forest before it was fectively locked up four years ago, and it was a favoured place for wildflower devotees. But in December last year, after four years of so-called conservation and no management, a hot fire destroyed the Pilliga, the koalas and the wildflowers. Gone are 420 jobs, which are so important to regional New South Wales, and, interestingly, a timber industry in north-western New South Wales worth $38.4 million. That is nothing to be sniffed at. By the time Christmas arrived last year, 700,000 hectares of forest in eastern Australia, much of it in national parks, had gone up in smoke. By the end of summer more than one million hectares were lost-‘lock it up, forget it and do not manage it', is the catch cry of many in the environmental movement-more than 16 times the annual average amount of forest harvested by our worldclass forestry industry. What a comparison. But let us not deal with the facts. Some people do not want a factual debate, just an emotional debate-especially as we move closer to state and federal elections-so that they can do yet another dirty little Green deal with preferences. Interestingly too, 40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere as a result of those fires. a According to a CSIRO scientist, we also lost 370 million animals in this summer's bushfires alone. As the forests regenerate their thirst for water will be insatiable. At a time of a deep drought this is the No. 1 concern of most Australians. Where is the evidence that native animal and plant species are better protected in national parks than state or privately managed forests? There is none at all. But this unfortunately is not a one-off. Back in 2003 we lost more than three million hectares to bushfires in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT. Thousands of hectares of mountain ash forests in our alpine regions ef- were wiped out and there has been practically no regeneration of the species in national park areas, unlike commercial forestry areas which use proven silvicultural practices to ensure regeneration of all species harvested. The 2003 forest fires also released 130 million tonnes of CO2-about a quarter of Australia's total annual greenhouse emissions. Equally significant, studies predict a reduction of up to a fifth of the water flowing into the Murray-Darling Basin region as a result of the regeneration of those forests. It is estimated that the regrowth from the 2003 bushfires will use 430 billion litres of water a year for the next 50 years. There is much more to this drought than people realise. The question has to be asked whether it is time to rethink our management strategies when it comes to national parks. If we believe in climate change we are going to have to confront issues such as the thinning of our national parks forests to save water in our catchments and prevent fires-a strategy that the forestry industry has employed for over a hundred years. We are going to have to confront the issue that perhaps cattle grazing in our alpine areas was good fire management practice and less environmentally harmful than the devastating fires that have ripped through our national parks in the absence of any active management. The Greens are opposed to active management of our national parks, but the evidence when it comes to forest conservation is firmly stacking up on the side of the forestry industry. I hope this is the message Forest and Wood Products Australia can effectively deliver to our domestic and international markets, and to those in our community who have been subject to misinformation campaigns for way too long. It is time, too, for the industry to stand up for itself and, instead of jumping into bed with the green groups as the easy way out of secondary boycotts, take on the fight with the CFMEU's forestry division and the timber communities in the interests of better national conservation and industry outcomes for Australia and the world at large. More also needs to be done in terms of social outcomes-not only in saving the dying timber communities in places like Baradine but also in building new opportunities, particularly in Indigenous communities like Port Keats-Wadeye, building on the success of ventures like those in the Tiwi Islands. The industry also has a great opportunity to capitalise on the carbon sequestration benefits of forests and timber products. This is a huge challenge. The world's forests and soils store more than a trillion tonnes of carbon, twice as much as is in the atmosphere, and they have the potential to absorb 10 to 20 per cent of total global emissions from now to 2050. In Australia, the annual net sink in forests and wood products is about 10 per cent of total greenhouse emissions. It is growing trees that sequester carbon most rapidly, generally early in their lifecycle. So managed forests are very important in terms of carbon absorption-hence the interest of the Indigenous community. And it is time that green hypocrisy when it comes to the proper utilisation of wood waste was ended. About five million cubic metres of timber residues are generated from commercial forest harvest operations each year, very little of which is burnt for power generation. If an extra four million cubic metres of that waste was used, 30 per cent of the MRET would be met overnight. Yesmeeting an MRET through the forestry industry. That is a real challenge to the so called environmental movement. But wood residues account for less than five per cent of MRET certificates, because wholesalers and retailers are too frightened of secondary boycotts by environmental NGOs to sell power generated from them; it is not politically correct. I hope Forest and Wood Products Australia have the courage to front up to this issue and do something about it. It is part of the greenhouse debate. There are also new opportunities for wood residues and timber crops when it comes to alternative transport fuels. I am referring to lignocellulosic ethanol. There is a growing ethical debate about food versus fuel, with ethanol in Australia produced from starch, grain or sugar. In the United States and South America, diversion of land from food to biofuels production is already driving up the price of food. Mexican corn prices have doubled in the last year, forcing the government to put a ceiling on tortilla prices. Sugar prices have also doubled, and that is why Australian sugar producers are more interested at this moment in the sale of their cane for sugar than for ethanol. Countries all around the world are now considering biofuels production from various crop sources, and these will be grown on land that previously grew food-or else on newly-cleared forest land. Interestingly, 80 per cent of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions arise from the deforestation of the Amazon basin, mainly to grow sugar cane for-guess what-ethanol. This dilemma comes at a time when climate change is also perceived as a threat to world food supplies and when drought in Australia is of great concern to all of us. As a Science Alert reported a couple of weeks ago, the industrial production of biofuels threatens create conflict over food for humans, feed for animals and feedstocks for liquid transport fuels. That is why production of lignocellulosic ethanol from waste and non-food crops is a very important future technology. There are many exciting opportunities out there for the forestry industry in Australia. The opposition supports this bill and wishes Forest and Wood Products Australia every success in its future endeavours. We only hope that, by working together with the forestry industry, we can take the debate forward on the science rather than on emotion and the coming and going of state and territory elections over their regular fourand three-year cycles. We owe that to the timber communities. (Time expired)",113
220,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2007 and the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2007. The key elements of these bills are as follows. First, the main bill will establish a new estry research and development and marketing company to replace the former Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. Second, it will allow the Commonwealth to provide matching funds for research and development projects undertaken by the new company. Third, it will allow the new company to collect levies to fund its activities. This amount will be limited to the lesser of either 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production of the Australian forestry industry for the financial year, or 50 per cent of the amount spent by the new company on research and development activities that qualify under the funding contract in that financial year. There are also carry over provisions for research to and development that is not 50 per cent matched. This will maintain research and development funding at the levels of the previous Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. Fourth, the bill gives the minister broad powers to revoke the status of the new company if it is deemed to have contravened the act or the funding contract or a number of other specified instances which would call into question the legitimacy of the company's activities. Fifth, it gives the minister the authority to direct activities of the new company in exceptional and urgent circumstances. And, sixth, it allows the minister to delegate any or all of his or her powers and functions under the bill to either the secretary of the department or an appropriate SES employee. The transitional and consequential provisions include: transferring the assets and liabilities of the Forest and Wood Products and Research and Development Corporation to the new company, assets being estimated at $6.4 million; transferring staff from the Forest and Wood Products Research and Develforopment Corporation to the new company; maintaining the terms and conditions of employment of staff in the new company; and retaining the Commonwealth as the liable party under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act until staff commence with the new company. This also affects some existing entitlements for transferring Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation employees. It is worth noting that the new company is not an approved authority for the purposes of the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 or the Superannuation Act 2005. The transitional provisions allow the carry over of long service leave. They require final annual reports from the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, and they allow unmatched research and development money to be carried over to the new company. The current Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation provides what has been described as a ‘national, integrated research and development focus for the Australian forest and wood products industry'. It is committed to research and development that promotes internationally competitive and environmentally sustainable practices. The main bill establishes a company limited by guarantee under the Corporations Act which will assume the research and development functions currently being provided by the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation and incorporate new functions of marketing and promotion. The old Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation could not undertake marketing and promotion activities, and the forestry industry has indicated its support for a new company to undertake this responsibility. Some concerns have been raised about the bill. As the bill establishes a new entity undertaking new responsibilities, it is appropriate that it should be reviewed to ensure that is properly established and that transitional arrangements are appropriate. It is appropriate to compare the outcomes of this process to the Uhrig template to determine if the administration of the new corporation is satisfactory. A review is also appropriate to consider the terms of the statutory funding agreement between the new corporation and the Commonwealth. A referral through a proper committee process will allow for the appropriate review and consultation to be undertaken. The bill gives me an opportunity to say something about current and future directions of forestry research. Recently, I had the opportunity to discuss these forestry issues, particularly in relation to global warming, with some key people from the Food and Agriculture Organisation-Dr Wulf Killmann and Mr Jim Carle. We discussed global warming and carbon sinks. It should be noted that half the dry weight of biomass is carbon. Forests, like other ecosystems, are affected by climate change, be it a sea level rise that threatens coastal forests or changes in temperature and rainfall patterns. Some impacts will be negative; some will be positive. But forests themselves influence the climate and the climate change process. They absorb carbon in wood, leaves and soil and release it into the atmosphere when burnedfor example, during forest fires or the clearing of forest land. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change obliges all member countries, of which Australia is one, to assess and report national greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions and removals of carbon reflected as stock changes in forests. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has created guidelines, methods and default values for all parameters needed to it assess carbon stocks and their changes in forests. Quantifying the substantial roles of forests as carbon stores, as sources of carbon emissions and as carbon sinks has become one of the keys to understanding and modifying the global carbon cycle. Unfortunately, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has found that many of the 229 countries and territories which are part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have had difficulty in providing complete information concerning all pools of carbonthat is, aboveand below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soil carbon to a depth of 30 centimetres. Many countries do not possess country specific information on the parameters necessary for calculating all carbon pools. As a consequence of missing data, it is not yet possible to aggregate country data to obtain complete regional or global totals for carbon in any pool. But it is worth pointing out that these totals and their changes over the years are very important for the global warming debate. The Food and Agriculture Organisation has estimated that global forest vegetation stores some 283 gigatonnes in deadwood and estimates that soil down to 30 centimetres and litter contain 317 gigatonnes of carbon. It therefore estimated, as at 2005, the total carbon content of forest ecosystems at some 638 gigatonnes, more than the amount of carbon in the entire atmosphere. That is obviously very significant. Roughly half of total carbon is found in forest biomass and deadwood combined, and half in soils and litter combined. In terms of trends, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has concluded that from 1990 to 2005 carbon in biomass decreased in Africa, Asia and South America, remained approximately constant in Oceania, and increased in Europe and North and Central America. Not all subregions followed this trend. More research in this area is essential, but the potential of forestry to play a role tackling global warming by absorbing carbon from the atmosphere is clear. How effectively is this potential being realised? The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change expressly allows countries to meet their targets through the use of carbon sinks. The protocol allows parties to fulfil parts of their obligations through purchasing certified emissions reductions from carbon offset projects under the clean development mechanism involving forests. Conferences of the parties to the climate change convention have held meetings to address specific issues concerning the so-called land use, land use change and forestry activities. The parties to the convention have, perhaps unfortunately, reached different conclusions regarding the proper role of forests and appropriate national legislation to foster that role. As a result, national legislative activity on the issue of forests and climate change has been limited. One exception is Costa Rica, which has created a certified tradeable offset to attract developed nations looking to sponsor mitigation projects. The first project funded under this mechanism has involved forests. Indeed, New South Wales has changed its property laws to recognise a separate legal interest in the carbon sequestration potential of forest land. A number of issues need to be resolved in relation to legislation to foster carbon sequestration in forests. For example: who can claim credit and receive payment for carbon sequestration and can that ownership be transferred? Who is responsible for carbon debits from deforestation, forest harvesting or natural calamities? How will the amount and duration of carbon credits be determined, recorded and verified? How can the government promote orderly sales or other transfers of ownership? How will national law alloin cate the risk of failure of carbon sequestration projects? Will the law assess liability for damaging a forest's carbon sequestration potential? Countries need to be thinking about how to encourage and integrate the use of forests as carbon sinks. Sequestering carbon in living forest biomass, soil and wood products, as well as substituting wood energy from sustainably managed forests for fossil fuels, are important mitigation measures. Industry now adds about 6.3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere each year and the destruction of forests contributes at least another gigatonne. The current concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, some 370 parts per million, is about 35 per cent higher than it was in pre-industrial times, when it was 280 parts per million. It therefore an appealing proposition to turn harmful emissions of carbon dioxide via photosynthesis into new forests, thereby replacing some of the 16 million hectares of natural forests that the planet loses annually. There are various things that industry can do to increase its contribution to climate change mitigation through forestry. Dr Wulf Killmann says that 80 per cent of the energy performance of a pulp and paper mill is determined on the day machinery is purchased; that the forest products sector is probably one of the lowest investors in research of any of the resource based sectors; that there is a serious lack of funds for research and development; that the dryer section of the paper machine is the main user of energy followed by the concentration of the black liquor and that breakthrough technologies are needed that completely change the way mills dry paper and concentrate black liquor; and that, in the Nordic countries, research and development in a biorefinery is expected to reach hundreds of millions of dollars in the next few years. The global forest products industry can play a significant role in combating climate change. Dr Wulf Killmann believes it has exceptional ability to become a net supplier of a range of energy products and it could, in combination with carbon capture and storage, become an important actor in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This will require optimising the use of raw material, increasing efficiency, producing bioenergy and expanding into biorefinery products. It also requires that forests be managed responsibly. Jim Carle says that planted forests account for about seven per cent of global forest area-or about two per cent of global land area or slightly fewer than 300 million hectares. They provide more than half the indusis trial wood produced in the world and their extent and productivity are increasing. Compared with naturally regenerating forests, planted forests represent a higher investment per area unit and normally produce higher values through their products and services. They are also sometimes controversial, and achieving a balance among social, cultural, environmental and economic benefits is a challenge. Planted forests can play a significant role in regulating water flows and improving water quality. They can be an important mechanism in rehabilitating catchments. As with naturally regenerating forests, they can regulate floods, reduce debris flows and stabilise land, thereby reducing soil erosion that would otherwise lead to excessive sedimentation in rivers and lakes. They can control soil and water salinity and improve soil stability to prevent landslides. It should not be assumed, however, that the impacts of planted forests are invariably positive. Inappropriate planting, particularly if using species with high water requirements, for example, can deplete water resources such as groundwater. Then there is the issue of fire. While the release of heat-trapping emissions from fire is a natural phenomenon, the net release of carbon by wildfires, as a consequence of fire induced site degradation and lowered carbon sequestration potential, is contributing to global warming. Human population growth is associated with increasing rates of conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural and pastoral systems and with the development of residential areas, infrastructure and traffic. Land-use change is occurring in traditionally uninhabited or uncultivated areas, such as mountain slopes and floodplains. This is frequently a result of poverty, deforestation or vegetation conversion for production of cash crops for the global market. In many regions of the world, the process is associated with the use of fire for land clearing and the increasing occurrence of uncontrolled fires. Many regions of the world have experienced a trend over the last decade towards excessive fire application in land-use systems and land-use change, and a trend towards more severe fires. The effects of fires include smoke and water pollution and impacts on human health and safety, loss of biodiversity, and site degradation with knock-on effects such as desertification, soil erosion or flooding. Fires burning under extreme conditions in some vegetation types, including organic terrain, can deplete terrestrial carbon and disturb the global carbon cycle. The Food and Agriculture Organisation has been coordinating a multistakeholder process to prepare a global strategy to enhance international cooperation in fire management. This is in line with recommendations from the third International Wildland Fire Summit, which was held in Sydney in October 2003. The Food and Agriculture Organisation has developed a set of voluntary guidelines for fire management which cover the positive and negative social, cultural and economic impacts of natural and planned fires in forests, woodlands, rangelands, grasslands, agricultural and rural/urban landscapes. The fire management guidelines cover early warning, prevention, preparedness, safe and effective initial attack on incidences of fire and landscape restoration following it. Naturally around the world there are many different situations, ranging from areas with few fires and little impact to areas in which fire is a key component of ecosystem health. Even in developed countries, people and communities move into fire-prone areas, causing problems for protection from fire. Of particular significance, and certainly this is true of Australia, are the areas in which fire plays an important role in the environment, either playing a role naturally in sustaining the ecosystem or providing for livelihoods through agricultural or other uses. Jim Carle says that the need to protect lives, resources and property from the adverse effects of fire must be balanced against the need for the appropriate use and equilibrium of fire in the environment. He also says that the notion of the ‘good fire' should continue to be advocated. Fire can be good for habitats, for resources, for reducing threats and for maintaining cultural values. The projections for global warming indicate increasing impact in relation to fire regimes. The prospect of a global mean temperature rise from 1.6 to 5.4 degrees Celsius by 2100 represents a much more rapid change than any experienced over the past 10,000 years. Just as importantly, in turn more frequent droughts will give rise to more high-severity wildfires, leading to loss of vegetation cover, desertification and reduced terrestrial carbon sequestration. Both land use fires and wildfires in all ecosystems are affecting carbon pools and global carbon cycles. In turn, global warming affects the duration and severity of dry seasons, therefore impacting on the incidence and severity of fires. In light of global warming, fire management practices need to take into account observed and anticipated changes in fuel and vegetation type, burning conditions and additional fire risk. Policies are needed to maximise the storage of carbon in ecosystems without increasing the likelihood of unwanted fire risk. We need to minimise the global warming emissions that occur as a result of large-scale, unwanted fire by restoring and maintaining ecologically appropriate fire regimes.",118
221,Mr ADAMS,RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"The Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2007 and the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2007 will establish a company limited by guarantee under the Corporations Act 2001 to assume the research and development functions currently provided by the FWPRDC and will incorporate the new functions of marketing and promotion. This legislation effectively replaces the old forestry R&D statutory authority, the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, with a new R&D and marketing corporation called Forest and Wood Products Australia, FWPA. However, we need to ensure that the proposed administration of the new company will adequately represent the views of all affected parties within the forestry industry. We should make sure that everybody in this industry is given representation. This legislation is not controversial. I believe it is important that marketing should be involved in any research and development strategy. By all reckoning, the timber industry needs all the promotion it can get. I would like to talk a little about the timber industry and the terrible misinformation that seems to be spread out and about, especially from Tasmania, without any real rhyme or reason. The timber industry is a fine industry. It is an old industry with links back to the dawn of civilisation. Timber has been used over aeons for everything, from the home to transport to energy-to every part of the life of early man. It was and still is a very important and enduring part of our civilisation. Just think of the analogies nowadays and what trees are used for: there is the tree of life and the tree of knowledge; art gives the tree a vital part in every landscape; it is our muse and our balance in a chaotic environment; we talk about roots and the protection of spreading branches. So much of our life is dominated by trees and timber products. I would say that in some people's minds there is a sacredness about trees that seems to ignore the very practical relationship between man and our forests, by growing them, cutting them down and growing them again. Trees are the ultimate sustainable product. They will survive long past man's pitiable efforts to ‘save' them from man. Research and development over the years has developed timber and its products to great heights. Timber is used in some of our best designed furniture. In this Parliament House we see the magnificent timbers from around Australia fashioned into floors and fittings, contrasting beautifully with the natural stone and marble around the building. The timber inlays in the Marble Hall are some stunning examples of marquetry, which is now becoming fashionable again. We have used tree and timber products as we have moved through the ages. Paper and paper making is so much part of our lives that people forget where it comes from. Paper is used for our newspapers, computer paper, art paper, labels and packaging on almost all our processed foods and many other household products, posters, books, magazines and notepads. In fact, as I looked at my desks, both here and at home, I thought that if paper did not exist I do not think I could survive. If we took paper out of our lives, it would be a very poor place indeed. Yet when someone suggests that they want to build a pulp mill in Tasmania, there is an uproar that it will ruin our lives because it might give out some emissions, put some effluent into the water or use a bit of the ter. I say ‘might' because there has so far been no proof of intention to do this. Surely, for the sake of being able to use our own trees and our own workers and being selfsufficient in the raw materials of our timber based products, we should at least allow the company to put its case without vilification at every turn. Gunns has been part of our lives in Tasmania, as indeed has some of our timber. It is a Tasmanian company employing Tasmanians and developing some of our savings to help our economy. Its managing director is a long-term Tasmanian. He lives in the north and his office is in Launceston, and it is in his interests to ensure that his environment is not despoiled. He is no different from the rest of us. Pulp mills are already in Tasmania and have been for some time. In fact, the family of a current Greens senator sold their land for the Wesley Vale pulp mill in the 1960s and now there are two pulp mills, a paper machine and an off-machine coater and manufacturers of a variety of office and specialty paper grades. Paper manufactured at Burnie is mostly plain paper for forms grade photocopying and offset printing and base grades which are then transported to Wesley Vale for coating. In 1989 there was an attempt to expand this pulp mill and there was such an outcry, led by the particular senator I referred to, that the proposal was dropped, and Tasmania had to wait nearly 20 years for someone to be brave enough to try for another one. Pulp mills are a known factor to those who live around them, and we have had little trouble living with them since the 1930s. Like many other processing plants, there are problems from time to time but they are always fixable. I live in the town of Longford, where there is a meat processing plant. Local wa- residents have for years lived next to the chimney plume which, in days gone by, used to exude an odour very like overcooked meal and meat. That problem has finally been solved. Although the plume is still there, and you can see when there is an inversion layer and you can see which way the wind is blowing, it has become a part of our lives and it harms nobody. Like people in Finland who live in a landscape full of pulp mills, these are benevolent giants in their communities, providing their jobs, their recreation and their economy. Why should ours be any different? With proper research and safeguards, any problems could be overcome. It does not have to divide communities. It is crazy to have scare campaigns running on emotion only. The facts seem to have mysteriously disappeared along with the science. This is why we must ensure that there is ongoing independent research available for industries and their communities to make rational and informed decisions about the future. If there is a situation that could lead to a problem in the future then those people should be able to sit down and talk about it using up-to-date information and come to some useful and workable conclusion. I am not saying that this bill will necessarily provide all that but legislation should help people to help themselves in coming to terms with change and new directions. This bill gives us some hope that funds will be invested in research and development. I support the bill.",123
222,Ms LEY,RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (7.33 pm)-I thank all members of the House for their contributions to this debate on the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2007 and the Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2007. The forestry industry is important to Australia as it contributes significantly to national economy and exports. Research and development makes a positive contribution to the productivity and sustainability of the Australian forestry industry. When combined with generic marketing and promotion, it will increase the competitiveness of Australia's forest and wood products in the international market. I thank the member for Hotham for his support for the continuation and expansion of forest research and development to include the promotion of Australia's forestry industry, although I must correct him on one small point: the new arrangements do not result from the Uhrig review but rather from the expressed desires of the forestry industry to broaden the scope and capacity of the industry research and development provider to include marketing and promotion to its already strong track record on research and development. The Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2007 will provide the power for the government to declare an industry owned company as the industry services body for the forestry industry. I also thank the member for Corangamite for his support and echo his comments that the development and promotion of a sustainable forest can only be beneficial to Australia and those Australians who depend on forestry for their livelihood. In fact, in my own electorate of Farrer the forestry industry is a major employer and economic driver. Good research and development coupled with promotion and marketing is an important requirement for the industry to remain strong and competitive. This legislation is an important step forward for the Australian forestry industry. The establishment of public companies or industry services bodies to undertake the delivery of marketing, research and development and other services to the our agricultural industries is not a new concept. The legislation follows the precedent set by other industries. It closely resembles other industries' legislation but has been tailored to meet the specific requirements of the circumstances of the forestry industry and the operating arrangements of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. Under these new arrangements, there will be accountability to the levy payers as members of the company and to the government through the funding contract. The constitution of the new company, which is to be the industry services body, and the funding contract are being developed. The funding contract will be tabled in both houses of parliament after it is signed off. Recent practice has been to table the funding contracts in parliament after signing. The legislation will provide for the establishment of a new industry services body for the forestry industry that will give industry the opportunity to better promote the environmental values of wood products as well as increase access to domestic and international markets. The industry services body will undertake generic marketing and promotion, research and development, and other industry services to the forestry industry. Integration of research and development and promotion will enable the forestry industry to be responsive in a unified voice to deal with the challenges currently facing the industry. It is hoped that the establishment of this new industry services body will also improve communication within the industry and with stakeholders and the government. By being able to better promote the industry and improve communication, access opportunities to the domestic and international markets for Australian forest and wood products will be maximised. The company that is declared as the industry services body will be limited by guarantee under the Corporations Act 2001 and will assume the research and development activities that are currently provided by the statutory authority, Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. The company will have a skills based approach to its board membership and advisory committees. This will allow interested parties seeking positions within the company to be considered, based on their skills set and the desired skills set of the company. Members of the company will have the opportunity to nominate and vote for board members. The accompanying bill provides for the one-off transfer of assets and liabilities and the corporation's existing employees to allow the new industry services body to function from day one with funds and without any disruption to the current research and development work. The transferring employees will support the interim board of the industry services body which will be made up of most of the current serving board of the corporation to ensure a smooth transition from the corporation to the industry services body. The Commonwealth values the outputs of research and development, and the legislation will provide for the Commonwealth to continue to match, dollar for dollar, funds spent by the industry services body on eligible research and development. The new industry services body will be accountable to the Commonwealth. It will be bound by a number of measures outlined in the legislation, the funding contract and the company constitution. Should a variety of circumstances occur such as the company constitution is changed in an unacceptable way, the industry services body fails to comply with the legislation or the funding contract, or the company ceases to carry on business, the minister will have the ability to suspend the payment of statutory levies and other relevant payments and/or declare that the company ceases to be the industry services body. The transition from the existing statutory authority, Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, to the new industry services body provided for in this legislation will unite and strengthen Australia's forestry industry to remain productive and sustainable into the future. The Forestry Marketing and Research and Development Services Bill 2007 and the accompanying transition bill are the result of a partnership approach to forestry matters between the government and the forest industry. It aims to provide the industry with greater ownership and control to enable them to be responsive to the markets and to have the capacity to respond more effectively and efficiently to current and emerging challenges. Ultimately this will mean increased access to domestic and international markets and improved sustainability and profitability of the industry. Once again, I thank those who spoke on the legislation. I have not mentioned the member for Wills, the member for Batman and the member for Lyons. I thank them, as well as the members for Corangamite and Hotham. I commend the bill to the House.

225,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I rise to speak tonight on the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 to, among other things, change the process of appointing federal safety officers; allow the Federal Safety Commissioner and persons working in the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner to disclose protected information on the scheme to the minister; extend the application of the Australian Government Building and Construction Occupational Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme, administered by the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner, to cover situations where building 2007 work is indirectly funded by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority; ensure that persons are accredited under the scheme at the time of entering into a contract for building work funded by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority, taking appropriate steps to see that such persons are also accredited while the building work is being carried out; extend the accreditation requirement to funding arrangements beyond those currently contemplated by the legislation; and clarify that subsection 35(4) of the act only overrides Commonwealth provisions to the extent of any inconsistency. Labor notes that the government has again had to return to the parliament to correct some elements of its industrial relations platform and this time it must amend the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act. The last opportunity I had to speak to the original bill-that is, the 2005 bill-was on 10 August 2005 when I made my views known about the prime motivation for the legislation proposed by the government. But clearly the need for this particular bill is not because there are any changed circumstances in the industry but rather a deficiency with the preparation by the minister in relation to this particular matter. Labor opposed the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill when it was first introduced in 2005 because it was a flawed piece of legislation based on a flawed premise. But given the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill's focus on occupational health and safety, we will be supporting this bill's timely passage through the parliament. However, Labor's concerns with the government's approach to this law in the past remain the same. Labor has opposed the Howard government's approach to the regulation of industrial relations and health and safety in the building and construction sector because it provides a separate set of laws for the industry and has created in excess of 200 pages of new legislation. It exposes ordinary employees to extreme penalties for taking industrial action and, in connection with the national code of practice for the construction industry and Work Choices legislation, it contributes to an astonishing level of regulation of industry. The Howard government has also indicated that it will consider on a case-by-case basis intervening in the public interest where employers use existing mechanisms under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. This is an unprecedented level of government intervention in support of employers in bargaining negotiations at the industry level. It does appear, given the intent behind the legislation, that the government is more inclined to intervene to assist employers in this industry than employees. I contend that is indeed symptomatic of the approach taken by the government with respect to industrial relations legislation. It is legislation that I would contend was prepared for political purposes and which is complex, conflict driven and based on false assumptions that will not assist industry or its consumers. It also fails to address a number of significant issues in the industry such as phoenix companies, tax avoidance and the still-unresolved question of protection of employee entitlements. There are a number of other matters on which there should be a greater focus. There does not seem to be a concern for the very high bankruptcy rates among small contractors in the sector. There is not a particular focus on the relatively widespread non-compliance with award or industrial obligations. Again, the legislation is designed primarily to focus upon conduct of employees or employees' organisations and therefore it lacks balance and consideration for any particular breaches by employers. To that extent it is, as I say, politically driven. That is why Labor has committed to abolishing the politically influenced ABCC and creating an industry specific inspectorate within the proposed independent umpire, Fair Work Australia. These specialist units will operate within the inspectorate arm of Fair Work Australia and one of the first to be developed will be for the building and construction industry. We want to take the partisanship out of the industrial relations legislation. We want to ensure that there is balance; that the approach of statutory authorities that regulate employment conditions, whether in the building industry or indeed in any other industry in this country, has an eye to breaches of law, if they are there, by employers, employees and indeed organisations that represent either of those two groups; and that it does not focus the government's enmity towards one particular part or player within the industry. When this bill was introduced by the government, the minister cited high rates of fatalities and the fact that the industry also had the third highest incidence of workplace injuries with more than 12,500 compensated injuries or 34 injuries per day. Labor agree that we need to do all that we can to ensure that Australian men and women who work on building sites across the country work safely and return home safely. We also agree with the view that OH&S performance must be enhanced through cultural and behavioural change but we would argue that the Howard government's punitive and adversarial approach will not achieve this. Labor are driven by a desire for genuine improvement in the area of occupational health and safety across Australian workplaces and we believe appropriate compensation is an important and essential part of that. In fact Labor have a very proud history of focusing on policies that prevent injury at workplaces and indeed have done so in the state legislatures of this country. Wherever there is a federal responsibility, Labor have always been at the forefront of policy development in the area of OH&S. Labor have made a very significant contribution, particularly when compared with the coalition parties, in this area. I think it fair to say that we have never sought to use this particular area, which potentially affects workers in this country so drastically, as a political football. However different the respective views are of both major parties in the area of industrial relations, we are particularly concerned that occupational health and safety-that is, that area of public policy-would find itself in a situation of being misused for political and partisan purposes. Labor is driven by a desire for genuine improvements, as I say, but the Howard government is moving to reduce coverage and compensation by shifting major Australian companies from state based schemes to Comcare. Only last month we had before us in this place a bill which had as its principal objective the minimisation of the costs of work related injury and disease for those covered by Comcare, even though it is a beneficial scheme. This contrasts with the historical evolution of occupational health and safety policy in Australia, which has placed the prevention of workplace injury and illness before all other objectives. This is a principle that has, historically, underpinned state and federal legislation in this area. But this shift away from that accords with the Howard government's Work Choices laws, their punitive and adversarial nature and the ideology behind them. If the government were really serious about occupational health and safety in the building and construction industry, we contend, it would abolish its unfair industrial actions law for the industry. Indeed, another area that concerns me and that is associated with the government's approach to occupational health and safety is the way in which it has sought to prohibit parties from agreeing upon enterprise clauses that go to union health and safety training. Now, we understand-we do not like it, but we understand-that the government has an extraordinarily high intolerance of unions in is this country and would like to see them critically weakened. It is certainly something that the government has sought to do since it was elected in 1996-that is, target the organisations of employees registered under the Workplace Relations Act, and target them critically to damage them so that employees have difficulty getting genuine representation in the workplace. But we do not understand how the government can go so far as to prohibit the capacity for an employer and his or her employees to reach an agreement on a particular clause that would allow for union health and safety training. We do not understand how that could be acceptable if the government were genuinely concerned about occupational health and safety. So this bill is of concern to us. Unfortunately, it is consistent with the approach the government has taken of putting its enmity towards unions before the safety of Australian workers in workplaces. That is a critical problem with respect to this bill and all bills that the government has introduced in this area of public policy. Labor consider the better approach to be to ensure that fairness exists in the workplace. We would seek to put fairness back into the system. This would mean having a system that places a high degree of focus on cooperation rather than conflict and settling old scores. The latest available workplace safety data from the ABS suggests that we are not making real progress on occupational health and safety in our Australian workplaces. The figures for work related injuries are instructive. Nearly 700,000 people were injured at work in Australia in 2005-06, and the majority of them, 63 per cent, were men. Men had a higher work related injury or illness rate-74 per 1,000-than women, although the rate for women was still very high-51 per 1,000. Younger Australians, both men and women, recorded higher work injury or illness rates. The 15 to 19 age group had the highest rate, with 78 per 1,000, followed by the 20 to 24 age group, with 75 per 1,000. Mature-age workers-that is, those over the age of 55-recorded the lowest rate of work related injuries and illnesses, with 50 per 1,000. The Australians injured at work were predominantly employees-86 per cent of all those injured. The injury rates for ownermanagers are certainly significantly lower in comparison. Workers who were employed under shift arrangements had comparatively high rates of injury relative to total employee levels. Indeed, although they make up only 16 per cent of the workforce, 27 per cent of employees injured were those working in shift arrangements outside the ordinary spread of hours such as a day shift. Perhaps the most revealing aspect of the ABS data was that more than 43 per cent of people who had experienced a work related injury or illness ‘had not received any occupational health and safety training in the job where their injury or illness occurred'. Furthermore, over 10 per cent of those injured did not apply for compensation because they thought they would not be eligible, thought they were not covered or were not aware of applicable coverage. This, coupled with the previous statistic, suggests that workers are still in a situation where they are not receiveration, ing the relevant training about workplace safety and they are not aware of their rights and responsibilities with regard to workplace safety and coverage by their relevant scheme. That is why we argue very strongly that it is an appalling decision by the government to proscribe the right of an employer and a group of employees to enter into agreements that may involve union-sponsored health and safety training. In fact, Senator Murray, who does not represent the interests of either major political party, has said time and again that, whatever criticisms some may have of unions, unions have always played an important role in the health and safety of workers. To remove the capacity for such an agreement to be reached under an instrument pursuant to the Workplace Relations Act seems to be counterproductive and, indeed, seems to make it less likely that workers will be safer and more likely that they will be injured in their workplaces. That is of concern to Labor, and again it is symptomatic of a government that places its ideology before the safety of Australian workers. It is also disappointing to see that the ABS statistics record that about 10 per cent of those who did not apply for compensation acted in this way because they thought it would reflect poorly on their current or future employment record or because the process for making a claim was too complicated. That is, one in 10 workers injured said that the main reasons they chose not to formally seek compensation was the fear of their employment record being affected and the concern that the way in which you apply for compensation was too complex for them. The current legislation does nothing to address these issues; indeed, it contains aspects such as prohibiting leave to attend occupational health and safety training. These ABS figures confirm that what is needed is coopnot conflict, and information, not intimidation. On this point, can I address some matters relating to the sector which is the topic of this debate. As I have previously mentioned, Labor is completely committed to policing the building and construction sector in a way which promotes occupational health and safety and provides constructors and building firms with certainty. But we must also put these reforms into perspective. In recent weeks, some sections of the industrial relations debate have tried to instil fear and uncertainty into the sector-in particular, the commercial segment of this sector. The facts underpinning the building and construction sector are worth examining. There is little doubt that the building and construction sector is a driving force in our strong economy. The value of construction activity in 2006 was $103.2 billion, of which $36.5 billion was residential and $23.3 billion was non-residential. In terms of total value, as at December 2006 the Australian commercial property market was worth $576.6 billion. Not surprisingly, the property sector that was worth the most across Australia as at December 2006 was retail, which reached $315 billion in value. In terms of floor space, the industrial sector is by far largest of the four major commercial sectors with over 101 million square metres of stock estimated to be worth $130.5 billion. New South Wales has almost 43 per cent of commercial property by value, followed by Victoria with 25 per cent. Queensland is the fastest growing, increasing its value by 23 per cent over the past year to now account for 13.5 per cent of commercial property by value. Around Australia, construction costs have risen and are still growing at above the rate of inflation. But growth is well down from the increases seen in previous years. For example, construction costs in Brisbane increased by a massive annualised rate of 27 per cent in mid-2004. It is worth reflecting on what exactly are the drivers of costs in this sector, as much misinformation about this very issue has been publicly aired in recent weeks. According to the experts-analysts who focus on this sector day in, day out-the key drivers of costs in the building and construction sector are labour supply, building approvals, the consumer price index and materials. One of the biggest impacts on materials and their cost has been the strength of global demand for resource and construction materials. Analysts agree that this has had a dramatic impact on the price of construction materials. Given the size of retail in the commercial building sector, obviously the demand for retail property is heavily dependent on retail turnover, which is reliant on population growth, disposable income and consumer confidence. Obviously, given the strength of the economy these factors have all been strong and have fed into demand in the construction sector. Another factor impacting on prices in this sector, as noted by the Reserve Bank of Australia, is strong investor demand as pension funds across the globe look for assets offering long-term income streams at high yields. the Analysts also agree about what will be the main impact on construction costs in the future. The skills shortage remains the biggest risk to the sector while demand for building and construction remains strong. A Reed Construction Data report released earlier this month revealed that construction costs in Victoria have surged by 44 per cent since 2000, or nearly twice the pace of inflation. The sharpest increase in construction costs was recorded in Western Australia, where they have jumped by 58 per cent since 2000 as workers have been sucked from construction to the higher-paying mining industry. In Queensland, construction costs have risen by 50.2 per cent since the start of the decade. The Reed Construction Data report confirmed that the dire shortage of skilled tradespeople accounted for most of the rise in building costs. In my home state of Victoria the skills shortage is having a serious impact on building and the affordability of housing. The Housing Institute of Australia has previously stated that the housing industry faces a skills deficit of 150,000 tradespeople over the next five years. Meanwhile, the average age of builders is increasing. For example, the average age of a builder in Victoria is now 47. So in any debate about costs in the sector and future risks to these costs, we should be armed with the complete facts-and only the facts should determine our policy response. I would like to reiterate Labor's support for this bill. I would like to remind the House that this bill is being introduced and legislation is being enacted because there were deficiencies in the original bill-and I was involved in the debate on that bill in August 2005. So the fact is that this is a bill to correct the minister's failure to attend to the concerns of the building industry. Labor support the bill because there is some focus on improving occupational health and safety in the building industry. But this bill is flawed, as was the primary bill. The bill was politically motivated. It was not focused entirely on the concerns and interests of employees and their safety in the workplace. It was as much about adversely affecting the capacity of employee organisations, and indeed employees, to go about their business safely. The government should try to remove its ideological blinkers in the area of industrial relations. It should concern itself with the interests of employees and employers and not be so blinded by its enmity towards unions that it has to spend almost its entire en- lyay) ergy worrying about how it can critically injure or damage those organisations. Instead, it should focus its attention upon reducing the awful statistics of death and injury in workplaces, whether they be for the building industry or any other sector of our economy. As I conclude my contribution to this debate, I reiterate Labor's support for this bill but state our long standing commitment to replace the ABCC with the Fair Work Australia alternative, which will focus on placing fairness and cooperation back in our workplaces.",127

228,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"Rankin) (8.20 pm)Sadly the coalition government has voted against Labor's BAS Easy proposal. It says that it is a friend of small business, but the Treasurer obviously finds BAS Easy too hard. BAS Easy is an option for a small business to be able to complete its GST bookkeeping requirements within a few minutes rather than the several hours that are required under a GST that has been in operation now for more than six years. You would think that, if it genuinely was a friend of small business, the government would embrace Labor's BAS Easy proposal. Instead the Treasurer announced in the budget that he would extend the simplified accounting methods to a greater range of small businesses-not just mixed food retailers but all small businesses-but only on the basis that if a small business wanted to have a look at the option of the simplified accounting methods then that business would be able to approach the tax office. Our grave concern is that the Treasurer has wanted to give the appearance of helping out small businesses with their GST bookkeeping requirements but in fact will not give any such help at all. If he were genuine about giving help then he would have instructed his coalition members to support BAS Easy. The fear we hold is that if the coalition were re-elected then the answer that small businesses will get from the tax office, when approaching and asking what ratio they might be entitled to, will very unfavourable one-in other words, defeating entirely the purpose of simplifying the GST bookkeeping requirements. In order to explore that a little further I have foreshadowed to the revenue minister that we would like to get a greater understanding of the proportion of small businesses that are availing themselves of the simplified tax system. Labor supports the simplified tax system. I think I can say that on behalf of the shadow Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. It is a good idea. It allows small businesses to group small assets and to write them off either immediately or at a faster rate than otherwise would apply. There are other benefits as well of the simplified tax system. I would point out that when Labor senators were asking government officials in November last year about the proportion of small businesses that were availing themselves of the simplified tem and therefore would be eligible for the simplified accounting methods, the answer given was the figure of around 28 per cent. We accept that the simplified tax system at that point in time was still relatively new and that it would take time for accountants to advise small businesses of the benefits of the simplified tax system. It is not a criticism. We are simply pointing out that 28 per cent of eligible small businesses seems to be a rather small proportion. We did hear from the minister that there is something in excess of 600,000 businesses now availing themselves of the simplified tax system. That sounds like a lot, but I am not sure how the tax office or Treasury is counting the total number of small businesses. We are asking a simple question-that is, the proportion of eligible small businesses that is accessing the simplified tax system. I accept the possibility, though not the likelihood, that the minister will not know the answer to that questionalthough I did alert him to that a little earlier. be a I hope he will be able to enlighten us here tonight. If he cannot then we would like to pursue this matter further so that we have a better understanding of the whole operation of the simplified tax system.",133
229,Mr DUTTON,NOES,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (8.25 pm)-In response, I will comment briefly on the comments of the member for Rankin on the Tax Laws Amendment (Small Business) Bill 2007. According to ATO data as at 29 March 2007, over 850,000 taxpayers were part of the simplified tax system in the 200506 income year and approximately 650,000 taxpayers were part of the simplified tax system in the 2004-05 income year-an increase of some 200,000 taxpayers. As the member for Rankin would be aware, there are some two million small businesses in this country and, if that goes some way to answering his question, he can work out the tax sys- percentages he likes from there. The reality is that the Labor Party approach this debate with no real understanding of small business. It has been reflected not just in their comments in this debate but also in their policy both during their time in opposition over the last 11 years and when in government. The Labor Party do not understand small business because they are not of small business. As their former leader said, they are not here to represent small business; they are here to represent the interests of the union movement. The reality is that if you have a front-bench made up of 80 per cent of people who were either former union bosses or union hacks in one form or another, they are not people who can properly represent the interests of small business. The question for small business is: do they want changes to the tax system, a system which has been in place since 2000? Their clear indication to me is that, over the last or seven years, they have been working through a system to be in a position of confidence now and have the capacity to complete their BAS, to work within the obligations that have been imposed upon them by the government through the ATO. They are largely satisfied with the way in which the system works. Computer systems are now in place, particularly for small business operators. Small business do not want another round of wholesale change imposed on them by the Labor Party. If the Labor Party is going to give credit to small business, then they need to acknowledge the fact that the clear message from small business is that they want a system of certainty and improvements in some administrative practices. They do not want wholesale change to a system that has been in place since 2000. Small business also ask the Labor Party to reverse their job-destroying industrial relations position particularly in relation to unfair dismissal. One of the biggest impediments for small business has been the fact that they have not been able to decide who can stay in their business. Small business owners risk their capital and have their houses on the line and are the last ones paid at the end of the week or the end of the month. They are creating jobs in this country. Under the Labor Party's opposition to unfair dismissal over the last 10 years, small business has suffered in this country. If there is one message from small business to the Labor Party it is: reverse your job-destroying decision in relation to the reintroduction of the unfair dismissal laws, get behind the coalition stance on unfair dismissal laws and make it easier for small business to employ staff. And that is what we have seen over the last 12 months-326,000 jobs have been created and well over 80 per cent have been full-time positions. In the past small business have put casual employees on their staff. six They have been afraid to employ full-time employees because it is too hard to part ways if things do not work out. The reality is that Labor's message from small business is not about BAS or BAS Easy, as the member for Rankin would have you believe, but about unfair dismissal laws. For as long as Labor says black is white, small business knows that it is no friend of small business in this country. Small business knows that a return to Labor would be a return to high interest rates for small business, a return to union domination of small business in this country, a bad outcome for small business and a bad outcome for families in this country as well.",134
230,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"The reason for the government's decision to oppose BAS Easy is now clear. The Assistant Treasurer has conveyed to this parliament his ignorance of the proposal. He has said that this proposal of the Labor Party would create new changes and extra challenges for small business. Since when did an option create those sorts of complications? It has been made clear time and time again in our public statements that BAS Easy is an option. If, as the minister asserts, small businesses are deliriously happy with spending many hours a week doing the GST bookkeeping, and have nothing else to do with their time, then they can stay with the existing system. We have made that perfectly clear. What Labor is doing is providing an extra option-an option based on taking snapshots twice a year, once in the first half of the year and once in the second half of the year. This should sound familiar, even to the minister, because it is an adaptation of the simplified accounting methods. Those simplified accounting methods were first introduced not long after the GST was introduced but they were limited to a very small range of businesses-that is, mixed food retailers. The purpose of extending the simplified accounting methods to other businesses was to give them the option of taking the benefit. They do not have to if they do not want to. If they are as happy as Larry or as happy as the ister says they are, fine; they can stay with the existing system. What is wrong with an option? Mr Bowen interjecting",135
231,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"In the case of the superannuation clearing house, as I am reminded by the member for Prospect, again, the government says, ‘This could be very complicated.' Well, not if it is an option. They do not have to do it. What is wrong with options? What is wrong with choice? This government says it is all for choice. We see this in Work Choices, which is no choice at all. In the case of working Australians who want to bargain collectively and who go to the employer and say, ‘We want to exercise our choice to bargain collectively,' under the Orwellian Work Choices legislation the employer can say, ‘You think you've got a choice, Pal? Well you ain't got no choice whatsoever, because we're not going to talk to you about your desire to bargain collectively.' If we are talking about freedom and choice, let us give a choice to everyone. Let us give a choice to working Australians who want to bargain collectively. Let us give a choice to those small businesses that want to access Labor's proposal for a superannuation clearing house. And let us give a choice to small businesses that want to avail themselves of BAS Easy. Yet this minister mischievously presents it not as a choice, not as an option, but as an obligation. It is not an obligation; it is a choice. Those simplified accounting methods, according to the Treasurer, are a very good idea. He introduced them in around 2001. He has extended them somewhat since then. He announced in the budget that they would be extended further, to any small business-not just to small restaurants, cafes and catering min- companies but to any small businesses who wanted to go to the tax office and say, ‘I'm really interested in cutting my GST bookkeeping requirements; I'd like to talk to you about you issuing me a ratio, or we'll do a snapshot. Let's have a talk.' The problem-and it is evident in the behaviour of the coalition tonight-is that it is pretty clear that if this government were re-elected, that would be a very short conversation. The tax office would say words to the effect of, ‘Yes, we've got a special ratio for you: it's called 10 per cent-10 per cent, the full Monty, because you're not getting any GST input tax credits.'",136
232,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! I remind the honourable member for Rankin that the question is that the bill be agreed to. We are in consideration in detail; we should be discussing the clauses of the bill. It is not an opportunity to reopen the second reading debate.,136
233,Dr EMERSON,NOES,"And the clause of the bill relates to the option of getting that ratio from the tax office; that is not going to happen if this government is re-elected. That is a crying shame. This government should recognise that the No. 1 bugbear for small business is still, after six years, the GST bookkeeping requirements. This government ought to have adopted BAS Easy, but each and every one of its members voted tonight against BAS Easy. Bill agreed to. Third Reading",136
234,Mr DUTTON,NOES,Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (8.35 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA NA AMENDMENT (OHS) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed.,137
235,Mr HARDGRAVE,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I am pleased to support the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007 as it provides a very strong statement from the Australian government that we want contractors, people involved in the building industry, to practise safe work practices, and we want those people to put their workers' safety at a premium in their conduct, not regard it as an optional extra. It is, from our reading of the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, a key aspect of the commission to ensure that we can establish the powers and functions of the Federal Safety Commissioner. The bill provides for the establishment of the Australian Government Building and Construction Industry Occupational Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme. The act also regulates the appointment and powers of Federal Safety Officers. It allows the Federal Safety Commissioner and persons working in the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner to disclose information on the scheme to the minister. It amends the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 to streamline the processes of appointing Federal Safety Officers and clarifies that subsection 35(4) of the Building Construction Industry Improvement Act only overrides Commonwealth provisions to the extent of any inconsistency. Indeed, the main purpose of this bill is to amend the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act to: extend the application of the scheme administered by the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner to cover situations where building work is indirectly funded by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority, ensure that persons are accredited under the scheme at the time of entering into a contract for building work funded by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority, ensure that the Commonwealth or Commonwealth authority takes appropriate steps to see that such persons are also accredited while the building work is being carried out, and extend that accreditation requirement to funding arrangements beyond those currently contemplated by the legislation. Essentially, we are keeping faith with the building workers of Australia by ensuring that the Commonwealth can provide a ready role model for others involved in this sector. I listened with a deal of interest to the member for Gorton about a half an hour ago-he is a good fellow. If you read his words and listened to his presentation in the House, you would be left with the conclusion that what he was saying seemed fair and reasonable. The trouble, though, is that every time those opposite speak about workplace fairness, they are coming with so many strings attached that the ‘good ship Labor' sinks into the ocean. It leaves the moorings of the wharf with so many strings attached that there is no way it can sail. The Labor Party try to suggest that this is all about the Australian government having some pathological dislike for the union movement. Nothing could be further from the truth. This government is enormously in favour of an effective union movement that truly represents the workers of Australia and truly meets their interests and ambitions. But the trouble with those opposite is that so many of the Labor Party arguments about the matters contained within this legislation, and all matters to do with industrial relations, ready proof that too many-in fact, I would say all-union leaders in this country are living off the efforts of the past. The reputation of the union movement in effecting a safer working environment is without doubt. There is no doubt in my mind that unions have been at the heart of so much of the argument to create a safer working environment. But they are living on the efforts of those in the past, because those in the union movement today are no longer the keepers of a working environment that is safe. Employers themselves understand that the costs to them, both personally and emotionally, as well as the potential for fines and other imposts if they do not make a safe work environment, are very real-as they should be. I get disappointed as a person who was once a member of a union-the Australian Journalists Association. When it affiliated with the ACTU, I resigned because it went from being a professional body to being just another union. I do not understand how any journalist in Australia can suppress their partiality when they are a member of the media and arts alliance. I remain gravely concerned, but I never hear those opposite speak about work safety actually being hinged around things like the inquiry into the Queensland construction industry, which found that over 50 per cent of people on construction sites could not read English to an adequate level. Fifty per cent of people on Queensland construction sites had an illiteracy that could in itself cause a deal of danger. Sure, they could understand the word ‘Danger' and the word ‘Warning' and those sorts of words, but a full interpretation of written instructions or a full interpretation the way in which to act safely in the workplace is not possible for 50 per cent of those people, according to work which was done by the Department of Education, Science and Training a couple of years ago. I think that is are a point of enormous concern. Nor do we hear from those opposite that one of the strings attached to their argument about the unions being completely involved in all arbitration when it comes to work safety is just how over the top and ridiculous some of these occupational health and safety requirements have actually become. The Beattie government in Queensland has so overlegislated now that a chap rang me a year or so ago and told me about a fridge mechanic who entered his house. The fridge mechanic said, ‘I am required by occupational health and safety law to prescribe a safety instruction to you if you are going to stay in your kitchen while I repair your fridge.' The seals had broken. There was safety tape marked out two metres around the fridge, and he told this home owner that, unless they had steel-capped safety boots, safety goggles-and possibly a face mask but certainly at least goggles-and other safety equipment such as gloves they would not be allowed to be anywhere near the repair of the fridge. You just cannot help but wonder how silly and over the top a lot of these things have become. So here we have the Australian government instead, through this legislation, saying to our building contractors in Australia who want to work with the Australian government, ‘Have a work safety principle operating, have a set of requirements that you impose upon your workers, deliver on that and you can deal with us.' We are not, as the Labor Party are suggesting, affecting any rights of entry of union officials under the Workplace Relations Act. Nor, as the Labor Party try to suggest, are we overriding any state or of territory OH&S legislation. Under the Workplace Relations Act, a union official is entitled to access a site to vestigate potential breaches of OH&S, but they need to have, of course, a right of entry permit and they need to make sure that they comply with all the requirements of the relevant state or territory OH&S legislation. We are not, though, going to allow, as has been done by the CFMEU in Western Australia, a proliferation of occupational health problems in the form of the ‘blue flu'. Therefore, we are not going to see an end, as the Labor Party have again committed to tonight, to the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner, which was established in 2005. That is what Kevin Reynolds, the head honcho of the CFMEU in Western Australia, wanted to see-as we heard reported today by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Kevin Reynolds is longing for a return to his power and a Greg Combet style of having the unions back in charge of Australia. We are not going to allow a situation where union officials enter a work site and in fact stop work from progressing, building from being performed and progress from being achieved on some premise of unsafe practices when, in fact, all they are about is trying to spread blue flu, which saw so many days lost to industrial action71 per 1,000 workers in the December quarter of 2004. Now, since the creation of the ABCC, we have seen that number reduced to just nine in the same quarter last year. It went from 71 in the last quarter of 2004 to just nine in the last quarter of last year. For the months ending in December last year, there had been 45.2 days lost per 1,000 workers compared to-wait for it!-725 days lost in 2005. This so-called concern for occupational health and safety by trade union officials has cost jobs in the building and construction sector. This government is about providing a positive example and through legislation is in- enacting a process by which people in the building industry will be able to work for the Commonwealth, and it is amending the Building And Construction Industry Improvement Act to allow the scheme to apply more broadly. It has always been intended that the scheme would eventually be applied to construction projects funded both directly and indirectly by the Australian government. The amendments contained in this bill will allow the scheme to progress to stage 2. Stage 2 will apply to head builders on construction projects indirectly funded by the Australian government, subject to certain thresholds, and it will lower the contract threshold for directly funded construction projects from $6 million to $3 million. An example often put forward is that of indirectly funded construction projects such as a project funded under AusLink. And I know of examples that have been put forward in discussions with state governments about education funding, particularly vocational education funding, where the state governments, so bereft of the morals expected of a reasonable authority, have danced to the tune of union officials and actually held up in past years vocational education funding bonus payments simply because they did not want to see these particular measures contained within this bill applying to projects that might be constructed. For instance, TAFE college buildings were not built or their construction was delayed because the work of the union was more important than the facili12 ties to be funded by the Australian government. These sorts ofMr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",137
236,Mr HARDGRAVE,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"I know exactly what I am debating, member for Gorton. I am giving plenty of examples as to why this bill is a good bill. This bill provides direction, instruction and inspiration to others in the building industry to conduct themselves appropriately. As far as we are concerned, transitional arrangements are not necessary. Stage 2 will apply only to new contracts and funding agreements entered into after the date of the commencement of these amendments, which is 1 October next. By implementing this particular scheme in two stages, smaller builders have been given time to better understand the operation of this scheme and get used to the principles in this scheme. They have been given adequate time to set up and prepare their management systems so they can become accredited under this scheme and gain access to Commonwealth work. Stage 2, which starts on 1 October next, was announced on 23 October last. So the government has given plenty of time to those businesses interested in that sort of work to get themselves involved and ready. In addition, the Federal Safety Commissioner has undertaken significant consultation on these various stage 2 recommendations with a view to bringing people with us as we create a cooperative and positive environment. This scheme is certainly not part of any federal takeover of occupational health and safety. Through the Council of Australian Governments process, we are trying to bring about the harmonisation of OH&S legislation by working with state and territory requirements. I remember a few years ago working on the Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services and talking to people in the railway industry, by way of example, about the ridiculous range of safety requirements in that particular industry. The same is true in the building industry, where the various types of credentials, occupational equipment and rules and regulations differ from state to state. If you are credentialed one state, you run the risk of not being able to work across the border. In places like south-east Queensland, this silliness has to be overcome by the harmonisation of this legislative requirement. In that part of Australia, building contractors and building people generally move from one state to the other and they need all of their credentials organised and able to be readily recognised by both state authorities. This scheme therefore is a way to achieve that, and is just one of the tools the government are using to address some of the unacceptable OH&S performance records we have seen in various parts of Australia. I acknowledge the member for Gorton's observations about those who are hurt in our workplaces. I acknowledge that anybody hurt in a workplace on any given day is bad news for all of those in that profession and industry. It is bad news for those who hire them and employ them, as the purchaser of those services. It costs the building and construction sector enormously. Anything that can in fact drive down the cost to industry generally has got to be a good thing. Anything that can improve the working conditions of people on the tools in this industry has my complete support, but not the puffery of saying, ‘If it's not the union training them, it can't be any good.' From our point of view there has to be a sense of trust in the workplace. Under the government's Workplace Relations Act that is exactly what you have in Australia today. There is an opportunity for individual workers with quality credentials and experience to trade those credentials and experience, and gain a larger pay packet. As we will find in legislation introduced today, and which is up for debate in the next parliamentary sitting, people will be able to go forward instead of backwards. They will be guaranteed that their circumstances can only be improved upon-a further example in of the sort of prestige that we attach to people with trade skills in this country. Changes under this bill are designed to streamline administrative processes for engaging and appointing federal safety officers. The current process, as originally prescribed, is inefficient. We want to see an end to the system whereby a person first has to be engaged as a consultant by the secretary of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations before the Federal Safety Commissioner can actually appoint them as a federal safety officer. The amendments in this bill will allow the Federal Safety Commissioner to engage consultants for the purposes of appointment as FSOs and determine the terms and conditions of their engagement. So, again, this will allow them to be proactive in every possible way. The engaging of consultants will still be subject to standard Australian government procurement processes. One of the things we will not require is that they have to be a member of a union to be an FSO. If the Australian Labor Party forms government later in the year, it will be: no ticket, no start. You tralia. will not see an FSO in a workplace anywhere around Australia unless they are a member of a union-that would be the way the Labor Party would run it-because, unless they are involved with a union, they cannot be trusted. We will see that impact right around Australia in every small business. Union officials will be standing by the till deciding who is hired and who is fired, who is working safely and who is not working safely. These sorts of matters are of grave concern to the people of Australia today. Mr Brendan O'Connor- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The member for Moreton has referred to the bill only twice in 17 minutes. It is about time he went back to the bill.",139
237,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,I am sure the honourable member for Moreton knows the requirement of being relevant.,141
238,Mr HARDGRAVE,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"Of course, it is not surprising that those opposite would take a point of order the second I start talking about their ‘no ticket, no start' ambitions. I have constantly been working my way through the various stages of the bill. I am surprised the member for Gorton has not realised that I have, in fact, constantly been dealing with the way in which the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner and the Federal Safety Commissioner will be operating and the way in which the administrative arrangements will ensure a better deal for the construction industry and the workers within it. I am just surprised that the member for Gorton should take that point of order. It can only be because he is so concerned about the point I make-that the Australian Labor Party's clear ambition is very simple: no ticket, no start. Unless you are a member of a union, you will not get a start in a building and construction workplace anywhere around AusA painting contractor that I was talking to the other day said that when he walks into a building workplace in Brisbane he will find the union official standing at the gate saying: ‘You're a painting contractor. You can't come in here unless you've got the union ticket.' The painting contractor says: ‘Buzz off, mate. I know exactly what my rights are and I'm coming to do a job.' This is a bloke who has a business which he and his brother started 10 years ago, and he now has 10 people working for him-10 extra mortgages being paid in Australia-and we have a union official standing at the gate saying, ‘No ticket, no start,' regardless of how safely this man may operate in the workplace and no matter how professional and capable he is. He is being judged only through the prism of his union membership and his union membership alone. The Australian Labor Party should stand condemned for the fact that they put occupational safety second to union membership; they put occupational safety second to whether or not the unions are actually running it. The occupational safety of workers is down the list if there is not a union person involved in this. If the Labor Party have their way, for Kevin Reynolds and people like him-people who have gone to 10 Western Australian construction companies and demanded they hand over $397,935.48 to the CFMEU for casual union tickets-it would not just be ‘no ticket, no start'; even if you do not want a ticket, you would have to pay to keep the unions away. That is the sort of vision that the Australian Labor Party have for Australia. They should stand condemned. I think you will find that big and small businesses and their employees around Australia are genuinely concerned about the way the Labor Party want to run Australia. (Time expired)",141
239,Mr HAYES,INDUSTRY IMPROVEMENT,"The more this government attempts to move legislation the more we see amendments before this place. Quite frankly, the government has become a serial offender in that we have regularly seen tax bills before this place, it seems that this legislative sloppiness, if you like, has come down to industrial relations. We saw the mother of all amendments come into this place today which is likely to be debated sometime during the course of this week. When you think about it, this takes away a lot of the need for the government to actually come up with ideas. The government is bereft of ideas when it comes to change. It is certainly bereft of ideas when it comes to having a decent legislative program. Quite frankly, the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (OHS) Bill 2007 is just another example of that. Quite frankly, amendments to their own legislation must be a welcome sight when they come to the cabinet table, because it means that ministers do not have to come up with new ideas; it means that ministers do not have to try and take money away from their taxpayer-funded re-election campaigns to invest in things such as infrastructure, health or the provision of further education and training. I digress. In terms of the contribution we just heard from the member for Moreton, it would be remiss of me if I did not make some comment. I have to say that I and, I suppose, every other working Australian would take umbrage at the way they are demeaning the health and safety issues of workers on sites. I and every other worker in this country place a lot of truck on having safe workplaces. It has been simply trivialised. The member for Moreton is not the first to do that and will not be the last. I have to say, putting health and safety as low as that in this debate is a fair indication of the standing of a lot of members opposite. This bill is not opposed by the Labor Party, but I would like to make certain comments in terms of commending Labor's second reading amendment to the House. The but bill before us amends a bill that was passed by the House in August 2005. Fewer than two years have passed since we debated amendments to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005. I might add that this is not the first time that this bill has been amended. Prior to the original bill being put before this House, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations introduced about 30 pages of amendments to the original bill. He did not get it right then and it seems that he has not got it right now, as we are here debating further amendments today. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005, extending the application of the Australian government's building and construction industry occupational health and safety accreditation scheme, administered by the Office of the Federal Safety Commissioner, to cover the situation where building work is indirectly funded by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority and to ensure that persons are accredited under the scheme at the time of entering into a contract for the building work funded by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority, and that the Commonwealth or a CommonwealthDebate interrupted.

241,Ms GEORGE,ADJOURNMENT,"As you are aware, yesterday was the 40th anniversary of the referendum conducted on 27 May 1967. Yesterday I was also honoured to be asked to be the keynote speaker at a gathering organised by the Shellharbour council, one which involved a lot of Indigenous and non-Indigenous citizens in a celebration of commemoration and reflection on those events of four decades ago and some of the difficulties that continue to face our nous communities. This weekend's event was preceded by a very important event on Friday night where the elders in my community presented themselves at what they referred to as a debutante ball. It was great to see many of the local female elders being presented to the gathering at the WIN Entertainment Centre and in a lot of cases being accompanied by their grandchildren. It was important to see that the generational issues of concern to Indigenous communities and the importance of their culture was being passed down from the elders to the younger people in our community. It was four decades ago that the Australian people overwhelmingly voted to give the federal government the power to legislate for Aboriginal people and to count them as citizens in their own country. It is hard to believe, isn't it, that it took until 1967 for the first peoples of our nation to have their citizenship rights recognised in that very important referendum. The overwhelming support for those constitutional changes-and, as history records, more than 90 per pent of Australians voted yes for those changeswas a national expression of hope: hope that the injustices, the disadvantages and the legacies of historical wrongs would be righted in the decades after the referendum. These changes in 1967 were a big step on the road to reconciliation. As history records, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people were involved in gaining support over many years for the petition that led to the referendum and in the lobbying that urged for a bipartisan approach to the changes sought by the Indigenous community. The Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, FCAATSI, was an important component of the campaign and Indigethat organisation embraced a number of high-profile Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. One in particular stands out in my memory-that is Faith Bandler. I was really heartened to see interviews with her last weekend and to recognise the important contribution that she has made to the cause of justice for Aboriginal people, her own people from the Torres Strait, and other islands. The campaign for justice for Indigenous communities in our modern era probably dates back to 1938 when Bill Ferguson and 1,000 Aborigines protested in Sydney on the day they refer to as the ‘day of mourning'. At this protest, they loudly proclaimed their concern about the loss of their lands, the loss of their culture and the denial of citizenship rights. With the changes in the referendum, a lot of hopes were realised but, then again, I think people understood that there was no guarantee of action to remove the legacy of disadvantage and discrimination. While over the last four decades there have been advances in Aboriginal legal and land rights and laudable achievements, particularly by noted Aboriginal actors, athletes, artists, demics, doctors and lawyers, the appalling state of living conditions for many remains a blight on Australia's standing in the international community and shames us all. The commemoration of the anniversary of the referendum has been an opportunity to speak the truth and to find common ground among Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples so that we can work together to eradicate the disadvantages we are all so aware exist in many Indigenous communities. As it happened, this weekend was also very close to the 10th anniversary of the Bringing them home report into the stolen generations. I think we should acknowledge the deep, personal grief inflicted on many children and their families and, to that end(Time expired) Australian Wheat Board",143
242,Mrs MIRABELLA,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to comment on a matter of concern to my constituents in the grain industry. Silo Bags is an innovative and successful technology which is revolutionising the way that grain is handled, stored and traded around the world. From its humble beginnings in Springhurst, just north of Wangaratta in my electorate, Silo Bags has come as something of a revolution in the grain industry by effecting considerable savings in freight and handling costs for grain growers across Australia and, indeed more recently, overseas. The Silo Bags technology is of enormous benefit to grain growers. If at harvest time there is no storage capacity on their farms, farmers can utilise Silo Bags to ensure the optimal preservation of grain in a convenient and flexible manner through Silo Bags' airtight, large storage capacity on their farms. Its very success as a godsend for wheat growers at harvest time has, however, been seen by the large grain traders and bulk hanacadlers as representing a real commercial threat-this is where the Australian Wheat Board comes into the equation. Under the guise of a joint venture, AWB approached Silo Bags. Under the process of due diligence undertaken at AWB's request, an offer was made to my constituents which would have given the AWB full and total control of the Silo Bags technology, leaving my constituents no income or control in this joint venture, despite it being their business and them owning 75 per cent of the shares-in other words, a total acquisition of a possible threat to AWB's market share. The AWB saw an emerging threat to their lucrative market that was being taken up by a fast-growing number of grain growers, and they immediately sought control of it through a boorish takeover. This, however, was the tip of the iceberg in terms of what was to come. Silo Bags, which has had success in many overseas markets, looked to India for trade. My constituents were approached by AWB India in this regard and given an assurance by AWB that Silo Bags's foreign market rights and commissions would be respected. This was blatantly not the case. Silo Bags sent machinery and bags to India, only to be left in the lurch by the AWB who, after initially agreeing to the shipment, then engaged in taking commissions and sales belonging to Silo Bags. AWB India claimed that, for Silo Bags to retain ownership of their shipment, Silo Bags would have to allow AWB to pay them for the shipment and then Silo Bags would have to buy it back from AWB. Silo Bags were then informed that they would have to alter an invoice and change the amount if they wanted payment for this transaction. This potentially illegal request from AWB remains active because my constituents did not alter the invoice as it was a breach of international trading law, as they understood it. As such, they still await payment from the AWB. When quizzed on this matter, the AWB hide behind their legal teams and provide an elaborate subterfuge in any way possible to hide their responsibilities to local grain growers. Through their behaviour in this whole tawdry episode, the AWB have been shown to be the very authoritarian bullies that Commissioner Cole alluded to in his report last year. Silo Bags has unfortunately been a pawn in the game of AWB brinkmanship. Unfortunately, time tonight does not allow me to delve more deeply into the matter here, but it is a story of fear, intimidation, blackmail and collusion. It is a sorry tale of a local Australian innovation being sidelined by the unethical vultures at the AWB. As Commissioner Cole stated in his report: A government grant, by legislation, of a monopoly power confers on the recipient a great privilege. It carries with it a commensurate obligation. The starting point is an ethical base. At AWB the Board and management failed to create, instil or maintain a culture of ethical dealing. Indefinitely keeping the AWB's monopoly powers over Australia's single desk wheat marketing system is akin to making Dougie Cameron the shadow minister for small business. That is why I look forward to the changes the government has foreshadowed in the wheat marketing industry. In written correspondence to the AWB, my constituents sum it up when they say: You cannot hurt myself or my team any more than you lot have. We believed in what we were told, and we believed in the AWB. We are now paying the consequences. Against the odds of the powerful AWB, my constituents have displayed the tenacity and determination that exemplifies the Australian farming spirit. I pay tribute to them and I ask that the AWB remember the very people they are said to have represented-the grain growers themselves. Indigenous Affairs",144
243,Ms GEORGE,ADJOURNMENT,"As I was indicating, it is also the 10th anniversary of the Bringing them home report into the stolen generations. As a nation, we should acknowledge the deep personal grief inflicted on the individual children and their families and, to that end, make a formal apology. A formal apology is the just and decent thing to do. If we acknowledge wrongs and assess honestly what needs to be done, we can, as a nation, move forward. If reconciliation is to be achieved, we must deal with both its symbolism and its substance. Saying ‘sorry' is a very powerful symbol. But symbolism without substance is without meaning. That is why, as a nation and on a bipartisan basis, we should commit to righting the wrongs that still face our Indigenous communities. Above all else, I would point out that it is shameful that in a modern, prosperous society like ours an Indigenous child born in Australia today can expect to die 17 years before a nonIndigenous child will. We need to recapture the spirit that led to the outcomes of the 1967 referendum and recognise that unfinished business and disadvantage still need to be redressed. Volunteering",145
244,Mr HENRY,ADJOURNMENT,"On 15 May in my electorate of Hasluck I assisted the Cancer Council to raise money for cancer research by hosting one of Australia's Biggest Morning Teas. I also took this opportunity to pay tribute to the many volunteers and to the volunteer spirit of the Western Australian community celebrating Volunteers Week. I invited a group of committed community-minded people to celebrate both events. A room full of volunteers is a great place to be. The enthusiasm, camaraderie and positive attitudes of those present ensured the day was well celebrated. Australians have a deep sense of helping others. It is one of the determining characterables istics of our Aussie nature. We are a great volunteer people. The number of volunteers in this country continues to rise. In 2004, there were some 6.3 million Australians donating their time and energy to others. Personally, I expect that the figure is much higher as most people provide volunteer support without realising it-whether it is driving the elderly, reading with primary school students, supporting the school through P&C activities or assisting volunteer organisations to provide valuable services to others such as guiding and scouting. These are vital organisations that have made a significant contribution over many years, providing the basis of a strong and healthy community. And let us not forget the many thousands of mums and dads who give up their weekends to coach our junior and senior sporting teams. I met people from all over the electorate whose commonality is their compassion to assist in the growth and well-being of others. Amongst those was Marilyn Hall, a fantastic lady who has given 18 years of service to the Kalamunda Scouts Association. She is the Kalamunda scout leader and has scouts enrolled in all levels of scouting, from Joeys to Venturers. Her group is the largest and most successful in the district, having won the district award for the past five years straight. When Marilyn is not at the scout hall, she is busy volunteering her cooking skills at the scout training venue. Judy and Bill Stewart also received recognition for almost 20 years of dedicated service to the People Who Care Agency. People Who Care initially started with eight people in a small house in East Perth. They have since grown and moved into new premises in Guildford. They provide vital services to aged and disabled people who choose to live independently. Their valuable assistance enthose people to get on with living their lives where they choose rather than being placed in nursing homes. Bill and Judy both joined as volunteers with People Who Care by taking people to their doctor and hospital appointments and shopping. As with all volunteering, once you become involved there is a natural progression to continue to do more and more. Judy has now progressed to the op shop, which is part of the premises in Guildford, where she has become an important member of the op shop committee. I had the privilege earlier this year of officially opening the newly relocated op shop. It was a fantastic morning celebrating the opening of the shop, which had been moved to a more prominent position to enable passing trade. I cannot speak highly enough of this organisation. They continue to come up with new and innovative ways in which to encourage volunteers into their service. Our ageing population will require more and more people to step forward and play vital roles within the community. Australia's Biggest Morning Tea was all the more successful thanks to many other people from my Hasluck community. My colleague Senator Judith Adams was my special guest on the day and I wish to thank her for her assistance and her candid speech regarding her personal battle with cancer. She also helped to reinforce the enormous impact that volunteers have within the community. Eddie Williams of the Meals on Wheels organisation in Kalamunda organised volunteers to assist on the morning with endless cups of tea, which was very much appreciated. Geraldine Smailes, a Kalamunda resident, and Bruce Harwood of Crabbs IGA kindly provided 200 pink cupcakes, which went down well with the cups of tea. Community spirit in Hasluck is thriving and I am very pleased that this is the case because communities where people care for each other are always stronger, healthier and happier places to live. Broadband",146
245,Mr RIPOLL,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to talk about one of the most frustrating issues which probably happens not just in my electorate of Oxley but right across the country. There are many issues that affect ordinary people but I have to say that the provision of decent broadband services is shaping up to be one of those key election issues. It something which I know distresses a lot of people. To put it really plainly, it frustrates you to absolute tears when you try to get a connection for the first time, you have a connection and you try to improve the speed, you try to go from a dial-up service to broadband or you realise that the cost is just too high and you are left with few options. The reality is that in Australia today over 100,000 people a year who have applied for broadband have been turned down because Australia has a second-class telecommunications infrastructure. The government has known about this second-class infrastructure for quite some time but refuses even to admit that the problem exists at all. I can assure the government here tonight without any question or doubt that there are hundreds of thousands of people out there who are demanding something better than what they have today. I was surprised by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Helen Coonan, who recently said: ... no one is complaining about the speed of broadband in metropolitan areas ... It is almost a quirky, bizarre quote for a minister for communications to say, ‘no one is complaining'. Clever or tricky, maybe, but perhaps she has not been speaking to anybody, because you do not have to go far for people to complain to you continually about the state of broadband in their local area. In fact, Australia's ranking in the world is not very good. We are ranked 25th in the world in our broadband speeds. I will not go into the detail of which countries are in front of us but there are a whole heap of less developed and less fortunate countries with fewer mineral resources than we have coming into government coffers within those countries which are ahead of us. Australia has also fallen behind the rest of the world in broadband usage. We are ranked is only 17th in the world. This is the 21st century; broadband connection is almost a given part of life. It is not a lifestyle choice or issue any longer; it is about quality of life, delivery of services, being able to do business and providing better healthcare services. It is about people being connected to the rest of the world. It is about older people in their homes having that window outside when they often might not have the mobility. It is about finding new friends and new ideas. It is this whole big world that is out there that connects everyone to everybody else. But if you do not have the speed, if you still have dial-up, if you do not have the infrastructure in your local area, you simply miss out. That is the stark reality. In my electorate of Oxley, we have the fastest-growing region in Australia: the western corridor in south-east Queensland is a fantastic growth area but it is not being matched by the provision of telecommunications infrastructure, particularly broadband services in new and old areas alike-for example, Forest Lake, where they are still struggling with broadband black spots; Springfield, which suffers particularly with broadband provision, and older suburbs such as Sinnamon Park, in new areas in that locality. It is just incredible that these areas are not fully serviced and some areas are not serviced all. People are not really given the choices or options, they are just told that it is bad luck and that they are going to have to go to some sort of a satellite dish system or basically it is just too costly. In one of the newer estates in my electorate, Windermere Estate, houses are even sharing phone lines; they are being pushed onto dial-up services and left with very poor choices. Labor, on the other hand, are committed to developing a national fibre-to-the-node broadband network in Australia, something we will deliver for all Australians. Government can do this; government can do it in partnership with private enterprise and with industry. Labor will also make available $4.7 billion to ensure that the network reaches as many Australians as possible. I think that is a good investment in Australia's future and it is a good investment in ordinary people. This multibillion-dollar infrastructure investment will deliver a minimum 12 megabits per second to 98 per cent of Australian homes and in a lot of areas it will be much faster. There will be huge leaps forward from where we are today. This is something that people not only need but deserve. This is something our economy needs. This is something that will deliver for Australia way into the future. It is something that this government ought to realise and they should stop saying that people are not complaining. The reality is that people are complaining and they need a government that listens to them. Wakefield Electorate: Service Clubs",147
246,Mr FAWCETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to draw the attention of the House to the running this month of the Annual Combined Service Clubs' Dinner in Gawler. The reason I bring this to the attention of the House is that so often we hear that we do not get cooperation in communities and that we do not see communities really looking outside of themselves. But the service clubs in Wakefield are made up of a fantastic group of people. In Gawler in particular this annual event is something to be applauded and it should be replicated around the country. What happens is that once a year all of the service clubs come together for a dinner where they can share information about the programs they are running, the activities they are doing, needs they have and opportunities that arise so that they can be more effective by working together. The Country Women's Association hosted this year's dinner. Linda Bertram as the president welcomed us to the evening and invited each of the clubs to have a representative, either their president or another member, give a report about the club's membership and the activities that were undertaken. The thing that really struck me was that, whilst we tend to think of, say, your typical Lions Club project as being perhaps a shelter at a park or something, what I am seeing through the service clubs in Wakefield, particularly the ones in Gawler, is a real focus on communities. We are seeing a real outreach to communities, not just locally but internationally, that are worse off than our own. There is a real intention to reach out and help them, from Apex and its help for the Westmead Craniofacial Clinic activities through to the local Lions Club, who have restored the train at the Gawler railway station, particularly through their use of the Work for the Dole scheme, which has seen a number of people come and be involved in the restoration of the building environs and the train-and the creation of a real centrepiece for the Gawler railway station. There is the Gawler View Club, and Pauline LaRoche spoke of the many women involved in that locally as well as on a broader basis, and their involvement with the Smith Family-again, looking to support young people and families not as well off as ours. Barry Stewart spoke on behalf of the Rotary Club of Gawler, which has very generously made me an honorary member. We heard about Alison Russell and Zonta, which is involved in advancing the status of women around the world in areas such as health and through combating things like trafficking. Interestingly, people like Naomi Arnold have been involved in Zonta not just at the local level but also at an international level. That says a lot for the quality of people in our community who step up to the mark and are prepared to take on leadership roles within these service groups. Martin Monument spoke on behalf of the Rotary Club of Gawler Light. I have been very pleased to be involved in some of the activities that this Rotary Club has run, such as the mental health forum in Gawler, where they were endeavouring to bring together people who have an interest in mental health, people who are engaged in supporting people with mental health issues and people who suffer from mental health issues, to bring an awareness of the help that can be provided and of gaps in services that we need to fill. They also have an active role in supporting the Gawler Health Service, as well as things like the Variety Club. Monika Klopas spoke on behalf of the Gawler Para branch of Apex and highlighted the 12 years that they have been running the Christmas light display along the riverbank. She bemoaned the fact that, with a couple of members moving on, their membership is now quite small; but, typical of the function that evening, one of the other service clubs offered to come on board and actually take over that role to make sure that the Christmas light display, which is so welcomed by the families of Gawler, continues. Bruce Townsend spoke on behalf of the Kiwanis and highlighted the fact that, whilst there is much need in the world, the Kiwanis approach is to change the world one child and one community at a time, and he gave examples of the things that they are doing to support people in East Timor. Lastly, we heard about the work of the Country Women's Association in providing baby packs to needy mums, emergency accommodation to families in need and even reaching out to people like the Fiji Cancer Society through the provision of things like sewing machines. All this just brings into sharp focus the outward-looking nature and community-mindedness of these people in Gawler, and on behalf of all Australians I thank them for the time and effort which they volunteer. Road Fatalities Anniversary of the Battle of Piave",148
247,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would first like to acknowledge the cooperation of the member for Casey in facilitating the adjournment debate this evening. Tonight I seek to address an issue of critical importance to all members of the House this evening-that is, the unfortunate number of Australians killed each year in road accidents. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau figures show that more than 1,600 people died on Australian roads in the year leading up to April of this year. This is barely an improvement on the number of road fatalities from five years ago. Earlier today in this chamber, I supported the motion standing in the name of the member for Ryan going to the support of the National Road Safety Black Spot Program. The federal opposition support the government's black spot program and AusLink 2. Labor would retain the black spot program through to 2014, the end of the AusLink 2 period, if we were fortunate enough to be elected to government in the election this year. Federal Labor want to see an improvement in the numbers of people dying on the roads. We need to commit ourselves to seriously pursuing endeavours to reduce fatalities on the road. Throughout this year, I expressed my concern that the money being spent on the black spot program is not targeted effectively enough. I reiterate, from speech in the House earlier today, that the black spot program is too important to be pork-barrelled by the Howard government, as has occurred over the last couple of weeks with the AusLink Strategic Regional Program after heavy influence from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services on behalf of his National Party caucus members. The forthcoming Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics report will evaluate the success of the program. I hope to see the black spot program continue to target areas that have the highest rates and risk of accident. We have a long way to go to achieve the target of reducing accidents, by 2010, to 40 per cent below the 1999 benchmark. Currently we are well behind on meeting that target and we are also performing poorly compared to other OECD countries. The action plan for the National Road Safety Strategy 1999-2010 reflects poorly on Australia's progress to reduce road deaths and accidents. The action plan reports that there has been, firstly, little reduction in deaths for vehicle occupants in singlevehicle crashes; secondly, a 15 per cent increase in the deaths of motorcycle crash victims; and, thirdly, a 20 per cent increase in deaths from multiple-vehicle crashes. While we are trying to reduce these targets, Australians are dying and families are affected by tragic losses from fatal road accidents. These deaths, I contend, are preventable, and the number of deaths on Australian roads, as we all accept, is too high. The opposition want to see a change in the number of people dying on Australian roads-and I also accept that all members of the House support such an objective. In 2007, Melbourne was successful in re have ducing the number of accidents and number of fatalities, with the Victorian road toll below the national average. However, this my sadly changed at Easter, which is a time when a lot of people are travelling on the roads and fatigue often sets in. In this period, greater Melbourne experienced 10 fatal road accidents, three fatal accidents within 24 hours. In my own electorate of Batman, three lives have been claimed on the roads during 2007. I can only imagine the impact that this has had on the families and friends of the crash victims and I extend my greatest sympathies to them. This evening I would also like to briefly touch on an important local function I attended yesterday with the Italian community, to celebrate and recognise the 89th anniversary of the Battle of Piave, which was a significant battle of 1918 in World War I. This was organised by ANSI, a local organisation in my electorate, to mark the importance of this battle and the pride of the Italian people in what is considered to be, in World War I history, a bloody and determined battle that revealed the strength of Italy and the pride of her people. It was symbolic of the people's determination to defend their country and maintain their way of life. The battle has the equivalent meaning to Italy that Gallipoli has to Australia. Folklore says that, in the war, the Piave River changed from clear blue to run the colour of blood. I simply say to the Italian community in my electorate, which is very significant in size, that I was pleased to be a part of this recognition of the sacrifices made by the Italians, including civilians, during the First World War, and I really appreciate the importance of continuing this annual function so as to acknowledge the struggles of the past and keep alive the memories of lost loved ones. Thank you very much for the opportunity to address the House this evening. House adjourned at 9.30 pm",149

For 10 years it just ‘Oh, my God, we need to do all these things.' has ripped money out of education and health, of having Labor's Commonwealth dental health money back then but it has caused a lot of pain to come back, and Labor will be putting that because the long-suffering taxpayer deserves a paying. They are now paying more tax than they NA have ever paid. Higher education needs to be back on the agenda. We need to see this government go on about infrastructure in Queensland in the years of doing absolutely nothing, what is dice before an election, this is the government taxpayers' money-and says, ‘We're here to help; think most people have woken up and said, ‘But were you when we were crying out for funding urgent upgrades on federal roads?'
