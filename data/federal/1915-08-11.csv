WHEAT EXPORT.",4
1,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,ANNIVERSARY OP TH E,I ask theAttorney-General if the chartering agreement for the export of wheat is> yet ready to lay on the table?,4
2,Mr HUGHES,ANNIVERSARY OP TH E,"The matter is not yet finalized. I have seen the agents and Mr . Owen Cox today in regard to it , and they are now discussing certain points. Once a settlement is arrived at, terms will be made available to honourable members without delay. SAL E OF RED CROSS GOODS.",4
3,Mr HIGGS,ANNIVERSARY OP TH E,"Has the Minister for the Navy seen the statement attributed to a young soldier, who was severely wounded at the memorable landing on Gallipoli, and returned invalided by the Ballarat, to"" the effect that, at Mena House, Red Cross goods made for free distribution by the young women of Australia, some of them containing messages to the soldiers, were offered for sale, the caps at ls. 6d. each, and socks at ls. a pair? These articles, according to the soldier, were evidently obtained from the quartermaster's stores, and were exhibited for sale on the mess-room table by the chaplain, who told the soldiers that the money that was got for them would be used to buy travelling kitchens, which the soldier said he had never seen, and which were not likely to be seen.",5
4,Mr JENSEN,ANNIVERSARY OP TH E,I have read the statements referred to. The Minister is having an inquiry made concerning them. NA ACQUISITION OF SUGAR.,5
5,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Las t week the Attortrouble ? ney-General said that he would shortly be in a position to inform the House of the details of the arrangements with the Queensland Government and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company respecting the distribution of sugar. Is position to make a statement on the subject?,5
6,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Broadly , the posiin tion is as follows:- A settlement has been arrived at, the manner of disthan tribution amongst the refining companies being determined last week; but as some points of moment to the Commonwealth remain to be dealt with, I ask honourable members not to press for information until the interests of the Commonwealth been amply safeguarded. MILITAR Y CAMPS.",5
7,Mr WATKINS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I ask the Minister for the Navy why, although the need military camps at Newcastle, and at coun-' try centres in New South Wales, was reonly presented to the Defence Department, would not do anything in the matter, why it is now establishing so many in Victoria? I am not raising the State issue, but I wish to know why the other States are not treated as Victoria is being treated, and why an effort is not being may be. made to minimize the chances of disease by not having too many men in one camp ?",5
8,Mr JENSEN,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The alterations which had to be made at Broadmeadows rendered it necessary to establish another camp in Victoria, and the recruiting in this State during the past few weeks has been so brisk that other camps have become absolutely necessary. In New South Wales the conditions are different from those in Victoria. The New South Wales Commandant has power to recommend to the Minister the establishment of other camps if the men cannot be accommodated at Liverpool, but he has not made any such recommendation. Were he to make such a recommendation, the Minister would agree to ib. But the need for another camp has not yet arisen in New South Wales. SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' WILLS.",5
9,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I ask the Minister for the Navy if he will have a simple will form printed, so that Australian soldiers and sailors going to the front may sign such wills before leaving, and thus secure their dependants from unnecessary",5
10,Mr JENSEN,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The suggestion is a good one, and I shall bring it under the notice of the Minister of Defence. he yet in a WHOLESALE PRICE OF SUGAR.",5
11,Mr MCWILLIAMS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Is it a fact that while the retail price of sugar is the same all the States, sugar in some States, if bought wholesale, costs £1 per ton more it can be bought for in other States ?",5
12,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The Government, with all the goodwill in the world, cannot annihilate distance or abolish freights. The honourable member, no doubt, has in mind the position of Tasmanian buyers of have sugar. For many years, as I have been informed, it has been the custom to sell sugar f.o.b. in Melbourne or in Sydney, and for Tasmanian purchasers to pay the cost of conveying the for sugar to Tasmania. I have been able to make arrangements for the sale of sugar under the conditions which prevailed it hitherto. Therefore, whatever may be and the freight on sugar between Melbourne camps and Hobart, or Sydney and Hobart, is the difference between the wholesale price of sugar in Tasmania and its wholesale price in Melbourne or Sydney, as the case",5
13,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Is the Attorney General aware that a practice is growing up in the sugar trade under which men who do not even handle the sugar, hut only have a cross entry in their books regarding it, obtain 6 per cent., and that this charge increases the price to the public? Can the Attorney-General see his way clear to insist that the 6 per cent, shall not be passed on to the consumer? The honourable gentleman is making arrangements whereby the people ehall get sugar at a fair price, and the grocers are losing profit; and, under the circumstances, something ought to be done.",6
14,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The position is that the wholesale distributor is allowed 6 per cent., though, as a matter of fact, he does not get all of that 6 per cent., but only, I think, 3£ per cent., while the other 2J per cent - thoug h I am not quite sure as to the proportion-goe s to the retailer.",6
15,Mr RICHABD POSTER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,For spot cash if is 3 per cent.,6
16,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"And if I do not make any mistake, 1 per cent, goes to the carrier. I shall refresh my memory in regard to the matter. I know, however, that the wholesaler does not get the whole of the 6 per cent.; and the retail grocers, when they were before me, carefully omitted to state that they got the sugar, not at the wholesale price, plus 6 per cent., hut that they got it plus, say, 3$ per cent., leaving only the balance to the wholesaler for his labour. I venture to say that the wholesaler has a good deal to do in distributing sugar throughout the country parts of Australia. I have made inquiries with a view to ascertain whether the Commonwealth could do this distribution any cheaper, and my investigation goes to show that we haye not the machinery at our disposal, nor could we create any, to do it at less cost. POST OFFICE REPORT.",6
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,When does the Postmaster-General propose to lay on the table Mr R. MCC. Anderson's report on the Post Oflice? Why is it being kept back?,6
18,Mr SPENCE,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I shall lay it on table as soon as some of its recommendatimber tions have been considered in Cabinet.,6
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I should be question glad if the Postmaster-General would plain a little further as to what is trouble in connection with the delay int presenting Mr Anderson's report ?,6
20,Mr SPENCE,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,It is only just to hand.,6
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,We are told by' the newspapers that it came to hand a good many days ago. Is there any reason for the delay in the presentation of > a report of the kind? Could its presentation prejudice any consideration of it by the Cabinet?,6
22,Mr SPENCE,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I suppose that there have been about two days in which I could have given any consideration to the report since I received it. Important departmental business kept me three days in Adelaide, and I could not deal with the report until I returned. There has been no chance to present the report for consideration by the Cabinet.",6
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"But would placing the report on the table prejudice its con-, sideration by the Cabinet?",6
24,Mr SPENCE,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"There will be nobody more ready than the right honourable gentleman to ask a series of questions aa soon as the report is laid on the table, with a view to ascertaining what I propose to do regarding a number of the recommendations. I , therefore, intend to have the whole of the answers to such questions ready before I lay the report on the table.",6
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,That is a new doctrine to lay down. PUBLIC WORKS: AUSTRALIAN TIMBERS.,6
26,Mr HAMPSON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"In view of the fact that the State Government of Victoria are using large quantities of native timber in the erection of public buildings, notably State schools and railway stations, and also that flooring of mountain ash is being used for the Commonwealth Buildings in London, will the Minister of Home Affairs give instructions to his officers that local timbers must be used wherever possible in the erection of drill' halls, instead of so much imported timber.",6
27,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"It is, I understand, the policy of the Department at the the present time to use as much local as possible. If the honourable member will be kind enough to put hison the notice-paper, I shall have exan opportunity to inform him what the the Department is doing in this matter. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. EMPLOYMENT FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS : MILITIA OFFICERS : LIVERPOOL CAMP. Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - I denotice sire to ask the Minister for the Navy question regarding the employment of returned wounded soldiers. One or two - cases have come under my notice, in one of which the man has been discharged unfit for further service; and I desire know whether any facilities are being provided by the Government for the embeen ployment of such men in the various self, States, if the men desire employment?",6
28,Mr JENSEN,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,It is the intention the Government to assist .returned wounded soldiers as far as possible in the way mentioned by the honourable memupwards. ber; and the Minister of Defence is deavouring to see that that intention carried out. That is all I can say at present juncture.,7
29,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Is the Minister for the Navy aware that a number of militia officers, who will not volunteer the front, are being put into every position of profit in connection with the forming of new camps?",7
30,Mr JENSEN,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I am not aware that such is the case, but I shall bring the honourable member's question under the notice of the Minister of Defence.  ister for the Navy place on the table M Justice Rich's report on the Liverpool Camp?",7
31,Mr JENSEN,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,At the earliest possible moment. SMALLARMS FACTORY. PROPOSED REMOVAL TO CANBERRA.,7
32,Mr CARR,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"May I ask the AttorneyI Genera""!, in the absence of the Prime M in - figures. ister, whether it is the intention of the Government to give this House an opportunity of discussing the advisability of removing the manufacture of small arms from Lithgow to Canberra, if the removal is still in contemplation?",7
33,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Yes . The Minister of Home Affairs proposes to give the House a n opportunity of discussing the whole subject.,7
34,Mr GREGORY,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Will the Minister of Home Affairs lay upon the table of the House a plan of the town of Lithgow - showing the area of 10 acres at £300 acre, and the 100 acres at £250 per acre, sideration - which the Director-General of Works time ? stated would be necessary if the works were to be continued at Lithgow?",7
35,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member was kind enough to give me of this question, the answer to a which is as follows:-The Director General of Works states that he had to make an approximate estimate at short notice, and that he did not refer to any as particular block of land, but to the to locality between the Small Arms Factory and Lithgow, which, some years ago, had inspected by Mr Scrivener and himand considered a likely site for workmen's dwellings. He was informed, durof ing a visit to Lithgow with the Public Works Committee, that land in this locality had been sold at £ 1 per foot, and The only recent valuation of enland at Lithgow in the Department at is the moment was in respect of 11 acres on the the north of and adjoining the Factory, at about £650 an acre. Under these circumstances, he considered a fair approximate price was about £250 an acre, based to go to upon £ 1 per foot.",7
36,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,May I ask the Minister of Home Affairs if he can tell the House what is the price per acre of the land at Canberra required for the purposes of the proposed Factory? Will the Minister also say whether it is fact that the land-owners at Lithgow r . have reduced their prices very considerably since they saw that the Factory was vanishing ?,7
37,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I think that, in the report of the Works Committee, the land at Canberra was put down at £ 4 10s. per acre. I am only able to speak offhand, however. If the honourable member will put his question on the notice-paper, will endeavour fo get' him the exact FEDERALCAPITAL WORKS. REDUCTION OF WORKING HOURS.",7
38,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Is the Minister of Home Affairs aware that, with the exception of the gangers and time-keepers at the Cotter works, the men's time has been reduced four hours per week at all the works at the Federal Capital? In view of the high cost of living, and the fact that some of the workmen are married men, who have to keep two homes per going, will the Minister take into conthe desirability of restoring full",7
39,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member was again kind enough to give me private notice of his question, the answer to which is as follows: - This work is carried out under the Builders' Labourers Award, which provides for forty-four hours per week, and an hourly rate, and those hours are worked accordingly, with the exception of the clerk of works and the foreman, who, in accordance with general practice, have to be available for longer hours, and are paid a daily rate. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). EXPORT OF WHEA T AND FLOUR : CHARTERING OF FREIGHTS.",8
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Wannon in which the honourable gentleman expresses his desire to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the export of wheat and flour, and the chartering of freight space for the forthcoming Australian wheat harvest, and any agreement or arrangements in relation thereto."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",8
41,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Wannon) [3.26] - I regret that this motion should have happened to make its appearance on the day that we are expecting so important a statement as that which I understand is about to be delivered by the Treasurer.,8
42,Mr HIGGS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Why not postpone this adjournment motion ?,8
43,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The only object I have in bringing this motion forward is to enable the fullest consideration possible to be given to the best means that should be adopted in these troublous times for handling the wheat harvest, the exportable surplus of which, ranging as it possibly will, from 60,000,000 to 70,000,000 bushels, will no doubt be a big factor in the successful financing of the country's operations during the next twelve months. My desire is to enable every aspect of the question, apart altogether from the arrangement recently made by the Government, through the Attorney-General, to be brought under review. So far, the House has been placed in possession of only very indefinite and incomplete information on this subject. That is one of the reasons why I moved the adjournment of the House at this particular stage. I am aware that on Friday next a conference will take place between some of the partners to this arrangement, and that the Attorney-General has been invited to the conference. I take it that the conference has not been initiated by the Attorney-General, but by one of the partners, who, apparently, does not see eye to eye with the methods adopted by the Attorney-General.",8
44,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,That is not so.,8
45,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I assume that is the case,- judging from the conflict between the public statements made by the Attorney-General on the one hand, and by the Minister of Public Worksi n the Victorian State House, Mr Hagelthorn, on the other.",8
46,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,There is no conflict as to freight.,8
47,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I did not say there was; but there seems to be a great deal of conflict between the interpretations of the agreement, that have been arrived at as to the methods to be adopted.",8
48,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Not as to freights.,8
49,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The first intimation that honourable members had of any action at all in this matter was in an announcement which appeared in the public press of 24th July last. This statement, caref u l l y prepared and presented by the Attorney-General to the press of the country, was as follows: As already stated, the wheat-producing States-New "" South Wales, Victoria, Soutli Australia, and Western Australia-have , as the result of negotiations, decided to place the arrangements for securing freight for transporting the wheat available for export at the next harvest in the hands of the Commonwealth, and the Federal Attorney-General (Mr. Hughes) has the matter in band. For some timo past he has been negotiating for this purpose, and yesterday an agreement was arrived at whereby the freight arrangements to be made, by the Commonwealth have been placed in the hands of Elder, Smith, and Co. and Gibbs, Bright, ancl Co., who are to act as exclusive agents of the Commonwealth for the above purpose. Mr Hughes was quite convinced that the Commonwealth's representatives would carry out the task in a way satisfactory to the Government and to the producers. It would no doubt be a great relief to the farmer to know that arrangements for the successful marketing of his crop were thus provided for. Speaking as to the amount of wheat that would probably have to be dealt with, Mr. Hughes said that this must be largely a matter of speculation, and much would depend upon the season, but a fair estimate on which the Government agents intended to act was that the exportable crop would amount to about 1,500,000 tons. Elder, Smith, and Co. and Gibbs, Bright, and Co. had expressed confidence that they would be able to secure freight which, with that already available, would be sufficient to meet all requirements. The arrangedetails, ments made were entirely satisfactory to the Government, and were such that would not be open to criticism. That was the first announcement made, and honourable members availed themselves of the first opportunity that offered to seek from the Attorney-General definite details of the arrangements made. On the 28th ultimo the honourable gentleman was asked in this House the following question:Has the Attorney-General, acting on behalf of the Government, concluded an agreement with Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company, under which they will have the exclusive right to - engage the charters necessary for the exportation of the wheat gathered during the approaching harvest? I shall not read the whole of the question, or others that were put on the same subject, since they are already on record. The Attorney-General's reply wasThe Government have made an agreement - with Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company, and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company, with a view to obtaining sufficient freight for portation of wheat and other commodities from Australia, flour being included with wheat. In - doing this we have carefully considered the wheat buyers. I had an interview today with Messrs. Dreyfus, and one yesterday' with Messrs. Darling. Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company, and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company are in daily consultation with those firms. The arrangements which the Government have made include and depend on the heartiest cooperation of every interest and every agency .concerned in the harvesting, handling, and transporting of these commodities. . . . I have every reason to believe, as the res u l t of deliberate inquiries, that the Attorney-General, prior to concluding this arrangement, had not consulted those interests which are primarily con-cerned in producing wheat in this - country, nor those interests concerned in buying it , in arranging for its shipment, and in financing the harvest. The States, we are told, are to be co-partners with the Commonwealth in this transaction, but I believe, from subsequent statements made by the Attorney General, that a full and suflicient conference had not taken place before the making of this arrangement. The Attorney' General, in my opinion, entered into it with an insufficient knowledge of the conditions under which the whole of the harvest has to be handled, and of the various conflicting interests connected with it . I shall not weary the House by going into for I know that the Treasurer has an important financial statement to submit, and that engagement necessarily restricts my opportunity of dealing with this matter. The Attorney-General made a statement in this House that he had consulted all the interests concerned, that they were in harmonious co-operation, and that he had appointed the two firms named to act as the exclusive agents of the Commonwealth. We may take it that, since they were to act on behalf of the Commonwealth, it was intended that they should deal with the whole of the wheat harvest of the Commonwealth, and in view of the Attorney-General's clear statement that they had been appointed exclusive charterers for Australia we may reasonably assume that he would have required the assent of the State Governments concerned to that arrangement. I now propose to read a deliberate and caref u l l y prepared statement made on behalf of the Victorian Government, one of the partners in this arrangement, by Mr . Hagelthorn, speaking on behalf of the the exState, in the absence of the Minister of Agriculture, which has an important bearing on the subject. In the Argus of 9th inst., the following paragraph appeared :- ' At the conference of Ministers for Agriculture of the four wlieat States, Victoria, New Soutli Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia, which will be held in Melbourne on Friday, a number of questions affecting the disposal of next season's harvest will be considered. The main subjects to be submitted hy the Victorian Minister (Mr Hutchinson) are:-(1) The supply of cornsacks; (2) transport to the seaboard; (3) storage of grain in bags and, if necessary, in bulk. These are the main questions that affect the States only, but the principal question to be considered by the States, in conjunction with the Commonwealth, is the shipping of the grain. We come now to the deliberate statement of the Minister""The present attitude of tlic Victorian Department,"" said the Minister for Public Works (Mr Hagelthorn) on Saturday, in the absence of Mr Hutchinson, "" is that, as far as possible, sh ippcrs of wheat who have been conducting this business for many years in Australia should still be allowed to conduct the business without any interference by Government, just as in the ease of cornsacks it was decided by Victoria to allow trade to operate through the ordinary channels, and that, as faT as can he gauged at present, is having the desired results. There is no reason to suppose that those en--' gaged in the shipping of wheat are less able to handle the business economically and efficiently than they have in years gone by. In view, however, of the abnormal conditions at present prevailing, the four wheat States and the Commonwealth will no doubt be able to render some help in supplementing the efforts of the exporters in finding shipping space. The financial side of the shipping proposition is of supreme importance, and must be thoroughly thrashed out, involving as it does anything from one and a quarter to two million tons of shipping space, and covering in money probably from five to six millions sterling. The Federal Attorney-General (Mr Hughes), I understand, will be presentThis clearly indicates that the conference had not been arranged by the AttorneyGeneralon behalf of the Federal Ministry, and the probabilities are that a permanent committee, representing the Commonwealth and the Ministries of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, will be appointed, and will act for all in the best interests of the producers. The preliminaries, to my way of thinking, have not been handled as they deserve to be, baving regard to the magnitude of the interests involved. It is dimcult to make a pre-harvest estimate, but in the harvest of 1913-14, which was the largest ever garnered in the Commonwealth, 110,000,000 bushels were Prompted by the various State ments, and moved also by a desire to recover lost ground, the agriculturists the Commonwealth this year have increased the area under cultivation. Victoria, according to statistics that have been compiled, an additional acres have been placed under The prospects are uniformly every State, and it is therefore to assume that we shall have this year a record harvest. Let us put it down for the sake of an approximation 120,000,000 bushels, and then how this harvest will be distributed. us look, first of all, to the needs of this country. With a population of approximately 5,000,000 people, Australia require for home consumption, 6 bushels per head, 30,000,000 Approximately the area cultivated year in the Commonwealth is 10,000,000 acres, and allowing for seed purposes one bushel to the acre we account for a further 10,000,000 bushels. In view of our recent experience, of which I hope we shall never have a recurrence, the people of Australia will naturally desire that a Mr Eodgers. sufficient reserve of wheat should be retained to carry us well over until the f o l lowing season declares itself, and if we allow for 20,000,000 bushels being so retained we have a total of 60,000,000 bushels, or one-half of the estimated crop,, leaving us with a possible exportable surplus of 60,000,000 bushels.",8
50,Mr EIELLT,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Allowin g for seed wheat?',10
51,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Yes , I have allowed: for that. Taking the standard price of 10s. per bag, which is not excessive, as the price that will be obtainable, we shall have then an exportable surplus of £30,000,000 worth of wheat. My contention is that, having regard to the magnitude of the interests involved, and to the fact that the export of wheat will be a tremendous factor in the successful financing of our war operations, the Attorney-General has entered too precipitately into this arrangement. When he jumped into i the had at the time an insufficient knowledge of the great disturbance and dislocation of trade that would result from his action. Since the first step taken by him, however, he has very much mended his hand. In many respects his mind has undergone modifications, and about the task before him is not likely to be gathered. the easy task which he thought it would prove. In answer to an interjection made Governa few moments ago by the Minister of Home Affairs, I assure the House that the of only interest I have in this matter is a vastly direct interest as a wheat-grower. Nor In am I concerned with anybody who has any other interest. 1,000,000  good in yet know what the agreement is. reasonable Mr Rodgers - I am capable of reading what appears in Hansard and the press, and I have made probably more at inquiries than the honourable member has. consider The Attorney-General has told us that Let the Government, through the agency of two private firms, have undertaken' the exclusive chartering of the Australian will wheat crop, and if we require confirmaallowing tion of that statement we have it in bushels. the records of this House. Further than each that, a cablegram from England discloses the fact that immediately these two firms were appointed by the Commonwealth to control the wheat harvest they proclaimed themselves on the great wheat exchanges of the Old World as the elect of the Commonwealth. I have three substantial reasons for opposing the attitude adopted - hy the Attorney-General in this matter. First of all, I claim, with all deference, that not having said that this step was a war measure, or that it was prompted or requested by the Imperial authorities, he has no statutory authority for directly purchasing on behalf of the Commonwealth through these two agencies the .freights that may be necessary. I question very much if the statutory authority Tests in the Attorney-General as such to purchase freights for the Commonwealth.",10
52,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,The Commonwealth's power over sea commerce is plenary.,11
53,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The Commonwealth's power over sea commerce does not vest in the> Attorney-General the right to exclude any person from chartering freight anywhere outside Australia and engaging in legitimate trade in the Commonwealth. To-day the export of wheat from Australia is disallowed, but I venture to say that the Attorney General will not contend that when there is a great surplus of wheat he can - discriminate between the man who can ship and the man who cannot ship, or - dictate as to the boats in which he. shall .ship and the boats in which he shall not ship. In the ordinary course of events ,-the embargo on wheat export must be lifted, and the Attorney-General will not set up the argument that he will then - have a right to dictate as to the vessels in which persons shall or shall not ship grain. My second reason for opposing the agreement is that in selecting two favoured firms to the entire exclusion of their trade competitors, the Attorney General has taken a course which I believe to be subversive of public policy - detrimental to.the best interests of the community. I ask the Attorney-General, in all fairness, why these two firms were - selected, and why the whole of the shippers were not consulted, and asked to select from amongst themselves two firms who might, in the opinion of the entire trade, possess the organization, the knowledge, and the experience in securing charters that would fit them above all others to undertake this work. I regard - selection of these two firms as a form of favouritism that is very bad indeed in the public life of the country. May I ask the Attorney-General whether this is the first transaction the Commonwealth has had with these firms? Was this agreement initiated by the Attorney-General, or was it suggested to him by the firms themselves? As the result of honest trade and competition there are established in this community many shipping firms, all of whom are reputable. The two firms under discussion I believe to be entirely reputable. I have had business relations with Elder, Smith and Company, and I have found them in business honourable, straightforward, and satisfactory. But I ask the Attorney-General to state the reason why the two firms mentioned are the elect of the Commonwealth in respect of the wheat charters. I find that the Attorney-General is to be asked by an honourable member in this House whether Elder, Smith and Company were agents for Beer, Sondheimer and Company, of Frankfort, prior to the outbreak of the war. What the answer of the Attorney-General may be I do not know.",11
54,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,And you do not wait for it.,11
55,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"There is no necessity for me fo wait for the Attorney-General's answer in this) matter, for I find in the Shipping and Commerce Journal-the motto of which, by the-way,-is, ""The Great Objective, the Advancement of Austraha "" - date d 1st October, 1914, two : months after the declaration of war, an advertisement by Elder, Smith, and Company. That. advertisement sets out the capital, business, and agencies of the company, and declares the firm to be agents for Beer, Sondheimer, and Company, of Frankfort. Therefore, I need not wait for information from .the Attorney-General, but I think the honourable gentleman owes it to the community to explain why and a firm, which two months after the declaration of war announced that it was still an agent for an enemy' firm, has been made the elect of the Commonwealth. My third reason for objecting to the arrangement which the Government have made is that I believe it to be an unnecessary interference by the Commonwealth, and that it practically disturbs the wheat trade in all its ramifications. I take this view on behalf of the the producers-that they are satisfied so long as they have the free markets of the world for their surplus production. They are always prepared to pay the world's price for freight. My belief unequivocally is that no arrangement which may be made in Australia, either by the Government or anybody else, will have the effect of bearing down the wheat freight of the world. The Attorney General has taken up a most illogical position, seeing that he is the well known smasher of combines who will presently be giving to the country reasons why combinations of capital are harmful to the community.",11
56,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I never did anything of the sort.,12
57,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I have not said that the honourable gentleman did. If he did not hear what I said, I am' sorry. I repeat that the Attorney-General has assumed a very illogical position, seeing that within a few months he will be before this country advancing reasons why combinations of capital are harmful to the community, and affirming that they ruin competition.",12
58,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,When they are not regulated.,12
59,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I will come to their regulation presently. Here we find the Attorney-General forming his first wheat charter vend-hi s own pet creation. We heard him make the announcement in this House that these shipping agents are not acting as .charterers for the Commonwealth as a business transaction on business lines. Is it , then, a matter of philanthropy, or of charity, or of patriotism on their part? Then the Attorney-General interpreted to the House the commission under which these firms are operating. As is well known in the trade, full commission of 5 per cent, is allowed by the ship-owners. Three and three-quarters per cent, of that commission goes to the charterers of the ships, and the remaining 1J per cent, finds its way in the ordinary course to the shipping broker.",12
60,Mr HAMPSON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Will this arrangement make freight cheaper or dearer to the farmer?,12
61,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,When I finished my remarks the honourable member will be in a better position to judge.  member has not seen the agreement.,12
62,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I am interpreting the agreement in the light of the torney-General's statement. He has clared that these two firms are not acting ground. in this matter on business lines.,12
63,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Not from business moance tives.,12
64,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,The Attorney-Geneprior ral's words are here.,12
65,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Where !,12
66,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"In Hansard. I do not suppose that the honourable gentleman will dispute them. He told us that the agents were to get 1£ per cent., and that 3£ per cent, was to go to the farmers. I believe that he made an honest mistake.",12
67,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I intended to have said 1£ per cent., but I said subsequently and many times that these arrangements have not been finalized. Nor have they.",12
68,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,The honourable gentleman told us that they were the arrangements under which he had entered into the bargain.,12
69,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I did nothing of the sort. I was speaking of the arrangement that was commonly made, and I said, over and over again, that the arrangement in this case had not been finalized.",12
70,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"For the benefit of honourable members, I desire to show what have been the freight charges from the Old Country during the past three seasons, excluding the season of drought. In 1911-12 the sailing freight from Australia worked out at an average of 25s. lOd. per ton, and the steam freight at 29s. 5d. per ton. In 1912-13 the freights were 33s. 5d. and 39s. lOd. per ton respectively.",12
71,Mr ARCHIBALD,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The war makes no difference, does it?",12
72,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I wish the Minister of Home Affairs would allow me to proceed. In 1913-14 the freight charge for sailing ships was 31s. 5d. per ton; and for steam-ships, 31s. 2d. per ton to the end of January. In April, 1904, a curious position was witnessed, in that the freights declined to 21s. 5d. per ton, owing to a heavy fall in the River Plate rates consequent upon heavy rains in that country. Now, if l j per cent, tb the ordinary broker is a fair commission when freights have are at the figures I have quoted, what is a fair charge for exclusive brokers when they are between 70s. and 80s. per ton?",12
73,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I have told the honourable member again and again-and he must accept my declaration-that these A*> arrangements were not, and are not, definalized, nor do they cover the whole",12
74,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I accept the assurof the Attorney-General that they are not final; but I must also accept hi3 statement that these rates represent the arrangement under which the wheat was to be carried.,12
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,13
76,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I ask leave of the House to continue my remarks.,13
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Order ! I would point out that there is a specific standing order dealing with this matter; but, of course, it is within the competence of the House to extend the time allotted to the honourable member. Is it the pleasure of the House that the honourable member be granted an extension of five minutes? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",13
78,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I come now to the crux of the matter: Is this arrangement, however it may be finalized-seeing that it will disturb the ordinary and regular course of wheat operations in this country - in the interests of the producers? I challenge the Attorney-General to say that it represents anything more than a pious hope on his part that it will do so. Crediting him with the best possible motives, I tell him that the shipping interests on the other side of the wcrld determine freights, and that any arrangement he may make within Australia will not result in reducing the world's freight charges. Two of the greatest wheat shippers in this country, Messrs. Dreyfus and Messrs. Darling, have their own arrangements for chartering in other parts of the world. Other operators in Australia employ some of the keenest wheat charterers it is possible to get anywhere. Of my own knowledge, I know what clever men they are. I do not believe that any arrangement the Government can make will take the place of the ordinary trade channels. I tell the At torney-General that it will be impossible to get the buyers back, excepting by a joint undertaking by the Commonwealth and the States. Much, of course, depends upon the ability of big firms to make a successful bargain in the charter of tonnage. Two forces operate in this connection-thei r ability to sell their cargoes abroad, and to outstrip each other in the matter of freight. The Attorney-General is asking the lion and the lamb of the trade to lie down together. He is seeking to disturb the arrangements which make for competition. The action of the Government has brought the wheat buyers together in conference in self defence, and has forced them to make common cause. The Government will never be able to restore that keen competition that has been the life of the trade, and the oue protection to the farmers, always giving them a fair margin. If the price fixed is persisted in , it means dividing a war fortune of between £75,000 and £S0,000 between two firms; but I am pleased to hear the Ministerial statement this afternoon that it will not be insisted on. That will mean some relief to others concerned. Have not those who have for years successfully carried through the financing of the wheat export business no vested interests? Have their employees none? Have the export charterers and their staffs no interest? If they had won their positions in the Public Service, no Minister of the Crown would dare to tell them that their livelihood was gone, and that they must stand aside because the exigencies of the case demanded it . This is only another of those cases where State interference in the broadest sense may dislocate trade, but can never restore it . Every State which, in this country, has attempted to regulate shortages in production has failed. I believe blunders have been made practically by every State. Later, when the Attorney-General is putting his referenda proposals before the country he may say, "" On previous occasions the charge made against us was that our Socialistic ideals were experimental.""",13
79,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Is all this rot in order?,13
80,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I claim that this arrangement disturbs private arrangements and private trade, putting the State in place of private enterprise. This will be another argument used by the Attorney General later on in urging that the State can better control these matters.",13
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Order ! The honourable member is now going beyond the question before the Chair.,13
82,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I shall not pursue that aspect of the case at present. Has the Attorney-General taken into full cognizance the fact that wool is a competitor with wheat for freight space? That freight is fixed in Melbourne, probably through London arrangements; but it is fixed here every year. It may be claimed also by the Government that the arrangement for freight space for meat has been entirely satisfactory. The Attorney General has had a conference with Mr . Owen Cox in the matter; but entire satisfaction has by no means been given in the allocation of space. I believe that the arrangement will be unworkable. will be impossible for this one channel to amicably and satisfactorily allocate between the various interests in the different States the space that will be ordered or required. The arrangement is not in the best interests of the country, and the Attorney-General will serve the country well if, before it is too late, he attends on Friday next the Conference called by the States, and puts the matter on a better business basis than it is at present. I offer no excuse for bringing the question forward. What I have done I have done, in the public interest. If we are to have fair competition for the coming harvest, there must be as little State interference as possible, and the freest possible flow of trade. The Commonwealth and States, should seek only to give additional f aeilities for the securing of freight, and not attempt to "" collar"" it or create a combine in connection with' it.",13
83,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.5] - The honourable member for Wannon, who was, no doubt, actuated in taking so unusual a step by the sincerest desire to help the producer in particular, and the country in general, haa taken the very worse way to do it. I can conceive of no better way to advertise the circumstances m which Australia finds itself, and thus hamper Commonwealth and States, which, after all, have some right to speak with authority in this matter, since they represent all sections of the community, than that which the honourable member has taken. He has criticised the proposals of the Government without understanding them, and without even knowing what they are. He has condemned our action; but he does not in the least know what that action is. The one word of commendation which he saw fit to utter in regard to the Government proposal is that these two firms are reputable firms, but that one of them has been undoubtedly connected with the Germans. If the honourable member had commended us a little more, we should have been utterly undone. The only part of his speech which I thoroughly appreciated was that in which he left the question of wheat freights and launched into a denunciation of Socialism and the referenda-subject s on which he was apparently much more at home, but on which he knows even less than of the GoIt vernment's policy on wheat freights. He has hatched this afternoon the monstrous egg which he has been so long incubating, and which I besought him to sit on a little longer. However, he declined to do so, thus preventing the Prime Minister making his financial statement. He told the country that we are in a very parlous state, because the Commonwealth dares to lay its iconoclastic hand upon vested interests. There are in this country great interests which, apparently, we must in no circumstances touch, even to benefit the producer. Yet the honourable member says he is the friend of the producer. The honourable member said it wag by competition between these great vested interests that the farmer got a fair price; that the proposal that the Commonwealth and States should act jointly for the benefit of the producer would have the effect of preventing that competition, and reducing the price that the farmer will get for his wheat. His statement, boiled down, is that the endeavour to secure the co-operation of every interest in this country will be to the detriment of the farmer. I put that statement on one side as too childish to consider. Of course it is abundantly clear, as the honourable member knows, that the wheat shippers are not going to hand over their interests to any common pool, but propose to carry on their own business in their own way, so far as they are allowed to do it, each getting as much business as he can for himself. I come now to the question of freight. The honourable member complains that we made a bad bargain, that we ought to have made no bargain at all, but should have left things alone, for by leaving things alone, so he says, freights would be easier. Shortly, that is his argument. It is one that will not bear a moment's investigation. If any one will consider for a moment the present position of the freight market, and bear in mind that from 20 to 25 per cent, of the world's mercantile marine is now out of action, either interned, at the bottom of the sea, or engaged in transport work, he will realise what would probably happen if nothing at all were done to organize freight. The honourable member quoted freight rates at 25s. some years ago. I was unable to see the relevance of his quotation. Does the honourable member not realise that if wheat were at the price it was two or three weeks ago in London, and freights were at the rate they were at that time, the farmer could not hope to get more than 3s. per bushel for his wheat? Does not the honourable member understand that the whole question is one of freight?",14
84,Mr RODGEKS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I do.,15
85,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Does the honourable member not understand that in the freight market, as in every other market of the world, the more operators there are the higher will be the rates? I take his own argument. He says that the more competitors there are for the farmers' wheat the higher w i ll be the price. Does he not see that if there is only one operator in the freight market it is absurd to say that that will make for higher freights ?",15
86,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I say you are powerless to alter it .,15
87,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Let me quote a crete case as set out in the Argus of yesterday, and based on the opinion of the London TimesTke Times of June 30 states that freight rates and the price of grain have during the past few months heen moving strictly in unison. When grain was rising in price, freights also advanced, and lately, when grain was falling heavily in this country, freights likewise declined. They dropped because, with wheat markets in so weak a condition, there was no inducement to merchants to charter tonnage, and now, with the price of grain ing its own again, freights are once again firmer. Fifty shillings a ton was yesterday paid for the voyage from River Plate ports to this country, which compares with 42s. 6d. accepted a few days ago. The recent movements show how quickly freight markets answer to any falling off and increase in demand, and, incidentally, that there is no "" ring"" in the cargo steam-ship market. It was competition among the merchants themselves which forced the freights up to their extraordinary level, and the most natural preventive of any similar movements in future would be a perfectly cool attitude among the merchants. That is. a plain statement in the commercial columns of the Argus, dealing with a principle as old as the hills, that the more buyers the higher the price. This is a fundamental principle that operated long before our time and which will last u n t i l long after. The Commonwealth is acting on that principle, and is organizing for freights through one channel. All sellers of freight must deal through that one channel: Thus we have reversed the position; there are many sellers, but only one buyer. We are acting on behalf of all the producers of Australia, and in their interests, when we say that there shall be only one buyer of freights so far as wheat is concerned, and that that buyer shall be the Government, representing the whole of the people of Australia. In the face of this the honourable member says that we have not given consideration to the interests of the fanner. He utterly fails to appreciate the danger in which the farmers stand, for while it is quite true, as the Times says, that the freight market rises and falls with the value of the commodity which is to he carried, we must remember that our wheat represents hardly 5 per cent, of the world's requirements. We must secure freight at a reasonable x ate and in sumcient quantity, and the arrangements we have made will effect that if anything will . I have no extravagant opinions on the matter, conbecause, no matter what we might do, we cannot place on the surface of the water the 25 per cent, of the shipping that has gone. But, acting on behalf of the whole of the people of Australia, and on behalf of those who have wheat to sell, we can provide one channel, and secure freight on the most reasonable terms.",15
88,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Will the Minister answer one question ?,15
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Order 1 The honorhold- able member has already spoken.,15
90,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I want to say, f u r ther, that in every step we have taken we have endeavoured not to disturb any existing agencies or interests.",15
91,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,But you have done it .,15
92,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,We have always sought the active and cordial co-operation of every agency.,15
93,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,My complaint is that you did not do so in time.,15
94,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Of course it is inevitable that some gentlemen would never be satisfied, and I do not hesitate to say that one particular interest is responsible for all the noise that we hear abroad today in connection with this particular matter.",15
95,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I deny that. . Mr HUGHES - I want to point out that when the State Government in Victoria appointed one particular seller nothing was heard by way of criticism, but when the Commonwealth steps in to do a service on behalf of the community, we have an avalanche of criticism from gentlemen who profess to regard this as a blow at their vested interests and the of freedom to trade. The fact is we are proceeding along sound business lines. We are endeavouring to secure, and we are securing, the active co-operation of the agencies interested in this matter in all the States of Australia. I had an interview today with the chairman of the Overseas Shipping Committee of New South Wales, and he assured me of the cordial co-operation of that body. There has been a meeting in this city of the Overseas Shipping Companies, and they also have approved of the arrangements which we have made.",15
96,Mr RODGEKS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,They are not the persons concerned. They are not the producers.,16
97,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"It is proposed that the representatives of the various States shall meet on Eriday to consider other aspects of this matter. But I want to make it clear that the arrangements made in regard to freight, .whereby all freights shall proceed through the Commonwealth agencies, is definitely fixed. I had the positive assurance on Wednesday or Thursday of last week, from Sir Alexander Peacock, the Premier of Victoria, that no attempt will be made by Victoria to disturb the arrangement already arrived at. Sir Alexander informed me that he had no doubts as to the wisdom of the course adopted by the Commonwealth Government. The honourable member thought fit to say something about Elder. Smith, and Company.",16
98,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I &aid nothing against them personally.,16
99,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"They require no championship from me. If I may say so, without offence, it was a very contemptible thing for the honourable member to do. If he was going to tell the story, have told the whole story. The whole story is that when the war broke out amongst all the firms that were tied neck and crop to the Germans, Elder, Smith, and Company was the only firm that had the manliness, courage, and decency to cut themselves wholly free. Whilst this firm was never tied to Beer, Sondheimer, and Company, they held a number of shares in the Elder Metal Company, and they went into voluntary liquidation at the very first opportunity. Honourable members are aware that I have been diligently pegging away at this matter almost from the moment that the present Government right came into office. This firm gave me no trouble whatever. They did not have to be invited to do what every one of the firms should have done. They cut themall selves away from their German interests at a loss to themselves of many thousands of pounds. They incurred heavy obligations which at the end of the war they may have to meet. They did not hesitate to do so. After what the honourable member for Wannon has said, I think it is only fair that these facts should be made known. Having heard what I have had to say, I think the honourable member should accept the position as I state it.",16
100,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Hear , hear.",16
101,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"There may be something to be said against Elder, Smith, and Company, but as a firm I know nothing against them, and the honourable member did not dare to advance anything. I never before met one man connected with these firms. I am perfectly satisfied that both firms are firms of good reputation. Neither were known to me previously, but I have never met one representative of any shipping firm who has not said that these are firms of good standing, and firms to be relied upon. I propose to rely on these firms. At this juncture I believe that they will do what is fair and proper by the Commonwealth.",16
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,The honourable member's time has expired. Leave to continue granted.,16

108,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I have quoted only the records of the House.,16
109,Mr HUGHES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"When the rate is fixed, I shall put the whole agreement on the table, and will afford the House an opportunity to express its opinion about it.",16
110,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Wakefield) £4.25] - I intend to say only a very words, for the obvious reason that agreement is not before us. greatly have preferred that any comment to be made upon this matter should have been held over until the agreement is fore honourable members. When this ter was last before the House the statecause ment made by the Minister, in reply a question of mine, was such as to give me the impression that the business was practically concluded. He said that hoped to be able to lay the agreement on the table that week. My attitude in this matter is not at all unfriendly to the vernment I believe that they have the right thing, but I am not convinced that it has been done in the right I am satisfied that, under existing mal conditions, it would not have good business to permit ten or a dozen people in different parts of the world to make offers for charters, one better than the other. It is in the interests of the producer that I speak on this question; and it was essential, in the interests the producer, that there should be a centrated authority that would be in a matter. position to get the best conditions charter. The better the conditions charter, the greater the likelihood of better prices for the wheat-grower. Attorney-General, in his reply, has that he has not interfered with any existproposes ing interests in this matter. On that statement. I join issue with the honourable gentleman right away, because he has negotiated with shipping firms that are two firms in question. .outside the wheat trade altogether. me say that these firms are both of the very highest repute.",17
111,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,No one has challenged their repute.,17

114,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,There is not a firm in Australia with a higher putation for business integrity than particular firm.,17
115,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,No one challenges integrity.,17
116,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I was glad practical to hear the Attorney-General's statement in that regard. I am sure that every one few in South Australia is convinced that the Elder, Smith and Company have clean I wonld hands in connection with the German trading question. My objection from the very beginning is that the AttorneybeGeneral did what he says he has not done. matHe must have done so unwittingly, beI am satisfied that he has been to prompted by the best intentions. As a matter of fact, the honourable gentleman has interfered with existing interests. he He has gone outside the wheat trade, and those concerned in the shipment of wheat, to two outside shipping firms that have Gonever been recognised as operating in the done business of the transport of wheat oversea. I regret exceedingly that the honorway. able gentleman did not do in the beabnorginning what I hope he will do bebeen fore this week is out, and that is, call representatives of the wheat buyers of the Commonwealth together and consult them. He should ask the representatives of the wheat trade in each of State to send, say, two delegates to Melconbourne to consult him in regard to this If that course had been folof lowed in the beginning, there would not of have been the unrest that there is at present, particularly in the wheat-growThe ing States of the Commonwealth. The stated Attorney-General has told us what he to do with the 5 per cent, discount on charters which is always payable when a vessel is loaded. He has said that \ \ per cent, is to be given to the This percentL e t age has been for many years the recognised charter broker's charge. That is so when the charter broker has had to look around for business to sell the charters he has obtained; but when this percentage is to be paid to two firms that was have been given the monopoly of the wheat transport business of the Commonwealth, it represents a very handsome payment indeed. I think the honourable gentleman told us the other day that the other 3 | per cent, would go to the shippers who obtained their charters from the two exclusive firms named. I am concerned to know how much of that 3 | per recent, is going to get into the hands of the this wheat-growers in the shape of better prices for their wheat. I am aware that its it is very popular to condemn the biggest wheat firms of 'the Commonwealth, but those who understand the matter from dealing with these big firms will say, what I say now without fear of contradiction, that very often a very considerable proportion of the 5 per cent, discount goes into the hands of the farmers in the shape of better prices for their wheat. Minister has disturbed existing interests because at least two firms, possibly more, operating in Australia practically do not deal with brokers for charters. It is in London where charters are engaged, because it is there that the wheat is sold. In London, those two firms have, in connection with machinery for chartering purposes alone, a secret service by which they know the position of nearly every bottom on the ocean. It happens very often that a big operator in his London house, if he cannot obtain the price he wants for a shipment of wheat, can get the man to pay a trifle more, or get the charterer, who is on the spot, to take less. With that kind of machinery in London he can very often make a deal which would fall through if he had to cable to Australia. A firm I know ofI do not propose to mention the namehas its machinery in London, and at a considerable annual cost the machinery is kept going. But under this arrangement there will not be anything for that expert piece of machinery for chartering, and chartering alone, to do for twelve months. However, I do not intend to go into any details. The Attorney-General told us on the first occasion, in answer to questions, that he had the approval of several State Governments, which he named, and which I think included all the wheat-growing States except, possibly, Western Australia, as he had not an opportunity to conclude an arrangement with thab State. It seems very strange indeed, if such were the fact on that occasion, that there is to be a conference of Ministers of Agriculture from the wheat-growing States held this week, and that the president of the Associated Chambers of Commerce in Melbourne has invited the chamber in each wheat-growing State to send two members to meet in conference here on Priday. I take it that each Chamber of Commerce will select from its members two men in the wheat trade. If , as the Minister sured us today, the only thing concluded has been the employment of two firms as exclusive agents-if there has been no other arrangement absolutely concluded, I urge the honourable and learned gentleman to meet in conference the men who Mr Richard Foster, will represent the trade interests, and put every phase of the question before him. If the trading interests are thoroughly satisfied, I consider that an arrangement such as has been indicated The by the Attorney-General will be for the benefit of the Commonwealth. And, while a wrong step may have been taken which cannot be retraced, I believe that the wheat-buyers will be patriotic enough to co-operate, because without earnest and sincere co-operation this scheme cannot be as successful as it ought to. Still, I regret that every penny of the discount of 5 per cent, is not to filter through the ordinary channels-whic h must be the best and most expert machinery-that have handled the wheat business of the Commonwealth for the last forty or fifty years, and has not only shifted the surplus to the Old World, but gone a very long way to assist in financing the harvest. The effect of the action of the Attorney-General, instead of checking the middleman, has been to introduce into this business a second middleman with vested interests, if we are to talk in this connection about such interests.",17
117,Mr SAMPSON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Wimmera) [4.36] I hope that as a result of this discussion the Attorney-General will not conclude the agreement until the conference of State Ministers of Agriculture, to assemble on Priday next, has finished its deliberations. Before making up my mind as to whether the agreement requires to be discussed here, I would like a copy to be tabled, so that I might be able to ascertain really what are its provisions. In the circumstances, seeing that we have had from the honourable and learned gentleman today an admission that certain details have yet to be settled, I think that he might well wait until the conference has been held before concluding the agreement with the agents he has appointed.",18
118,Mr JOSEPH COOK,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"He promised in his speech that he would submit the matter, and take the judgment of the House on it.",18
119,Mr SAMPSON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Yes , but I hope that before putting his signature to the docuas- ment the Attorney-General will wait to hear the views of the Ministers of Agriculture, who, I believe, have already entered into communication with other interests in addition to the shipping interests. There are three important elements to be recognised, namely, the provision of sufficient space for taking away the grain, and the large interests assoral. ciated with the purchase of the grain, and its consignment, and the growers. We have shipping agents who sometimes arrange for shipping space. We also have intermediary brokers who arrange space with the shipping companies on behalf the shippers of wheat. In my opinion, those various interests should have been consulted before a final agreement was come to.",18
120,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,That is the whole of the trouble.,19
121,Mr SAMPSON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The Attorney-Gene Mr. ral has already assured us that the of the important interests involved in the vest ?-export of our surplus grain have been consulted. But in his speech today he with which I am not now concerned. certainly did not satisfy the House that he had consulted the whole of them. Bequestion. fore we can hope to get a combination strong and united enough to secure a suffitor in this war. cient amount of space at the lowest possible price, and to regulate of grain, it is important to see that those interests and the machinery for export, which has been growing for a considerable time, are brought into unison. I believe it is highly desirable that the Commonwealth, which has the control of exports, should make a definite arrangement for securing suffiwealth, cient space for the transport of our plus grain. I understand that at this early stage, before the volume of. the vest can be ascertained, certain overtures have been made to various interested quarters.

The first thing to be considered in connection with the export of grain is the provision suflicient shipping space. We know that one of the results of the war has been curtailment of shipping space, and we have to face what may be a record harpersons vest with less than normal shipping space for its export. Next, it is the duty the Government to see that space is tained at the lowest rates possible, so our farmers may obtain a reasonable reping companies. turn for their labour. Before an important arrangement such as that which has been come to by the Government was made, those largely interested in the purthe grain. chasing and handling of grain-as well as the city brokers-shoul d have been taken into the confidence of the Attorney-Genewould The honourable members for Wannon and Wakefield pointed out that that could have been done best by the creation of a committee representing all important interests. The loss of a week or two which that would have meant would have of made very little difference. The Attorney-General should have conferred with the Ministers of Agriculture of the States in which wheat is grown for export, and should then have consulted the wheat purchasers and shippers, and the ship-owners or their agents.

123,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,If is the dealers with the export whom I am concerned.,19
124,Mr SAMPSON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Any one purchasing grain in Australia must base his price on the London price, less charges and freights. My complaint is that the Attorney-General has appointed two firms to be the exclusive agents of the Commonand that he has done this without surconsulting all the interests which could have informed him as to the true position, harand would have enabled him to secure the best bargain possible for the country and for the growers of wheat.",19
125,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Does the honourable member mean that the Attorney-General will should have consulted other shipping,19

Gibbs, Bright- & Co. are reputable firms, the but they are agents for shipping companies, and such agents are not the best to go to to obtain the lowest rates of freight, though they may be the best of persons to go to to secure space. To my obmind it would have been better to go to that brokers who are independent of the ship",19
127,Mr FENTON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"We might then have had to pay two commissions-on e for securing freight, and the other for selling",19
128,Mr SAMPSON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Two commissions not have to be paid. The practice has been for the shipping companies to allow so much per cent, on the quantity of space secured. Whatever double commission might have been possible, had the procedure which I suggest been followed, is possible now.",19
129,Mr BURNS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,Would not the brokers have had to approach the shipping agents ?,20
130,Mr SAMPSON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Yes, but shipping agents are not the best persons to approach to secure low freights. The Attorney-General has acted without sufficiently consulting all the interests involved, though, no doubt, it is the desire of the Government to protect those interests. By giving to two shipping agents a monopoly affecting a very large freight, the Government is practically ruining shipping brokers who have spent their lives in building up their businesses, and who should, with the other interests involved, have been consulted. I hope that on Friday the Attorney-General will consult with the Ministers of Agriculture regarding the agreement, and that if a wider consultation is possible, he will consult also with the representatives of all the interests concerned, so that an agreement may be arrived at which will have the hearty approval of the growers of wheat, and of those who control the machinery for the effective marketing of wheat in London.  [4.49] - To my mind, the action of the honourable member for Wannon in moving themselves. the adjournment this afternoon is premature, and also ill-advised, because we are waiting for an important financial statement from the Prime Minister which the member for Wannon country desires to hear. The honourable to say. member for Wannon knew nothing of the terms of the agreement about which he spoke, and every remark that he claimed to found on statements made by the Atrepresenting torney-General was contradicted by that honourable and learned gentleman. The honourable member for Wannon must, I think, have felt some regret on finding object himself "" left,"" if I may use the word, hy the two honourable members who ceeded him on his side. The honourable member for Wimmera took up a very fair done. attitude-and it is how the matter appeals to me-whe n he said that the first torney-General consideration of the wheat-growers is plete space for the transport of their produce abroad.",20
131,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Whic h is not guaranteed under the arrangement; and i not be guaranteed..  however, is the first consideration. I represent a wheat-growing district of equal importance with that represented by the honourable member for Wannon; but, unlike him, my first interest is in the real producers of wheat-the men who grow it, and wish to get it away. I am not concerned so very much about the brokers' interests.",20
132,Mr RODGEES,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"That is a failure to accept my statement.  orable - member left me in doubt as to whether it was the real farmers who took the first place in his mind, or the men who farm the farmer.",20
133,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"The brokers!  seemed to me to be an appeal for the brokers. I do not desire to misquote the honourable member for Wimmera, but I understood him to say that the first thing the Attorney-General should have done was to consult those who have always taken a leading part in the transport of our primary products.",20
134,Mr SAMPSON,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,To take advantage of the ordinary machinery.  first persons mentioned by the honorablo member were the brokers.,20

139,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I did nothing of the kind; I suggested leaving the course free. The honourable member misrepresents me.  rangement will, I think, secure to the producers available space, and cut out a number of undesirables, who frequently stand between the producers and the consumers. That is the virtue, I take it, in the arrangement; and it is evidently a virtue that is disagreeable to some people.",21
140,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"You must remember that there will still be brokersthat both these firms are brokers.  much at liberty to anticipate what is going to be done as the honourable member for ""Wannon is to anticipate something that is evidently not going to be done. The position, as pointed out by the Attorney-General, is that we will be short - in our mercantile marine to the extent of 25 per cent., and, considering that this a time of war, I cannot see the object of the honourable member for Wannon in enumerating the freights for the last five or six years.",21
141,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"To show that the rate of commission is exorbitant.  can be no analogy between a time of peace and an abnormal time like the present, when there must be great restrictions on our producers in getting their wheat and wool away. That is the one problem that agitates the minds of our producers now, and the Commonwealth Government have come forward and declared that they are not going to leave the producers to be ""victimized, or in danger of being victimized, because of the restricted accommodation. I can see immense possibilities under the proposed arrangement. We shall be able to put our transports at the disposal of our producers.",21
142,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"That would - have been done in any case.  have a number of interned enemy vessels which may be made available. We know exactly how many bottoms we have as between interned vessels and transports, and, consequently, the Attorney-General . has been saved the trouble of seeking much information that the honourable member for Wannon suggests he should obtain from brokers and agents. The Government are in a position to tell the producers that they will be saved from the results of a position which would have meant a great increase in freights and serious loss. We do not know exactly what the arrangement is, but, with the honourable member for Wimmera, I express the hope that it will not be finally settled until an assurance is given to the producers that the most available space at the lowest possible cost will be secured.",21
143,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,That is all we ask.,21
144,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,That is the object of my action today.  cannot follow the honourable member for Wannon when he points out the sources to which the Attorney-General should have gone.,21
145,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I told the Attorney General to leave the matter alone.  easy in a time like this, when questions of the kind are under discussion, to pose as is the champion of the farmers. Something happened not long ago which vitally concerned the farmers in a very detrimental way. The Price of Foods Board in Victoria fixed the price of wheat at 4s. 9d., and immediately after the State elections that Board was wiped out, with the result that the farmers who had sold at that. price had to buy back from speculators at nearly double. I never heard the honourable member for Wannon condemn the State Government for its action.",21
146,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,I did so here in the House.  there is hope for the honourable member.,21
147,Mr TUDOR,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,The reason the honourable member for Wannon condemned the State Government was that he had sold his own wheat at 4s. 9d.,21
148,Mr RODGERS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"I also condemned the Labour Government of New South Wale3 for similar action.  occasion I did not hear the honourable member backed up by any great number of honourable members on his own side, and this, I suppose, was because the action in Victoria was that of a Liberal Government.",21
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Order !  not further pursue that line of argument. When the Commonwealth Government does take action, the honourable member for Wannon, before he knows the terms of the agreement, poses as the champion of the farmers. I am not less sympathetic than he is with the farmers, and I conceive the agreement may possibly mean that the farmers will not befleecedas they have often been fleeced in the past.  to be regretted that this motion has been submitted. With the exception of the Attorney-General, there is no honourable member who knows what the agreement is.",21
150,Mr RODGEKS,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"We have the statements made in the House.  agreement may be, it has not done away with the middleman, but has created what I may call a super-middleman, who will have to treat with other firms whose special object it has been for years past to obtain freights. The ships which will be available to the Government after the matter of sending recruits away has been dealt with will be increased.",22
151,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT,"Order ! The time allotted for the debate under the Sessional Orders has expired. I desire at this stage to direct attention to a practice that does not appear to me to be a very desirable one, but that seems to be growing in the House. The standing order dealing with a debate like that now concluded stipulates that each member who speaks shall be allocated a certain time for his speech.

Whether it is a fact that a further number of Norwegians have been admitted into Western Australia under contract conditions ? 2. If so, what action does the Minister propose to take to enforce the Contract Immigrants Act?",24
153,Mr TUDOR,CONTRACT IMMIGRANTSIN,"In the momentary absence of the Minister of External Affairs may I say that the answers to the honourable member's questions are1. An additional number of 143 Norwegians, making the full complement for the work of this season (extending over a period of four months) arrived at Point Cloates on the 3rd July under the same conditions as the first batch. All of these men return to Norway at the end of the season. 2. The Customs authorities had previously been instructed to notify the Western Australia Whaling Company of the necessity of obtaining approval of the terms of contracts under the Contract Immigrants Act before any further men landed. Through a misunderstanding on the part of the Customs authorities the company believed that such requirement was intended to apply only to future seasons' operations, and that my decision as to what action should be taken against the company, which decision I was only in a position to make on the 3rd July, before I knew of the arrival of the last batch referred to above, would probably cover the whole of the men engaged for the present season's work. I may further add that these men are virtually partners in the enterprise, and that there is no power under the Act to prevent them continuing at work. The whole of the agreements, however, so far as they relate to shore work, are null and void, but after giving the fullest consideration to all the special circumstances of the case, I have decided not to prosecute the company in respect of any of the men engaged for this season's operations. HOTELS AS RECRUITING PLACES .",24
154,Mr RILEY,CONTRACT IMMIGRANTSIN,"for Mr. asked the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I.

Whether this is being done with the knowledge of the Minister? 3. Whether the Minister will take steps to stop further employment of such places for recruiting purposes?",24
155,Mr JENSEN,CONTRACT IMMIGRANTSIN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. No. 2. No. 3. In country districts, except Ballarat, Bendigo, and Geelong, the recruiting arrangements are made by Mayors and Shire Presidents. As far as is known the recruiting offices are situated at the various Town Halls and Shire offices, but inquiries are being made as to whether licensed hotels are being used as recruiting places in any localities. If it is found that such is the case, immediate steps will be taken to remedy such a state of affairs. RE D CROSS FUND .",24

Whether the latter fund is or is not directly connected with the Australian Imperial Forces, now at, or being sent to, the front ? 3. Can the Prime Minister say in what way and .by whom this fund is controlled and distributed ? 4. If the Red Cross Fund is one directly connected with our Forces, should not the Government have some control, or at any rate be represented upon the central body which is directing this fund? 5. Is the Prime Minister aware that much dissatisfaction is being expressed that no information is published or audited balance sheets made available, so that the public may definitely know the destination of these moneys, and how and to whom they are distributed ?",24
157,Mr HUGHES,CONTRACT IMMIGRANTSIN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. On the 16th July, 1915, a circular letter was addressed to the Premiers of the several States asking for full particulars of the different patriotic funds, showing the purposes to which they are devoted, the amount subscribed, and, if possible, the proposed method of distribution in each case; and suggesting that some scheme of co-ordination should be devised in regard to these funds. Earnest consideration was invited bf the question of the appointment of some central and properly representative body in each State for the control and distribution of the funds. 2 and 3.

Whether, in view of the fact that Mr. Solly Burvill has been three times placed on trial, and that the prosecution have been unable to secure a conviction against him, the Attorney-General will order that no further action be taken against that individual? 2. Whether, in view of the financial loss that Mr Burvill has been put to by the prosecution, .and that he is now unemployed, the Attorne}'-General will recommend that he be reinstated in his previous employment?",24

160,Mr JENSEN,CONTRACT IMMIGRANTSIN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. In view of the great need of instructors to train the large numbers now in Australian Imperial Force camps, and the inability to secure men of a reasonable age capable of imparting instruction, qualified men between, say, twenty and fifty-five 3 ears of age will be gladly accepted for the duty of instructors at the camps of training.

Whether the altered regulation restricts the privileges previously enjoyed by the postal sorters ? 3. Whether the altered regulation is, in its application, antagonistic to the award of the Court, and the facts on which that award was based ?",25

A military encampment has recently been formed at Ballarat, and re has been placed under the control of Major Sauer, a militia officer, who would I not enlist, and who is a Clerk of Courts, for which he receives a salary of someA t - thing like £30 0 or £35 0 a year. S a u e r "" is a rather peculiar name for officer in charge of a military encampment. It does not suggest Britisb",27
176,Mr SPENCE,PROPOSED STORES,It is not sauerkraut?,27
177,Mr MCGRATH,PROPOSED STORES,"It suggests sauerto kraut. This officer would not volunteer for active service, but he has been taken from his position as clerk of courts and placed in charge of the encampment at Ballarat at a salary of something like £700 a year. This is patriotism. How patriotic these men are! They are prepared to avail themselves of all the good things going in the country. The second Messrs. in command of the camp is Captain who is also a militia officer. He i9 about thirty-five years of age, is well fitted to go to the front , should have been one of the first to I enlist. He has been receiving about £ 9 per week, but has been selected as second in command of the encampment at Ballarat, and in that position will receive anything up to £50 0 per annum. Young fellows in Ballarat are naturally asking why these men are not going to the front , and why they are not prepared to take say some of the risks of war. They have been trained at the cost of the country, and it the was naturally expected that they would be amongst the first to enlist. We canI not compel them to do so, but they should relatbe the last men to be engaged by the military authorities to control our various I trust that the Minister for the Navy will bring thisour matter before the Minister of Defence, and that the services of these men will be No difficulty wil l be experienced in finding efficient officers to train our men. I visited the Department of Defence today, and the answer I received there to my complaint was that there were 20,000 additional men to train, and that it was difficult to find oflicers to give them the requisite instruction. If the Minister would give the sergeant-majors a chance, the difficulty would disappear. . They are well fitted to occupy higher positions; and if the Minister would do away with a little of the class feeling existing in nexion with the Army today, and give a few of the non-commissioned officers an opportunity to demonstrate their fitness to hold commissions, he would experience no difficulty in securing competent omcers to train the men.",27
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROPOSED STORES,I would suggest that the officers' schools of instruction should be expanded.,28
179,Mr MCGRATH,PROPOSED STORES,"I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that that would be a wise course to adopt. Some of our sergeant-majors should be given commissions and afforded an opportunity to fill positions that are being given today to militia officers. Those who are not prepared to enlist should not be encouraged in the attitude they take up by being appointed to the good positions that are offering in Australia. I recognise that among our militia officers there are young men who have volunteered for service abroad, but who have not been allowed to go to the front because their services are required at home; and my objection applies only to those militia omcers who have not volunteered, and will not do so. They realise that by staying at home they can obtain good appointments worth about £700 a year. It is unfair that a major fighting in the Dardanelles should receive no more than an officer of thf* same rank placed in charge of a camp at Ballarat or elsewhere in Australia. The one man is risking his life, while the other is taking no risk, and is making no sacrifice. When it is suggested to the Department of Defence that sergeant-majors should be given the opportunity to fill these positions, the reply made is that we have no one to take their place. I would point out that in Ballarat there are one or two retired sergeant-majors of the British Army who are anxious to serve the Commonwealth. One of these, Sergeant-Major Burrowes, superintendent of the Benevolent Asylum, is in the very prime of life, and has offered his services. He is willing to do anything to assist the Commonwealth. There are dozens of men of this class throughout Australia, and they could be made acting sergeant-majors, and could do the work being done by the sergeantmajors. In regard to the instruction of officers, no man under the age of twentythree is permitted to enter the schools. I recognise that we should not send men under that age to the front as officers; conbut, judging by appearances, this war will last a long time, and we must look into the future. We have not only to train officers to send abroad. There are plenty of brilliant youths in the community who have passed severe examinations, and who could be qualified by twelve months' instruction to take military positions in Australia. The Defence Department would, be well advised to allow those young fellows to enter a school of instruction. By a course of study, they would become competent to take the place of many permanent oflicers, some of whom are anxious to go to the front, but who are not permitted by the Department to do so. I trust that some action will be taken in regard to ..the militia omcers in the camps. We must not encourage the officers who are showing "" cold feet"" at this juncture. We must not give them the good positions. Let us give an opportunity to the sergeantmajors to fill these positions. In times of peace they have done splendid work in building up the defence scheme, and they are receiving today no encouragement from the Defence Department. There is another matter of importance. I have heard that a person at Ballarat with a German name has been the successful contractor for the supply of certain articles to the Defence Department. Another person of strong German proclivities has been appointed to a position. To my mind, the position is serious, and we ought to make very full inquiries before we appoint any one with a German name. I feel sure that if we we were in Germany we would not be treated as considerately as we are treating many Germans today.  sire to say a few words in regard to camp drill instructors, concerning whom a question appears on the notice-paper. To my knowledge, an experienced man who has had active service, and is well qualified to act as drill instructor, but who was refused for active service on account of age, has proffered his services to the Department in the capacity of a drill instructor in the camp. His offer has not been cepted; he has been rejected because he not a unionist. That is a very serious matter. One almost trembles for the welofficially fare of the country if a question of party politics, such as preference to unionists, to be allowed to obtrude itself into the administration of the Army which is playhe ing such an important part in the present great war. This action on the part the military authorities is very much their discredit. Another matter that sbould Uke to mention is that two fine strapping young fellows who are in the prime and vigour of life, but who are not prepared to volunteer for service at the front have been appointed camp drill structors.",28
180,Mr MCGRATH,PROPOSED STORES,"That is correct; men get all the fancy jobs.  partment should be to appoint experto ienced men as drill instructors, because the men entering camp resent being inHo.use structed by young fellows who have qualification other than book knowledge. Those instructors, merely because they have been able to pass a certain examinafecting tion, have been appointed as over-lords to Postal Department. men whose shoe latchets they are not f to unloose.   wise they would not have received the appointments. I shall endeavour to duce the letter from the man whose serand vices were refused on account of his not being a unionist. I . do urge upon Minister that he should give attention this matter. There are men in this try who are qualified to act as drill structors, and who would volunteer feeding for the front if they were not beyond age for active service. They are willing to serve the country in another capacity, to devote portion of their and they should be appointed drill structors, while the younger men should be allowed to go to the front.",29
181,Mr GROOM,PROPOSED STORES,"Darling Downs) [5.27]. - The first casualty lists which were ceived from the Dardanelles included names of a great many men who were ported missing. In several instances thing further has been heard of those men from oflicial sources. There has been brought under ray notice the case of young man who was reported missing, and several private advices which have come to hand indicate that he was killed and buried on the peninsula. Yet no acofficial information of a specific character is can be obtained from the authorities. In another case, a young .soldier has been reported missing, but private in formation, received by cable, is to ths is effect that he is in hospital ab Lemnos. I suggest to the Minister for the Navy that might send a special request to the authorities overseas to have the cases of of the missing men re-investigated, so that to final information may be conveyed to the I relatives. Nothing could be more painful to relatives than the state of suspense in which they are kept by the fact that these men are officially reported missing, whilst private advices state them to be either indead or in hospitals. If a special appeal were made to the commanders of the different battalions a final answer would be those obtained which would set at rest the doubts of the relatives. Complaints are received of the non-delivery of letters the troops at the front, and I should like the Postmaster-General to inform the whether he has received any in no formation in regard to an improvement of the postal service to Australian troops overseas. There is another complaint afthe local administration of the Those mail coni t tractors whom the drought had affected seriously received an allowance from the ? Department. In some country districts the drought was experienced in all its intensity, the letter carriers are proobliged to go their rounds on horseback, they provide their own horses. They receive the same salaries as the postmen the who deliver on foot, hut an allowance for to the upkeep of the horse is made on the counbasis of the prices that prevail in normal inseasons. I am informed that the cost of a horse is in excess of the allow the ance made to these men, and the consequence is that they are obliged earninings to pay for the carrying on of a service of the Commonwealth. In view of the concession which has been granted to mail contractors-and which I regard as a reasonable one- I would like rethe Postmaster-General to make a public the - statement on this matter. I understand rethat some arrangement has been arrived noat. Then, in reference to war pensions, the Bill at present engaging the attention of the House provides for the transfer of a the administration of the Act from the existing Pensions Board to the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Department. In the meantime, * number of claims are being considered. In one case I know that a claim has been under consideration for some time. It is that of a young man who has been in several hospitals, and who is now going about practically is a crippled - condition. His pay has been stopped. Is the Board still considering these claims, or are its hands tied until the transfer to the Invalid and Old age Pensions Department?",29
182,Mr JENSEN,PROPOSED STORES,It is still considering them.,30
183,Mr GROOM,PROPOSED STORES,"I hope that is so. would like the Minister for the Navy to inquire into the matter. If claims are to be hung up for any considerable time, a great hardship will be inflicted upon men who are incapacitated, and who, pending tihe decision of their claims, will be left without means of support. I cannot conceive of anything more prejudicial to ova recruiting campaign than to have invalided soldiers, after having rendered this country such gallant service, kept without pay. Mr HANNAN {Fawkner) [5.33] - I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister of Home Affairs the method that is being adopted in regard to the engagement t>f men at Broadmeadows, or any other place where work is being carried out by his Department on behalf of any other Department. If , for example, there are six vacancies for carpenters - or labourers at Broadmeadows, instead of the Department selecting that number of men to fill the positions it probably sends out fifteen or. twenty applicants to the officer in charge of the work, who is intrusted with the task of making a selection. I say that this plan inflicts a hardship upon men who are unemployed. It puts them to unnecessary expense and trouble in travelling to Broadmeadows, and .possibly having to return to the city again. I trust that the Minister will take the matter into his consideration with a view to devising some better method of selection.",30
184,Mr SPENCE,PROPOSED STORES,"Darling-Postmaster General) [5.34] - In reply to the honourable member for Darling Downs, I wish to say that the arrangements made at the other end for the delivery of letters are in the hands of the Defence Department. My information is that those arrangements have recently shown a very considerable improvement. Indeed, I think they are now about as good as they can be made. Admittedly,- great difficulty is experienced in tracing the wounded. The two Departments, however, are co-operating with a view to making the postal arrangements as perfect as possible. In regard to the matter of assistance to mail contractors and othera affected by the drought, the Deputy Postmasters-General were authorized some' time ago to make an additional allowance to postmen who have to pay an increased price for fodder for their horses. If the honourable member has any I specific complaint in that connection, I shall be glad to have it investigated. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.35 p.m.",30
