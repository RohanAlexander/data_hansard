Mr T.UDOR - The Acting Prime Minister has stated that communications were addressed to the Premiers of the States in reference to the medical inspection of school children, but that unfavorable replies were received in some instances. Will he lay on the table of the House a copy of the letter sent to the Premiers of the States, and of the replies received from them ?",14
1,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,INSPECTION OF SCHOOL,"Before promising to do that, I must examine the replies, because 1 do not wish to do anything Ayhich may be resented by the authorities of any of the States; but I do not think that there will be any objection to laying the papers on the table. [12(5] NA PRESERVATION ACT. ALLEGED COAL AND SHIPPING COMBINE. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Has the attention of the Acting Prime Minister been called to an article in this morning's Age in reference to a great coal combine, there referred to as a powerful monopoly? There is a statement in the newspaper thatThe latest developments in connection with the Northern Coal Vend is that New Zealand has been brought within its sphere. _ Further on, it is stated that"" The effect of this extension of the operations of the combine,"" said a broker today,"" will be to block out of the New Zealand trade in Newcastle coal all new tonnage except that of the Union Steamship Company."" The writer also saysIt was learned in the.course of inquiry today that the price of coal at Newcastle is likely to be advanced from ios. tb ns. per ton before the end of. the present year. Any increase in the selling' price means a corresponding advance in the market. Can the provisions of the Australian In dustries Preservation Act be used to prevent this gigantic monopoly from materializing?",14
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I have seen the newspaper article to which the honourable member refers, and, on reading it, it occurred to me that t i e Commonwealth law . could be used to prevent the creation of a monopoly, but, of course, its applicability will depend entirely upon the evidence obtainable, and it is often difficult to obtain the evidence required. In my opinion, the Australian Industries Preservation Act was framed to cope with an arrangement such as this combine in coal, and if it is found that the public are being injured, the Government will take cognizance of the matter, subject, of course, to the opinion of the Attorney-General as to our right to interfere. Mr SALMON.'-if the Act does not give the necessary powers, will the Minister have it amended ?",14
3,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Yes ; , if it should be found that the combine is seriously injuring the public interests.",14
4,Mr BAMFORD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"Following up the Question asked by the honourable member for - Darwin, I desire to know whether the Acting Prime Minister is prepared to protect the public against the Shipping Combine?",14
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"I cannot reply to that question until all the.facts are before me. The honourable member will recognise that a Minister cannot accept as accurate a statement appearing in the press, and that everything must depend upon investigation of the facts. The question simply whether or riot there is a combine which is injurious to the public.",14
6,Mr MCDONALD,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,There can be no quesEnormous tion as to the existence of a Shipping bine.,15
7,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRIES,"It is not easy to. procure evidence in regard to combines; but I shall have a consultation with the Attorney-General, and if the law w i l able us to at once grasp the.nettle, to be, and will be, .put in motion. MEDICALEXAMINATION OF that",15

10,Mr MALONEY,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I wish to'know from the Postmaster-General if steps have been taken to carry out the suggestion which I mnde some time ago that the names of subscribers in the telephone directories should be arranged in the order of the numbers of their instruments, as well as alphabetically ?",15
11,Mr MAUGER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"On making inquiries, I found that a large number of directories were in stock, and others in course of compilation, but I shall adopt the honourable member's suggestion as soon as possible.",15
12,Mr LIDDELL,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I have noticed that the Melbourne telephone directories are indexed on the margin, which is a considerable convenience. Will the honourable gentleman see that the directories used in Sydney and elsewhere are similarly arranged ?",15
13,Mr MAUGER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"That is a matter which is left to the Deputy Postmasters-General hut I shall send copies of the Melbourne directory to the other States, and urge that any improvement which it may contain be adopted universally. Mr WIT.KS - The Sydney telephone books and directories, have for some time been marginally indexed.",15
14,Mr MCDONALD,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"^-In view of the large quantity of ' copper wire used by an the Telephone Department, and the enoris mous demand for telephones, will the Minister consider the advisability of manufacturing both copper wire and telephones? supplies of copper are obtainable Comin Australia at low rates.",15
15,Mr MAUGER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The matter will receive early consideration. The demand for both copper wire and telephones is extremely great, and some step of an extral enordinary nature will have to be taken to it ought cope with it .",15
16,Mr BATCHELOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is not a fact, the cost of indexing the list of teleCADETS. phone subscribers differs materially in the several States, ranging from fid. per copy one case to about f d . per copy, the latter rate being charged by the Government Would it not. be more economical to have this work done by the so, but I departmental officers?",15
17,Mr MAUGER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Possibl y it would; I shall make inquiries. TARIFF. CLEARANCE OF VESSELS - DUTY ON WIS E NETTING - MINISTERIN CHARGE-ORDE R OF CONSIDERATION OF ITEMS , Mr HENRY . WILLIS - I have received a letter from a firm of merchants, in which the following statement occursYou will understand that the new Tariff came into operation on the morning of Friday, the gth August, and the Star of Scotland arrived in Sydney Harbor early on the same day. This vessel had called at other Commonwealth ports, and the goods for the merchants were cleared at the old Tariff. Under the old Tariff' wire netting was admitted duty free. My correspondent, and the Sydney merchants generally, wish to know whether the Government will allow them to clear wire netting ex this vessel on the terms on which it was cleared in other Commonwealth ports.",15
18,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,The answer has been given to similar questions that it cannot be allowed.,15
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,The Minister means that it will not be allowed.,15
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The honourable member can word my answer in that way, if he pleases.  whether the Treasurer or the Minister of Trade and Customs has charge of the Tariff, as both have to do with it , and, therefore, I hardly know to whom to address my question; but I wish to ask whether, in view of the rapid spread of rabbits into clean country in the central districts of Queensland, the Government will permit honourable members to deal with the proposed duty on wire netting as soon as possible, so that pasloralists and others may know exactly what to do in regard to' the erection of fences.",15
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"In the first place, I wisli the honourable member to clearly understand that I am in charge of the Tariff, and, in the next place, that I cannot promise to deal with any item in the Tariff except in its proper order. Whatever may be decided when we get to the Tariff, if I were to publicly announce now that the proposals relating to wire netting, chairs, or other articles were to be taken out of their order, I should have a hornet's nest about my ears. I intend not to make any promises on the subject until we get to the Tariff.  Speaker, in moving that the duty on w.ire netting be the first item considered?",16
22,Mr SPEAKER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The point is one for the Chairman to rule on in Committee of Ways and Means. I imagine that it will bepossible in Committee to follow the usual course of postponing items to allow the early consideration of other items, should that course be thought desirable. *",16
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I should like to know whether a specific motion could not be moved in the House directing the Committee in the matter.,16
24,Mr SPEAKER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"When the House has referred a measure to a Committee in the way in which the Tariff has been referred to the Committee of Ways and Means, I take it that it will refuse to direct the Committee as to the conduct of its business in any matter within the power of the Committee. This is a matter for the Committee itself to determine.",16
25,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I wish to ask the Acting Prime Minister whether, if ' a motion be moved in Committee for the consideration of the duty on wire netting before other items of the Tariff, the Government will oppose it?",16
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,When such a motion is moved I shall say what the Government will do in regard to it.,16
27,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"In view of the urgent necessity for dealing with certain items of the Tariff, notably the duty on [126]- 2 wire netting, forthwith, will the Government at once proceed with the consider a-. tion of the Tariff? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - We shall proceed with it when we have finished the work which I have announced on three or four occasions we must take first.",16
28,Mr GLYNN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"For the facilitation of the disposal of Tariff .items which it is thought desirable to deal with as matters of urgency, would not the most convenient course be for the Government to name certain items to receive precedence, or for honourable members to choose such items by ballot, without debate?",16
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I do not think anv list would be agreed to without debate. If the Ministry proposed the postponement of most of the items of the Tariff in order to give prior consideration to some which are near the end, we should have a preliminary discussion on the whole Tariff.",16
30,Mr GLYNN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,My desire is to avoid unnecessary talk.,16
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I think that no such arrangement, if proposed, could become to without the concurrence of honourable members after a debate. When we get to the Tariff we can see what it will be best to do; but I am strongly opposed to dealing with any item out of its order.",16
32,Mr GLYNN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"If a motion were tabled, the honourable member might consider it a motion of no confidence.",16
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"If I made a promise, in regard to wire netting, I should be besieged with requests from persons interested in piece goods, woollens, stearine, and other articles, for the early consideration of the proposals relating to them.",16
34,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,The duties on the necessaries of life should be those first considered.,16
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The Tariff will be dealt with in the ordinary way. At the present time. I can think of no better method of dealing with it than by considering the items seriatim, though I am willing to reconsider the matter when we have the schedule before us. At the same time, I hold out very little hope of being able to pick out items to be dealt with out of their order in advance of other items.  to pass, without discussion, a few of the items which demand immediate settlement-and I do not suppose that there are more than nine-wil l the Acting Prime Minister accede to the request that has been made that they should be given precedence? I do not wish to put the Government in a hole, but I desire to do something for the people of Australia who are anxious that the goods in question shall be taken out of bond. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not think that the honourable member's proposition is likely to be agreed to. Even if it were, I should want to know first of all what items the honourable member had in mind.  the nine.",16
36,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I have nineteen.,17
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I do not think that the proposal is a practicable one. I have hitherto carefully refrained from stating definitely that the Government will do what has been suggested, because I do not wish to hamper our operations when we proceed to deal with the Tariff. I certainly do not desire that some traders shall be placed in a,better position than others. . Mr MCDONALD - Why not agree to whether settle the Tariff within six weeks?",17
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,If honourable of'Government Bill? members would agree to settle it within six minutes I should offer no objection.,17
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I should like to know whether the Acting Prime Minister considers the several Bills which he intends to ask the House to deal with before we attention to it. proceed with the consideration of the Tariff schedule are of a tithe of the importancefrom the point of view of urgency-of the Tariff itself, and whether he will seriously consider the desirableness of postponing their consideration until we have begun, least, to deal with the Tariff schedule. Does he not think it would be advisable later on to rest in our work of dealing with the Tariff, in order to dispose of other matters which may become urgent?",17
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"On e at least greater of the measures I have mentioned-the with Judiciary Bill-is in my opinion very quiries, urgent. I do not think that any of them should occupy our attention for any length of time. The lawyers are the only honorCastlemaine able members who are likely to discuss the Guildford, Judiciarv Bill , and they cannot talk for ever. There are various reasons why I the think that the passing of that measure at work the present juncture is extremely and I wish to see it become law without delay. The other two bills should not take long'to deal with. Unless the flood gates' of eloquence are opened, we should be able to dispose of them in an hour or two.",17
41,Mr MATHEWS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Havin g regard to the fact that the Victorian Wages Board for the bicycle trade has determined that 27s. 6d. per week is an adequate wage for adults engaged in the industry, I wish to know whether the Acting Prime Minister will give priority to the item of "" Bicycles and Bicycle parts "" in the Tariff schedule, so that we may remove the duty and allow the men in the trade to look for . more remunerative employment ?",17
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I can give no promise; but I happen to know that, as the result of the Tariff, the Massey-Harris Company are arranging to commence operations next month. I am ncjt going to promise to give precedence to any item in the schedule. SEAT OF GOVERNMENTBILL .",17
43,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"As the Acting Prime Minister does not intend to ask the House to proceed immediately with the consideration of the' Tariff, I wish to know it is the intention of the Government to expedite the passing of the Seat",17
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I shall not promise to ask the House to proceed with the Bill until we get on with the Tariff. I hope that when we make a start with the Tariff schedule we shall give uninterrupted ""GUARANTEES FOR COUNTRY TELEPHONE LINES.  Postmaster-General a question in regard to at the following paragraph, which, under the heading of "" Castlemaine,"" appears in this morning's issue of the AgeWhen Mr Mauger, Postmaster-General, visited Castlemaine some three weeks ago he was approached by the Traders and Employers' Association with a request that they might have facilities in telephonic communication the outside townships. After making inMr Mauger has notified to Mr C. C. Salmon, M.P. for the district, that he has approved of communication being established as soon as possible, without guarantee, between and Chewton, Fryerstown, Yapeen, Muckleford, Barker's Creek, and Harcourt. With regard to a telephone between Harcourt and Sutton Grange, he has approved of construction on alternative terms, certain to be done by those interested or under the desirable, guarantee system. If this statement be true, does it not indicate a new departmental policy, and will that policy be adhered to by the Minister - in dealing with all requests from country districts for a telephonic service ? Hitherto in such cases a guarantee has been insisted on.",17
45,Mr MAUGER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I did not quite grasp the honourable member's question, but. the facilities afforded in regard to telephonic communicationwill be, as far as possible, of general application.  idid not make my question clear to the honourable gentleman. According to the paragraph I have read, the Postmaster General has promised that certain telephonic communications shall be established without a guarantee. I wish to know whether the same principle will be applied - to similar work in all country districts. Hitherto a guarantee has always been insisted upon.",18
46,Mr MAUGER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"A guarantee has not been insisted on save where the officers of the Department report that there is no probability of the line being a payable one. - It is sometimes found that a line in respect of which an indemnity has been demanded yields , such a revenue that it is not necessary, and whenever facilities can be. afforded to rural districts"" without requiring - a guarantee that course will be adopted.",18
47,Mr SALMON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is not a fact that the towns named in the paragraph to - which the honourable member for Grey has referred have been for many years connected with Castlemaine and that his decision simply means that the public are to have the use of telephones already in existence.,18
48,Mr MAUGER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,That is the position. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS.,18
49,Mr GROOM,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I desire to make a personal explanation. In the course of a sspeech which, the right honourable member - for Swan made in the House a few evenings ago, he referred to the Conciliation - and Arbitration Bill, and stated that when it was before the House I gave an inconsistent vote. I desire to say that the - records of the House show that my attitude an respect to that measure.was throughout consistent.",18
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Wit h regard - to the explanation made by the Attorney General,18
51,Mr SPEAKER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I would remind the - right honourable member that under the - Standing Orders it is not permissible to debate a personal explanation.,18
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"My desire is, sir, to also , make a personal explanation. Having carefully examined the records since making the statement in question, I regret to say that I inadvertently misrepresented the honourable gentleman. I am now in a position to say that while he consistently opposed the extension of the Bill to State public servants, he consistently voted for the inclusion of States railway employees and others engaged in industries carried on by the authority of the States. I very much regret that I should have misrepresented the honourable member. PAPERS.

55,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Dalley) [10.59] - I rise, not to canvass this item, but to obtain information in regard to it. Hitherto the bulk of our printing has been done by the Victorian Government Printing Office, and I must say that it has been admirably executed. I desire to know whether the £2,000 provided upon these Estimates is intended to be expended upon the purchase of machinery which will ultimately be installed in the Commonwealth Printing Office at the Seat of Government. Of course,"" it is. simply a matter of grace on the part of the Victorian authorities to allow Commonwealth printing to be performed at the Government Printing Office of this State, although I am aware that in each of the States capitals the Government Printing Officeis anxious to obtain a portion of that work. I am thoroughly satisfied with the work performed by the State Printing Office in Victoria, and I recognise that both the present Government Printer and the late Government Printer have rendered the Commonwealth very valuable service. one ground upon which we can urge a complaint, it is that our Commonwealth printing is "" got up "" too elaborately. I believe that there is room for the exercise of economy in the production of many of our parliamentary papers, so far as the quality of the paper employed is concerned, and the style in which the printing is done. The parliamentary papers of the House of Commons are not to be compared with our Commonwealth .parliamentary papers, from the point of view of their general ""get up .""",18
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Hume-Trea surer) [11.3.]-In reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley, I may say that a double-magazine linotype machine has already been approved, and it is necessary that another machine of a similar class shall be purchased.",19
57,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,A r e these machines Commonwealth property?,19
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"They will be. The machines will cost about ^1,500, without the motors, which must also be provided. The expenditure proposed is for the purchase of these machines. I know that at present great difficulty is being experienced by the Victorian Government Printing Office in coping with the work which it is called upon to do. Upon one or two occasions I have had to get printing executed in Sydney on account of the congestion of work in the Government Printing Office here. I .think that additional printing will require to be done on account of the Federal Statistician's Department.",19
59,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Will that be done in Sydney ?,19
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"No . The Government Printing Offices of both New South Wales and Victoria have declined to undertake the printing of the publication which was formerly known as the Seven Colo,nies. I had the work sent to Sydney, but Mr Gullick, the Government Printer, has refused to undertake it. stand that a reasonable tender for the printing of that publication has been rereceived, I think, from Messrs. Sands and MCDougall. The amount upon the Estimates will be expended in the purchase of additional machinery to enable us to cope with the large quantity of printing which has to be done in connection with Parliament and the Commonwealth Departments generally. It will be Commonwealth property, and when the Parliament removes If there be to the Seat of Government the machinerywill be duly installed there.",19
61,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Robertson) [11.5.]-The remarks of the Acting Prime Minister emphasize the necessity which exists for at once establishing the Federal. Capital where we shall be in a position to erect our own buildings, and house our printing machinery. It seems to me that the constant acquisition of further - accommodation in Melbourne only serves to accentuate the difficulty which we shall experience when we come to remove the Seat of Government from this city. I hope that we shall not continue to waste money by erecting temporary buildings in Melbourne. We must find accommodation for the housing of this machinery.",19
62,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,It will not require very much room to house two linotype machines.,19
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"As far as I can understand, the Commonwealth is under no expense in that connection, except for the rent of the building.",19
64,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I recognise that the Acting Prime Minister has made out a strong case for the purchase of theselinotypes. I think that it might possibly be conducive to economy if all 'our official papers were of a uniform size. With reference to the. printing of postage stamps,19
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"That work will be done in Victoria. The officer who formerly undertook the printing of postage stamps iri Adelaide, is now in Melbourne with a view to arranging for the work being performed here.",19
66,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I am glad that his services are being availed of. He is a most efficient officer. He has demonstrated his ability to produce postage stamps for 30 or 40 per cent, less than I under^ they can be produced for in Queensland  bing"" upon anybody, and South Australia is "" scabbing"" upon the rest of the Commonwealth.",19
67,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"This officer has devoted a lifetime to the printing of postage stamps, and the result is that he can produce them for much less than they can be produced in any of the other States. He has been brought to Melbourne, his Department will be - established here for a time, and then we shall have to remove it to the Federal Capital. It seems to me that we are frittering away money by acting in this fashion. If we erect temporary accommodation for the machinery which we are' about to purchase, we shall have to demolish it by-and-by, whereas if we erected a building at the Seat of Government, it would be a permanent structure, to which additions could be made from time to time, in accordance with a plan which would provide for the requirements of the Commonwealth.",20
68,Mr MCWILLIA MS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Franklin) [11.12.] - The purchase of these two linotype machines will certainly result in a saving to the Commonwealth. I do not think that we need worry much about the housing of the machines, because the accommodation required for them will be so very small. I .think that the arrangement under which our Commonwealth printing is done by the Victorian Government Printing Office is working exceedingly well. There is, however, one matter to which the Government might devote consideration. suggest that in future all tabular printing which has to be undertaken should be set up in such a way that it can be used, ' if necessary, in our official publications without involving the expense which is caused by what is technically known as "" overrunning."" I am quite certain that a considerable sum is annually wasted by tabular matter having to be re-set.",20
69,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Surely that is a question for the printer.,20
70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"At the time certain instructions are given by the House for the printing of documents. When these documents have been set up brought to Melbourne? it frequently happens, that tables which they contain require to be inserted in publications issued in book form. When Melbourne ? that occurs, those tables have to be reset, and thus a considerable sum of money is wasted which, I think, might avoided.",20
71,Mr BATCHELOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Boothby) [ n . 1 5 ] . - I think that I heard the Acting Prime Minister say, in answer to the honourable 0 member for Robertson, that it has been decided to carry on the printing of postage stamps' in Melbourne, under the supervision of the officer who formerly undertook this work for the Government in South Australia. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - That is the intention. - Mr BATCHELOR - Unde r the circumstances that is perhaps the wisest decision to which the Treasurer could come. But I have thought over this matter, and I cannot help thinking that this is a triumph of parochialism over Federalism. The work could be done, and - the cry has ajwavs been to have it done, in the departmental office in Adelaide. It never has been contended, and it never could be contended, that the work could not be done cheaper there than - in any other Government office. Hitherto the work of printing postal stamps has been done in the States Government printing offices, except in South Australia, where it was undertaken by a branch of the Post and Telegraph Department. A proposal was made to have all the stamps for the Commonwealth printed at this one office, as the most economical plan to adopt.  mended by every Postmaster-General for the last seven years. I Mr BATCHELOR - There is a sum of £ 1 , 3 0 0 on the Estimates for that purpose, but I suppose now that that money will not be required; I take it that the agitation has been sufficiently strong to prevent all the work being transferred to the office in Ade- ' laide. One of the latest phases of the matter is that the officer who has control of this work in Adelaide has been recommended for a superior position in the Commonwealth service; and a continuance of my agitation to have the work all done in Adelaide might have the effect of depriving present that officer of promotion.",20
72,Mr TUDOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Has that officer been,20
73,Mr BATCHELOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Yes . ,20
74,Mr BATCHELOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I understand from the Minister that the officer will do in Vicbe toria the work it was proposed he should do in South Australia,  has been doing in South Australia for many years.",20
75,Mr BATCHELOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,But not for the printing whole of the Commonwealth.  officer should superintend the printing the' whole of the Commonwealth stamps in Melbourne ?,21
76,Mr BATCHELOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I hope so.,21
77,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Yes , that reason for his removal to Melbourne.",21
78,Mr BATCHELOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"What I complain of is that, having; brought this officer to Melbourne, and placed him under the conable trol of the Treasurer, the Government are going to' continue the old and expensive system of producing the stamps in a State ber of years. printing office"". I do not complain of any action of the present Treasurer; regret that there is not sufficient Federal spirit to permit of the work being done the place where it has been proved to done most cheaply. This happened to be the only Commonwealth work done in Adeever. laide, and it is a pity that parochialism has triumphed in the matter.",21
79,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Fawkner) [11.19] I wish to emphasize what has been said from time to time in reference to a Comunjust monwealth stamp. Now that we are fedeit rated, such a stamp ought to be provided.",21
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"We cannot have a Commonwealth stamp until the bookkeeplonger, ing period has expired.",21
81,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I amsorry to hear that there is an obstacle in the way of having one sooner; but I hope the Acting Prime Minister will keep the matter mind so that immediately the bookkeeping period expires this much-needed reform may be carried out.,21
82,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The bookkeeping period has been the trouble up to the building. present, and I do not know whether it is possible to overcome it .",21
83,Mr TUDOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Yarra) [11.22] - On offices. several occasions I have referred to the difficulty which is occasioned owing to the fact that the Commonwealth has .not a printing office of its own. The gentleman in charge of the State Government Printing Office in Melbourne may be one of the best in the world; but the fact remains that he is under the control of the State Parliawas ment. The officer who has been brought over from Adelaide and the linotype engipossess neer are the only two officers who are Federal servants. That is not a proper position for the Commonwealth to occupy. Time after time we have voted lairge sums of money for the purpose of purchasing machinery, until today, I think, it would be difficult to ascertain how much of the machinery in the printing office belongs of to the State and how much to the Commonwealth.

84,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,That is a question I is the desired to have answered.,21

89,Mr TUDOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"But that suggestion has= been made; and, so far as I know, it is to representatives of Victoria. Hadi been known that the seat of Government would remain in Melbourne for six years, and, in all probability, for some "" timesteps would have been taken at the outset to establish a printing office of our own so that we might have complete our control of the machinery arid officers.",21

91,Mr TUDOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"No , but we might do precisely as we have done in regard to ous other departmental offices, and rent a",21
92,Mr STORRER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,There is no expensivemachinery in those other departmental,21
93,Mr TUDOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"But the Commonwealth has paid for the machinery in the Government Printing Office. A reference to past Estimates will show that we have paid many thousands of pounds for machinesthat are being used not only for Commonwealth work but also for Sfate work. I ' given to understand some time agothat the Victorian Government do not a linotype, but that they use the Federal linotypes for their own work. It has also been stated that the employees book more of their time to the Commonwealth than they do to the State. The Government Printing Office is, to some extent, under divided control; and so long as the present state of affairs continues .we can never ascertain exactly how the business is carried on. The officers are not Commonwealth officers, and probably deem it their duty to be more loyal to the State than to the Commonwealth. I trust that the Treasurer will look into the matter and ascertain exactly how much machinery the Government possess in the State printing office. If Commonwealth machinery is used for State work we ought to be given credit for that in the account which is rendered against the Commonwealth. We hear a great deal about Federal extravagance, but I believe that charge to be untrue; and I hope that we shall not be called upon to pay more than is necessary for any printing work that may be - done for us. I understand that there is a sum on the. Estimates for the purchase of two more linotypes; and if the State uses these machines we ought, as I said before, to receive credit for the work.",21
94,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Hindmarsh) £11.25] - I thoroughly agree with the suggestion that it is time the Commonwealth had a printing office of its own.,22
95,Mr WATSON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,We shall have one at the Federal Capital.,22
96,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"We should have - a Commonwealth Printing Office even before we go to the Federal Capital. We rent offices for the transaction of other Commonwealth work, and we could just as easily rent a printing office. It has been - said, though I do not know with what truth, that the Commonwealth pays overtime rates for a great deal of the work which is done, with the result that the expenditure is much larger than it ought to be. As a printer myself, I know something of the cost of printing, and I have been surprised at some of the charges made. I may say, however, that the work itself is entirely satisfactory.  investigation into the whole matter.",22

99,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The Printing 1 'Committee has no power in this connection. We ought to be able to tell to an hour long the Commonwealth plant is used - week in doing Commonwealth work, long it is used for State work, and what allowance is made by the State Government for the use of the linotype machines.",22
100,Mr STORRER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Does the Commonwealth pay for the use of the State machines?,22
101,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The Commonwealth ""pays through the nose"" for the use of all the State machines. From the prices I have seen, I should be very glad, indeed, to undertake the work done by the State Government for the Commonwealth, and it is time some change was made. It seems absurd that when we have a separate departmental printing office in Adelaide we should render it idle,, and bring the superintending officer over here to be under the control' of a State Department in Victoria.  cause the Secretary to the Treasury said it should be done.",22
102,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I do not say that; but I wish to point out the absurdity of the position. Had this work not been done more cheaply and satisfactorily than it could be done elsewhere, I should have asked the Minister to make some change; but it seems absurd to unnecessarily place one of our officers under a dual control. I shall insist on inquiries being made as to the allowance which the State Government makes for the use of Commonwealth plant, and ""how far the statement is correct that we pay overtime rates for a great part of our printing.  might ascertain the facts.",22
103,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I have no doubt that a Select Committee would cause some' wonderful revelations.,22

105,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The Printing Committee has no power except to save as much as possible in the printing of papers. I am sorry the Printing Committee has not power, because I am satisfied that if that Committee.or a Select Committee investigated the matter, we should have a recoman mendation to the effect that it would pay handsomely to establish a Commonwealth",22
106,Mr TUDOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Can the Printing Committee do nothing in the matter?,22
107,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"No . The power of the Committee extends only to the papers submitted.

[REPRESENTATIVES.] effect some savings, and, with complete power, it could doubtless effect more. ' I trust that the Minister will see that an exhaustive inquiry is made to ascertain the value of the Commonwealth plant, and the manner in which it is used, and that he will obtain a statement showing whether what we pay for our printing is a reasonable or unreasonable amount, and whether it would be cheaper to have our printing done in a building of our own, under Commonwealth supervision. .'",22

110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,The question comes up every year.,23
111,Mr HUTCHISON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Then why does not the Government do something in regard to it?,23
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,The present arrangement has been thought to be the best that can be made. The honourable member says that it is rumoured that the Commonwealth is.called upon to pay overtime for work which should be done in ordinary business hours-that .the State is trying to get at us.,23

116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"A f any rate, that is the way in which the matter has been put to me. I have therefore instructed the Secretary to the Treasury to appoint a man to go into the printing-office, to see that the Commonwealth is not placed at a disadvantage in any shape or form. He is to be kept there permanently, so long as the present arrangement continues.",23

122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The original arrangement was made by Sir George Turner when Treasurer, in his desire to effect economy, and economy has always been aimed at in Commonwealth administration, notwithstanding the charges of extravagance which have been brought against it. I have instructed the Secretary of my Department to cause a thorough investigation to be made to ascertain how the Commonwealth is now being treated in the matter of printing, and whether it would cost more than we now pay to set up a printing-office of our own. It is quite possible that the arrangement under which Commonwealth work is done in the Victorian office is not so satisfactory now that the Commonwealth Departments have largely increased in size as it was when first entered into. I cast no doubt upon the bona fides of the State in the matter of printing, .and I hope that inquiry will say show that the statement that the Commonwealth has been overcharged for its printing is incorrect. With regard to the South Australian officer whose transfer has been referred to, he has been represented to me as the best man we could get, and arrangements are being made for him to do the work here. I understand that he does not desire to be placed under the Government Printer, and that therefore there is some little difficulty about accommodating him in the Victorian Printing Office.",23

127,Mr LIDDE LL,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Hunter) [n.37] - The text upon which the Acting Prime has hung his remarks is the word "" economy,"" and in this connection I should to call attention to an example of the ner in which the Commonwealth machinery and plant in the Victorian Printing Office is being used. A wealthy French gentleasked man interested in architecture, the Vicomte de Fenelon, has produced plans illustrating the construction of the Ark, the Taberunderstand nacle, and the Temple of Jerusalem, and has been kind enough to forward a copy them to the Federal Parliament. Library Committee, or the Printing Comwealth mittee,' has caused them to be bound covers measuring 39 inches by 26| inches, made of green morocco, the most expensive leather procurable, and highly decorated gold. In my opinion, the money, would have been better spent in procuring works on history of Australia.",24
128,The CHAIRMAN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I think that this matter should be referred'to when the for the Library is under consideration.,24
129,Mr LIDDELL,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I would point out that the work has been done with the machinery and plant in the Victorian Printing Office,' for which we are now asked to vote to time. money.",24

132,The CHAIRMAN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I understand that it was paid for. out of the Library I think, therefore, that it should be discussed when the general Estimates are before us. The vote now under considerais one for machinery. If I allowed the member for Hunter to discuss the binding of a particular book now, all the be other binding sanctioned by the Library get Committee might be brought under review.",24
133,Mr JH CATTS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Cook) [11.41] - I am prepared to vote against every item in regard to which it seems to be assumed that Melbourne is to remain for all time the seat of Government.

134,Mr CHANTER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,When we move we can Minister take our machinery with us.,24
135,Mr JH CATTS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"It would be a very like costly matter to move it. We have been mantold that, year after year, the Commonwealth printing plant in the Victorian office is being added to, and although we 0 have what machinery the Commonwealth now possesses, we have not been given satisfactory information on the subject. I that, in the first instance, Parliament was led to believe that the machinof ery in the Victorian Printing Office would The be sufficient for the printing of Commonpapers, but ever since the present in arrangement was made, we have been putting in new machinery, until perhaps by now we have enough tofitup an office ,of our in own. Another matter to which I wish to refer is that on page 40 of the Estimates the in chief, provision is made for the payment to the Government Printer of £150 for services rendered in connection with the printing of Parliament.

139,Mr JH CATTS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I regret that I drew your attention to the fact, Mr Chairman. I did so inadvertently. I am not a parochialist, and do not agree with much vote, of the parochial talk that we have heard in this Chamber. But I object to the Commonwealth going to tremendous expense toestablish itself in Melbourne, and I intend, to vote against items which I think have that tendencv.",24
140,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Dalley) [11.45]--I.shoul d not have risen again to discuss this item but for the admission made by the Minister that it is proposed to gather together the printing plant of the Commonwealth, some of which apparently has been lent to the Victorian Government. Several honourable members have spoken about the use of machinery, and it has been said that an expert stamp printer in the printing office at the General Post Office; Adelaide, is to be transferred to this State. do not wish to discuss the qualifications of that gentleman, but would remind the Committee that in all the States we have men engaged in printing stamps who, unless they are to be transferred to the central office, will be deprived of their livelihood if the whole of this work is in future to be carried out in Melbourne. We have a stamp printing staff in New South Wales, where the stamps issued far outnumber those used in any other State.",25
141,Mr BATCHELOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Then they ought to be more economical in the matter of printing,25
142,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I am not an expert, but it would seem that there is a remarkable disparity between the cost of printing in various States. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, as an expert, emphasized the point that I , as a. layman, desire to make. The Acting Prime Minister has told us that he wishes to combine economy with efficiency in the working of the Commonwealth Printing Office. Sir WILLIAM LYNE , - I said that I had already given instructions that an officer be appointed shall be there to see that we are not unduly charged for overtime.",25
143,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"That is satisfactory. There is another matter which I desire to bring under the notice of the Treasurer. At the end of each session honourable members are-supplied with bound copies of the Commonwealth Statutes. These are printed and bound at the Victorian Government Printing - Office, but, strange to say, the public are unable to purchase them there.",25
144,Mr FAIRBAIRN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Who wishes to buy them ?,25
145,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Every member jof the a. - legal profession must have them, and every well appointed library also has them on its .shelves. At the present time a private firm in Victoria is printing the Commonwealth Statutes, and making a good! thing out of the work. The community ispractically being fleeced. I hold that our Statutes should be issued as cheaply as. possible. They cannot be purchased at any of the Government printing offices im the States.",25
146,Mr BAMFORD,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,They ought to be available at the Commonwealth offices.,25
147,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Quite so. Some months ago I brought under the notice of the ex-Treasurer the fact that they are published' by the Law Institute of Victoria, to whom application for copies have to be adI dressed. There are in New South Wales alone no less than 360 subscribers.",25
148,Mr TUDOR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"That is good individualism,, is it not ? ' Mr Wilks - I am simply suggesting that we should make reasonable use of the Government Printing Office. The good Socialism that I have to suggest is that the Government Printing Office should print and bind the Commonwealth Statutes, and sell them to the general public. They have to print and bind them for honourable members, and I think that the adoption of my suggestion would lead to a considerable reduction in the cost to the public.  the not intend to oppose the item immediately under review, nor do I desire to blame the present Treasurer for the way in which* the stamp* printing office attached to the General Post Office, Adelaide, has been treated. I have no hesitation, however, in saying, that it has been most scandalously dealt with. Every Postmaster-General who has inquired into this question has found that the'cost of printto ing, stamps, postal notes, and post cards in South Australia is considerably less thanit is in any of the other States. The officer in charge of the work there is a specialist. The question has been threshed"" out in this House year after year, and although each succeeding Postmaster-General has agreed that a certain sum shall be expended on the plant in South Australia, his decision has been overruled, not by his colleagues, but by a departmental officer. From time to time, the several Postmasters General have had to play second fiddle toan officer in the public service. , That is most unsatisfactory state of affairs. The South Australian office has been most scurvily treated, and we know full well that this money will not be spent in that State. The Government are breaking up the printing plant attached to the post-office there, and the expert officer to whom I have referred will be placed in an almost intolerable position since in the Commonwealth office he will mot have absolute control of the work in which he is an expert. I have every reason to believe that we have.paid thousands of pounds more than we ought to have done for our printing. A Commission, consisting of experts, ought to be appointed to inquire into the whole question; something more than a mere examination . or - inquiry by a departmental head is necessary to ascertain the facts. Although I consider that South Australia in this respect has been badlv treated, I am not going to vote against an item providing for the purchase of plant and machineryin many cases, the purchase of machinery means not extravagance but economy-bu t I think that the Treasurer should cause to be prepared an inventory of the printing plant owned by the Commonwealth in order that we may know exactly of what it consists. It is absurd to suggest that the passing of this item should be delayed until the Capital Site question shall have been decided. I was under the impression that it had been settled. It seems we shall never see the Federal Capital until the people of New South Wales are prepared to agree among themselves as to what they want. Hansard will show that when a site was finally decided upon every leader in the House'urged honourable members to stand by the decision, but it seems that honourable members are at liberty to go outside and advise the people of New South Wales that they have been "" tricked.""",25

150,Mr LIDDELL,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member in order in discussing on this item the question of the Capital Site?  sir, I would remind you that the item relates to printing plant which will have to be removed to the Federal Capital.",26
151,The CHAIRMAN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I was not closely following the honourable member at. the moment, but if , as I understand, he was making only an incidental reference to the Federal Capital Site question, he was not out of order.  in my opinion it will be a long time before we remove to the permanent Seat of Government, and that consequently it would be absurd to defer the purchase of necessaryprinting machinery t ill then.

154,Mr BAMFO RD,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Herbert) [12.2] - I do not agree with those who desire to establish a Commonwealth Printing Office in Melbourne. . In my judgment, it would be a great mistake to do as they suggest. Those who advocate the establishment of our own office here appear to have overlooked the fact that apart from the purchase of linotypes, a great deal of expenditure would to me that have to be incurred in securing other machinery. In looking over the general Estimates I find that there is an item set down as an honorarium to the Government Printer",26

156,Mr BAMFORD,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,This matter has been referred to previously.,26

158,Mr BAMFORD,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"At any rate, it is shown elsewhere that the cbst of providing fuel, light, and motive power for our printing machinery in Melbourne is only £ 5 5 4 I venture to say that if we established a printing office of our own in this city the expenditure in that connection would be much greater. Moreover the whole of the arrangements of the Department - would b3 dislocated during its transfer. I hope to live to see the day when this Parliament will remove to a home of its own. So far as the printing of stamps and postcards are concerned; I fail to see why the officer to whom reference has been ma'de, should not be installed in an office of his own  will be an absolute waste of money.",26
159,Mr BAMFORD,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I suggest to the Acting Prime Minister that he might take into consideration the advisability of establishing this officer in an office of his own. I shall vote for the item.,27
160,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Treasurer) [12.6] - I wish to say that the value of the printing plant which the Commonwealth has in Melbourne at the present time is about ,£36,000. Proposed vote agreed to. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE. Division 7 (Special Defence Material), £80,000.",27
161,Mr GLYNN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Angas) [12.7] - I hope that Ministers will speedily come to a definite conclusion as to what is to be their policy of defence. It is really too much to ask the Committee to vote even an instalment of what ""must eventually be a very large expenditure, in the absenee of a defence policy deliberately arrived at. In the first place we require information as to what is to be the proportion of expenditure upon the Military Forces to that upon the Naval Forces. We wish to know whether we are to look to a highly-trained small force or to an imperfectly-trained large force as the basis of our land defence. Personally I confess that I am absolutely in a fog over defence matters. As far as a laymen can do so, I have endeavoured to follow the development of a defence policy in the United Kingdom, thinking that 'it might afford me some guidance as to the policy which should be adopted here. But when I find such authorities upon defence matters as Mr Arnold Foster taking one view, and Lord Roberts another, I admit that I am bewildered. The former believes in a small, perfectlyequipped force, whereas Lord Roberts ad0 vocates the establishment of a force of something like 900,000 men. In this connection I also recollect that Mr Haldane recently brought forward a scheme which, having passed through the crucible of a good deal of criticism, has now been placed upon the statute-book of the Imperial Parliament. His scheme provides, amongst other things, for the abolition of the militia, which some experts think is an absolutely suicidal policy. When I read these conflicting opinions on the part of experts it makes me hesitate to sanction a large expenditure upon defence. Shortly before Mr Haldane's scheme was approved by Parliament, an attack was made upon it by certain voluntary associations which study defence matters very closely. Lord Roberts himself subscribed to a circular. sent out by one of these associations as a protest against the adoption of Mr Haldane's scheme. What is a layman- a man of peace-wh o does not care to board a vessel even for the purpose of making a short trip, to say to a proposal to expend a large sum upon defence, seeing that every plan brought forward by the British Government has been "" riddled"" by experts? When I come to consider our local defences I am in precisely the same ""pickle."" Towards the end of 1906 'Captain Creswell presented a report to Parliament which seemed to modify, if it did not altogether reverse, the report which he prepared upon naval defence about four years previously. At that, time, if I am not mistaken, he pinned his faith in the matter of Australian defence to an expenditure upon cruisers. He now suggests that we should commence with torpedo boats, torpedo boat destroyers, and some other class of vessel, the name of which I have forgotten. Captain Creswell very pertinently asked "" Why is the Navy neglected?"" In looking up a few notes upon this matter which I made at the time, I find that that officer set down the total of our Naval Forces at something less than 1,000.",27
162,Mr EWING,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"If the honourable member is talking of the naval militia, it numbers a little over 1,000.",27
163,Mr GLYNN,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Captain Creswell set down the number of the permanent forces at 164, and that of the naval militia at .781. He estimated our land defence forces, at 40,000, I presume upon a war footing. Major-General Hutton is a firm believer in a highly trained body of troops coupled with rifle clubs. He has declared that something like 25,000 troops form the nucleus of our army in time of peace, and that the number could be raised to 40,000 in time of war. Captain Creswell, I repeat, asks why we are spending such large sums upon our land defences whilst"" the Navy-whic h is our first line of defence-is altogether neglected. In this connection he mentions that we have a trade valued at something like £140,000,000 annually to protect. He points out that during the recent war with Russia the loss sustained by Japan on account of the interruption to her sea commerce was about £150,000 per day. When we consider the far greater ease with which the world's trade with lis might be intercepted, it becomes apparent that its interception would involve us in a very serious loss. Therefore we are justified in expending a larger sum upon naval defence. When the Prime Minister spoke of this matter in June, 1905, he pointed out that we are within striking distance of sixteen foreign naval stations. Speaking upon the Defence Estimates in 1906, he saidThe Government have decided to recommend the establishment of harbour and coastal defence, ancl to commence by ordering eight coastal stroyers and four first-class torpedo boats. He estimated the cost of these vessels about £700,000, which was to be distriledge buted over three years, and which would thus involve the Commonwealth in an annual expenditure of . approximately £2'50,ooo. That is a very large expendisidered, ture, and the burden of my complaint is that we are asked to sanction even instalments of a large defence vote before some systematic plan of defence has been laid down-befor e it has been decided whether ' the Navy or the Army is to be our chief line of defence. If the two are to pended upon we should be told what be the proportion of' expenditure upon I have already said that-1 was rather tical in looking for guidance to the experts at home, and certainly confusion comes ""worse confounded"" when I look for guidance to the experts here. Some two years ago, Colonel MCCay, then a member of this House, who had devoted great deal of attention to military matters, posals. referred to the estimate by Major-General Hutton, in connection with the equipment of our forts, some of which are dealt with in the Estimates before us. Major-General Hutton estimated that a sum of over £520,000 would be required to put our fort's in order; and of that estimate stalments have been spent. I forget what balance remains; but if I am not mistaken, some time afterwards, the Council of fence increased that estimate to £1,300,000 or £1,400,000-a n absolute staggerer.

The Imperial authorities cannot resent the desire on the part of the people of Australia to provide for their own defence, and will, no doubt, be willing to allow the Imperial warships to remain in our waters while we are making our arrangements. It would be very harmful to Great Britain and' the Empire at large if Australia, which is part of the Empire, were attacked, and perhaps captured, by a foreign foe. We must make a start some time in providing for our own defence, and ,£200,000 a year would pay the .interest on an expenditure of £5,000,000.. which would enable us to do a good deai by way of a beginning. I do not advocate the borrowing of money by the Com. monwealth, but, as we may be called upon, to expend in connection with defence amounts larger than could be provided out of current revenue, we might perhaps borrow for the purpose, establishing a sinking fund for the wiping out of the debt, and! the present naval contribution would provide the necessary interest.",31

I think we should also provide our mounted men with regulation saddles. I see no reason why the class of men now joining our forces should be required to provide their own saddles. Those with whom I have come in contact are some of the finest men in the Commonwealth. Our mounted forces are largely recruited from the farming class-fro m men raised on the land-me n of intelligence, who might well be intrusted with the care of regimental saddles. It would be understood, of course, that saddles so supplied should be used only on parade, or at encampments. There is often a difficulty in replacing lost straps of regulation pattern when the men have to provide their own saddles and bridles, and I trust that my suggestion will be adopted by the Department. Another point that I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister is. that many of our mounted men are without swords.

So far as I have been able to ascertain, the cadet ammunition is supplied entirely by the Colonial Ammunition Company, and for a long time many complaints have been made in regard t& it. To all such complaints, addressed to the Military Branch of the Department, there has been received the stereotyped reply that the bad results obtained at practice were the fault, not of inferior ammunition, but of faulty shooting. We have to remember that our cadets pay a proportion of the cost of the ammunition used by them, and it should be our endeavour to encourage their efforts to become marksmen. They devote every Saturday afternoon, when there are so many counteT attractions, to an effort to acquire skill the use of the rifle, so that when they up they may be ready to take their place amongst our active soldiery, and we ally ought to give them every encouragement. As indicated by a question which I put the other day to the Minister of Defence, the Department refused to conduct tests determine whether or not faulty ammuniwere tion is supplied to the cadets; but the grievance became so acute that the National Rifle Association of New South Wales cided to do so.

He adopted the scheme which had been outlined by Major-General Hutton, who returned to England before it had reached fruition.

I should like to ask the Minister whether we are asked to vote this money in fulfilment of that scheme? If that be not so, has another scheme been evolved, or is another scheme in progress, and, if so, what is that scheme? It is becoming a positive scandal that, after seven years of evolution of many schemes for the defence of Australia, we are yet voting money in the dark-that we do not know whether it is. to be applied in connection with any scheme outlined by a responsible Minister. will , I think, shorten the debate if the Minister will be good enough to answer those questions.",35

However, in reply to the honourable member for Parramatta, I should like to draw attention to one or two facts. The honourable member spoke highly of the administration of my predecessor in office, Colonel MCCay, by whom the Board was created. The proposal for the appointment of a Board was made tering the' Department. by the Government of which the right orable member for East Sydney was leader. I presume that every honourable member feels that in the control of a Department, Board is dangerous, though, after all . may be the only possible means of control. If Australia were able to obtain the services of a Bismarck, a Napoleon, or a Kitchener, I would depend upon such men rather than a Board. The difficulty, however, has always been that, even when Imperial officers have been imported, the salary offered them has been such as would not secure the services of a Kitchener or a Roberts.",35
252,Mr HENRY WILLIS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Why not? These men were obscure at one time.,35
253,Mr EWING,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Whateve r may be said about patriotism, ability, and so forth, we find, in the ordinary business of the world, that if we desire the services of men of high qualifications they must be paid adequate salaries. However patriotic our Hamiltons or Hector Macdonalds may be, we cannot obtain their services unless we pay them higher salaries than Australia has offered up to the present. I think that the House, when it approved of the Board system two or three years ago, determined that it should The Board is on its trial now; and I do not see why it should not succeed, if it be composed of competent men. Nearly all the work worth doing in the world is one man work; but at the same time, I do not see why a Minister, supported by a Board of four or five able men, even though that plan is not quite in accordance with our ideas, should not succeed. I am quite satisfied that if any ordinary intelligent lavman were prepared to devote himself to the service of the country, and were permitted to reIt main long enough at the head of the Defence Department, he could do very good work with the assistance of a Board.",35

It can be well understood that the responsibility of administering a Department of this kind is a very heavy one; the defence of the country is certainly no small matter. We may have our jokes even when we are engaged' in the work of the country; it is not worthwhile to carry one's heart on one's sleeve, and the lugubrious man, who considers every question without one gleam of humour, is not much use in office or anywhere else. a number of honourable members here who, no doubt, later on will occupy the position , of Minister of Defence.",35

It is true that in the Department men of special training and special knowledge are doing clerical work; and, in referring to this, the honourable memThere are ber put his finger on a weak and dangerous spot.

Colonel MCCay, when speaking on the 12th September, 1905,made a forecast of the requirements of the Defence Department for the purpose of completing a scheme then in process of evolution. He on that occasion said that an expenditure of £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 would be necessary, and that if a loan was not. to be raised Parliament must decide how much should be spent each year. I believe that Colonel MCCay recommended that shortdated loans should be raised for the purpose, but I am not sure as to that, and I may be doing him an injustice. At any rate, he sketched a proposal extending over a series of years, and involving in the aggregate an outlay of £800,000 as special expenditure for the purpose of developing I should like to know whether the money we are voting now is in pursuance of that scheme.

The northern part of Australia is within a comparatively short distance of India, which has a popumillions lation of 300,000,000; of China, which has a population of 400,000,000; of Java, which has a population of 30,000,000; and of Japan, which has a population of over 50,000,000, and. therefore we should dement. vote great attention to its defence needs.

As to the defective ammunition which it has been alleged has been supplied to cadets, I would point out that makers who would supply defective ammunition to cadets would supply it to adult forces, and it will be a serious matter if our men are provided with worthless cartridges. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will look into the matter.  Colonel MCCay was Minister of Defence, he gave great attention to matters affecting accoutrements and equipment, and particularly to the harness for horses attached to service waggons and' field guns.",38

Six months later I remember the Prime Minister telling us that we had had three defence periods in five years-the G.O.C. period, the D.C. period, and he was not allowed to complete his classification, some one interjecting ""the period of muddle."" It seems to me that the period of muddle is still continuing. On the admission of the Minister of Defence we have frittered away millions, and still have an imperfect system. Some one should be hanged for what has occurred.",39

Why should we jnot have similar manoeuvres in the Monaro country? The South Australian and Victorian troops could li-j marched there from Bairnsdale, the Tasmanian troops landed at Twofold Bay, and the New South Wales and Queensland troops brought down from the north. We have no information in regard to the various items in this subdivision, under which we are asked to vote £130,000. We have been voting every year various sums for field artillery, and yet we are asked today to agree to an item of £29,000 in respect of, Field Artillery-ammunition , waggons, harness, and spare parts and accessories for field guns. Why is this expenditure necessary? What has become of the money that we have already voted for similar purposes? Then, again, we find that £[8,000 is provided for the purchase of camp equipment. Some two or three years ago, in Queensland, what was described as worn-out defence material was sold by public auction, and a few months later, a lot of camp equipment that had been disposed of in this way had to be re-purchased. Tents which had been sold at from 5s. to 10s. each were re-purchased at prices ranging as high as £ 3 . That discloses an extraordinary state of affairs. Will the Minister also afford the Committee some information in regard to the item of £1,000 for engineers' equipment? I recognise that the item of £10,000 for the purchase of cadet rifles and spare parts is a reasonable one. If we are to encourage the cadet movement, such an expenditure cannot be avoided. But I would draw special attention to the item25,000 sword bayonets and scabbards for short M.L.E. rifles, ^18,750. In a recent issue of an English newspaper, I saw a paragraph to the effect that the War Office had not determined on the class of bayonet to be adopted for the British troops. It was stated that some severe tests were being carried out, but that the authorities had not yet decided whether they would adopt .the sword bayonet or the triangular-shaped bayonet - Have the Government decided what class of bayonet is to be adopted for the use of the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth? I refuse to vote £18,750 for this item unless I have a satisfactory explanation in regard to it.

317,Mr CROUCH,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Colone l Le Mesurier held that office for about two and a half years, and Colonel Stanley for less than twelve months. Colonel Parnell is now Chief of Ordnance, but is not responsible for the state of affairs disclosed this afternoon, and I have some doubts as to the extent of the responsibility of Colonel Stanley. It will be remembered that earlier in the debate I asked the Minister what officer was responsible to him and to the House in the matter of equipment, and that he replied "" The Chief of Ordnance."" We know, therefore, that notwithstanding the Board of Control, there is an officer whom we may hold responsible for these matters. For the last two or three years there have been neither waggons nor limbers for field guns already in Australia. During that time a howitzer battery has been stowed away in Sydney, and no one knew anything of it until it was recently shall discovered by the Minister. I wish to know what action the Minister intends to take in regard to those responsible for the scandalous state of affairs which he has disclosed.

I was asked who advised the Minister with regard to equipment, and I replied "" The Chief of Ordnance."" The honourable member for Corio now holds that we should attach to that officer the responsibility for the state of affairs complained of. I have informed the Committee' once or twice that I could not explain at this juncture who was absolutely to blame for the non-supply of limbers and waggons for guns already in Australia unless I went fully into detail. The position is this: The Chief of Ordnance may tell a Minister that he needs £100,000 for the purchase of necessary equipment, and the Minister may say in reply to him, "" I dare not ask Parliament to vote so large a sum, and the Treasurer says he cannot find the money. Cut down the amount for which you ask by £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 . "" When that is done the officer has to do the best he can with the reduced vote. ",41

I am only stating what is a common practice. If the Chief of Ordnance asked for ,£100,000 for ammunition and the Minister told him that such, an amount could not be made available, then the responsibility would be removed from that officer..  £[53,040 was appropriated for field artillery, & c , and only £ 2 6 , 1 3 5 was expended ?",41

The Mr EWING - I was only citing a supposititious case. There are in the House honourable members who have held office either as Treasurer in a Federal or a State Administration, and I appeal to them to say whether .the case I have cited is not a typical one. Is it not a fact that when the Estimates of a Department are submitted to the Cabinet, Ministers very often demand that they shall be reduced?",41
327,Mr MATHEWS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,The Estimates are cut down every time.,41

329,Mr FOWLER,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"If a Minister does not succeed in obtaining what he considers necessary for. the purposes of his Department he ought to resign' and tell .the Parliament why he has taken that action. Mr EWIN'G - I do not say that. In politics, as in every other walk of life, a man has to adopt that which he thinks is the wisest course. When a Minister asks for £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 for his Department and the Cabinet say "" We are not prepared to ask Parliament to vote more than £[300,000,"" he may, if he pleases, retire and perhaps make way for a less competent person, or he may do the best possible with the means at his disposa.1. But I would appeal to honourable members in dealing with this matter to be guided by the ordinary rules which they adopt in every-day life, and to be - sure that an officer is to blame before an indictment is laid against him.",41
330,Mr CROUCH,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Corio)'[3.14] - I thank the Minister for his interposition, because instead of relieving the officer in question from blame he has rather settled the responsibility more closely upon him. Although the Minister of Defence tried to water down his statement it cannot be denied that when the honourable member for Parramatta was speaking, I inquired, '' Who is responsible for this' state of things ?"" and that the Minister replied, "" The Chief of Ordnance.""",41
331,Mr EWING,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,I should not have made such a definite statement. I ought to have said that the Chief of Ordnance advises the 'Minister.,41
332,Mr CROUCH,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The honourable gentleaman admits that although a chief of ordnance may recommend an expenditure of .£100,000 , perhaps only £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 is Are we to suppose that Colonel Le Mesurier, who, as a member of the M i l i tary Board, appointed himself Comman-dant of Western Australia, or Colonel .Stanley, who, as a member of the same Board, promoted himself to the office of - Commandant of Victoria, ordered field guns for Australia without limbers, wheels, or ammunition? I am very glad that the honourable member for Flinders has raised - this question of responsibility. years I have been vainly attempting 'to fix responsibility for the chaotic condition of our Defence Department .upon the right shoulders. This afternoon a small searchlight has .been thrown' - upon the work of the Department, - and the Minister has rendered the' countrysome service by telling us what he has - done. I have no doubt that he is endeavouring to do his best, but he is prevented from doing so by the tremendous dead weight of officialism and red tape with which he is surrounded. I admit all that has been said this afternoon of the ability displayed by Colonel MCCay as an administrator of that Department. But, knowing as he did-and as every man. connected with the Military Forces knowsthe rottenness of the Department, I blame him for lacking sufficient courage to sweep away a number of men whose utter inefficiency and lack of any sense of responsibility prevented good work from being accomplished. Had Colonel MCCay done his duty, he would have cleared away a lot of the rubbish at the head of our Defence Forces at the present time. Minister has had seven or eight months' experience of his office, and ere this he must have found out the inefficiency of these men. He must have discovered that if Australia were threatened with invasion tomorrow our only hope of successful resistance - would rest with the junior or citizen officers. The Minister has .said from time to time that in the junior officers lies the hope of the Department. Obviously it is his duty to get rid of these other officers. But instead of doing so, he promotes them to the positions of State Commandants. Some of these men have received large increases of salary, notwithstanding that they are responsible for the'wretched state of our ded'ence equipment. The Defence Forces need equipment, but I will take the responsibility-so as .to avoid the possibility of good equipment being spoilt by bad offivoted. cers-of voting against the whole item. That is the only way in which we can bring the Minister up with a round turn. It is idle to provide funds for men who cannot spend them properly-me n for whose inefficiency the Minister wishes to accept responsibility. There is not the slightest doubt that he is the most generous Minister that we have had. He is too generous to be just. I wish that he would be more just to these officers and For to the Commonwealth, and that he would act with a full sense of his responsibility. If he does not, I feel that we shall be overwhelmed by a catastrophe which I fear is only too imminent. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [ 3 . 2 0 ]I strongly deprecate personal attacks either upon our defence officers or upon public servants generally. It must be recollected that these men are denied the opportunity of replying.",42
333,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Ough t they not to be criticised ?,42
334,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The Department should be criticised. The Minister-no t any particular officer-is responsible to this House, and I have always understood that it is the duty of a Minister to see that his Department is properly conducted - If it is not so conducted, he alone is responsible to Parliament. As I have already said, I strongly deprecate personal attacks upon officers, and, as I happen to know something about one of these Items, I shall give the Committee the benefit of my knowledge. I venture to say that if a strict inquiry were made by the Minister, it The would be found that the delay in the receipt of certain equipment in respect of our field artillery is due to the fact that the Government-lik e other Governments throughout the Empire-hav e been unable to procure from the Woolwich arsenal the equipment which they desire.  policy to get that equipment made here instead of importing it.",42
335,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The honourable member is quite right in regard to smallarms and small-arms ammunition, but it will be a generation or two before we can hope to manufacture up-to-date ordnance and the ammunition for it. To do that, we should require an arsenal like the one at Woolwich. To incur the expenditure necessary for us to establish such an arsenal 36U Supply. [REPRESENTATIVES.] would be a very doubtful experiment, cause the local demand for ordnance is so limited that it would not justify an extion penditure of perhaps £1,000,000.",42

339,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Yes . I I called attention to this matter last session. Some time ago a question was asked of the Minister for War in the House of Commons as to the progress which was being made in the re-arming Of the British Army with the modern eighteen-pounder guns, which are of a very complicated character. He replied that the delay which had ocable curred was due to the fact that the Colonies and India had been supplied with the mark .1 pattern of these guns, and that, provements would probably be introduced a little later it would be to the advantage of the mother country to wait. For predoubtless cisely a similar reason, it will perhaps to our advantage to wait a little longer. ",43
340,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Anybody who get knows anything about ordnance knows that when a new type of gun is issued from Woolwich it is known as mark 1. I have never known a case-and I have six different types of field guns-in which the mark II . gun was not very much superior to the mark 1 weapon, either on account of some details in its mechanism, or because of the ammunition with which it was supplied'.. A considerable improvepattern to guide us. ment is always made, both in the gun itable, self and in the ammunition, as the result of experience. I can quite understand that our Ordnance officer-whoeve r he may have the Committee. been-ma y have been perfectly justified in the advice which he gave-that certain indents should be obtained from Woolwich, and that we have already to hand all that is available.  complaint is made, but the absence of carwere riages and the limbers.",43

342,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"I know that in Brisbane we have the carriages and some of the limbers too. They were sent out from Woolwich without the handbook of Suppty. beinstructions. The honourable member knows the value of that book, f t contains instrucin detail concerning the various parts of the guns and their, uses. These impounder guns are very complicated, ancl it was found almost impossible to put them, together in the absence of the handbook, which, up to the time that I left Brisbane,",43
343,Mr MATHEWS,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,Then they can blunder think that in the old country ?,43
344,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"Exactly . The blundering, if we can call it blundering, may take place upon the other side of the world. I feel certain that the delay which has occurred is due to the fact that the Commonwealth Government have not been to obtain from the Imperial authorities the whole of the material which they desired. That has been the case in conas imnexion with every gun which has been brought out. It was so in the case of the 12-pounders and of the 15-pounders, and it is so in the case of the modem be 18-pounders, which are more complicated than any of the other weapons.",43
345,Mr EWING,ARRANGEMENT OF TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES,"The Government had to out limbers and waggons; they had to give the Australian contractors an opportunity to look into the matter, and then grant them a long period in which to, comworked plete their contracts. - Colonel FOXTON - I was not aware that that was so. I know that we cannot make the guns or the carriages in Australia, but possibly we may be able to make the limbers and the waggons if we have a I thought it desirin theinterests of the officers who have been attacked, that I should put what are probably the facts of the case before  tened very attentively to the Minister's explanation upon this item, and I cannot but think that there has been gross dereliction of duty on the part of somebody in the which Ordnance Department. The field guns here for eighteen months or two years, ancl were practically useless owing to want of limbers, unless, of course, it was proposed to'treat them as guns are treated in the Navy, and haul them by means of dragropes. If patterns had been obtained fromWoolwich, they could have been used in the future for this kind of work. It is on record that when some guns were imported into Western Australia, it was found, first of all, that they were accompanied by no hand-book containing instructions how to fit them, together, and finally it was ascertained that the sights had been, left'behind. When the sights were sent out as speedily as possible by mail-boat, the ammunition turned out to be suited to a different kind of gun altogether. Such occurrences are scandalous, and those responsible for them ought to suffer. I say nothing against individual officers, because I know nothing - about them. It is 'true, however, that officers - on whose training, both here and abroad, - we have spent large sums of money, are - doing mere clerical work in the Defence Offices.",43

The Minister is very good to take all the responsibility on his own shoulders, but of what good is that to the country ? - We are sent to manage the country's affairs; but I am sure that if the business of a public company were managed in the same wav, the - directors would be ignominiously dismissed, and would richly deserve the punishment. I hope the Minister will take to heart what has been said in the course of the debate this afternoon. Since the present Minister has been in office, he has overcome many obstacles, and has tried to do his best, both for the service and for the country. I am sure that if the honourable gentleman is allowed to retain office long enough, the Defence Forces will be placed in a better position than they have been, since the inaugurationof Federation. It has been admitted this afternoon that most of the money voted for the defences has been utterly wasted. It is shameful that this confession should have to be made at the end of six years of Federation.",44
