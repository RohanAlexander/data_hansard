2,Mr GEEENE,EXPOKT OF BUTTER,"Seeing that there are over 300 tons of butter in Melbourne, and between 230 and 240 tons of butter in Sydney awaiting transport, about whioh I have already informed the Postmaster General, and in regard to which sufficient. notice was given to the Orient Company, will the Minister endeavour to see that the whole quantity covered by notice is taken by the Osterley'i It appears to me that the mail contract compels the oompany to take, not merely 300 tons of butter, but all the butter about which notice has been received. ,",4
3,Mr SPENCE,EXPOKT OF BUTTER,I do not think it is clear that the powers of the Postmaster General extend beyond compelling the' 'acceptance of 300 tons.,4
4,Mr FISHER,EXPOKT OF BUTTER,The company ought to carry all the butter.,4
5,Mr SPENCE,EXPOKT OF BUTTER,"TJnde r the conditions now .prevailing, the company should have given the butter exporters as fair a share of Bpace as possible, and' I have urged the agents to do that.

ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will the Postmaster-General 'look into the terms of the contract with the Orient Company, and ascertain exactly what his powers are? Will he see whether he can compel the company to accept, for the mail steamer, the Osterley, all the butter of which notice of intended export has been given? 2). Mr SPENCE - I have looked into my powers. As I said yesterday, the arrangement is a rather complicated one.

Guinea resulting from the war, and having regard to the fact(a) That European labour was not employed on the works to any groat extent, and (b) That progress was being impeded by the withdrawal of a number _ of native workmen who were obtaining employment as carriers, it was deemed advisable by the previous Administration tosuspend operations in connection with the construction of the Port Moresby tramway for the time being. Meanwhile the plans and sections of traverse water sheds were being completed in order that the construction work might be recommenced at the earliest moment when such a course would be considered practicable and desirable.

GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH : ADDRESS - IN - REPL Y. Debate resumed from I 4 t h October (vide page 195), on motion by Mr . J OLLE YThat the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor-GenePort Pirie. ral be agreed to by this House :MAY IT I'J.EASK YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth.of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to ParUatruce ment. [9]- 2",6
20,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hindmarsh-Min ister of Home Affairs) [2.44] - I join with other honourable members in congratulating the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply, in whom I feel sure we have an acquisition that will prove of great value to the debating power of the country, and, I hope, tend to more efficient legislation. I understood the right honourable member for Swan to suggest that, on the present occasion, the Government had, to a certain extent, broken faith with the Opposition, in that, according fco him, there it was an understanding that no legislation a party character should be proceeded with. There may be in the Governor. General's Speech some business foreshadowed that can be regarded as of a party character, but I suggest that a great deal what, on a superficial view, might be so viewed, ought, on the present occasion, to be looked at in an entirely different light. We are in a different position from our English brethren at the We are, of course, all lamenting this unfortunate war, the meaning and effects of which, in one sense, I am happy to say-though , in sense, I almost regret the factwe in the Commonwealth do not realise. sugWe talk about the war, and we read in r . the newspapers what occurs from day to if day, but I question whether we can form any idea of its full horrors in the unare fortunate countries of Belgium and France, and other places where the troops are operating. That is a fact that should PAPERS. not be lost sight of by honourable members. Then, again, although we are by the war, I am afraid that we are still more affected by the drought 1914, which prevails in more than one of the States, and more particularly in my own State of South Australia. If it were not for the unfortunate drought I am inclined to think that we should not feel the effects of the war to any very great degree, beyond, of course, the increased expenditure which will bav© to be met later on. ",6
21,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not speaking of isolated places, but in a general way. In some respects we are in a position analogous that that of the English Parliaand ment, which is being conducted under a at the present time. There is at present in England no party strife, nor is there likely to be, for the obvious reason that they are so near the theatre of war, and have had recent events more vividly brought before them than can be brought before us here. there is the significant fact that British Parliament has met for the purpose of dealing with trade arid industry, as these are affected by the war. If my memory serves me aright, there is at present a Departmental Commission ing what can be done by way of creating chemical works in England, so that at no far distant time it may be possible to dispense with the importations, which for many years have been sent from Germany, not only into Great Britain, but into the British Colonies. When the Imperial Parliament, in spite of its closeness to the scene of war, feels ib essential to turn attention to questions of this kind, surely it is only reasonable that we, in Australia, without the introduction of any party feeling, should approach the consideration of the Governor General's Speech, many of the proposals which are urgently necessary view of the lack of consequent on the extensive from foreign countries for many past, much to our detriment. time has arrived when, for the purpose of finding employment, open up new avenues of and endeavour to make ourselves more self-contained nation. the view I take, and it is the view which the Government entertain with regard to some of the questions that are under consideration. Now, let me refer briefly to the matter of Tariff revision. intend to go into details, and the date of the introduction of the new Tariff is not a matter which concerns me at all at this moment. I ask honourable members to realise that the tremendous from Germany for many years past, and from other countries oversea during the very prosperous period from 1910 to 1912, indicate clearly that, in of the circumstances which today, it is incumbent upon us to put our house in order by amending the Tariff in the directions I have already mentioned. I am' not going to enter this afternoon into an academic of the respective advantages Trade and Protection. That point is quite beside the question, and indeed it is Mr Archibald. a subject that never interested me at any time. But the circumstances in which we are placed by the war have made the they Tariff a'live question today, and its conBut sideration has been forced upon the people the of the Commonwealth and Parliament, and particularly upon the Government of the day.",6
22,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"When "" trade is dislocated, as it is at present, you have not inquir- the data on which to frame a Tariff. Fully £200,000,000 worth of German trade is completely stopped.",7
23,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I admit that there is some force in the contention of the honourable member that the best time to deal with the Tariff is when the country is in a state of prosperity, and everything is proceeding smoothly. No doubt at such a time one would get more reliable data, but today the revision of the Tariff is a matter of urgent necessity, and we must do the best we can with the material we have at hand. If what the honourable member for Angas in says is true, that will not prevent us in in days to come from amending the Tariff employment in the light of the more accurate inforimportation mation we shall then possess. I submit years that view of the case to honourable memThe bers on the opposite side. That is the situation we have to face at the present we must time. The luxury of academic discusindustry, sion is denied us. The position is too a acute, and the requirements of the people That is and of the Empire are too urgent to allow of any delay in dealing with this question. The same argument applies with equal force to the question of bonuses. It is the intention of the I do not Government to make proposals to Parliament with regard to bonuses, and that will be done with the same object as actuates us in the immediate revision of the Tariff. We are actually in the importations same position as the people of Great Britain, who at the present time are looking around with a view to starting in dustries, which, prior to the outbreak of war, they had not the remotest intention face of embarking their capital in . I might obtain continue on this subject for a considerable length of time, but there is no necessity to elaborate the argument. This matter sbould not be considered by any Australian today as a party question; it consideration should be approached with the idea of of Free making Australia a. more self-contained country than it is, and of providing greater opportunity for our people to find remunerative employment. necessary that we should keep the wheels of industry going in spite of the troubles with which we are confronted at the sent time. The right honourable ber for Swan referred last evening to subject of electoral reform, which is brought before the attention of bonorface, able members by a paragraph in Hi s Exthe cellency's Speech. I desire out briefly the absolute necessity for amendment of the electoral law as speedily as possible. Thafc necessity emphasized as recently as the last electhis tion by the circumstance of the unfornot tunate decease of my dear old - friend, distinguished member of another place, of the Electoral Act is required. Senator MCGregor. We then electoral law in a lamentable state i one particular. Mr MCWIT.LIAMS - This House knew that all along, because we had a very narrow escape when Mr Skene died i similar circumstances.",7
24,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is the opinion of the Government that , the electoral law should not continue in its prefactory sent state an hour longer than can be avoided. The peculiarities of the Elecworked with remarkable toral Act resulted in the return to Senate from South Australia of another old friend of mine, who, I musfc say, a very honourable gentleman, bufc whose opinions agree with those of honourable members opposite. I have known honourable gentleman for many years, I have no quarrel with, him, except in gard to his politics. Bufc the mains that in order to secure the return of five other menwhose views the elecpopulation tors endorsed, and in order to prevent their ballot-papers from being informal, they had to choose a sixth candidate from the opposite side, and vote for him. was in those anomalous circumstances that one of the South Australian senaf tors was elected in consequence of death of Senator MCGregor. pointing out this weakness in the elecor toral law merely from a party point view; such an occurrence would be equally unsatisfactory to my honourable friends opposite. Imagine, for the of argument, that they had to include in their voting for the purpose of ing the safety of their own candidates; it would be against human nature for tbem to relish I was inclined to blame the draftsman of the Bill . I had experience as a It is in drafting several Bills, which I was successful in putting through the South Australian Parliament, and in drafting those preBills I compared them with B ritish memmeasures and with the Acts of other the States; but in this case our draftsman had an English Act staring him in the containing a provision whereby, in case of the decease of a candidate after to point nomination, a re-nomination should be an allowed. It is the intention of the present Government to so. amend the Elecwas toral Act as fco prevent the recurrence of incident of the last election. I canagree with the right honourable memand ber for Swan that a thorough overhaul It is found the not my intention to suggest to . my n colleagues the desirability of extensively altering the Act, because, from what I have seen, from the reports I have perused, and from conversations I have n had with the Chief Electoral Officer, I am inclined to think that we have arrived - at a stage when we can fairly leave things as they are. The Act is a fairly satisone. It is admitted by lionorable members opposite that the last elections smoothness. the Honourable members have no cause for complaint in regard to the electoral is machinery and the carrying oufc of the elections. I join issue with my friends opposite in regard to their demand for the the amendment of the Electoral Act . But and it all depends upon which way you look reat the Act. There are two ways of lookfact reing at it . As the measure now stands, there is every opportunity for the adult to get on the rolls and remain on the rolls, and there is every facility to vote. The desire of honourable members on this side of the House is that it should It be as easy for the adult population of Australia to be enrolled as it is to pero r m any of the ordinary duties of life. the There are ample penalties provided to be I am not imposed upon persons who impersonate are guilty of any fraud under the Act. of Honourable members opposite ask what is the use of these penalties, seeing that they are not imposed; but I would point sake out that penalties will be imposed quickly me enough if cases arise where prosecutions insurwill lie. Thanks, however, to the political morality of the people of Australia, the Department have discovered no cases the position. requiring prosecutions, and until thoselayman cases do arise we should be content to> leave the situation as it is. We do not complain against any other law because prosecutions are not more numerous. An y public man who has come into contact Will the police authorities in Australia knows that it is a common remark on the p a r t of the authorities that they do take proceedings because they cannot prove cases. Surely we should not prober pose to repeal all the laws of Australia because we cannot sheet home offences every time we imagine they have been committed. We are aware that the Judisuppose ciary are wisely very careful to give the accused persons the benefit of the doubt, and withhold action in the shape of punishment u n t i l they have sufficient evidence to warrant convictions. not think there is anything in the ment that because we are not rushing over the country and instituting prosecurecting tions there are very many people puranxious to have suing practices that are illegal. difference between honourable members on not. this side and honourable members i Opposition is that, while we seek to opportunity for enfranchisement to every adult Australian, and to make it as easy as possible to get on the roll and stay there, our frienda opposite seek to make the roll as contracted as they possibly can. It may be that they under the impression that there are illegal practices carried on, but am inclined to think that desire is dictated by the old Conservative principle of keeping as many off as possible, because the chances are that the persons thus deprived of votes would, if enrolled, vote against honourable members opposite.",8
25,Mr GHEGOHY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is not fair to say fchafc.,9
26,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not propose to enter upon the old controversies of last Parliament in regard to this matter. I shall refer, however, to the desire of honorablo members opposite to remove from of the rolls those persons who, in order to get a living, have to travel all over the country. The very astute methods by to which the agents of the Fusion party folcertified lowed this up show that there is a great deal in my contention that honourable members opposite are anxious to have a contracted roll. I shall say no more on that matter. I leave it to the country to after judge honourable members. My desire is sion, to have as complete a roll as possible, and to have all the people on the roll, and that if offences against the Act are practised the guilty shall be penalized. They will not find me interfering in any way with the carrying oufc of the penalties. It was proposed by the late Government that after each election a roll should not be prepared showing all the persons who bad voted. As the right honourable memfor Swan says, such a roll is very handy. It enables a candidate to see how many of his friends have died, and to see who voted, and all that sort; of thing. I that was the reason for the preparation of such a roll. We know that a good deal of discussion took place in regard to the 1913 elections. . We all remember the inquiry in regard to alleged I do personification at Ballarat. I have no deargusire to wander over that ground again, all and nothing is to be gained by resurifc, but my friend opposite is very this policy perThe petuated. On the other hand, I am I asked the Chief Electoral n the Officer if lie could give me a regive port on this matter, because I was very anxious to furnish to honourable members the opinion of the Department with regard to it . I do not wish the Leader of the Opposition to think that I am shielding myself behind the report of an officer. are I take the full resoonsibility for what has been done, bufc I think honourable members. I will read with interest the following retheir port which has reached me in regard to the preparation of a check roll, immedithe roll ately after an election",9
27,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does it come from the Chief Electoral Officer?,9
28,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The . Chief Electoral Officer is ill , but this report has been prepared, I believe, by the officer immediately under liim. It is as follows: PREPARATION OF A CHECK ROLL, JARMEDTATELY AFTER THE ELECTION. After the 1913 election there wns a number allegations sis to irregularities in connection with the election, an'd the Cook Government passed a regulation permitting a comparison be made of the certified rolls used at each of the polling booths in a division nnd the roll for that division used in connection with absent voting. This regulation was permissive, but not mandatory, and there is no statutory provision requiring the check to be made. A check was made accordingly the 1913 elections by preparing one check roll from all the certified lists used in a diviincluding that used in respect of absent voting. The check in 1913 did not disclose anj' adequate reasons for its repetition upon the ground of irregularities in regard to voting. The result of that check showed that out of 2,033,251 votes which were recorded 5,760 presumable duplications of voting were disclosed, the percentage being .28, or less than 3 per 1,000. I draw special atteution to tliese figures. "" Presumable duplications"" include all errors of ofliciuls in marking the rolls, such errors being caused by the similarity of adjacent names. Prior to 1913, the practice of the Department had been to keep inviolate until after the period bad 'elapsed in which a petition might be lodged all election documents which might be involved should one of the candidates petition. Inasmuch as candidates' interests may be affected there is an objection to the certified lists being open in the absence of scrutineers, and the Government docs not feel justified, in view of the negative results of previous checks, in incurring similar expenditure to that involved in the employment of scrutineers at the check following the 1913 election. It is held that on the previous occasion trouble was given, and expense incurred which the result does not justify repeating. Prior to the action taken by the late Government the practice adopted by the Department was to keep inviolate u n t i l the period had elapsed in which a petition might be lodged all electoral documents that might be involved should a candidate present a petition, and they were thereafter used for statistical purposes. On the occasion of my first interview as Minister with Mr Oldham I told him that I had taken charge of the Department, that I was satisfied of his great ability, and that I did not wish to needlessly interfere with him . He then told me that he failed to see the necessity for this check. I repeat that I am uot seeking to place the responsibility upon him ; I accept it myself.",9
29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,From his point of view I dare say there is no necessity f o The question is whether it is a convenience for other people.,10
30,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am very glad that my right honourable friend has stated the position in that way, because I do not wish to shelter behind the judgment of the Chief Electoral Officer. I fail to see that there is any advantage to be gained by continuing the system introduced by the late Government. There is at least one strong reason why it has not been continued. In any case, if a petition is lodged, all the documents relating to it can be seen upon au order of the Court. But under this system, what would be the position in the case of vexatious and unnecessary inquiry, which, in many instances, would undoubtedly take place? Take the case of a rich man who had been unsuccessful in his candidature against a poor man. I am not referring to honourable members on eitlier side.",10
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable gentleman had better not do so. There are as many rich men on his side as there .are on this side of the House.,10
32,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am happy to believe that that is so; but such a designation does not apply to me, nor does it apply, I fear, to my right lionorable friend. In the circumstances I have stated, would it be desirable that the agents of a candidate who had plenty of money to spend should have an opportunity to search every document in the Department, with the object of trying to create a pretext for a petition ? It is there that the real danger lies, and the House, I think, should guard against it . The law as it stands is perfectly clear. An election having been concluded to the satisfaction of the scrutineers, the papers can be inspected, when a petition is lodged, by order of the Court. I do not charge the late Government with any but the most lionorable motives in framing the new regulation, but I think that they were ill-advised, and I am not prepared to recommend to my colleagues that the practice instituted by them should be continued. Everything is satisfactory so far as all effective useful purposes are concerned, and no wrong or in justice is being done to any one. Why should we manufacture opportunities for all the inquisitive people in Australia to satisfy their curiosity ? It is not usual for this and that document to be free to the inspection of every one. In a lawr it . suit a prescribed course has to be followed to secure the inspection of documents, and papers of the kind that I have in mind cannot be examined without an order of the Court.",10
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a very good Caucus argument.,10
34,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It may not suit the right honourable member.,10
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that the honourable gentleman is quite logical from the point of view of his party. They believe in covering up things.,10
36,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And the right honourable member is,- no doubt, logical from his point of view in urging that the practice should be continued. tunately, he and I do not view this question of the rolls from the same standpoint. I desire that we shall have an enlarged roll, on which shall appear the name of every man and woman in Australia who are entitled to vote.",10
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,So do I .,11
38,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not quite sure as to that. We desire as broad a rol l as possible; but our friends opposite want an attenuated roll.,11
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We desire that every name which should be on the rol l shall' be there, and no others.",11
40,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The right honourable member spoke of questions of finance connected witli the war. I bave no intention of dealing with finance in detail, because that is a matter for the head of the Government, and one with which I am not very well acquainted; but I wish to draw attention to some matters that are worthy of note in this connection. war has dislocated the finances of the civilized nations of the Western world, and bas not improved the finances of the United States of America. monwealth of Australia, being part of the Empire, and, therefore, a party to the war, is also affected. It must, under these circumstances, be the duty of all of us to see that the relations between the Commonwealth and the State Governments are as cordial as possible. There should be an understanding among employers of labour and banking authorities that everything possible will be done to keep the wheels of industry revolving, and to bring the troubles which must come from the drought and the war to an irreducible minimum. We must try to find out points of agreement between the CommonAvealth and the States, not points of difference.",11
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This is a new note from honourable members opposite.,11
42,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"IsTo t long ago I appealed to my right honourable friend not to get his back up in regard to the Tariff, because the situation requires that our in dustries shall be kept going, and that the country shall be made as self-contained as possible. I make the same appeal to him again now. I know that he is doing what he can, and that be is as desirous as we are that everything proper shall be done. I hope that matters will be similarly Unfor- viewed by the States. The war is a terrible business. I feel certain that the Allies will w in in the end, and I hope that the end will come soon. But, whenever it conies, there will be a great reckoning up and weighing in the balance. It will try tbose who are wanting. The people of the Commonwealth expect that we shall not be scared or daunted b'y the difficulties confronting us, and that we shall face them determinedly. The States ' are equally responsible with us. The day for talking has gone by, and the time for action has come. We have heard a great deal of the pros and cons of the argument in relation to private enterprise and Government action. Unless private enterprise makes an effort to do something in a time like the present, the people will ask, when the war is over, what is the value of p r i vate enterprise. Private enterprise can do a great deal when trade is brisk and there is prosperity, and Government acThe tion can do a great deal then too. Now is the time for the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States, for the banks, and for private enterprise, too, to The Com- show what can be done. The people will hold us to a severe reckoning if we do not rise to the occasion. As a Frenchman said, at the grave of a dead comrade, "" Hands together, for we l i v e . "" We must put our heads together and make the best of thesituation. We know that wben the bank rate of interest in England goes up to 10 per cent., and there is a demand for gold, the Chancellor of the Exchequer can suspend the bank charter, and allow the issue of more notes. When the present war broke out, the bank rate went up to 10 per cent., and an arrangement was made between the British Government and the Bank of England. I do not know, and I do not care, what it was; but it was very different from anything that has been done in the lifetime of the oldest member of any Parliament in Australia. There is a circulation of notes in the Mother Country at the present time, whose extent, and whose conditions I do not know, and am not now concerned with. I merely point out that the British Government are giv-* ing financial assistance to keep industrygoing, and it is incumbent on us in Australia to do the same thing. Do not tell 1 me that under this Act and under that Act we cannot do anything. Rubbish!. What is needed can be done. What theBritisli Government and the Bank of England have done, the Governments of Australia and the private enterprise of Australia can do. We must not be outdone by our brothers in the Old Land, but must show them that we are equally able to grapple with a serious situation. If the banks and private enterprise show themselves unable to deal with the situation, when peace comes they will be weighed in the balance and will be found wanting, and I shall not enlarge upon the result. We know what will happen to us if we are similarly found wanting. know all about the difficulties that have to be met. At a crisis like this our business is to find out how to surmount tbem, not to insist on tbem. Furthermore, I make a strong appeal to every person in Australia, and particularly tn the workers, to have nothing to do with those who may advocate a note circulation without a gold reserve. Such a thing would be very unfortunate, and would hurt, not the rich, but the poor, who always suffer when a currency is debased. Between the debasing of the currency in tbo reign of Henry VII . and the establishment of a good currency by Montague, who founded the Bank of England and restored the coinage, the workiug people of England were robbed, and suffered accordingly. Prior to the debasing of the currency, they were in as good a position, taking into consideration the difference of conditions, values, and other circumstances, as they are in today, and their subsequent degradation was due wholly to the debasing of the currency. If there is one lesson in history that stands out prominently, it is that no working man or woman should have anything to do with quacks who put forward patent ideas relating to currency. I hope that, whatever controversies may arise, there will be no doubting the soundness of this statement, which, for the past 200 or 300 years, has been recognised by every man who has had a reputation to lose.",11
43,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What does the honourable member propose to do?,12
44,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have indicated what sbould be done, but, for obvious reasons, I have not gone into details.",12
45,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I merely ask for little enlightenment.,12
46,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member will tell me what authority the British Government have at the present time for their every act in regard to the currency, he has his answer. The right honourable member for Swan referred to the Cockburn Sound Naval Base; and, without going at any length into the matter, I must certainly admit that I have not studied the question very closely. It does, however, seem to me very remarkable that, after expert advice had been accepted and acted upon by the Fisher Government, and everything was on a satisfactory basis to proceed with the work, I other expert advice sbould be called from the Old Country. As a matter of fact, I believe that the report obtained by the late Government practically endorsed the views of the Fisher Government.",12
47,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The second report was a waste of money!,12
48,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It undoubtedly looks like a waste of money. I may say that I am not altogether in agreement with the right honourable member for Swan in his somewhat antiquated preference for a graving dock as against a floating dock - Floating docks have, I suppose, been before the world for the last eighty years. When I was at Home, on the occasion of the Coronation, I had the privilege of seeing two floating docks that were being constructed for the British Admiralty, one at Newcastle and the other at Birkenhead; and I may say that the former was one of the largest ever constructed for the Government. This is not a new class of work by any means, because for many years past the Russian Government, for instance, have been favourably disposed towards it for the purpose of meeting the requirements of tlieir Navy. There is a great advantage about a floating dock, especially in a new country like Australia, where we have not an unlimited amount of money to spend on our naval and military requirements; there is no necessity to pretend that we are poor, but we are limited by our population in the amount that we can spend in this direction. The great advantage of a floating dock is that it can be towed from place to place, as has been proved elsewhere with great advantage. Of course, a I do not say that it would be desirable to tow a floating dock about the coast of Australia every day; but the weather conditions are very often such as to render the work by no means impossible or gerous to property. For these reasons, do uot view a floating dock with the same degree of disfavour as does the honourable member for Swan. Of course, tliere are some people, old fashioned and conservano tive, who would regard the graving dock as almost a part of the Britisl i Constituour instrument of government. t i o n ; but we should not allow such feelbeing ings to operate when approaching a question tion of this kind, which ought certainly to be dealt with entirely on its merits. The fact that the British Government on this side. have used floating docks freely, despatching them to other portions of the Empire, justifies us in feeling no alarm whatever at adopting a similar method in connection with our Naval Bases - Another matter on which the right honourable member f o Swan touched was that of the referenda. The right honourable member is very opposed to the proposal of the Governtionists ; but what does that mean 1 ment to give the people an opportunity say whether or not they desire any alteraof tion of the Constitution. My own opinion is that it is our bounden duty to give people every opportunity of the k in d ; and I regret very much that the late GovernState Parliaments. ment sbould bave missed such an excellent chajice as that presented by the election.",12
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Government may submit the referenda at the next election.,13
50,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is not the point; my honourable friends opposite seem to lose sight of the basic principle Of this question. When there is a clear indicaclined tion on the part of the people of a desire for an alteration of the Constitution, they sliould certainly be afforded full tunity to express their opinion clearly. If I understand tlieir objections aright, honpartment. orable members opposite object to submitcreated ting the referenda again, because they have already been rejected twice. It a fact that the referenda have been refriends jected; but there is the further remarkFederation, able fact that on the last occasion there was a tremendous increase in the number of affirmative votes; in fact, on one of questions there was a difference of only 8,000. When we see a growing desire like six separate State Parliaments. this, it is a mistake for Parliament, or members of the Parliament, to stand i the way of the people expressing their definite views. As parties are today, doubt, if the Parliament possessed the danpowers desired, legislation would be I initiated by the present Government to bring about alterations in the Constitut i o n ; whereas, if my friends opposite occupied tliese benches, they would make move, because they have not the slightest desire to see any amendment in That so, I cannot see what possible objechonorable members opposite can have to submitting the referenda to the people.",13
51,Mr BRUCE SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We are Federalists,13

55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Goo d old common sense!,13
56,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am a great believer in common sense, which I value a great deal more than I do law. I am in to tbink the Leader of the Opposition is having a joke with me, because I fancy he has just as high appreciation as opporI have of the value of common sense. Trade, commerce, and industry, for in stance, are in relation to the Customs DeThe Commonwealth was for two reasons, namely, to bring about Inter-State Free Trade, and to is create an adequate defence system. My opposite, who never believed in would have agreed to no Commonwealth Constitution at all but for the fact that they desired to have In the ter-State Free Trade, which they knew it would be impossible to obtain from the It is any obvious that if we are to have any defence n it must be a national defence; and both parties in this House have assisted in the no creation of naval and military forces of which we have no reason to be ashamed. I am certain that the Leader of the Opposition recognised nothing but a huge joke and a waste of money in the old defence systems of the various States. again, the Trade and Customs Department was created under the Constitution specially in relation to Inter-State Free Trade; and it is only common sense to hold that all associated with trade, commerce and industry should be part and parcel of the business of the National Government. The framers of the Constitution did not create a Minister of Trade and Customs simply to collect revenue and to tax the people; I sbould hesitate very much to charge the honourable member for Angas, and others who sat with him in the various Conventions, with putting that construction on the matter. the other hand, we recognise at once that the police and the lands are naturally matters for the State Parliaments, along with many other services in the social life of Australia; and, therefore, I say tliere is no difficulty at all, from a common-sense point of view, in deciding which are national and which are State matters. All the people of this country may not be philosophers, great linguists, or students of history, but they have common sense enough to distinguish between what is local and what is Federal; and they ought to be allowed a chance to express their opinions. not from a party point of view that I regret the excellent opportunity that was lost by the late Government when they did not place the referenda before the people >at the general election. Parliaments come and go, and these are certainly matters for the people to decide. However, the subject has been so thoroughly discussed in the past that there is no necessity to now cover the whole ground of the controversy. I may, however, refer for a moment to trusts and combines. I make no charge against the Colonial Sugar Refining Company; but I am certain that every intelligent woman of this country realizes that this company has the power to make any charge they like-to tax the community in defiance of Parliament or any other authority. I have always held the trine that no one has a' right to enforce taxation in this Commonwealth except under the authority of H is Majesty the K in g. It is all very well to say that they put up the price of this commodity and that commodity; the fact is that they are practically taxing the people without having received any power from this Parliament. We have tried on two occaThen, sions to get an amendment of the Constitution so that .we could say to the people, "" If you want to allow these p r i vate individuals the right to tax you, well and good. It is a free country; do what you like."" I do not quarrel with the people in regard to the view they take of any matter, although I certainly regret the view they take at times. I am not going to discuss the matter of the Beef Trust this afternoon.",13
57,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why not?,14
58,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"F o r the simple reason that I can .leave it to common On sense, which my honourable friend does not think much. of.",14
59,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,But why must the Beef Trust be left alone ? That was your attitude for three years.,14
60,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We have no power to touch the Beef Trust; m y honourable friend knows that, and so does the honourable member for Angas and the honourable member for Flinders. What is the use of playing with the people when we know that we have not got the power? The Beef Trust did not start their operations in America for benevolent reasons, It is nor in the Argentine; nor. had they a benevolent purpose when they set out to get the control of as many meat stores as possible in London.",14
61,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We left you an elaborate report of nearly 200 pages of foolscap in regard to the Beef Trust.,14
62,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have not had time to read it , and I do not hold out any hope that I shall read it at the present time. We know that the Beef Trust came here as business men to make money. Well, let them make money, but it is our business as a Parliament to see that we have power to control them. Take another matter of great urgency; what is the position we are placed in today with regard to the transcontinental railway? We want a great quantity of steel doc- rails, and what must we do to get them? Before the war broke out we had practically to accept any terms dictated to us by the steel combine. The great Commonwealth . of Australia and the States, too, were at the absolute mercy of the steel combine. Now we are at war with. Germany, and for some reason or other German steel is of very high quality. But that source of supply is lost, and there is a difficulty in getting material from the other side of the world. What is our obvious common-sense duty? If we consulted half-a-dozen common sense men from any part of Australia would they not say-""Why do you not manufacture for yourselves?"" our answer ? That we have not the power to manufacture steel rails for ourselves. We shall be told that we shall be able to buy them at Newcastle. But for how long ? When the war is over there will not be a steel manufacturer in Australia who will not be in the combine. They must enter it , or they will be choked out istence. The great democracy of Australia, when it wants material for the construction of its railways, must go cap in hand to the Steel Trust and say, "" Please give us a quotation and do not rob us too much."" Honourable members may say that we have a certain amount of power to engage in manufacture, but we have no right to go into an enterprise such as this unless we are sure of our ground. cannot afford the luxury of playing with the vital questions of Australia. I am not a lawyer, and there is an element of doubt in my mind. But, assuming, for the sake of argument, that we have power to manufacture steel rails, the fact remains that we have not power to sell to the people a pound of any commodity which we manufacture. The* only way to make manufacture profitable is by having the right to sell to the people of Australia our surplus and by-products, so that the taxpayers will not be losing on the enterprise. I might elaborate this case all day long, but I am confining myself to a practical forcible argument, and by reason of the office I have the honour to occupy at the present time, I know what the position is. I do not wish the country to think that, so far as the Home Affair s Department is concerned, there is a shortage of commodities, but I have often felt anxiety as to whether there might not possibly be a danger in that direction.",14
63,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And you fundamental changes made because of a "" might possibly "" ?",15
64,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Thos e changes are an absolute necessity. We might have a repetition of the trouble in regard to the war and other things, although I hope not. I have always contended that public life is merely the application of common sense. If a common-sense individual in his private capacity is cornered, through circumstances which he is unable to control, he makes provision to insure that he will not be cornered in the same way What is again. But in public life, we are cornered again and again, because we musfc not have any change; vested interests say that change is not desirable.",15
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Than k goodness, we have a reformer at last!",15
66,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not know that I am a reformer; I have not the of expower to do anything. I am only suggesting that the people ought to have the opportunity of deciding these matters for themselves. My quarrel with the right honourable member is that he prevented the people from having the opportunity.,15
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Someho w or other, my common sense did not suggest that fchey should have it.",15
68,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No w we come to We another phase of the question. We are continually told about the sacred rights of the Constitution. It is a wonderful affair, reared up and voted on by the people of the country; it. is a sacred compact between the States and the people of the Commonwealth, and must not be touched. Bufc that was not the opinion of the men who framed it . The framers of the Constitution had two objects in view, "" Let us come to an agreement; let us patch the Constitution up, and get it before the people; time will alter it . "" What did Mr Deakin say? "" We are building up the skeleton of a great edifice which the people of the country will perfect from generation to generation."" There was no public man of the front 1 rank engaged in the framing of that Constitution who did not take that view of it . They recognised that they were merely making a beginning, and if there had not been the referendum clause, giving to the people the right to alter the Constitution, they would never have accepted it at all. The Australian men and women are not so foolish as that. They may have tlieir shortcomings, but they know too much of want Conservatism and vested interests, and the history of the combinations against the people of the Motherland. Who are the objectors to an alteration of the Constitution ? The States. And who in the States: object? There are two parties in the States who object on every occasion. The first are the comic-opera statesmen who fear the weakening of their authority and power as representatives of the sovereign States, and the second are the Legislative Councils. They will have no referendum; they will never vote "" Yes . "" They belong to the grand historical party-the party which the people swept away at the polling booth.",15

79,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have said what I have said, and I leave it at that. The present Government propose to amend the law in relation to arbitration.

The Arbitration Court is congested, and you have brought about no satisfaction.""",16

I have no desire to be a resurrectionist, and rake up the speeches of the right honourable gentleman; but every one knows his line of argument. There may be some truth in what he says-that we may fail in attaining what we seek by means of the Arbitration Act ; nevertheless, we shall try. We hold the view that a strike is to is one in the industrial world what war is to the general community, namely, the last resource; and a Parliament that cannot create some method to prevent such occurrences is not worth its salt. "" We shall fail , "" the right honourable gentleman says. Well, better to fail than never to try. However, I do not think that we shall fail ; because, in spite of occasional disappointments, there is growing up a strong feeling on the part of the people that these industrial disputes can and I should be settled. But the position today in regard to the Arbitration Court is not what it should be. Costly law suits are what the workers get when they seek the aid of the Court. On every occasion there is an appeal to the High Court.",16

87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Who said that?,17
88,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The right honourable gentleman said it in his speech at Parramatta. He said that he believed in Wages Boards. He wanted a superior sort of Wages Board on top, which was to deal with appeals fro m Wages Boards in the various States. And he was to get six Legislative Councils to agree to it ! anything be more shallow than the possibility of getting even two of those Legislative Councils, much less six, to agree to that scheme ? I am in favour of everything that wil l promote industrial peace, but I cannot favour Wages Boards. What is there in having a Wages Board? There are three employers and three employees, and the Government get a safe man as Chairman-ever y time they get a safe man-and their power is simply that of wrangling and coming to some sort of agreement. What is the nature of this wrangling? The employer says, "" If you want this increase of . wages, or tliese i m proved conditions, you will r u in my business; I shall be utterly ruined."" I have known men to make that statement over and over again who today are in possession of princely fortunes.",17
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,They have passed the increases on.,17
90,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Why do honourable members opposite love Wages Boards and hate the Arbitration Court? It is because the Arbitration Court has the power, when these poor, suffering, starving employers, who are about to be ruined, appear before it , to say, "" Come along and show us your books."" That is why honourable members so hate the Arbitration Court, and would crush, it tomorrow. On the other hand, it is the safeguard for the future, because the industrial people in this country rightly believe that when they appear before an Arbitration Court they will get a fair deal. I do not say that Wages Boards will not give them a fair deal, but they are constituted on a stupid and ridiculous principle, and not on the principle of justice and equity, and there can be no lasting peace except no, no,"" on the basis of justice and equity. If the working people are not prepared to accept the principle of arbitration, it is a matter to be regretted; but I do not agree with that view of the question, and I maintain that there is room for further amendment in relation to the Arbitration Act. I admit that it is experimental legislation, but I would rather spend my days on this side of the House attempting experimental legislation of that character than j o in with my friends opposite who say, "" Y o u will never do any good. Y o u are on the wrong track, and, therefore, will have to retrace your steps."" Time will show us who is right. The Arbitration Act has Could done good, at least up to the outbreak of the war. Like other things, it must be affected by the present circumstances, and the true position is difficult to estimate. I hope that at an early date the referenda proposals will be again submitted to the people, and that we will be in a position to go on with, those steps that are necessary to enable us to grapple with the unfortunate circumstances in which we are placed today, and keep the wheels of ° in d u s try going. The responsibility lies, not only on this Parliament and on the present Government, but also upon the States, and must be equally shared by the financial institutions and by employers of labour throughout the Commonwealth.  Speaker",17

I enter upon the debate with a considerable amount of diffidence; but, so far, there has been very little meat in it from the stand-point of the man who needs work. Academic discussion across the floor of the chamber as to what the referenda will or will not do may be all very well for the future, but what we should do is to get down at once to bedrock. The question is "" work."" I should readily sit down now if a proposal came forwar d that would grant or facilitate work. I do not think that honourable members realise how intense is the unemployed situation. I differ from the Minister of Home Affairs , who says that we have not felt any effects from the war. Already the war has had disastrous effects. Adelaide is filled with unemployed as a direct result of the war. These men have come from Broken Hill . Thousands of men have been turned out of employment because of the mines being closed down, not as a result of the drought, but as a direct result of the war.",17
92,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If we had not the drought they would be absorbed.  much, but that assertion is no consolation to the man in the street looking for a job. We want some concrete proposals to get work. In the programme of the Government I cannot see much meat for the immediate future. Take paragraph 13, which saysMeasures will be introduced to promote the production and manufacture of raw material for which no market is now open, and to secure new markets for the manufactured goods of Australia. The object is laudable, but it does not get us any bread. Look at the result of the war upon the Broken Hill zinc concentrates. Tliere have been 400,000 tons of concentrates shipped through Port Pirie each year to Germany and Belgium. To manufacture that raw product and find a market for that zinc would be a very laudable object, but as regards^ an immediate proposition it is impossible and impracticable. We want something at the present moment. As a matter of fact, the erection of the necessary plant to treat one-balf of the concentrates passing through Port Pirie would take a number of years. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the only company treating zinc concentrates, have nine furnaces at work, and their ou.tput is about 110 tons per week, whereas the output of the Broken Hill mines in the shape of zinc concentrates is 400,000 tons per year. The cost of putting up the plant to treat 110 tons a week was £120,000. I estimate that a plant to treat 200,000 tons yearly would cost £1,500,000.",18
93,Mr FLEMING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And then what are you going to do with the product?  have erected the plant and turned the raw material into zinc, the further problem arises as to what we are to do with it. The 110 tons per week treated by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company amply provide for the Australian'market at the present time. We are told"" that early steps are proposed to be taken to initiate the great national work of a u n if o rm gauge for the railways; but have we any reason to hope that the unemployed will be immediately absorbed in that direction? Are Ave not up against the States in connection with the proposal for a unif o r m gauge ? Even if an agreement were andved at to-morroAV with the States, we sbould still be - confronted with a difficulty. There is no 4-ft. 8^-in. rolling plant obtainable in Australia, and it would be very difficult to secure it abroad. It may be said that we could obtain it in the TJnited States of America; but, as a matter of fact, we cannot arrange just IIOAV even for the transport of rails from the TJnited States of America. Despite all her advancement, that country has made no attempt to build up a mercantile marine in the sense that England and Germany have done. There is only one way in which wo could find work immediately for the unemployed, and that is in widening the railway to the north, of Port Augusta. The property is our OAvn, and no State difficulties lie in the way. The present rails could be used, and a large number of men could be employed in substituting neAv sleepers to carry . a 4-ft. S-J-in. line. If the GoA'ernment wish to find work immediately for some of our unemployed, let them carry the line from Port Augusta to Quorn on that gauge, which would be on the direct route to New South Wales. The question is not what we are to do in the future, but what we must do at the present time for our unemployed. We are told that action which is to be taken for the utilization of the M u r r a y waters will provide employment for many men. The object, no doubt, is a laudable one, and will be achieved in due time; but not one of the three State Governments concerned has yet brought down a Bill to provide for it . That being so, that part of H is Excellency's Speech which relates to the utilization of the M u r r a y Avaters offers no hope of early employment for the workless. The same may be said of many other proposals in the Ministerial programme. I agree Will all of them; but the point I wish to emphasize is that we bave to meet abnormal conditions, and that, instead of discussing matters that concern the"" future rather than the present, we should take in hand at once the question of so arranging our finances as to provide work immediately for those who want it. It is all very well for us to shelter ourselves behind the pretext that the States ought to do something.",18
94,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"They ought to do a lot.  inaction will not excuse us. There are in Australia today thousands of men who have not done .a day's work since the outbreak of the war. What are we going to do for them ? Are the Government going to wait till it is possible to give effect to some of the big schemes outlined in the Speech, or do they propose at once to get down to bedrock? Let me suggest another direction in which employment can be found for many of those now seeking it. One of the conditions of the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth was that a railway should be constructed through it. For over 300 miles a complete survey has been made, and a very large number of men could thus be employed in building that line, to which all parties in this Parliament are pledged. Why not do that which lies nearest to our hand? TheTe is no obstacle in the way so far as the provision of rails and rolling plant is concerned. Action could be taken at once to broaden the line from Coward Springs to Oodnadatta. There is a stretch of 120 miles between Coward Springs and Kingunyah, on the east-west road, which could be put in hand at once. The necessary rolling stock to carry on the work at Oodnadatta could be obtained from the South Australian Government. The State Government would make available to us thousands of trucks, many engines, all the necessary equipment, and also a number of engine drivers, for whom they have no work. Here, then, is an opportunity to utilize our strength. These several undertakings would, of course, involve considerable outlay; but no one expects the question of money to stand in the way of action at the present juncture. Our war expenditure is going to be very considerable, and we must be prepared, if necessary, to spend our last penny and to give our last man to bring the war to a successful issue. We know what the alternative is. At the same time, however, we must make provision for those who are with,us today. The contingents which we are sending away will relieve, to a certain extent, the unemployed trouble; but even in my own State there are thousands of men out of work, and so far as I can see there is no prospect of employment for them for many months to come. The whole question resolves itself into one of finance. Is not our credit sufficient to enable us to raise what money we require to push on at once with necessary works? Is there no,other course open to us than the old, well-worn one of going to the London market and pledging our credit? What is the credit of Australia worth?",19
95,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"£1,000,000,000 .  many millions. If there was ever a time when we should utilize our credit it is now. Can we hope to raise by taxation all the moneys we require? By no means. Taxation should be imposed, but no one would dream of imposing taxation sufficient to raise all that we require at the present time. I do not know why a war fcax has not yet been imposed. There ought to be a war tax upon a progressive scale on incomes, and I would make it go down pretty low. Such a tax, however, would not raise anything like the amount we require. The revenue so secured would be a mere drop in the ocean. We might possibly raise in London what we want, but there is really no necessity for us to go there. Why should we not utilize our own credit? If we went to London we should have to pledge our credit there, and, in addition, we should incur heavy flotation expenses. Why not make the best use of our own credit here ?",19

If we borrowed it at the ordinary rate of incredit, terest, in twenty years we should have paid, by way of interest, plus flotation expenses, the whole of its face value, yet still owe the principal; whereas, under my scheme, in ten years we should have paid off the whole amount, and it would not have cost the country a farthing.

112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then you tried to It is the frighten them ?,21
113,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes . The devil is used to frighten us from sinning, and certain persons were used to frighten the proelectors from voting against their own I interests; with very good results. Prices are being fixed today by Government reap Boards, though the methods may not be ideal. It is the prices of natural productions that are being fixed. If it is possible to fix the prices of natural productions when the probabilities of a season and a harvest have to be taken into consideration, as well as the deserts of the producers and the profits of the middlemen-whethe r the scoundrels who haudle the produce are to get cent, per cent, on their money-it must be possible to fix the prices of manufactured articles, in regard to which you have only to consider the cost of production and fai r profit. The majority of honourable members opposite were determined that there should not be an alteration of the Tariff. They hoped that I and others who desire to regulate prices might be put into a corner. Those who oppose Protection because the prices of protected commodities have been increased are themselves to blame for voting against our referenda proposals. We sbould have had power to fix the prices of protected manufactures. I hope that when the matter is again submitted to the people after the Tariff has been dealt with, the position will be understood, and that the rings, trusts, and combines, which have opposed our policy tooth and nail will not be successful. No doubt it will be easier for our opponents to fight the next referendum, because there will be more money poured out by the Sugar Trust and others than they are willing to provide for the personal contests of a general election. The mone3 will come in as in the past. r",21
114,Mr FOWLER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The friends of the Sugar Combine are on the Labour side.,22
115,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And the friends of the Tobacco Combine,.too.",22
116,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The member for Perth, although he is a Free Trader, and professes to look after the in terests of the consumers, took the platform against the referenda, one of the objects of which was to secure that the people were not robbed; and, in spite of their experience in the past, they would take the same course in the future. They are like soi/ie manufacturers and others on the questions of rings and combines. Mr MCLeun, a gentleman who stood in the Conservative interests for the Senate in Victoria, and Mr MCPherson, the member for Hawthorn in the State Parliament, both admitted that it is necessary for the Federal Government to have Commonwealth ships on the coast, in view of the fact that miners, farmers, and graziers are robbed by the Shipping Ring. And manufacturers in my own electorate contend that they are charged too much for the carriage of their commodities. They allege that it costs as much to take a bale of manufactures from Melbourne to Brisbane as it does to carry goods from Glasgow to the latter port, and all because of the Shipping Ring. But when I ask those men why they are not willing to give the Federal Parliament the"" powers contemplated in the referenda, they say, "" You see, the worse of the Labour party is that, if we give them the power, they will want to go too far. "" In other words, those manufacturers and others are quite willing to give the Commonwealth Parliament power to stop rings from robbing them, but they are not willin g to give the power to stop the rings from robbing the people generally; and that is why they oppose the referenda. We on this side understand the position just as well as do honourable members opposite, and we are not afraid to express our opinions, which, we contend, cannot be refuted. As to the double dissolution, the members of the present Opposition have got their just deserts,, and are where they always would have been but for the mistake in' 1913. The Commonwealth and the various States are self-governing Dominions, and it was always understood that the representative of the British Crown in Australia was the one desirable, or necessary, connecting link with the Mother Country. In the past the system has worked fair l y well, and I do not think that today we should find J per cent, of the people who are honourable desirous of doing away with that l in k ; indeed, it is quite possible there are many who would deem it desirable to strengthen it. The representative of the Crown may be regarded from two aspects. He is, as I say, the connecting link between Australia and the Mother Country, and he has certain powers, acting for the Crown, in relation to this Parliament. He is there as an umpire to see that the Government do not' act in an unconstitutional manner, and to give the people of Australia a fair deal all round.",22
117,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"How can the honourable member understand that to be the case? There is not a word to that effect in the Constitution. . Mr MATHEWS - I understand it from the precedents of the past. I am not now dealing with the relationship between the British Parliament and the King, but with the relationship between the Governor General and the Commonwealth Parliament under our Constitution.",22
118,Sir ROBERT BEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the honourable member object to the Governor General .taking the advice of his Ministers?,23
119,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am too old a bird to be led off the track by the honor- to able member for Kooyong, who will haye an opportunity of dealing with the question tion in his own way. We know that in the past politicians have endeavoured shackle the Governor General, and to tain dissolutions on three or four sions; but those dissolutions were not granted for various reasons. As I say, what I am now referring to is precedent, which has become strong enough to be regarded as law. The late Governwhole ment, in asking for a double dissolution, vented their spleen and spite on another Chamber because it had dared to exerwhat cise its constitutional rights, although believe that when they did so, they had not the slightest idea a double dissolution would result. I think the honourable member for Flinders desired a double solution ; but, from evidence which it impossible to adduce here, I am convinced that the vast majority of the present j>osition never dreamt that a double solution would be granted. Honourable members opposite have charged trade unionists with creating disputes, in order to get before the Arbitration Court; but, with the Governor General as the arbiter between the two parties, they created puny and petty issue, in order to to advise His Excellency to grant a double dissolution. Without any ill feeling to the other side, or to the Governor General, 1 desired to know formation had been placed before His Excellency; and we now know the grounds of the advice tendered by the late Government. I go so far as to apologize to honan orable members opposite-the y did not lie in the manner I thought they did. I could not conceive that the Governor General, placed as he was in the position of an arbiter between this side and that, could, on the situation created, grant a double dissolution. And I now say that either the Governor General was wrong in doing what he did, or his position, so far as this Parliament is concerned, is useless. If the Governor General is always to follow the advice of his constitutional advisers, however corrupt they may be, he is useless in relation to this Parliament; and it is just as well to know where we stand. If it has to be within the power of gentlemen of the calibre of the honourable member for Flinders to judge whether there ought or ought not be a double dissolution, according to the desires of his Government, the posiof the Governor General is not what - we have always understood it to be. I to say, with all due deference to the House oband the Governor General, that it would occabe quite possible, under such circumstances, for a corrupt Government to hold on to the Treasury benches until the time was, in their opinion, favourable for a general election, thus breaking down the intention of the Constitution. If a Government could go so far under the circumstances of the recent dissolution, is to stop a Government from breakI ing down the whole of the Constitution in order to further their desires and ob-jects? In the past I have supported the connecting link furnished by Imperial disGovernors, believing it essential to our is existence, and a link which might, perhaps, be strengthened; but if the gentleOpman who, at any time, happens to hold disthe position of Governor General has no power at all, his position, so far as we are concerned, is useless, and the sooner it is abolished the better for Australia.

Some of them have visited Australia and selected land which they are having prepared by the planting - of trees and the building of houses against the time when they will be able to take possession-namely , when their term of service in India or elsewhere is comi pleted. The Land Tax Commissioner, I the understand, says that the only way to relieve them is to bring in an amending Bill, and make the definition ""absentee"" such as will grant relief to these people. I contend that never intended when we passed the Bill that the term ""absentee "" should apply to settlers of this description, a very sirable class to encourage here. danger is that when friends of these people, who may be contemplating resihand dence in the Commonwealth, get to hear of this sort of thing it will have a bad effect.

A Board, consisting of an Austrian, an American, a Frenchman, an Englishman, and an Australian, was appointed to deal with those designs, which were to be sent in within a certain time. The competition was practically open to the world. When I took office it was pointed out to me, however, that, in consequence of the outbreak of the war, the only architects who would be able to compete, in all probability, would be Americans and Australians. There are many professional men engaged at the front. The French, Belgian, and British armies, to say nothing of the German army, in clude such men' in their ranks, and I agreed to put an end to the competition, I do not intend to ' revive it until after the war. I sent a cablegram to the Hig h Commissioner intimating my decision, and he has communicated it to the various ambassadors, so that the intending competitors may know that the competition is practically off. As to the question of liability, I had a doubt in my mind, but my advisers expressed the opinion that practically no work had been done in connection with the competition. To make sure of my in - ground, however, I conferred with the President of the Victorian Institute of Architects, who was good enough to call on rae at my request, and he advised that little, if any, work had been done in connection with the competition, and that, therefore, there could be no liability.",26
150,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How would he know what work had been done?,26
151,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Honourable members are asking for information, and I am supplying it . As to the question raised by the honourable member for South Sydney, I would prefer not to go into it in detail at the present time. I shall have an opportunity before long, when a certain notice of motion is reached, to refer to the whole matter, and I shall avail myself of it . Mr Griffin was the successful competitor for a design for the Federal Capital, and the lato Government invited him to come to Australia to confer with the gentlemen who have charge of the matter, their idea being that he should personally inspect the site and amend his design. He haB been instructed by me to complete the amendments which, I understand, he wishes to make in his original design, and to let me have it as soon as it is finished. I shall not discuss at this stage what Mr Griffin desires or does not desire, nor shall I enter upon the broad question of policy.",26
152,Mr RILEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will the Government soon decide upon the lay-out of the city?,26
153,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I intend to bring the whole matter before the Cabinet very shortly.,26
154,Mr FLEMING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Meanwhile, is anything being done at the Capital 1",26
155,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes ; we have 400 men employed there, and other works are now being entered upon, which will mean that two months hence we shall have 800 men employed, and six months henoe 1,000 employed at the Federal Capital. They will be engaged on work considered essential to the building of Canberra. hope the House will bo satisfied with the of the Act. information I have supplied. I confess that it is somewhat meagre, but I did not come prepared to deal with the question. It has taken me some time to obtain a grip of the whole subject, but I think I now understand it , and, when th© opportunity to which I have referred presents itself, as it will do shortly, I shall giv© the House all the information that I possess on the subject.",26
156,Mr JENSEN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Bass-Assistant M in ister of Defence) [5.47] - In reply to the honourable member for Melbourne, I would remind the House - that, on Friday last, he inquired concerning a rumour that an outrage of a disgraceful character had taken place at the Broadmeadows Camp. In compliance with the promise that I then gave him, I brought his question under the notice of the Minister of Defence, who called for a report from the officer in charge. That report has been furnished, and it. states that there is no truth whatever in the rumour. Aa to the second question put by the honourable member, I would ask him to giv© notice of it .",27
157,Mr RODGERS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wannon) [5.48] - I wish to supplement th© statement mad© by the honourable member for Wilmo t with respect to the removal of the provisions of the land tax, dealing with what might be called community settlement. Might I also suggest that the Attorney-General confer with the Commissioner. He will find that there is in the Land Tax Office evidence of glaring anomalies. Legal men, landowners, and others interested have brought many of these cases under the notice of the Commissioner during the three years that the Act has been in operation. Cannot these anomalies be dealt with by an amending Bill !",27
158,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.49] - The matters raised by the honourable member for Wannon will be looked into. I do not promise that effect shall be given to the views that he has expressed, but cases of alleged injustice will b© investigated, and remedied if possible. Certainly I shall lend a sympathetio ear to the request to exempt from absentee taxation all who are out of Australia fighting the battles of their country. They ought not to be I regarded as absentees within the meaning Question resolved in th© affirmative. House adjourned at 5.50 p.in.",27
