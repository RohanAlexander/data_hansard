1,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister let the House know on what datehe received the announcement from the Colonial-office as to the contemplated appointment of Lord Northcote to the office of Governor General of the Commonwealth,, and what reply, if any, he returned I",12
2,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"A communication was received by H is Excellency theGovernor-General from the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, though I do not remember the date of it, stating that it was in contemplation to appoint Lord Northcote to beGovernor-General, and asking if the appointment would be acceptable to His Excellency's advisers. The message also added that L o r d Northcote's administration of office in Bombay had been attended with marked success. To that communication the reply was madethat the Governor General saw no reason; why the appointment should not be acceptable ; and when I was in Sydney I received a document from His Excellency intimating that he had received a telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies announcing the intention to appoint Lord Northcote to be Governor General.",12
3,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Was ' any reply sent to that?,13
4,Sir EDMUND,Unknown,BARTON - No reply was needed.,13
5,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I think that my question should be answered by the Prime Minister, or he should say that he does not intend, or is unable, to answer it.",13
6,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"What part of it have I not answered ? At a later stage,",13
7,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"Before the business of the day commences, I might, in courtesy to the House, say that since answering a question at an earlier stage, I have received a communication from the Governor General informing me that on Saturday, the 8th inst., he received a telegraphic message from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, intimating that the K in g had been pleased to approve of the appointment of. Lord Northcote, C.B., G.C.,I.E. , at present Governor' of Bombay, to be the Governor General of Australia. PENNY POSTAGE.",13

NAVAL COMMANDANTS ' REPORTS. i Mr L. E. GROOM - I wish to know from the Minister for Defence if he will inform us whether any reports have been obtained from the Naval Commandants of the various States upon the naval work of the Department, and, if so, whether they will be laid upon the table of the House for the information of honourable members 1",13

11,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I wish' to make an announcement of a formal character. On Friday last, I made a statement to the House with regard to the proposed re-arrangement of some of the Ministerial Departments. I have now to intimate that His Excellency the Governor General has approved of the re-arrangement, and that the Ministers in question have been swornin for the administrations which they have respectively undertaken.",13
12,Mr WATSON,Unknown,Is it necessary to ask the approval of the Governor General?,13
13,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"It is the invariable practice for a Prime Minister upon the formation of his Ministry to submit the names of his colleagues for apwish proval, and upon a change of Ministers to submit for approval the mime of any fresh colleague, or of any colleague who has undertaken a new Department.",13
14,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"As I understand that a question as to the precedence of Ministers has arisen, this may be an opportune time to ask the Prime Minister on what"" principle the order of the Departments was arranged ? Under the Constitution of New South Wales the Treasurercomes next to the Colonial Secretary-an office which is generally held by the Prime Minister-and in most of the other States the office of Treasurer is generally held by the Prime Minister. Will my right honourable friend inform us upon what principle the otlice of Treasurer has been made fourth on the list of Federal Ministers 1",13
15,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Does not the Government work on the round-table principle ?,13
16,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"There has been some silly statement of the kind. The order of precedence which was settled at the outset placed the office of the Attorney General first after that of Minister for External Affairs; then came the Minister for Home Affairs, and then the Treasurer. The change which we contemplate is that so far as the present Ministry is concerned, the office of Minister for Trade and Customs shall rank next after that of the Attorney General. That change has been made with the complete approval of tine Treasurer. No decision has been come to with reference to the position of the Minister for Home Affairs. In some Constitutions, a relative precedence of offices is fixed, but no such precedence is provided for in the Commonwealth Constitution.",13
17,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I should like to explain that my question had nothing to do with the position of the Minister for Trade and Customs, but referred to the original arrangement. I thought that my right honourable friend might have given us, not merely a statement of the position, but the reason for it. Perhaps, however, a better time to deal with the matter will be when the Budget speech is under consideration. I think it is one which the House should understand.",14
18,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"It is not a fact that in the States the Treasurer invariably comes next in precedence to the Prime Minister. Sometimes he is Prime Minister, in which case he naturally takes precedence, but in other cases, as I know from experience, sometimes the Treasurer and sometimes the Attorney-General ranks next to the Prime Minister. On this occasion the Attorney General was, by arrangement amongst Ministers, placed next.",14
19,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,Is rangement subject to alteration 1,14
20,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,It is not contemplated to alter the arrangement at a later period.,14
21,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,Is the arrangement subject to an alteration in another Ministrv ?,14
22,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"All these matters are subject to alteration by Order in Council. This precedence was announced immediately after the 1st January, 1901, in the Commonwealth Gazette, as a notification from the Governor General, and it is subject to alteration by similar notification as circumstances arise, and the Executive Council determine. Mr O'MALLISY - I should like to ask the Prime Minister if he has any objection to tell us who the new honorary Minister is to be?",14
23,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"I shall have the utmost pleasure in informing the House as soon as I know myself. . FEDERAL CAPITAL. i Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I should like to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs whether it is correct, as reported in the newspapers, that; he has declared that no money shall be spent on the building of the Federal capital until the whole matter has been relegated to the people for decision ?",14
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I do not know to what newspaper paragraph the honourable member is referring, because there are so many paragraphs, some on one side and some on the other. But any expression of opinion that I have given has been that I do not think any large sum of money will be voted by this Parliament That is my personal opinion-no t that there shall be no money voted, because I think money should be voted if the question of the site is settled this session, so that various matters may be dealt with before the commencement of the buildings. PARTIALLY - PA ID FORCES : NEWCASTLE.",14
25,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Is the Minister for Defence aware that the capitation fees of the partially-paid forces at Newcastle have not been paid, although the vouchers have been signed for a month past ?",14
26,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I am not aware of the fact, but I shall make inquiries at once, and see that the fees are paid if they that arare due. IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION ACT.",14
27,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister what steps, if any, have been taken relating to three carpenters who are supposed to have landed under agreement to the Chillagoe Company, two or three days ago, as reported in this morning's newspapers 1",14
28,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"F r o m inquiries made in Sydney from the Collector of Customs, I find that there were three Germans on the s.s. Gera who proved to be under contract to perform manual labour as carpenters in the service of a mining company in Queensland. I. may say that I am expecting a communication on the subject from Sydney at any moment. When I left Sydney it was not ascertained whether these intending immigrants were with in the meani ng of the' Immigration R e s t r i c t i on Act , as possessing special s k ill required in A u s tralia. I have given instructions that in quiries be made on the point, and I am now awaiting the result. NA PROPERTIES. Sir WILLIAMMCMLLLAN (for Mr . REID ) asked the Minister for Home A f f a upon notice Whether there is any estimate in existence the total value of the properties which have become vested 'in the Commonwealth, and for which compensation is to be made to the States",14
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VALUE OF TRANSFERRED,"The answer to the honourable and learned member's questo tion is as follows :At the time of the Adelaide Convention an approximate estimate of £10,445,000 was put forward, a compilation, I believe, of the Victorian Government Statist. On the 24th January. 1901, I asked the Premiers of the different States to furnish ine with schedules of the properties of the Departments which had then been transferred, and of those which it was proposed to transfer in the near future. After some correspondence, lists were furnished by some of the States, but they did not contain - the necessary particulars as to values, & c , and, in October, 1902, the Prime Minister intimated to the Premiers of the States that the question of the appointment of a board of experts had been under consideration, but that before anything further could be done, certain data were necessary, and asked them to furnish the same as soon as possible. Since then, various reminders have been issued to the States Governments, but, so far, the desired particulars have only been received in regard to some Western Australian post-offices, although it is understood that fclie preparation of the information is well advanced in most of the States. As late as last week, reminders were forwarded to the State Premiers. PUBLIC SERVICE VACANCIES.",15
30,Mr HUMECOOK,VALUE OF TRANSFERRED,"the Minister for Home A f fair s, upon notice I. W i th reference to vacancies for officers who have passed State clerical examinations, when the vacancies to be declared, Attorney-General in answer to a question on 16bh June last? 2. Is it true that a number of officers from side the service have been appointed Customs Department, and that those qualified within the service have been passed over ?",15
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VALUE OF TRANSFERRED,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. Arrangements are not yet sufficiently plete to admit of any specified number of vacanK IN cies being declared ; but the Public Service Commissioner has recently provided for the transfer of ten of the General Division Officers to clerica positions, and efforts will be made to provide for others as suitable vacancies arise. 2. Only two appointments of the kind have been made since the Public Service Act came into force, and these were to minor positions at £4.0 per annum. PRESS MESSAGES.",15
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,VALUE OF TRANSFERRED,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. Has the Postal Department sent to newspaper proprietors in New South Wales a circular i r s, letter notifying that if any press message contains words not intended for publication, the whole of message will be charged as an ordinary message ? 2. IT so, has a similar circular letter been sent to newspaper proprietors in all the other States ? of the Commonwealth or in any of them ?",15
33,Sir EDMUND BARTON,VALUE OF TRANSFERRED,"The answers the honourable member's questions are as follow - 1. It has been reported, in reply to a question, that the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has sent to certain newspaper proprietors in Sydney a letter directing their attention to the regulation providing against the insertion in telegrams ""tendered as press"" of words not intended for publication, and not admissible in press telegrams, in order that the correspondents of the newspapers might be informed. 2. The Postmaster-General is not aware that any similar letters have been sent by the Deputy Postmasters-General of the other States to newspaper proprietors. All Deputy Postmasters-G eneral were, however, advised of the ruling which was given with respect to a specific instance in which a press telegram from Sydney, and addressed to Melbourne, contained twelve words of a private character, and were informed that it was to be generally applied from the 1st July last. INTER-STATE SHIPPING TRADE.",15
34,Mr CLARKE,VALUE OF TRANSFERRED,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. What is the value of the total shipping trade between Australian ports ? 2. Of the total amount, what proportion is carried by oversea ships, distinguishing, if possible, between British and foreign ships, and also between passenger and ordinary freight trade ?",15
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VALUE OF TRANSFERRED,"The answer to are the honourable member's questions is as folas indicated by the lows :I am informed that there is no means of obouttaining the figures to reply to this question, exto the cepting from the shipping companies. NA BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from the 6th August com- {vide page 3221), on motion by Mr DEA I That the B i ll be uow read a second time. Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN (Melbourne) - On Thursday, when I moved the adjournment of this debate, we had listened to three very able speeches-on e from the leader of the Opposition-, one from the late Minister for Trade and Customs, and another from the honourable member for Bland, who is the leader of the labour party. Allow me to say that I was very pleased with the moderate tone of the speech of the honourable member for Bland, and - grateful for the statistics which he supplied in relation to labour matters in' New Zealand. Those statistics were so full as to make it now unnecessary for me to further refer to them. In response to an interjection by the honourable member for Parramatta, the, honourable member for Bland stated that he had changed his views, and I have to make a similar acknowledgment. There was a time when I was utterly opposed, not only to unionism, but to conciliation and arbitration in any form. As ship-owners, we considered that we could judge best how our business should be managed, and I held that view for a long time after the great strike of 1890. The honourable member for Bland stated that "" the spirit of unionism had changed,"" and that there was now a newer unionism. The unionism to which I had been accustomed during the great strikes of 1890 to 1894 was of a more arrogant and "" stand-and-deliver "" type than the unionism of today. I hope that the newer unionism referred to by the honourable member for Bland, which has enabled those of us who are employers to meet our men with pleasure and discuss matters in' a conciliatory spirit, may continue. Eor some years past, so far as the relations between employers and employees areconcerned, there has been peace in the shipping trade. There is peace at present, although there has been some talk lately of a threatened strike. I can assure honourable members that I know of no reason for any such strike, or of any cause whatever for alarm, unless the leaders of the Seamen's Union are determined to import into the discussion of the present position considerations of a political nature that have nothing whatever to do vvith the relations between capital and labour.",15
36,Mr BATCHELOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Is there any agreement in existence?,16
37,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes ; there is an agreement between the employers and the Seamen's Unions, and I think I shall be able to show that unless action is taken by the leaders of the Seamen's Union, with some political object in view, there need be no fear but that everything will be done to get over any difficulty, if there be any, in the easiest possible manner. I sincerely trust that there will be no fomenting of troubleon the part of the Seamen's Union, and that labour leaders will not indulge in the tactics which appear to have been suggested by the reports recently circulated. The leader of the Opposition and the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, stated that this measure was of an experimental nature. I quite agree with that view, and therefore I intend, when the Bill reaches the Committee stage, to move that its operation shall be limited to .a period of five years.",16
38,Mr KNOX,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I have already given notice of my intention to act in that direction.,16
39,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I was not aware of that. I am very glad, indeed, to hear that the honourable member contemplates such action, and I shall have pleasure in supporting him.",16
40,Mr BATCHELOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Does the honourable member think that five years would prove very much ?,16
41,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It is said that ten years' experience in New Zealand has proved nothing.,16
42,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"We 1I have had some experience in New Zealand and in New South Wales, and, as the New South Wales Ac t will terminate in 1908,1 see no reason why the operation of this Bill should not be so limited as to expire in the same year. If the legislation which has been passed prove satisfactory in New South Wales and New Zealand, there is no doubt that the New South Wales law will be renewed, and I should be only too pleased at Such a result, unless some serious complaints can be urged against it. We must remember that this legislation is new, and that it will apply over an extended area; and that in itself affords a sufficient reason why we should treat it as experimental.",16
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Would a term of five years be sufficient ?,16
44,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I think so.,16
45,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Would it not be easy to repeal the Act if it proved unsatisfactory ?,16
46,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It would be more difficult to repeal the Act than to renew it. Whether they are favor.able to the Bill or otherwise, honourable members must recognise that strikes are extremely injurious. Dealing with the matter, first, from the humanitarian point of view, I wish to give honourable members some idea of the suffering inflicted upon women and ..children in the case of great strikes. I :shall read an extract from the work of Mr . AV. P. Reeves, the Agent-General of New .'Zealand, which is an extremely useful publication. He saysThere was in 1898 a colliery strike .which lasted :for five months, and was finally settled by the arbitration of Lord Bosebery. During the weeks of - conflict it kept three-quarters of a million of dependent women and children in a state of .anxiety and intermittent suffering. It also threw out of work half-a-million of persons en.gaged in trades directly affected by the coal .strike. Honourable members can easily picture to themselves the suffering undergone during that great strike, and I hope they will - approach this matter with a determination - to give the Bill every consideration from that pointof view. Regarding the monetary losses, .1! desire to show the House that if we can - devise any means whatever b)' which we 4jan prevent strikes, we shall do a great - deal of good. From the report of the Labour Department of the Board of Trade I find that the estimated annual loss in wages alone incurred through strikes in England-exclusiv e of the losses of the em.ployers-is £1,500,000. The same authority states that in 1S92 there were 700 strikes, affecting 372,000 workmen; and - that the loss which resulted amounted to £3,900,000. Mr Reeves also gives some useful imformation regarding America. He - says that the report of the Commissioner of Labour of the United States shows that the losses incurred by the employees in 'twenty years through strikes in the United - States was estimated at £55,000,000; whilst the employers lost more than £24,500,000. In Australia we have had the shearers' - strike and the great maritime strike. The shearers' strike' alone cost the Queensland 'Government about £100,000.  men ? ",16
47,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"A very great' deal; and it is the cost, not only to the men, but to their wives and children that has to be considered. ' In the Broken Hill strike, which occurred in 1892, the wages lost to the men represented £200,000, whilst the temporary loss to the employers was £500,000. At the present time a similar dispute there is being settled by means of conciliation and arbitration.",17
48,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,At Broken Hill?,17
49,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am not surprised that an honourable member should exclaim at ""Broken Hill , "" because very few of us know that such a dispute exists. Were it not for the fact that a Conciliation and Arbitration Court has been established in New South Wales, I will undertake to say that there would have .been today a strike at Broken Hill quite as serious as was that which occurred there in 1892. It is satisfactory - in the light of that experience-to know that trade will not be upset as it has been if it is possible to carry this Bill . What has been the effect of ""these big strikes upon the various States ? How far have they been retarded in their progress ? I venture to say that it would be impossible to estimate the years that the States have been put back by the disputes which have occurred - At Newcastle, in New South Wales, the great strike lost that port the major part of its foreign coal trade- a trade which it has never recovered until this day. Moreover, these disputes prove nothing. Either the employer or the employees may have a perfectly just cause, and yet be defeated in a strike. Every one, therefore, favours their abolition. It appears to me that there are only three ways by which that object can be accomplished, namely, by voluntary conciliation, by compulsory arbitration, or by conciliation with the force of arbitration behind it, as is proposed in this measure. Voluntary conciliation has been tried, both in England and America, and has met with only a minimum of success.",17
50,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It was a dead failure in New South Wales.,17
51,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"On e of the first Conciliation Boards in England was established by Mr Mundellain 1860, in connection with the hosiery trade. Yet, in thirteen years-fro m 1889 to 1901-ther e were 10,792 labour conflicts. In America vpluntary conciliation has been tried for a number of years. A genuine attempt in that direction has been made by the National Civic Federation Society, and by other organizations - There the employers ' generally meet the leaders of the trades unions in conference. Y e t , in thirteen yearsf r o m 1881 to 1894-ther e were 14,390 strikes, affecting 69,000 establishments and 3,714,000 workmen. Then we have the late instance of the great coal strike, which nearly resulted in c i v i l war in N e w Y 6 r k , and which was terminated only by the intervention of the President. It appears to me, therefore, that compulsion of some after an attempt has been made at conciliation-is necessary. already been used in some quartersa n d will probably be urged in this House - that neither in E n g l and nor in A m e r i c a , will the workmen submit to compulsion. But in E n g l and the unions have not sufficient representation in the House of Commons to enable them to secure the passage of a compulsory A r b it r at i o n Bill , and, in the second place, they fear, wrongly as I think, that, if an A r established, the Justices composing it might entertain unconscious bias against them.",17
52,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The r e are two Act s upon the statute-book, but no advantage is taken of them.",18
53,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am aware that one Act was passed as far back as 1824. A d v a n t a g e has not been taken of those measures because the workmen regard them as useless. In A m e r i c a ver y much the same condition of affairs exists. the workme n fear that the power of the trusts would govern the Court, if such at r i b u n a l were in existence. They have no confidence in the integrity of their J u d i c i a r y . The fac t that legislation for compulsory arbitratio n has not been enacted is due to influences which do not operate in Australia . I agree with the leader of the Opposition that the willingness of the labour bodies to submit indust r i a l disputes to a j u d i c i a l decision reflects great credit upon them, and that it reflects equal credit upon our J u d i c i a r y . At this stage I should l i k e to quote some extracts in support of m y statements regarding the position w h i ch obtains in A m e r i c a . first authorit y I will cite is Mr S. Gomper, President of the A m e r i c a n Federation of Labour, who writesBut I do say, and I might say it parenthetically, that I object to the organizations of capital, popularly known as ""trusts,"" when they attempt to interfere with the political affairs of our country, and particularly the Judiciary. I am speaking of them from an industrial, and not from a - commercial, point of view. Mr James D u n c a n , secretary of the GraniteW o r k e r s ' U n i o n , saysIf there were any danger of our labour movement following the course of similar movements American in the older countries, and losing respect for the Government of the country, it would be because the toilers have become cognizant of the fact that from time to time the common people are denied their civil rights, both by what should be popular Government and by the Judiciary ; and kind- Especially that the man with a large bank account is able to get favourable consideration in our Legislatures, and even judicial decisions in his. The argument has favour, because of his wealth. I am not one who believes that the courts are absolutely turned over to the rich and against the poor. I know, however, that in conflicts in which law suits are made part of the controversy, the fact that the rich are better able to carry their cases into court, and to fight for them through welltrained and high-priced attorneys, makes them more confident of getting decisions in their favor. The workers, therefore, do not look upon that form of procedure us containing a great amount of good or justice to them. b it r at i o n Court were Mr M a r t in F o x , President of the Ironmoulders' U n i o n , saysI am strongly of the conviction that, in a country like the United States, where there are so many diverse interests, so many diverse views, and so many instances in which the interests of capital are placed before those of labour, compulsory arbitration is thoroughly impractical, and its principle is thoroughly obnoxious to the American citizen. The citizen cannot afford to lend his assent to any governmental institution which, in the capacity of a court having power to enforce its award, could compel him to submit There to conditions of labour which are obnoxious to hiin, under penalty of fine or loss of liberty.",18
54,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Was the opinion recently expressed ?,18
55,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In there 1901. There are many other instances of the k in d , but I have selected only a f e w for the in for m at i on of the House. Mr . F r a n k Buchanan, President of the Iron workers' U n i o n , Chicago, saysIndeed, the instances are rare of any trade in Chicago calling on the State Board. This is, perhaps, due-first , to the suspicion widely entertained that Boards of Arbitration appointed and representing a political administration have purposes to serve other than that of fair play between The employers and employees; second, because members of such boards are usually strangers to the requirements of the trades in dispute, and theretore cannot exercise the sound judgment in reaching a decision to be had by a board composed of persons connected with the trades. I have often thought that compulsory arbitration enforced by the State would be a good thing, and yet I find few men in the labour movement favourable to it. Why this is so, I cannot say, unless it is because the working-men believe that the courts and the various boards created by the State are generally on the side of capital, and therefore they are afraid to have their interests .adjusted by them. I have put these quotations before the House, in order to show that America and England do not enforce the principle of - compulsory arbitration for reasons that do not exist here.",18
56,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Accordin g to the report of the commission, conciliation in England is - a success.",19
57,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,A very modified success.,19
58,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N, - scarcely think that it can be described as a success in view of the figures which I have just submitted as to the number of strikes that have taken place there.,19
59,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I think that the commission deal with that point.,19
60,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The arbitration - experience which we have gained in connection with the working of the Conciliation - and Arbitration Acts in New Zealand and New South Wales is satisfactory, although in the case of New Zealand perhaps it is not so satisfactory as we might wish it to be, for this reason : In that colony the Act provides for the establishment of boards as well as the court, but very often the only result of taking a case before the Conciliation Board .is that a man suffers much delay, and is put to fruitless expense. The board can decide nothing finally because of the right of appeal to the Court. I think that in that respect also this Bill will be found to be an improvement on the New Zealand law. In determining to change the views which I had held in regard to this matter for so many years, I must confess that I was much swayed by the opinion formed by Mr James Mills, of the Union Steam-ship Company of New Zealand, in regard to the working of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in New Zealand. I am not quite sure, but I am under the impression that he informed me that he was at one time opposed to the Act ; but I know that he told me that, notwithstanding the many minor troubles which he had experienced, the Act, as a whole, had worked so satisfactorily that he would not be without it now in any circumstances. I bad also had some slight experience of the working of the New South Wales Act in connection with the dispute which took plaee at the Southern collieries, and which was settled in 1902. ' I am the chairman of the board of directors of a colliery which was interested in that dispute, and had it not been for the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of New South Wales, I feel satisfied that the Southern collieries would have been plunged into a disastrous strike. We experienced considerable delay, trouble, and annoyance in settling the difficulty, and perhaps I felt as angry as did any one else whilst the dispute lasted; but when, I received the following letter, dated 3rd December, 1902, from Mr . Waley, manager of the Bellambi colliery, I felt much gratified that a strike had been I avoided by the action of the court.",19
61,Mr WATKINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,We should have had another strike in Newcastle this year but for the Act.,19
62,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"So I believe. Mr Waley wroteI confirm wire sent you in reference to the case, The Southern Owners v.. the Miners, as follows :""Arbitration Court award Southern Colleries dispute entirely in owners' favour on all important issues."" I was not pleased simply because of that result. The announcement of course gave me some pleasure; but I was still more gratified to think that a strike, which appeared to be inevitable, had been avoided by the action of the Court.",19
63,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Did the men submit to the decision of the Court t,19
64,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,They submitted loyally.,19
65,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,They have not left the country.,19
66,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"So far as I am aware they have not. I know that our pits are still going ahead. The letter continued The award means a victory for the owners on practically all points, and is just what we wanted. The compromise which we offered the men during the progress of the case was far more liberal in character than the award now. given, and the sliding-scale rate of payment adopted by the Court in the first three clauses is exactly the same as we offered the men when we tried to compromise with them-indeed , before any appeal to the Court was made by the men. In connection with this very trouble, the honourable member for Parramatta asked me one day in this House whether it was true that we had dismissed two men from the colliery because of the fact that they acted as delegates for the men and took part in the inquiry before the Court. I caused inquiries to be made, and I found that no such thing had occurred. The true position was that the men left the employ of the colliery in accordance with the agreement which, they had made, a certain bord having been worked out. They took the matter to the Court, and they also published a letter in the press which was not in accordance with the facts. The Court unanimously decided that they were wrong in publishing the letter, and that the action of the owners of the colliery in dismissing them was perfectly justified. Mr . Smith was a member of the Court, and might naturally have been expected to take the side of the men, but he thoroughly endorsed the view held by the other members of the tribunal. I should like, also, to say that the report by Judge Backhouse, as well as that issued by the Victorian Royal Commission which visited New Zealand for the purpose of inquiring into labour matters there, are both very strong, and any one who reads them must come to the conclusion that we should not lightly oppose this measure. I do not propose to deal with the constitutional question, for I believe that much will be said on ,the point by the legal members of the House. As a layman, however, I venture to state that I am not inclined to agree with the Attorney-General in regard to the power to apply the common rule. If it can be applied, I think it will be manifestly unfair, because employers at a great distance, who have had no opportunity of. taking part in the discussion, may suddenly find themselves bound by an order in connection with the making of which - they have not been heard.",19
67,Mr GLFNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The honourable member is touching the very substance of the Bill .,20
68,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not profess to be a lawyer ; if I require any law I pay for it. Sometimes I take coun- sel's opinion, but if I do not think that it is right I do not accept it. On this occasion I am not going to take the opinion given by the Attorney-General, because I »m strongly under the impression that when the common rule provision comes to be discussed, the honourable and learned gentleman may find it very difficult to carry it. Although I do not intend to say more upon the constitutional point, there are one or two matters to which I should like to direct the consideration of the Attorney-General and the other legal members of the House. It seems to me that; if the Bill is passed, the employers of Victoria, for example, may find themselves under two masters. ""Under the> Factories Act it may be determined that themen employed in a certain trade shall work 48 hours, and be paid 50s. a week. But suppose that in that trade a dispute which t extends beyond the limits of the State, arises, and the Federal Court intervenes, and decides, that the men shall work 45 hours and shall be paid 47s. 6d. per week, upon which ruling are the employers to act 1 P see nothing in the measure to determine that an order of the Federal Court shall overrule that of the Victorian Court. Then in the interpretation clause I find that""Industrial dispute"" means a dispute in relationto industrial matters arising between an employer or an organization of employers on the one part and an organization of employees on the other part. While a "" strike ""Includes the cessation of work by a body of employees acting in combination as a means of i'nf orcing compliance wi th demands made by them, or other employees on employers. Those definitions apply to disputes between employers and employees, but apparently do not apply to what are termed Demarcation Disputes by which employers suffer loss from, disputes between the men themselves. An instance arising within my own experiencemay perhaps make my meaning clearer to the House. The Peregrine, a vessel belonging to Messrs. W . Howard Smith and Sons, waslaid up for overhaul, and Messrs. Robison Bros, contracted to effect certain repairs. At the. same time, the vessel's chief engineerwas overhauling the boilers and engines, and he instructed his fireman to draw and clean the condensor tubes. The engineers who were working for Messrs. Robison Bros, said that that was part of their work, and when the chief engineer of the vessel said that it was not, the shoremen struck. TheKalgoorlie, a vessel belonged to the firm of Messrs. Mcllwraith, MCEacharn, an.d Co.,. was then being overhauled by Messrs. Robison Bros., and although there was no dispute in reference to her, the shoremen employed on board struck work out of sympathy with the shoremen on board thePeregrine. J. do not see any provision in the Bill, unless it be in clause 91, to meet such a case, and, in my opinion, that clause does not do so, because of the interpretation of industrial disputes and strikes which I have already read.",20
69,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The New South WalesCourt has dealt with cases of that kind. Siv MALCOLM MCEACHARN - A strike of that nature might possibly spread from one State to another, and therefore I think that the Attorney-General should make a note of the point - The right honourable member for South Australia stated that the need of the Bill is principally for the protection of those engaged in maritime pursuits. It is intended chiefly, he said, to deal with maritime matters, and therefore I do not think I shall be wearying the House if I give honourable members some information as to the importance of the Australian shipping trade. Whilst I shall have something to say later on as to the position of the right honourable gentleman, 1, as a ship-owner, feel that, whether we do or do not desire protection, we are under an obligation to him for having such' a regard to our interest. The position requires consideration from both the shipowners' and the seamen's point of view.",20
70,Mr CONROY,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I hope that if there is a rise of 20 per cent, the workmen will get it all.",21
71,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not know that they would if the honourable and learned member were, an employer. The figures which I am about to read are as condensed as possible, and although it is most difficult to obtain accurate information in regard to the shipping trade, since no statistics are kept by the Customs Department, I think that they are a fair approximation of the real position.",21
72,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Does not each shipping firm keep its own statistics 1,21
73,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes ; but each firm desires to keep them to itself. It is undesirable in any trade, and especially in the shipping trade, to be too ready to give information about one's own business, and my friends may think I am giving a little too much information now. But, inasmuch as the Minister for Home Affairs was desirous of posting himself upon this - subject, and I had given him certain information, I thought it better to take the wind out of his sails by supplying these figures myself. I estimate the steam tonnage engaged upon the coastal trade of Australia at 190,000 tons. Mr Coghlan's estimate differs from mine, but he includes lines like that of - Bethel Gwynne in the Australian trade, Messrs. Currie's steamers, which do not trade on the coast, and Holt's line. I put down the value of the vessels at £3,000,000. That includes shore plant and other things, which belong to the shipping business, but the value of which is not actually in thesteamers themselves. The earnings, including lighterage, towage, and the small coastal trade I estimate at from £2,LJ00,000' to £2,300,000 per annum. I put down theexpenditure on wages at sea and in shore establishments, and wages arising out of repairs, at £1,1(0,000 to £1,200,000. That istheamountpaidbytheAustralianship-ownersto the local wages' fund. The provisions,, the supply of which gives rise to a large amount of employment, I put down asworth £360,000 per annum. Then we have the coal that is consumed and the labour in connection therewith, the dues, thestaff, insurance, renewals and repairs, and all the other items - with which it is now unnecessary to deal. The number of seamen and firemen employed in the steamers 'owned by the members of the federated steam-ship owners-leavin g out those engaged in theriver, bay, and small coastal trade- I estimate at 1,750.",21
74,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,What about the coal 1,21
75,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I cannot give particulars in regard to the coal, which is, however, a heavy item. I had to obtain these figures very hurriedly, and some of them. I was supplied with only yesterday.",21
76,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Is the New Zealand trade included ?,21
77,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The figures I am giving are exclusive of theNew Zealand trade.,21
78,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable member is dealing only with the .Australian coastal, trade ?",21
79,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Yes .,21
80,Mr THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,How many of the seamen employed are foreigners ?,21
81,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"That I am not able to tell the honourable member, but I do not think there are many foreigners employed in the Australian coastal trade. The officers, stewards, dec, I estimate at 2,500, bringing the total number employed up to 4,250. I estimate the others employed in the smaller trade at about 1,750.",21
82,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,What is the smaller trade ?,21
83,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The river, bay, and small coastal trade. The honourable member for West Sydney has kindly supplied me with the number of wharf labourers employed on the Australasian coast; and that number I find is 11,787. Roughly speaking, the number of men employed in the Australian shipping trade is 16,787. That figure, of course, does not include the enormous number of persons who are employed as carters, and in the various small vocations which arise from the shipping trade. I should now like to quote some figures from * series of articles which originally appeared in the Age newspaper, and have been published in pamphlet form under the title A Mercantile Marine for Australasia: An Urgent Necessity. That pamphlet compares the wages paid by the Australian ship-owners with those paid by the P. and O. Company, the Orient Company, and Norddeutscher Lloyd Company. Without going into details as to how the figures have been arrived at, I show in the following - extract a comparison of the wages paid:A comparative statement of one steamer owned by each intercolonial company employed in the AVest Australian passenger trade shows that the .averages are as follows :Total Extra Wajres Paid per annum on all Intercolonial Weat Australian Passenger Steamers. On the basis of Harloo, over and above ... 10,455 13,262 19,330 On the basis of Kalgoorlie, over and above 10,945 13,610 19,522 On the basis of PUbarra, over and above - ... 8,278 10,650 17,950 On the basis of Odbo, over and above ... 11,456 13,44.3 18,896 On the basis of Ani/lian, over and above ... 11,379 14,016 19,363 On the basis of Perth, over and above ... 7,352 Average one-sixth ... 9,977 12,299 18,461 The above comparisons, taking all the steamers employed by intercolonial ship-owners in the West Australian passenger trade, viz.:-Not only the before-mentioned but also the WMowra, Paroo. Coolgardie. and Nemesis, details of which it is not necessary to take out. and which have been approximately averaged, give the following result:Total extra wages paid by intercolonial ship-owners on their West Australian passenger steamers over and above Omrah is approximately, per annum as above... Total extra wages paid by intercolonial ship-owners on their West Australian passenger steamers over and above Himalaya is approximately, per annum, as above Total extra wages paid by intercolonial ship-owners on their West Australian passenger steamers over and above Prie'lrich der Grosse is approximately, per annum, as above £18,461 These are very important figures, and any one who desires to read up the question could not do better than study this pamphlet, the figures of which, although they were compiled some years ago, still apply. Mr L . E . GnoOAr - The proportion is applicable at the present time.",21
84,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That is so.,22
85,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The figures as to the hands employed are altogether different from those in Coghlart.,22
86,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I looked at Coghlan only this morning, and I find that he includes all thesailing ships, with which, however, I am not dealing. I think that, Coghlan gives a great deal more tonnage to the coastal sailing ships than ought to be given, and that his statistics in this respect are very unreliable. I do not say that my figures are thoroughly reliable, because it is extremely difficult to get abso£ £ £ lutely correct information on these points.",22
87,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In Coghlan some of the tonnage is counted twice-onc e in, and once out.",22
88,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I believe that is so. I think, however, that Cog/dan, in regard to the Australian steam tonnage, is fairly correct, his figure being 203,000 tons, as against my*'estimate 8,816 15,707 of 190,000 tons. The officers' wages paid on the coastal steamers are much in excess 59,865 73,797 110,768 of those paid on the steamers jf the three lines I have mentioned, except in one instance. The P. and O. Company pay their first officers £ 1 7 a month, as against £ 1 5 or £ 1 6 , in accordance with the class of vessel, paid in the Australian coastal trade.",22
89,Mr THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,What about the captains' pay 1,22
90,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I have not given the captains' pay, which in the three lines I have mentioned varies in accordance with the period they have been in the service. That is very natural; be... £9,977 cause the captains in the employ of the over-sea companies have much larger vessels to command; but I think that the pay of Australian captains in the smaller vessels compares very favourably. Australian sea... £12,299 men's wages are £ 6 10s. per month, as against £ 4 5s. paid on the P. and 0. steamers to white sailors.",22
91,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Is that the pay afc which the men ship in England 1,23
92,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes . On the Orient Company's vessels the pay of seamen is £ 4 per month, and on the Norddeutscher vessels, £2.17s. In the Australian coastal trade, firemen are paid £ 8 10s. per month, and we may assume that right through firemen are paid £ 2 per month more than are the seamen. In the P . and 0. service, firemen are p a i d £ l 4s. a month ; on the Orient vessels £ 4 10s., and on the Norddeutscher vessels £ 3 10s. In th« Australian coastal trade ordinary seamen ftre paid £ 2 per month, while the Orient Company pay £ 2, the P. and O. Company 13s. 4d., and the Norddeutscher Lloyd £ 1 7s. In excess of the wages, the £ 6 10s. for seamen and the £ 8 10s. for firemen employed on the coast, there is overtime, which amounts, roughly speaking, to £ 1 5s. per month for seamen, and about £ 1 per month for firemen. The amount varies in different vessels. No overtime is paid to the seamen employed in over-sea boats. I think that it might be interesting to honourable members if I indicated the way in which seamen's wages have fluctuated during the last ten years. In 1893, after the great strike, the seamen received £ 5 per month. They were previously being paid £ 7 per month. In 1897 their pay was increased to £ 6 per month, and the' firemen were paid a correspondingly higher rate, namely, £ 8 . In 1900 the rates were increased to £ 6 10s. and £ 8 10s., and in 1901 to £ 7 and £ 9 . In February, 1903, they were reduced to £ 6 10s. and £ 8 10s. The overtime was in all cases as I have stated. I think every honourable member will agree that these wages are higher than those paid in any part of the world.",23
93,Mr EWING,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Would the honourable member give us some idea of the effects of the competition of over-sea steamers upon the local ship-owners ?,23
94,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It is very difficult to arrive at a close calculation of the effects of the competition of over-sea steamers with the Inter-State boats ; but' I should think that the Inter-State traffic carried by over-sea steamers around the whole of the Australian coast, would represent not less than 100,000, and perhaps as much as £125,000 per annum. That is. to say, if the local ship-owners were not exposed to the competition of over-sea steamers, they would carry more traffic tcthe extent of, say, £125,000 per annum.",23
95,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The traffic on the over-sea steamers is almost purely passenger traffic.,23
96,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes , , the amount of cargo carried by the over-sea steamers is very small. That would be £125,000 out of a total trade of £2,250,000. or £2,300,000. The Western Australian, trade represents a very large proportion of that which is taken from us by the over-sea boats. I observe that the Minister for Home Affairsis glorying in that fact, but he is considering the interests of Western Australia only, whereasj I think, we should look at the matter from a national point of view.",23
97,Mr A MCLEAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The Minister is goingto "" walk into "" the Inter-State steam-ship owners.",23
98,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Hehas "" walked into"" us in every direction. When I went to see him I was received very kindly, but wherever he showed me that anything was being done in Western Australia, ruin stared me in the face. He was building a breakwaterand dock at Fremantle, that would take away the Albany trade of the steam-shipowners. He was also opening out the Collie coal-fields- I admit. that he gave me an opportunity of joining in that enterprise, and that I missed my chance-so that the people of Western Australia might havetheir own coal supplied, and thus be independent of that which was obtained from the Eastern States. Wherever I went I found the right honourable gentleman doingall he could to injure the ship-owner, and now he intends to make a further attack upon us. I should think that of the£125,000 of trade which is lost to us every year, fully £100,000 is represented by Western Australian trade, and inasmuch asour total trade with Western Australia amounts to only about £200,000 ; the mail steamers are virtually taking away half our trade. ' I think that is the right way for the right honourable gentleman to look at the matter.",23
99,Mr SAWERS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The trade taken from the local steam-ship owners is almost entirely passenger traffic ,23
100,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Yes .,23
101,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That shows that we need a railway.,23
102,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do - not want a railway, so far as competition with the shipping trade is concerned ; I do not say what my views would be from another stand-point.",24
103,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,How does the .honourable member travel when he goes to Western Australia ?,24
104,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I should generally pay the higher rate when I which is very seldom. Let me say, in nexion with this matter, that there is steamer on this coast belonging to the A . U . S . N . Company which is larger better than any of the "" jubilee"" boats of the P. and 0. fleet.",24
105,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Why ' did not three the honourable member wait for her "" Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN - cause she was not out here. The Kanowna has only recently arrived here, and I have not visited Western Australia for the last six or seven years. I do not travel by mail steamers because I am afraid to jny own boats, or because I would not be well treated upon them.",24
106,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Is ern Australia sufficiently isolated without making her position worse t,24
107,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not want to isolate Western Australia, X am giving honourable members information which shows the extent to which our trade is being interfered with by oversea vessels.",24
108,Sir JOHNFOKREST,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"If the passenger trade between the eastern States and Western Australia is worth £200,000 per annum, there are very good prospects for a railwav.",24
109,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I did not know that I was going to help the right honourable gentleman in his railway scheme. I hope that he will not attack us too strongly in regard to the matter now before - us. Regarding the position of the seamen at the present time, I may point out that the existing agreement is an old one renewed, and that it resulted from a meeting held in December, 1902, at which time the seamen agreed to a reduction of 10s. per month. The ship-owners asked for a reduction of £ 1 . The agreement contained - this clauseIf the state of the ship-owners' trade is such as to warrant a further reduction, the delegates of the Seamen's Union will meet the representatives of the Steam-ship Owners' Federation in June next, or as may be mutually arranged, for purpose of demonstrating this, but failing any agreement as to a reduction, the agreement now entered upon shall be continued until 31st January, 1904. So that although the ship-owners have been able to demonstrate that the trade would warrant a reduction, the seamen's l'epresentatives have not agreed to the change. First of all they desired that that request be withdrawn, and then they stated go, that' they would communicate with the conmembers of the union and give us their a reply. That reply has not yet been received. Some short time before the right and honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, resigned his position as a Minister, I was asked two or times whether there was any prospect of a strike amongst the seamen. - B e - I said that I had not heard of it, and I could not find anybody who had. We had received no threat. At a later date-as o before the retirement from office of the late the Minister for Trade and Customs- I was go in asked whether the steam-ship owners as were disposed to extend the agreement for a further period of six months until the nob WestNavigation Bill could be submitted to this House. I replied that, speaking for myself, I had no objection to an extension of the agreement, and that I would consult the but steam-ship owners upon the matter. I saw some of them. They had no desire to take .any advantage of the seamen upon a point of this kind, and said that they would be glad to consider a formal request from them. That is the position at the present time. I understand, however, not only from' personal conversation, but from the fact that a delegate has notified the President of the Steam-ship Owners Association to the same effect, that they are determined to abstain from making any such application, the reason given being that they have no desire to place the late Minister for Trade and Customs in any difficulty. Further, one of the delegates-tw o of them being present at the interview-state d in the presence of myself and another outside of this Chamber, that he would rather see the wages of the seamen reduced, to £ 3 per month than do anything which would place the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, in any difficulty.",24
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Who said this ? Sir. MALCOLMMCEACHARN - A delegate of the Seamen's Union, in the the presence of another delegate and a friend of my own. There are members of this - House who can confirm my statement, because they have approached the representatives of the seamen with a view to induce them to forward an official application to the ship-owners. Shorty before the retirement from office of the Minister for Trade and Customs, I requested a member of this House to communicate with Mr Guthrie, asking him if he would apply for an extension of the agreement, at the same time stating my views upon the matter. I know that Mr Guthrie was communicated with, because a telegram was received here upon the Friday on which the Minister for Trade and Customs resigned his position, stating that he was leaving Adelaide for Melbourne on that day. That telegram was despatched at about twelve o'clock. At three o'clock on the same afternoon Mr . Guthrie received a telegram from the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr . Kingston, stating that he had resigned his position in the Ministry, in consequence of being unable to afford the seamen the protection which he had promised them. ' Mr KINGSTON - That is a fact.",24
111,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I hope that whatever statements I may make will relate to matters of fact. I feel that no trouble whatever would have arisen if consideration of this matter had been deferred for a few days. Had the telegram to which I have referred not been despatched, the seamen would have approached the ship-owners, and the latter would have recognised the position. I admit that the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, during the course of his speech, stated the case very fairly.' I think that if there were any ground for fearing that a strike would occur that fear will be dissipated by the passage of the Bill .",25
112,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,In its present form ?,25
113,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I think so. Under this Bill , strikes are prohibited, and therefore the seamen could not strike. I will, however, grant that the right honourable member was correct in his contention in regard to one matter, in which he desired to protect the seamen. He was correct in arguing that if the ship-owners as a body applied to the court which will be constituted under this Bill for a reduction of the wages of the seamen, they would be able to put forward in support of their action the competition to which they are subjected by steamers carrying crews who are paid lower wages.",25
114,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,As they have done.,25
115,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I am assuming that the steamship owners made an application to the Court which will be established under this Bill .,25
116,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The lower paid competition is the argument for the threatened and desired reduction of the seamen's wages.,25
117,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I quite grant what the right honourable member says. The argument which he used is perfectly correct. He himself declared that if he were a member of the Court, and such an application was put forward by the shipowners, he would be bound to support a reduction of that competition.",25
118,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,There is no com-. petition. The passenger rates are higher.,25
119,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I can show that in some cases they are lower.,25
120,Mr FOWLER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,For how many years has this competition continued?,25
121,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"F o r a great many years. But I am not arguing on the question of the competition which exists. I am merely endeavouring to unravel a difficulty, and to show that there is no fear of any trouble arising so far as the shipping trade is concerned.",25
122,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It is not only the fear of a strike that we have to consider; we have cause to fear a reduction of wages.,25
123,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I . have granted that the light honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, put the position very fairly. He said he had occasion to fear a reduction in the wages of the seamen in consequence of the shipowners having declared-thoug h not in the way that is generally understood-that , if this competition continued, they, would have to apply to the Court for a reduction. I grant all that, whether or not I agree with the contention. My only desire is to get out the truth.",25
124,Mr WATKINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Coul d a reduction take place if that agreement were extended ?,25
125,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No . I immediately saw the difficulty, and I agreed not to take any unfair advantage of the men. There is no ship-owner whoentertains a desire to do so. Although the ship-owners require an official application by the representatives of the seamen for an extension of the agreement, there is. not one of them-eve n including those - who object to this Bill , and who may be opposed to the Navigation Bill-wh o will not do what is fair to the seamen. I think that the ship-owners are quite as able to realise what is fair as are the men themselves. I Am thoroughly satisfied that none of the ship-owners would object to an extension - of the existing agreement",25
126,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Until the Navigation is passed ?,26
127,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I am perfectly prepared to extend it for six months.,26
128,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Does the honourable member argue that our own seamen should be subjected to this legislation, and that the foreigner should go free ?",26
129,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,No - at all.,26
130,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Nobod y could argue it.,26
131,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"So - far as the clause relating to British seamen matter ? .is concerned, I should not object to its being eliminated altogether.",26
132,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The honourable member has shown that there is not much in it.,26
133,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"T h honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, is naturally - quick at drawing deductions from figures; and I am convinced that, if he considers the - statistics which I have submitted, he say that there is a great deal in them. I - should have been glad to aee the Navigation Bill introduced, simultaneously measure which is now under discussion. Possibly, honourable members may wonder why I do not support the right honourable and learned member for South Ausable tralia, Mr Kingston, in his desire to insert in this measure clauses dealing with the shipping industry. I think I have made out a case for the position which he has taken up so far as the ship-owners and seathe men are concerned. At the same time, feel that if these navigation clauses were serted in this Bill, the ship-owners would be - committing themselves to a Navigation B I prefer not to commit myself to approving of legislation of that characteruntil measure dealing with it is before me. Indeed, I do not know whether all the owners are not entirely opposed to this B I am not sure that I do not stand alone amongst them in the attitude which I adopt. At all events, they hold the that they ought not to commit themselves or the seamen to a Navigation Bill, by including in the measure under discussion clauses relating to the shipping industry. There is one other matter to which I must refer, and that is the statement made by the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, that in framing this measure he desired to act fairly to both sides. I am sorry that I cannot say that Bill he evinced that desire. If he had been anxious to treat both sides with impartiality surely instead of sending draft copies of the measure only to the delegates of the Seamen's Union, he would have consulted the ship-owners or other employers 1 He did not do so. Tom Mann, although not a Member of Parliament, found it possible to obtain a draft copy of the measure, but so t far as I am aware, no Member of Parliament received one.",26
134,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Did the honourable member hear what I said in regard to the,26
135,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Yes . The right honourable member made a point of 'the fact that he had indicated to the leader of the Opposition that he would e give an opportunity to some honourable member on that side of the House to see very a draft copy of the Bill .,26
136,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I did not say that I had handed a copy of the Bill to any member of will the Opposition. What I said was that I had offered to submit the Bill for suggestion to any honourable member whom the leader with the of the Opposition might name.,26
137,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The r e is no difference between us in regard to that point. But the fact that the right honour and learned member offered to submit a draft copy of the measure to a member of the Opposition makes the position ten times worse. He was prepared to submit a draft eopy of the Bill to an honourable member of Opposition,* but he did not give honorI able members on the Government side of in the House an opportunity of seeing it.",26
138,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The organizai l l . tions rather than Members of Parliament should have been allowed to see draft the copies of the Bill .,26
139,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I shipagree with the honourable member. But ill . was any member of the Opposition interested in the proposals to be embodied in this measure to a greater extent than were view honourable members on this side of the House? I think that the right honourable and learned member made out an extremely bad case. Much as I admired his impassioned utterances in dealing with the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I feel that he gave the House very little information. T anticipated that he would throw some light upon the constitutional question in regard to which he had differed from the remaining members of the Cabinet; but he did not do so; and I must say that I prefer to take the opinion of the other members of the Ministry to that held by one honourable member. I can assure the House that it was hot until I had given the whole question grave consideration that I determined to adopt an attitude in regard to this measure which I knew would be severely criticised by those with whom I have been most intimately associated. I am naturally placed in a difficulty in breaking away, on this important issue, from so many of those who in the past have been my warmest supporter's. But, as I said at the outset of my address, if there be any means by which to avoid strikes, I am not - going to be fearful of trying the remedy. The principle involved is too important to permit any one, when dealing with it, to consider his friends. I am not satisfied that many of those who are agitating against this Bill are not quite sure, of the attitude which was adopted by the employers in New South Wales in 1901, in regard to the Industrial and Arbitration Act passed in that State. I have a cutting from the Sydney Daily Telegraph, dated 11 th October, 1901, relating to themeasure in trod uced by Mr Wise. Under the headings of ""Views of the Employers:"" ""Support the Object of the .Bill,"" it is stated thatA circular has been sent to each member of the Legislative Council, explaining to them the attitude of the employers' representatives in regard to the Industrial Arbitration Bill now before the Hoiihe. The circular was issued on behalf of the following associations and firms:-The Pastoralists Union of New South Wales, the Chamber of Manufactures, Colliery Owners' Association, Stevedores' Association, Colonial Sugar Company Limited, Master Builders' Association, Brickmakers' Association, Moi-t's Dock Company Limited, Stock Owners' Association, and the Steam-ship Owners' Association. I shall refer later on to the position of the Steam-ship Owners' Association. The extract continuesIt is stilted in the circular that, after having had several meetings in regard to the Bill, the joint opinions of the abovefirmsare as follow :With the aims and objects of the Bill as introduced by Mr Wise-viz. , the prevention of industrial warfare in the shape of strikes and lockouts, which have in the past had such disastrous effects on the industries of the State and all concerned therein-the employers of labour are entirely in sympathy. The principle of settling these disputes by arbitration has also their cordiaL endorsement, but the wisdom of applying compulsion thereto remains to be proved. With the view to making the Act more equitable to all parties, they suggest certain amendments, bub even as the Bill now stands it is immeasurably superiov, in their opinion, to that rejected by the Legislative Council last year. These firms and associations then proceeded to make certain suggestions as to the amendment of the Bill, and I am surprised to find that one of the suggestions made by them-wit h which I do not agree-wa s that employees of the State should be brought under the Bill .",26
140,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Does the honourable member argue from these facts that the firms and associations named werein favour of the Bill 1,27
141,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I draw no inference from the circular. I simply place the facts before the House.. I am referring not to the Bill, but to theprinciple involved. We find that, after carefully considering the provisions in the New South Wales measure, these employers made no intimation in the circular that they opposed even the principle of compulsion. On the contrary, they approved of the general principle, but said that "" the - wisdom of applying - compulsion theretoremains to be proved."" Subsequently the Steam-ship Companies presented a petition to the Legislative Council in opposition to the measure.",27
142,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"As a matter of fact, all the organizations named in thecircular to which reference has been made opposed the Bill .",27
143,Mr THOMSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The circular was prepared after the Bill had passed the Legislative Assembly.,27
144,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,T e s . If they opposed the Bill I presume that they opposed it when it was before the Legislative Assembly.,27
145,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,And they were subsequently converted.,27
146,Sir MALCOLM MCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Yes,27
147,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,- Does the honourable member say that the position indicated in the circular shows that they were converted 1,27
148,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do. 'They may have opposed some of the clauses, but they gave a distinct approval to the principle of the Bill, and that is the point with which I am dealing. As I have - already mentioned, the Steam-ship Companies subsequently petitioned the Legislative Council against the passing of the Bill . They - opined that the Act was dangerous and experimental ; that it would paralyze enterprise, which would be harassed and restricted; that investment would be prevented; that industries would languish, and so forth. In any case the petitioners - considered that the passing of the Bill would be a hasty, and superfluous action, as the Federal Government had announced their intention of introducing legislation on the subject. Although they ma)' have opposed portions of that particular Bill , they evidently anticipated action by the Federal Parliament, and that was the chief reason for their opposition to the New South ""Wales Bill. Under clause 23 the members of the Court are to be appointed for a term of seven years. I think that is too long.",28
149,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It will be too long if the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Koovong is agreed to.,28
150,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I hope that it will be carried; but even if it is not, I do not see why the term of office - should be seven years, when in New Zealand it is only three years.",28
151,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It will be much more diffitheir cult in the larger area of the Commonwealth for members to be re-elected.,28
152,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I do not think that it will be any more difficult.,28
153,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,We want our Judges to be quite impartial. They should not always be thinking of their chances of re-election.,28
154,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I do not refer to the Judge. <,28
155,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The members of the Court .iire practically Judges.,28
156,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I sayswould give the Judge a long term of office, but, as this is experimental legislation, I do not think we should appoint the members of the Court for so long a term as seven - years. Speaking as an employer, I do not know any one who would be ready to take tip the various duties which will be cast"" upon --members of the Court, and no doubt the employees will be in a similar position.",28
157,Mr SAWERS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Would not a short term of office be likely to encourage partisanship 1,28
158,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not think so. We must suppose that the men appointed will act .fairly. Under clause 50, awards are to be made for any term not exceeding five years, whereas, under clause 107, industrial agreements . may last for only three, years.",28
159,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"But an award may be varied, if necessary, before the end of the five years.",28
160,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"That is so, but I do not see why, as an industrial agreement is limited to three years, an award should endure for five years.",28
161,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,T t does not matter' how long the award lasts if it can be varied during its term ,28
162,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not admit that. My position is different from that of those who see their way clear ahead of them. This is experimental legislation, and I should like to see matters dealt with definitely in the Bill , rather than trust to future events. The honourable member for Bland has referred to the provisions of clauses 63 and 75, which deal with the representation of parties before the Court. I am very pleased to find that he is opposed to the employment of barristers and solicitors in these cases. Very few questions of law are concerned in them, and if the parties are compelled to state own cases, they will be able to do so from a thorough knowledge of all the facts, whereas if lawyers are brought in, technical points will be raised, the parties are likely to get their backs up, and settlement will be delayed. I think, too, that there is something in the suggestion that those who have the longest purses and are able to procure the best lawyers will generally win. On this subject the Royal Commissioner appointed by the Government of New South Wales to inquire into the working of compulsory conciliation and arbitration laws As I have pointed out, unless all consent, the parties cannot so appear before the boards or. Court. Rarely is the consent given,, and it may be said that they are not allowed. As ftir as I saw, . their interests did not suffer. The cases which I heard were ably conducted by representatives of both sides. All the points were clearly brought out, and sufficient material provided for the Court to come to an equitable decision. In speaking to one of the Judges, I - asked whether it would be an improvement, in his - opinion, to allow counsel to appear. His 1 WHS significant: ""It depends upon",28
163,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"He a r , hear.",29
164,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not think that it does. I think that lawyers should be excluded in cases merely business matters are in dispute. The. Victorian Royal Commission appointed to investigate and. report on the operation of the Factories and Shops Law of New .Zealand deals with the same subject in termsOn the whole we found a distinct unwillingness on the part of the employers and employed to permit barristers or solicitors to before the Boards or the Court on behalf of parties to disputes. Instances were cited where proceedings under the Principal Act had unduly protracted by the endeavours of counsel to cover a great deal of ground in argument, dwell too much on technical points. Amending Act of last year, therefore, which bids the appearance of any lawyer nals (save by consent) unless he is personally interested in the dispute, as an employer or worker, - may be accepted as the result of the clearly extions 1 pressed opinion of the general public on the question. The reasons are not far to seek. The which in many cases seem to be inseparable from legal procedure, strike at the very root main advantages claimed by the advocates these' trade tribunals, viz., a prompt and tinuous hearing once the case is begun, speedy settlement of the matters at issue, after - eliminating everything but the essential requisite for a just award. Further, the bill costs, although not of so much moment to - company or association of employers, as the wuge-carning classes which form the workers' unions, is looked .at askance by both Whatever aid may be occasionally sought lawyers in the preparation of appeal cases, does not appear to be any likelihood of alteration - in the existing practice, which is to confine legal advocacy to coses concerning breaches of the Act, selves were a close corporation. - and to rely upon the direct representatives the parties to a dispute to conduct all cases, whether conciliation or arbitration sought. . Mr DEAKIN - The experience of - Justice Cohen, of New South ""Wales, exactly the reverse of that.",29
165,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I have every respect for Mr Justice Cohen. One could not have, in the main, a better man as an arbitrator, but-as was pointed out by the leader of the labour partythere are reasons why he should hold that view. I do not agree with him, however, and I hope that the leader of the labour party will move an amendment barristers and solicitors from appearing. If he does not do so I shall.",29

168,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The where honourable and learned member for Corio interjected last week, when the subject was being discussed, that the lawyers are the saviours of the weak. I am inclined to think, however, that they would keep these these disputes going for weeks, and, as I have shown, would be more likely to win cases for the strong.",29

I have touched lightly upon been the common rule, and there is one other and point to which I should like to refer, the The preference given to trades unionists by forsection 65. I am not at all disposed to before tribusupport that provision.",29
171,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Not under any condi,29
172,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Not delays, under any conditions. If unionists are to of the receive a preference, great care must be of taken in the supervision of the rules of their conorganizations. I have had some bitter exand periences in this matter. The honourable points and learned member for West Sydney on of one occasion, when I had to stand firm, in a strong tervened for the men, and agreed that I it is to was not taking an unreasonable attitude. sides. The case to which I refer occurred at from Albany. The wages which were being paid there were far in excess of any that have ever been paid on the coast, and the men themThey of would not allow a man-of-war to take in ordinary coal with her own men, and struck when is such an attempt was made, although they had not sufficient men to carry out the Mr work. The ship-owners on the coast were isharassed to such an extent, because the union would not take in new men to assist them, that we had to register a union of our own under the Western Australian Act. That case shows that unless great care is taken, we may put a rod into the hands of the unions, not for themselves, because they - will break down under their own weight, but for the employers.",29
173,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The conditions under the preventing Bill will be different.,29
174,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Thos e men could have been cited before the court.,29
175,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"If they had been taken away from Albany, ten or fifteen vessels would have been delayed, and inconvenience and loss would have occurred.",30
176,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The men could have been compelled to go 6n with their work in the meantime.,30
177,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It is very difficult to compel men to keep to their work, and I know of many cases in which they have refused to do so, and we have been powerless to compel .them. I have been recommended by a lawyer to bring them before a court, but I have not thought it worth the trouble. In New Zealand, in 1900, the number of workers in industrial trades was 48,938, and the number of unionists only 26,000, while in .December, 1901, the number of workers was 57,098, while the number of unionists was only 23,769. So that the members of the unions were actually reduced in number between 1900 and 1901 by over 2,000. Why should we legislate to give a preference to unionists, when it has been shown in the case of New Zealand that more than one-half of the employees are non-unionists?",30
178,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The unionists do not the preference.,30
179,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I know that it is left to the discretion of the Judge in certain cases, but in some trades the preference is given to unionists.",30
180,Mr CAMERON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It will be given under the Bill .,30
181,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That is why I am raising an objection.,30
182,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The Bill provides that the court by its award may direct that a preference shall be given to unionists.,30
183,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not regard that as a desirable provision, and I shall certainly vote against it. In some instances in New Zealand, in which two men, one being a unionist and the other a non-unionist, had applied for the same position, the employer has been allowed to exercise his own choice.",30
184,Mr CAMERON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Unde r the Bill it will be compulsory upon the court to give preference to unionists.,30
185,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The provision is that the court ""may"" direct that a preference shall be given.",30
186,Sir MALCOLMMCEACHARN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I understood that thecourt would be compelled to give a preference, but in any case I should rather see the provision excised f roin. the Bill . I have endeavoured to show why I have arrived at a conclusion so contrary to that which my actions in the past would have seemed to indicate. I feel that thereasons I have given are good ones. I have given every consideration to the matter, and have made full inquiry, not only during the last two or three years, but for many years past. If the Bill is amended in the directions I have indicated, it will bewell worth adopting as an experiment, because the prevention of one strike would justify the passing of such a measure. At any rate I believe that in supporting it I am studying the best interests of humanity.",30
187,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N," This Bill will undoubtedly become historical. A member of the Ministry has resigned his office, because he considered the Bill - did not go farenough, and because he was not prepared as a Minister to bring forward a measure with which he was not thoroughly in accord. Now we have the honourable member for Melbourne, who is an influential member of the Ship-owners' Federation, supporting the Bill , and I feel sure that the attitudewhich he has assumed towards the meaget sure will have great weight, not only in this Chamber, but outside. The honourable member for Melbourne told us that he had changed his opinion. He hashad keen struggles with the labour organizations, and now he tells us that, in order tosave the community the great loss involved in strikes, and to avert the suffering tohumanity which results from conflicts between workmen and their employers, he has decided to support the measure. The honourable member for Melbourne questioned whether his old friends would recognise him after his speech today, but I do not think he need have any concern on that score, because he must have the approval of his own conscience in doing that which he believes will be best for the Commonwealth. The honourable member wishes to limit theterm for which the Bill shall operate, on the ground that it is experimental in itscharacter, but I would point out that nearly all our legislation in the early days of theFederation must be, to a large extent, experimental. He suggests that the Bill shall be passed subject to a limitation of five years. But I think that the honourable member may safely allow it to pass subject only to the ordinary process of repeal. The opponents of this measure urge-that it will have a tendency to drive away capital, that it will increase the prices commodities, that it will cause ill-feeling between employers and employees, and that it will interfere with the liberty of subject. I propose to deal with these jections from the point of view of one represents a district which contains some of answer to the the most powerful labour organizations Australia, covering all branches of the engineering and ship-building trades, various other occupations, and as one is able to speak with considerable experience - of the relations existing between labour capital, and of the legislationi n New South Wales. Most of the opponents of the B'.ll have contended that it is the prerogative of the British employer to be the master of his own business, and that State should not interfere for the purpose regulating it. Some of the opponents of measure appear to be prepared to return the old days of savagery when might right, but right was not might. History shows us that in England, long before thing was ever heard of arbitration or ciliation, legislation was passed from time time to restrict employers in the control their businesses. We know of the Statute of Labourers, the Statute of Apprentices, - and the Spittalfields Acts. Those attempted to do what we are now trying accomplish for Australia upon a more comconcerned prehensive scale. It is true that they not provide f©r the appointment of special Courts, but the employers had to submit the decisions of magistrates with regard the conditions upon which they employed, their assistants. With regard to the objecthe tion that legislation of this kind will the effect of driving away capital, I to quote the experience obtained in .Zealand. Judge Backhouse, who was apState pointed by the New South Wales Government to inquire into the working of the Arbitration Act in New Zealand, in course of a lengthy report said that only one man among all the employers were questioned-and the inquiry was f and comprehensive-wa s ready to go to the old condition of affairs. He said tihat he had heard grave rumours to efteet that capital had been frightened of the country, but that he found that after disputes which vitally affected certain tries had been settled by the' Arbitration Court, a great amount of capital was vested in those industries. That was report, not of a labour leader, or of a tradesof union organizer, but of a gentleman who was specially appointed to make inquiries, and obtain information for the guidance of the the New South Wales Government. The obstatement made by Judge Backhouse, who appears to me to afford a sufficient objection raised on in that score. The honourable member for Melbourne said that he had always treated . and his men in a humane manner, and I believe who him. I know that there are many masters who do so, and in regard to whom employee's and are perfectly prepared to waive arbitration. Just as we have the new unionism, so we have the new capitalism, and the employers are now represented to a far greater degree than formerly by large joint stock companies the whose entry into the industrial world has of made the labour problem all the more acute. the The instincts of individuals may be humane, to but as members of joint stock companies was their main concern is to see tliab the manager grinds out a dividend for them anyevery year. In Great Britain satisfactory conrelations between employers and workmen to have in many cases existed for hundreds of of years, and the most amicable feeling has been shown for several generations. In such cases there is a certain amount Acts of sympathy between master and man, to but where large joint stock companies are the position is entirely changed. did We are told that if the conditions of the workers are improved and wages are raised to the prices of commodities will increase. But to I would ask, who will have to pay these increased prices ? Will they not fall upon masses-upo n the employees themselves ? have Prom this aspect of the matter a very strong desire argument may be advanced in favour of New Federal legislation. We now have Interfree-trade, and if we permit employers - in a State like Victoria to carry on their operations without any restrictions whilst the we subject employers in New South Wales or in other States to serious disabilities, the who industrial operations in Victoria will inu l l crease to the disadvantage of other States. back Therefore, under a system of Inter-State free-trade we should have a common law for the regulating wages and other conditions of out employment. We are told that the adoption of this measure will produce ill-feeling. indusWhy should it do so? The honourable member for Melbourne has declared that inill-feeling has been engendered under existthe, ing conditions, and that it may possibly re-assert itself within a comparatively brief period. At any rate he is not prepared to guarantee that the ship-owners will consent to an extension of the agreement for more than six mpnths. It has been said that the operation of the Bill will have the effect of driving capital from the country. I will undertake to say that the vents strikes. maritime strike which occurred in 1890, and the banking crisis in 1893, had Mr BRUCESMITH the effect of driving infinitely more capital from Australia than will the operation of this measure. Indeed, I find that in New Zealand, after grave which vitally affected certain industries had been settled by the Arbitraout tion Court, a large - amount of additional capital was invested in those industries. We are told that voluntary agreement the correct principle to adopt in industrial matters. The Bill under consideration vides that the court can register voluntary strikes agreements, so that the necessity for much dreaded arbitration will thereby be obviated. All that the parties to agreement are asked to do is to register so that the powers of the Court can be are called into operation. But, in my judgter ment, the Broken Hill strike of 1892 is splendid illustration of the weakness the system of voluntary agreement. In speaking upon the Industrial Arbitration Bill in the New South Wales Parliament, Mr Ferguson, addressing himself to that aspect of the question, saidA voluntary agreement between masters men with enforcement of awards is a very thing in its way. I remember that we voluntary agreement between masters and men at Broken Hill. It was a written agreement, was signed by the workmen particularly request of the employers. We agreed that in event of any future trouble arising between the masters and men it should be referred to a' Court this Bill . of Arbitration which would consist of a Judge the District or Supreme Court of one of the tralian colonies, and a representative of the and a representative of the employers. Those are exactly the terms of this Bill. That was a voluntary agreement, and what was the use of It was not worth the paper it was written As soon as the employers found that it was able to break the agreement they did so. They snapped theirfingersin our faces, the men went out on strike, which was their only remedy, they lost after a protracted struggle. Altogether apart from the suffering which the struggle inflicted upon the strikers, I hold that the disturbance of trade relations, Bill the cost of preserving law and order, and interest the additional burden which was cast upon prive Mr Wilks. the shoulders of the community generally,, represented a very considerable sum.",30
188,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The honourable member is assuming that under the operation of this Bill industrial strife will cease.,32
189,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I intend to show that legislation of the character proposed pre- What about the case of the shearers 1 The .Equity Judge declared that if they had come within the provisions of the New South Wales Act civil disputes war would have resulted.,32
190,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I have already pointed that the principle of voluntary agreement proved a failure at Broken Hill . I might also instance the case of the Mort'sis Dock Engineering Company, at Balmain.. That company employs over-2,000 men,, proand has been concerned in only two serioui- during more . than twenty years. the But the employees of the company had toresort to a strike in order to obtain that any very form of agreement. Of course, I am it, aware that the more powerful trades unions not favourable to legislation of the characproposed. It must not be imagined for a a moment that all organized labour is in of favour of arbitration. I know of an organization which is absolutely opposed to the principle of arbitration, simply because, usuallyj it is powerful enough to enforce its. demands. I refer to the Shipwrights' Union in New South Wales, which has not registered for the purpose of coming under the. and provisions of the State Act. Why has it good refused to do so ? Because it has the had a eaonomic power of compulsion ! But and it the larger bodies of workers, who at the have no power of redress, will be the anxious to be included within the scope' of The honourable and learned of member for Parkes may consider that-' Austhose who favour the measure are extreme men radicals, but it is a remarkable fact that the extreme socialists are opposed to it just as it? much as are the extreme capitalists. That, upon. fact is proved by the experience of New suitSouth Wales, where, in 1891, a largemeeting of socialists was held to protest, and against the adoption of a system of industrial arbitration. They carried the following resolution :That this meeting desires to protest against the. now before Parliament, and declares that it is. a measure framed by capitalist politicians in the of the capitalist class who desire to dethe workers of the power to strike, because: when the workers strike the profits of the capitalist class cease. Another extract which I have from the same source speaks of that Bill, the objects of which were similar to those of the measure under consideration, thusWe urge again, as we have already urged, that the strike is the only economic weapon which the workers possess. We are told that the workmen of England are opposed to industrial arbitration. Why 1 Because, as was pointed out by the honourable member for Melbourne, they have not sufficient representatives in the House of Commons to secure to them their meed of justice. The same conditions obtain in America. Surely we are not asked to imitate America- a country which is seething with anarchy and industrial strife, and where the police are called out to shoot down men who are fighting for their rights. Surely even moderate men will not say that in this respect the United States of America should be held up as an example to us: No Arbitration Court is in existence there. Mr SAWBRS, - The unionists United States of America object to the principle.",32
191,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"They do so because they are afraid of the corrupt courts which exist in the States. The people of the Unite'd States of America have certainly effected wonderful improvements in other directions, but their position in this respect is not such as to warrant us in looking to them for guidance. The argument has been used that this is merely experimental legislation ; but it would apply to most measures that we are called upon to pass. instance we have the experience of New Zealand, of Western Australia, and of New South Wales to. guide us. The aspirations of the people of New South Wales are common to Australia, and we find that in that State this principle has not worked to the detriment of the public. On. the contrary, it has tended to industrial peace. It must not be imagined that the Court to be established under this Bill will invariably decide against capital. The New South Wales Gourt has given as many decisions against the interests of employees as in favour of them. In many vital cases its awards have been against the employees. The honourable member for Melbourne pointed out during his address that a decision given against certain colliers had been loyally observed, and manv similar cases 8 c might be mentioned. This Bill is unquestionably in favour of the interests of the smaller organizations; and well-organized unions can take care of themselves. Some people say that the Bill is an encroachment upon trades unionism. I admit that it will have that effect; but capital today is travelling largely on the lines of trades unionism. The position in regard to joint stock, companies, to which I have already referred, shows that they have been driven to combine in order to obtain greater security. Our Shipowners Association, our Employers' Federa1 tion, and other kindred institutions in Australia show, too, that the principle of organization is recognised b j the employers, while in America great trusts are .formed from time to time. All over the world the tendency of the age is for capitalists to come together for the protection of their own interests, and it is equally right that employees should combine. The early trades unions were successful whilst they had to deal with only the disorganized forces of the emof the ployers ; but as soon as Capital became organized they found that they could not fight with success. During an industrial struggle the men who have to depend upon their labour have no wage fund or reserve to draw upon for the support of their wives and families ; but the capitalists have supplies to draw upon, and are*not affected to anything like the same degree. The spirit of Capital has been to worse Labour even when the demands of Labour have been just, and surely every honourable member must desire that justice In this - shall be paramount. If the demands of Labour are just, the power of the purse should not prevent their recognition. This Bill will do justice to both parties, and I feel that every honourable member should welcome it. If we desire capital to be driven out of Australia,'let us by all means fight against the principle of arbitration and abide by the old state of affairs ; let us have our strikes and industrial disputes, and capital will certainly leave the country. In my opinion, however, too much is made of the cry that capital is being driven out of Australia. Capital is unconscious of country. Capitalists invest their money where they can obtain the best return. As long as they can obtain the best rate of interest they know no fear. Even the British moneylender will make advances on Turkish bonds when British consols are low. He will lend money on the rofctenest security in the world when British consols are so low that it pays him to inflate the market elsewhere. The experience of Australia is that the rates of interest were falling long before the question of compulsory arbitration was considered. The rates which prevailed twelve or thirteen years ago are not now obtainable. The. honourable and learned membor for Parkes suggests that the Arbitration' Act of New South Wales is driving capital away from that State. I think, however, that the Attorney-General dealt very well with that point when he showed the House that the New South Wales Court had given awards affecting 36,000 employee's and only 1,000 employers. I am satisfied that it will rectify the differences between Capital and Labour in a very short period.",33
192,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It has made certain awards, but it is not correct to say that it has settled all trouble.",34
193,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The awards have been obeyed.,34
194,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That is good enough for the Attorney-General.,34
195,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The men affected by the awards of the Court are still following their avocations, and no difficulty is being experienced. The New South Wales Court is an admirable one. It has as its president a lawyer-Judg e Cohen-wh o is well trained in mercantile matters, and whose associations have not always been with the cause of labour. The representative of the employers is Mr Cruickshank, a very able man whom I have known for twenty years, while Mr Samuel Smith, whom I have also known for twenty years, represents the employees. Thus the Court is composed of a Jew and two Scotchmen, and if the representatives of capital or labour can thwart a court so constituted, they must be possessed of qualities such as most people would not attribute to them. The decisions of the Court have not pleased either side, but the public of New South Wales are satisfied that it is freeing the country of industrial disputes. The State is not being called upon now to exercise its power to preserve law and order in connection with industrial troubles. Many of those who oppose this Bill are veritable - whales"" for law and order. They would vote against this Bill today and tomorrow they would say to the meu, "" Figlitout your difficulties in a constitutional manner. Take your case before the courts, but do not break the laws of the country."" I agree that the laws of the country should not be broken. We do not wish to see the hysteria of a Frenchman or the excitability of a Spaniard exhibited in connection with the regulation of our industrial affairs, but we contend that by a measure such as this the possibility of industrial strife will be avoided. I have dealt with the arguments against the Bill. I desire now to advance one or two reasons in favour of it. In the first place, we have to remember that if we pass this Bill the occupation of the paid agitator will be gone.",34
196,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Includin g the honourable and learned member for Parkes.,34
197,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes ; he is occasionally paid as a lawyer. It is singular that, notwithstanding the fact that the legal profession is a very close corporation, most lawyers are opposed to this measure. The courts of law fix their wages-o r fees, as they call themand they dare not accept payment on a lower scale.. The same remark applies to the medical profession, whose fees are fixed practically by a trades union. Those who believe in stability of trade should accept this Bill. In the past the paid agitator has been able to work upon the emotions of the men, and the loyalty of the employees to their executives has been so great that they haveimplicitly obeyed orders. UnderthisBill, however, the paid agitator will be able to exercise no such power. When I speak of the agitator I do not refer to the genuine reformer-to the man who puts forward views which he believes - to be in the interests of his fellows- I refer to the individual who finds that it pays him'to create dissension between Capital and Labour, and who reaps monetary gain from a strike. I am surprised that the opponents of the measure have failed to recognise that if we pass this Bill such a man will have nothing to do. All who are against professional agitators should support the Bill . Another point which we have to remember is that this measure affords the only process by which collective bargaining may be carried into effect. Honourable members will say that that is a new idea; but the days of individual bargaining have disappeared. The operations of trade all point in the direction of collective bargaining, and this Bill will'legalise the principle. At the present time a man is able to go to a banking institution and arrange for capital with which to purchase his material, and to enter into a contract in regard to it which must be respected. This Bill now declares that a man shall have power practically to purchase his labour as well as to purchase his money and his material. Hp will be able under it to secure his labour with the mathematical accuracy as to cost which marks his dealing with capital and material, and, therefore, under this measure we shall secure what is known as stability of trade. The honourable and learned member for Parkes may say- "" ""We do not like either Capital or Labour to be compelled to adopt a course which is repugnant to it but we can scarcely perform any act which is not subject to some governing power: AVe have no ideal liberty of the subject. /This would be truly a pretty country if we lived in the state of ""philosophical anarchy"" which some people suggest. If we pass this Bill an employee will be at liberty to advocate the improvement of his fellows without becoming, as under the existing conditions, a marked man. An employee at Mort's Dock, or at any other works, who attempted hitherto to secure a reform in regard to wages, or some other conditions of labour, found himself a marked man, and had his name placed on the black list. In the United States of America this system is very rife. There, a man who dares to fight for the freedom of his fellow-workmen, is marked for all time by the associations of capitalists; yet we are asked to follow, the - example of that country, so far as its freedom from compulsory arbitration is concerned., We have had industrial difficulties in the past in which-rightl y or wrongly we need not considermen who have fought for their fellows - have become marked men, and have been prevented from getting employment. The Bill , however, will put a stop to that sort of thing. It will prevent employers from putting their men on blacklists. After disputes have been settled by the Court, there will be no ill-feeling, because the parties will have relied, not upon the old methods of violence, but upon the new method of reason. Surely the honourable and learned member for Parkes will agree that the new system is better than the old' system ? I could understand his objection to the Bill if he were against the principle of arbitration altogether; but I do not see why he should object to the Bill if he is 8 c2 opposed oruy to some of its details, because they can be altered in Committee. I shall, however, be out of order if I refer to the provisions of the measure in detail at this stage, although honourable members sometimes offend in that particular. Employers are not forced to go before the Court, because the Bill provides for the registration of voluntary agreements between masters and men. They can meet together and arrange terms without going before the Court at all, and, no doubt, where there are good masters and good men, mesb difficulties will be overcome in that way. The Bill will benefit chiefly, not the powerful associations of masters or of men, but those persons who belong to sections of the community which, under existing conditions, have no power to obtain redress of their grievances. When the New South Wales measure was under discussion in the State Parliament, I was opposed to the establishment of a Court of Conciliation, because I thought that if the parties to a dispute could not come to an agreement between themselves, it would be better for them to go at once to the Court of Arbitration. The New Zealand system has proved a failure largely because the Conciliation Boards have been composed of partisans, men chosen by the parties to the disputes who were determined to do the best they could for those whom they represented - There has, moreover, been the suspicion that many troubles have been fomented to procure the appointment of men to Boards of Conciliation so that they might draw the fees attached to the position. This Bill, however, gets over the New Zealand difficulty, and is superior to the New South Wales measure, in that it provides for the settlement of disputes by the method of either conciliation or arbitra tion in the one Court. I think, however that its provisions should apply to the public servants, the servants of the Railways Commissioners, and similar bodies of men.",34
198,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Hear , hear. Why have a partial millennium ?",35
199,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am glad that the honourable and learned member agrees with me in this respect, although he makes me somewhat doubt the wisdom of my position. AVe cannot, however, reach an elysium by one bound; we must advance a step at a time.",35
200,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"If the Bill provides a panacea, why not apply it to all classes",35
201,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It - is not claimed that it provides a panacea ; but the experience of New Zealand, to which Judge Backhouse has borne testimony, is that the effects of a measure of this kind are good. Backhouse is neither a capitalist nor an employee.",36
202,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,B u b all lawyers are capitalistic.,36
203,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In that case we should apply a double scrutiny to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Parkes. I think that the public servants and other classes which I have named should, as in New South Wales, come under the operation of the measure. Such an arrangement would have prevented the recent railway strike in Victoria. A measure of this kind should apply to public servants just as every other measure applies to them. Could there be any more unsatisfactory tribunal than Parliament to remedy the grievances of such persons 1 For that reason alone they should come under the operation of the Bill . It has been said that it would be difficult to enforce an award, but I think that that difficulty could be got over. I should like now to refer to the position of seamen under the Bill. A dispute in which seamen were concerned would, more quickly than any other dispute, extend from one State to another. But only the seamen connected with the coastal trade come under the Bill ; its provisions do nob, apply to the men on foreign vessels. I have no personal concern in the action of the right honourable and learned member for South Australia in this matter, but, to quote an expression of Marat, one cannot be an apostle of truth unless one has the courage to be its martyr. The right honourable and learned member has certainly had the courage to be a martyr for the truth which he holds.",36
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,.Does member class the right honourable member for South Australia with Marat t,36
205,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes . He has applied a very high standard to public life. If Ministers cannot fully approve of a proposed measure, if it does not conform to their ideas, or carry out their promises, they have no other course open to them than to leave the Cabinet. In that respect the right honourable and learned gentleman did what was right. I am convinced, from what I know of the opinions of my own constituents, that seamen especially need consideration in connection with a measure of this kind. In reply to the argument that the employers should be allowed to deal with their own employees, I would point out that, under such Judge conditions, the employees would be beaten every, time, and would have no redress. If honourable"" members wish to encourage violence, and to create disturbances and uncertainty in the community, they should oppose the measure. But if the contrary is their desire, they should try to pass it. Its provisions are not a panacea, but they are a palliative, and none of our legislation does more than provide a palliative for abuses. I shall support the measure very cordially, though I think that, like the policeman, it will be most useful when it is nob being used. It will prevent strikes and differences by its very existence, without the calling into operation of its various clauses. If the people of Melbourne were, at any given moment, to determine to be disorderly and to create a riot, the police of the city could not prevent the disturbance. But the instinct .of the people^ combined with the knowledge that the assistance of the police is always within reach, brings about-the general observance of law and order. This measure will have a similar effect. It has been said thab it will not be used,- but, to say that, is to argue that masters and men are devoid of intelligence. Exacbly the opposibe is the case, and both parties will learn to respect and to use the measure for the proper settlement of their disputes and determination of their rights. It is, however, bo the moral force behind the Bill that we have to look for the advanbages to be gained from it, more bhau bo the mere adminisbrative force of the Government. Masters and men, before they provoke a struggle, will satisfy bhemselves that they are in the righb. They will bake care that bheir claims are based upon justice, because they know the honourable that,, if the Court decides against them, public opinion, too, will be against them. The Bill will require a great deal of con- ° sideration in Committee. Personally, I have no dislike to lawyers, but experience has proved that it is a very costly thing to employ lawyers, and I shall nob vobe for any provision which will tend bo make the proceedings before the Court difficult or costly. Both masters and men can be represented by persons who thoroughly understand the facts of the case and the technical points' involved, and it will be better to have that representation, and to exclude lawyers, who are 'likely to differ and fight over legal points which will seldom be really at issue. I know that some of the labour unions have fears on the matter; they think that their funds will be exhausted in legal expenses. The experience of New Zealand has shown that lawyers are not necessary.",36
206,Mr BKUCB SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Then why have lawyer on the Bench ? Why not employ an innocent layman ?,37
207,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not think the epithet -*' innocent "" could be applied toa lawyer. The honourable and learned member has on several occasions sat on boards of arbit'ra-' tion, and I know that whenever he does - so he goes into matters very carefully. ' He gives them the maximum of attention, even if months of delay are caused by the process. The MCSharry case affords a good example of the w«,y in which a case may be lengthened. No doubt the honourable and learned member for Parkes was very thorough. He was the first in and the last out, and the experience gained in - connection with that case makes me desire more strongly than' ever to exclude lawyers from the proceedings in the Arbitration - Court. I have often been asked what New South Wales has gained from federation, and I have always replied that it at least had resulted in bringing the MCSharry case to a conclusion. If federation had not been brought about, I believe that the MCSharry case ""would, still have been going - on. I know that the honourable and. learned member for Parkes has special - qualifications for dealing with trades disputes, because of his intimate knowledge of mercantile and industrial affairs, bub I think that we can get along very well in the Arbitration Court with men of experi-etice who have an intimate knowledge of the matters in dispute. One of the best labour unions in Australia, which during' tweuty years has been concerned in only two strikes, has already derived benefit - from the Arbitration Courb in New Soubh Wales. Some eighbeen months ago a strike took place among the iron workers' assisb-anfcs employed at Morb's Dock, in Sydney. The men were endeavouring bo secure - an increase in bheir wages from 36s. to 39s. per week. Their demand was opposed .by the Morb's Dock and Engineering Company, and afber a strike had baken place the - dispube was settled by voluntary arbitration, the arbitrator being Mr Cruickshank, one of the members of the presenb Arbitration Court in New South Wales. H is decision was given in favour of the men bo the extent of half the amount they asked for, and that course will probably be. adopbed in mosb cases in the future. If the Arbibrabion Court does not adopt a sysbem of compromise ib will prove a failure. a Mr Bruce SMITH - Then the men have only to ask fortwice the amount they expect.",37
208,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"On the same ' principle the employer offers only half the amount he expects to give. The competitive system compels the employer to give no more than he can avoid, and I hope that the Arbitration Court will strike the happy medium in all cases.",37
209,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That is a dangerous principle to lay down.,37
210,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I cannot say what the Court will do. Almost invariably its decisions have the effect of "" splitting the difference.""",37
211,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"That affords the men a direct incentive to resort to the Courb, whether they are satisfied or not.",37
212,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not think so. The wages boards in Victoria really constituted arbitration courts, which fixed wages in certain trades, and I do not think that it can be claimed that their operations have had the effect of driving away capital or of interfering with the development of industry. In Tasmania there are no restric-. bions upon the employment of labour, and that State will form a happy hunting ground for some of those capitalists who desire to exercise a free, hand. I believe that the Bill is a wise one, and I shall support it. Provision should be made for a conciliation tribunal which will be able bo exercise ibs beneficent influence in cases which may be amicably adjusbed, whilst the Court is occupied in dealing with disputes of a more complex and difficult character.",37
213,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N," I desire to congratulate the honourable member for Melbourne upon the excellent speech which he delivered, and upon the change which has taken place in his convictions. He does not by any means stand alone. I know of a large number of employers, both in New South Wales and Victoria, who were at first antagonistic to compulsory arbitration, but who have come to the conclusion that, whilst the law in operation may be imperfect, it has brought about a condition of affairs compared to which that previously existing was chaos and anarchy. Their opinion is shared by some of the largest employers of labour in America and England, and therefore the honourable member need riot be afraid that he will be isolated; he is in very godd company.",37
214,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The honourable member thinks that he is right this time.,38
215,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes ; and I have hopes even of my honourable and learned friend regarding conciliation. H is conversion may be a painful process, but all great things are born in travail. At .the outset I take exception to the suggestion of the. honourable member for Melbourne that the Bill should be limited in its operation to five years. That plan has been tried in Victoria, but has failed.",38
216,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It only shifts onus of proof as to re-enactment.,38
217,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It does more. It causes just as much confusion and unrest in trade as continual alterations.of In Victoria we passed the Factories Act in the first place for a period and we had a long and bitter struggle over (its re-enactment for a further period two years. The Act expires on the 31st October next, and it would be infinitely better if all the questions, dealt with that Act were settled for a considerable .period. There is nothing to prevent an legal profession. amendment of a measure or repeal of a section which is considered injurious i operation. If the suggestion of the honorthat able member, or that of^the honourable memof ber for Kooyong, is adopted, the five term may elapse at a most inconvenient time. The Victorian Shops and Act will expire in October. Its .re-enactment will have to be considered by a dying Parliament which was elected for specific purposes, and which is out of touch this class of legislation. Surely that is not the kind of Parliament that one would have to deal with a measure of this sort. If we limit the operation of the Act to a him. period of four or five years, it may expire at a time at which it would be least desirable to discuss its re-enactment, and I hope the suggestion of the honourable member will be adopted. There was only one other note of discord struck by the honourable member for Melbourne, and that was in regard to giving preference to unionists. A very diction ? striking article written by the Honourable B. R . Wise, Attorney-General of-New South Wales,. and published in the National Review, of August last, contains some very pertinent remarks with reference to that question. He says The same observation applies to the sub-cluuse- which empowers the court to give u preference tounionists. Without entering into the question whether wage-earuers should decline to work with non-unionists, as .barristers are permitted by law to decline to hold a brief with a layman, or with, one who is debarred, it is Sufficient for practical legislation that some of. the most troublesome, strikes of modern times turn upon this point. That is a very striking remark. I notice that barristers are very frequently to be found opposing this kind of legislation, and yet I know of no more exclusive body than ' the legal profession.",38
218,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The honourable member is quite misinformed. The idea of a fixed the wage or a'fee for a lawyer is a delusion.,38
219,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It is no delusion when one gets the bill. The lawyers have fixed a. minimum wage, and they will not accept a tariff. anything below it.",38

Mr Mauger , - The leader of the Op-position strongly urged that upon no account should this Parliament deal with industrial legislation: Y e the contributed to this debate an admirable speech in favor of the Bill ; so that if Mr Wise has - changed his opinion he is in excellent company.",39

He goes on to s a y It is sufficient for practical legislation .some of the most troublesome strikes of modern times turn upon this point, and that these never be settled by the Court, unless it had lation. power to determine within what limits the unionist - contention should prevail. Accordingly, both in New Zealand and New South Wales, the Court can, under certain conditions, direct that ence be given to members of an industrial union. That is all for which this Bill asks. - order to settle industrial strife it gives the Court power to say in effect:"" Seeing that the vast majority of the men interested in this trade are unionists, the - others, who are in a minority, shall be impelled to join the union."" The history - of labour struggles throughout the world shows the necessity forsuch a provision. 'These are the only objections-and they not seem to be serious ones-whic h are - raised by a representative employer such as the honourable member for Melbourne. me they constitute a very clear indication - of the signs of the times. Many years ago I urged upon the employers in Victoria that their position would be' infinitely strengthened if, instead of assailing principle of industrial arbitration, they - deavoured to improve the method of applytion. ing it.

I am - convinced that this Parliament will not listen to them. If they concentrated - attention upon pointing out where mistakes have been committed, and'joined in making suggestions for the improvement of this measure, the House would lend them a very ready ear. But when they ask us to revert to the old condition of non-interference, they ask what it is absolutely impossible to concede.",39

234,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In some cases it does, but not in all - I know some very excellent employers who are neither fearful nor selfish, but who take up the position that they desire to conduct their business without interference. Industrial civilization is of such a complex nature that that state of affairs is simply impossible. The whole trend of industrial legislation throughout the world goes to maintain the position which I have indicated. In nearly every of Europe industrial legislation of some kind has been enacted. From all I that can gather, England stands at the very head of the family of nations, both in the could quantity and quality of this kind of legis",39

Of course, all sorts of experiments are being made all over the world, but I am speaking of legislation' to which practical effect is being given. I think my honourable friend will find that I am correct in declaring that England stands at the head of the list of nations in this connection. Switzerland comes next. It is very remarkable that, prior to federation in Switzerland, the cantons had full power to legislate, and a condition of affairs obtained which was very similar to that which exists in Australia at the present time. Complaints, however, were continually being made that one canton was obtaining an undue advantage over another. In one, legislation of a far-reaching character ft'ould be enacted in regard to industrial matters, and in others no legislation would be enacted. I notice that some employers predict that one of the results of this legislation will be a conflict between the Federal and the State powers, and that in some instances the courts or wages boards in the different States will arrive at one decision whilst the Federal Court will give a different decision. I would strongly urge that the best way for the employers to overcome that difficulty is to join with the trades unions in seeing that the power to legislate upon these subjects is exclusively vested in this Parliament.",39
242,Mr BHUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,There has been a conflict between the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Arbitration Court with regard to the time at which certain establishments shall close.,40
243,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"U n d e r the Early Closing-Act? , .",40
244,Mr BRUCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"SMITH - The Arbitration Court decided that they should close at one hour, and the Supreme Court at a different hour. - Mr Mauger - In New South Wales I am aware that the hours for closing are regulated by statute. I quite agree that it is preferable that all these matters should be regulated by one statute, and that the power to legislate upon them should be vested in the Federal Parliament. Otherwise I can quite see that there are possibilities of conflict. In Switzerland the difficulty was overcome in the manner I have indicated, and in 1877 the first general Factories Act was passed. In 1888 the whole of these legislative powers were taken over by the Federation. The cantons still have power to legislate, but their legislation must not come into conflict with that of the Federal authorities. The European nations which have interfered in industrial matters the least, whose labour legislation is represented by zero-suc h nations as Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Roumania-ar e confessedly in the background, if they are not .absolutely declining. It seems to me this is an indication that in the interests of national life it is absolutely necessary to legislate on industrial lines such as are proposed in connection with this Bill . A f t e r all, this is but another step in the evolution of industrial progress. At the early part of the last century we acknowledged that the nation had of necessity to provide a national minimum of leisure, .in orderto save the child-life of England. We have provided for a national minimum of sanitation, and we have also acknowledged the State's duty by providing fora national minimum qf education. Mr G. B . ED WA RDS - And for protection from injury, too.",40
245,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes . .Of course the national minimum of sanitation and health involve the protection of woman and child labour, and embrace all the ramifications to be found in the industrial Acts of the various* nations to which I have re-, ferred. In this connection, I deem an ex' tract from a debate which took place in the House of Commons in the early part of last century sufficiently important toread. Richard Oastler, who was so closely associated with the effort to secure a national minimum of leisure - by that I mean a restriction of the hours of labourfound it necessary; in the interests of the child life of England, to recognise such a principle. Speaking in the House of Commons'upon the matter, he said I will not picture fiction to you, but I will tell you what I have seen. Take a little female captive six or seven years old; she shall rise from, her bed at four in the morning of a cold winter day, but before she rises she wakes perhapshalf-a-dozen times, and says-""Father , is it time? Father, is it time?"" And at last when she gets up and puts her little bits of vags upon her weary limbs, weary yet with the last day's, work, she leaves her parents in their bed, for their labour (if the3 have any) is not required so early. r She trudges alone through rain and snow, and mire and darkness to the mill, and there for thirteen, fourteen, sixteen, or even eighteen hours, is she obliged to work with only thirty minutes, interval for meals and play. Homeward again atnight she would go, when she was able, but many a time she hid herself in the wool in the mill, as she had not strength to go. And if shewere one moment behind the appointed time, if the bell had ceased to ring when she arrived with trembling, shivering, weary limbs at the factory dopr, there stood a monster in human form, and as she passed he lashed her. ""This"" he contiuued, holding up an overlooker's strapthis i.s no fiction. It was hard at work in this town last week. The girl I am speaking of died ; but site dragged on that dreadful existence for several years. It was this condition of things in England that compelled the Government to insist upon a national minimum of leisure.",40
246,Sir MALCOLM MOEACHAHN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,How since was that 1,41
247,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"In 1833-the early part of last' century. It was absolutely necessary in order to preserve child life, <jhild life now is being preserved only where a national minimum of leisure is operative.",41
248,Mr BATCHELOH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Goo d old private enterthings prise !,41
249,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not see that quotation has any .bearing upon the quesand tion of compulsory arbitration, although is doubtless very pathetic.",41
250,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I intend to show that compulsory arbitration is another step in evolution of industrial emancipation. I that it is not only pathetic but pertinent the question which we are considering. desire to show that where this measure relief has not been applied, child life being strangled in the interests of heartless manufacturers. Let honourable members read the report concerning child life was presented to the House of Commons within the past three years.",41
251,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,We have a Factories Act in operation in New South Wales - in Victoria.,41
252,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am discussing the condition of affairs in Great Britain, and will show that my remarks are perfectly pertinent to the question which we are sidering. If the honourable and learned member will read Frank Hurd's Cry of Children, he will find that in those indusapprentices tries to which a national minimum of leisure is not applicable, child life is being crushed out of existence. It is true that we have Factories Acts in operation in Victoria and New South Wales. Unfortunately, - have no such legislation in a number of other States. That is where a great diffiwe culty presents itself. Already one or factory owners have quitted Victoria, and established their industries in Tasmania, where no protection is afforded to the .ployos. They are thus competing extremely unfairly with the manufacturers of Victoria. The honourable member for Bland pointed out that the same - thing has occurred as between New South Wales and Queensland. That goes to show that in the absence of legislation such as is now proposed, a condition of things similar to that which existed in England and Victoria previous to legislation.",41
253,Mr HUMECOOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It also emphasizes the long need for. a Federal Factories Act.,41
254,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes ; it emphasizes the need for industrial unification. It is true, as the honourable and learned - member for Parkes says, that we have had factory legis-' and lation in Victoria for some time, but I can assure him that we did not obtain it >one moment 'too soon. The condition of which existed in Victoria prior to the passing of the Factories Act goes to the show that where employers are allowedthis is my point-to take advantage of it an overcrowded market, to do as they like with individuals, whether men or women, sweating and long hours are the inevitable the result. I have here quite a number of illushold trations of the condition of things which to existed in Victoria prior to the passing of I the Act in question. It is absolutely cerof tain that sweating was almost universal; is there was no minimum wage, long hours prevailed, no record was kept of home workers, alleged apprentices were underwhich paid, and no check was attempted to be kept upon alien competition. It was found, when we came to agitate for factory legislation, that there were no less than 440 persons and who were continuously employed without receiving any pay. One large establishment had been carrying on an extensive business I by exploiting child labour. As soon as one batch of apprentices had been engaged for contwelve months, it was discharged by the firm ; another batch was then taken on, and the as soon as the time arrived at which the would have to receive some payment for their services, they were dismissed. Not a penny was paid by it for this class of labour: Therefore, to obtain anything like industrial order, it was absolutely necessary we to pass a Factories Act. I contend that, in the order to complete our industrial legislation, require to provide, not only for the maxitwo mum number of hours to be worked, and for proper sanitation, but for some tribunal to fix the rates of wages to be paid. It must erabe clearly a condition of every contract of employment that its terms shall not be such as will impair the efficiency of the citizen producer, or diminish the vitality of the race. To encourage labour afc a rate insufficient .for the proper maintenance of the individual must be just as injurious as is a contract providing for long hours, and requiring persons to work under insanitary conditions. I have endeavoured to show that legislation in this direction is necessary in the interests of child-life. I should also like to point, out that it is necessary in the interests of our womanhood. I think it will be admitted by all who have studied her works, that Mrs Sydney Webb is an exceedingly careful woman, who would never in any way exaggerate the facts. She is my authority for the condition of things which prevails in England, in a, trade to which no Act. restricting the hours of labour and requiring proper sanitation applies. The honourable and learned member for Parkes should be particularly interested in the quotation which I am about to read. AVe had in Victoria a very severe struggle to secure the extension of the principle of wages boards to the jam-making trade. It was said that if the industry were brought under the wages board system it would be ruined, and that the various factories would immediately close down. They have not yet closed down. On the contrary, according to the latest statistics, the industry is expanding. But special pleading of the kind I have indicated has succeeded in preventing the industry in Great Britain from being brought under the Factories Act. Writing last year on the condition of the jam-.maktng trade in England, to which a national onmimum of leisure and sanitation has not been made to apply. Mrs Webb saidThe majority of the British jam factories at the beginning of the twentieth century, present during summer months, scenes of overwork, overcrowding, dirt and disorder hardly to be equalled by the cotton mills at the ""beginning of the nineteenth century. Women and girls are kept continuously at work week-days and Sundays alike ; often as much as 100 hours in the seven days; and sometimes for twenty or 30 'hours at a stretch. The crowded, unventilated, uncleaaly, and generally insanitary state ""of the work-place - bh e puddles 'of dirty water uon the floos, the - clouds of steam in the '"".boiling-room,"" the long hours of standing in boots and clothes made wringing wet by the faulty arrangements of the tubs and water supply-=al l these evils are 'described year by year in the official reports of the factory inspectors.",41
255,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Does that state - of! - affairs exist in Victoria ? Mr Mauger.,42
256,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,No . MR . BRUCESMITH - No r in any part of Australia ?,42
257,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I hope not; but I am inclined to think that unless legislation of this kind is made to apply throughout the Commonwealth, there will be very greatdanger of a repetition of the condition of things which prevailed prior to the passing of the Factories Act in Victoria. In thosedays insanitary conditions existed - to an alarming extent in connection with our factories. In company with the Rev. A . R. Edgar, I visited on one occasion a factory in South Melbourne, in which dozens of girls were employed, and in which stagnant water had lain for years. Typhoid fevercases were continually developing, and thestate of affairs was absolutely appalling. I wish now to direct the attention of the House to certain remarks made by Sir John Gorst. As the honourable and learned member for Parkes is aware, he is not a Radical,, but a Conservative member of the House of Commons.",42
258,Mr WINTER COOKE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Conservative s have been the greatest reformers.,42
259,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I quite agree with the honourable member.,42
260,Mr BATCHELOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,There is a chance for them to reform in this case.,42
261,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,E x a c t l y .,42
262,Mr WINTER COOKE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,They passed a. Factories Act in England.,42
263,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"But not until Lord Shaftesbury had determined to take theside of the Opposition, and adopted a coursewhich caused him to lose position, and laid himself open to the bitter andfierce-fightingof those who were nearest and dearest to him. He was a Conservative who wasbetter than his political creed, and he certainly =",42
264,Mr WINTER COOKE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Some of the Radicals objected to the passing of the Factories Act in England.,42
265,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"We have had the samethinghere. We have had some parents objecting to what they 'describe as their means of sustenance being lowered by the action of the State in .reducing the hours of employment - for their children. In Jiune of last year, Sir John Gorst, in the House .of Commons-Gave a really alarming.account-of the children of Edinburgh as disclosed by the recent investigations of the Royal Commission on Physical Instruction. At the Nort'h Canongate School the ! Commissioners were struck by the-appearance.of the boys while bathing, by their thinness and generally underfed condition. Out of 150 examined 115 lived in houses of two rooms, and the remainder in houses of one room. The large .minority, if not. the majority, were habitually underfed and insufficiently clothed. Thirty-eight per cent, suffered from insufficient nutrition.",42
266,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,He was then Vice-President of the Board of Education.,43
267,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,This statement was made last year.,43
268,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Yes - It was because of the position which he held that he made that statement.,43
269,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The report continues""How can we raise an Imperial race if that is the eeneral condition of the children in the schools,"" Sir John asked in the House.",43
270,Mr GB EDWARDS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,B y taxing their food supplies.,43
271,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"If it would have the same effect that it has had in the United States of America, that policy would be good for the children. No picture such as this has been drawn of the American children, AVe, too, are supposed to tax the food supplies of Australia; yet we have no record - such as this to present. I hope, however, that I shall nob be dragged into a discussion of the fiscal question at this stage. The-report continues The Commissioners stated that physical exercise in the case of children improperly fed and clothed resulted in early physiological exhaustion and infirmity. Yet Dr Mackenzie found children who were suffering from phthisis and from heart - disease undergoing severe physical exercise. In Edinburgh, 31'7 of the children have defective vision, and 42 per cent, are defective in hearing; Altogether 10,000 children in that city, or 70 per cent., suffer from one kind of disease or - another, or some affection which requires attention. If anything like this state of things exists in England we are raising up a race which shows an alarming deterioration. The facts demanded the 'attention, Sir John suggested, of every one who desires to see this country great and prosperous. The first thing to do is to find out the facts. Teachers ought to examine the children every day, and. a periodical examination should be carried out at the public expense. .1 hold that the fact that mothers are underfed, according to the testimony given beforeselect committees, because in many cases parents of families are unable to obtain sufficient to provide the necessaries of life, goes to show conclusively that some kind of legislation that will insure a national minimum wage is needed in England. Another very imporbant 'phase' of this question, which demonstrates clearly the need for legislation of this class, is the fact that woman workers are making inroads upon our industrial life, and largely to the displacement of male labour.  of protection.",43
272,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That state of affairs is very marked in England.,43
273,Mr BATCHELOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It is worse in free trade countries than in protected counbries.,43
274,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I shall show thab it is nob a question of free-trade or of probection. Hobson, in his Evolution of Capitalism, shows conclusively bhat, while male labour has increased during the last 50 years by 52 per cent., female labour has increased by 201 per cent.",43
275,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,In protectionist countries.,43
276,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No - In England. I would commend to the attention of my honourable and learned friend a 'series of 1 books which has just been published giving an account of the Convention of women held last year in England.' He will find that women like Lady Dilke and LadyHenry Somerset point out that, in many directions, women are making inroads upon our industrial life. They do not, and personally I do not, object to women being employed at any kind of work which they are capable of doing, bub they objecb to women being employed at rates which lower the standard of living, and make home-life impossible. Lady Henry Somerset draws a very pathetic picture of the condition of the Yorkshire workers. She tells of a case in which the wages of a man employed in a woollen mill had been gradually decreasing until they were not enough bo keep his family. H is wife bhereupon made application to the employer to be given work, and honourable members can imagine her horror when she found, on going to the faebory on the following Monday morning, that she was bo receive 15s. a week, and bo displace her husband who was getting 19s. a week. We are told that that experience is by no means singular. A very striking case occurred in Vicboria which shows the need for legislation which will fix the rate of wage according to the character of the work to be done, irrespective of the sex employed to perform it. If females can be employed in woollen factories, at brushmaking, clockmaking, and even in the lighber iron brades, as they are now being employed in England, surely it is necessary to secure for them, in the interests proper standard of living, the same rates - wages as are given to men. In Victoria some time ago, there were eight factories which were turning out all kinds of brushsituated ware, and an enterprising capitalist brought the machinery here, and started a ninth factory, in which he employed female Very soon the other eight factories to find their trade slipping from them, industrial regulations. and, on inquiry, it became that, if they were to continue in business, one of two things must be done; either the pay of their hands must be reduced to the rates paid to the women in the ninth factory, or the wages of those 'women creased to the rates paid in the other factories. Representatives of the Age the Herald-newspapers which have always supported legislation of this kind-instituted inquiries, with the result that it was found 1 that, wliereas in the eight factories employlegislation ing men 2s. Sd. a dozen was paid for No. class of brooms, only Is. per dozen was to the women employed in the ninth factory. For No. 2 brooms, 2s. lOd."" per dozen paid to the men, and Is. 2d. per dozen to the women; for No. 3 brooms, 3s - to the men, and Is. 3d. to the women, and so until for the best class of brooms-heavy - first-class scavengers' brooms, the which is really not women's work at albthe men were getting 5s. Id. per dozen the women only 2s. Id. per dozen. men's union waited upon the Council of Anti-Sweating League, and were joined by their employers, who urged that Government should be moved to appoint a Wages Board for the trade, because otherwise the eight factories would have to discharge their men and employ women. If those men had been discharged it would have been impossible for their homes to be maintained on women's wages, and I am very pleased to say that the Ministry, of which the honourable 'member for Gippsland was the head, appointed a Wages That Board did not attempt to discriminate between male and female labour in' the trade. It did not say that either class of labour should or should not be employed; but it fixed a minimum wage for Victoria, and put all the employers in the trade the same level. It allowed them to employ men, women, or youths, but it compelled them to pay the minimum rate of wage all employees. What was the result i The factory which had been employing w.omen Mr Mauger. of ai was closed, and the proprietor removed to of Tasmania. Although his competition has still to be faced, it is not now so keen and severe as it was when the factory was in this State. That case goes to show the need for extending this class of legislation throughout the Commonwealth. With Interlabour. State free-trade, we must have somebegan thing like a common rule and uniform This Parliament apparent has agreed that the female public servants of the Commonwealth shall, if their work is equally well done, receive the same rates of pay as are given to men similarly employed. I can assure my honorinable friends on the Opposition side of the eight Chamber that this particular phase of the and question is something quite apart from the . fiscal issue. The state of things we want to prevent exists in .England, America, Germany, and Australia, and it is only by such as I have indicated that we can 1 put a stop to it. We must put a stop to it, paid unless we are prepared to allow the home= life of the people to suffer. I think it was was Rooseveldt who asked, "" Why do not the men go to church, and have largefamilies ? "" I am not going to speak on the first question on now, but I know that many men are prevented from marrying because of the uncermaking of tainty of their position. Mr B'AMFOHD - Will the passing of thisand measure affect their position 1 The Mr Mauger - I think that it can, the be made to do so, and I hope that it willI hope that when the Arbitration Court is the established, national minimum rates of wages for particular trades will be made tpapply to men and women alike.",43
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,So we are to establish Arbitration Courts in order to increase the population ! Surely the honourable member could advance a better argument for theB ill than that ?,44
278,Mr SPENCE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Some men marry-to getBoard. wives to keep them.,44
279,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I think the Bil l will tend to prevent what I have spoken against. Legislation of this kind is absolutely necessary to prevent labour from being crushed by trusts and combines, and to fix the terms, on of collective bargains. The honourable and learned member for Parkes and others haveobjected at various times that the labour to leaders of England and America are op posed to this kind of legislation. There is, I however, a great change taking placein their attitude towards it, the decision. in the Taff Vale case being one of the causes. That decision is being applied very widely in America, so that it is creating alarm. Recently, in Connecticut, a Judge not only gave an injunction against the men, but also issued an attachment against their homes, their furniture, and their savings in the banks.",44

287,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes ; but I will my authority for the statement. I have made. He is Professor Gunton, one of leading American economists, and he delivers monthly lectures before the Institute Economics there, his lectures being attended destroyed. by leading men of all shades of thought. In the May number of his magazinehe says The precedent established by the Taff Vale case in the English courts, making trade unions liable for damages in case of a strike, has followed by the courts in Vermont. Vermont was the P. P.. Patch Manufacturing Company against The Protection Lodge of the International Association of Machinists. suit was to recover 10,000 dollars damages injury to the business of the F. l i . Patch facturing Company by picketing and boycotting during a recent strike. for trial on the 19th March, and lasted seventeen days, the jury bringing in a verdict for dollars damages for the plaintiff. This first decision of its kind in this country. In the Waterbnry strike the corporations tuted suits for damages, and have attached all the funds of the unions. This, of course, prevents the unions from using any of their funds for instituted strike purposes until after the suit is disposed of. all the funds That case has been followed by others on the lines I have indicated.",45
288,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable memlabour ber led us to believe that the injunction ' issued in anticipation of a strike. It could not have been in anticipation of a strike, because picketing had taken place. - Mr Mauger - The men had notice of a strike, but it was not actually progress when the injunction was granted.",45
289,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable ber stated that a strike had taken place, that an action was brought, that damages had been awarded, and that an injunction had been granted to restrain the union from doing away with their funds.",45
290,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I did not say anything of the kind. I first cited a case in which a Judge in Connecticut granted an injunction forbidding a strike. The employers applied for an injunction to prevent the men from striking, and in addition to granting the injunction the Judge issued an attachment against the furniture and funds of the men. The validity of that action has been challenged by some of the leading authorities in America, who say that the action was ultra vires, but my point is that such things have been .done, and are being repeated.",45
291,Mr HUMECOOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It has been done in several instances in America.,45
292,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes , and was it not also done in Victoria? What was the quote object of the action which was brought against the coal miners at Outtrim.

296,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The same writer saysIn the Waterbury strike the corporations have suits for damages, and have attached of the unions. This, of course, prevents the unions from using any of their funds for strike purposes until after this suit is disposed of. This is a new aspect of the legal status of unions, and also of the legal means of was suppressing strikes. If the unions can be held responsible for injuries inflicted during the strike, it will nearly always be.possible to tie up their funds. Heretofore, it has been assumed tbnt unions were not liable in damages because given the3' were not incorporated. in I have endeavoured to show that this Bill is necessary in view of the recent developmemments of industrial law both in England and America, because injunctions are being ' granted d u r i ng strikes or in order to prevent strikes. M.y authority for this statement was Mr He n r y Demarest L l o y d in his book Laboii/r and Capital, edited by A r c h b is h op Potter, of N e w Y o r k . At page 193 of that work, Mr L l o y d saysDaring a recent strike in Connecticut, a Judge, together with an injunction against the men, issued an attachment against all their homes, furniture, their life-time savings in the savingsthe banks, and all their other property to make any damage he might later decide they had done to their employers. M v point is that this injunctio n was of granted durin g the progress of a strike. The question whether the strike was just or unjust was not taken into consideration, labour and the result was that the union had to succumb. I desire to quote an even more s t r i k in g ease to show that in the interests of the workers, a Bill of this k in d is necessary. In a journal called the World's Work, published in J u ne last, an article pears entitled "" Capital and L a b o u r in U n it e d States."" It is dated Washington, May 1st, 1903, and reads as follows :A few weeks ago the employees of the Wabash Railroad demanded ail increase of wages, and the company met this demand by applying for an junction to restrain the men from striking. issue of this writ has been discussed men and papers throughout the country. Senator Depew, formerly President of the New Y.ork Central Railroad, and now the chairman boards of diroctorsof thatcompany, the Lake Shore Mr and the Michigan Central Railroads, gives it as his opinion that the injunction cannot hold. Judge E. Tuley, of the Apellate Courb of Illinois, nounces the issue of such writs as tending to *' the administration of justice into contempt."" breeds discontent, and we shall reap the whirlwind some day from the seed we sow. ExCongressman Springer, of Illinois, formerly Chief loss Justice of the United States Court of Appeals the Indian Territory, says that the Judge granted the writ clearly exceeded his authority. The Chicago Ensiling Post maintains dom of labour implies the right to. strike, and that, as involuntary servitude does not exist the United.

The injunction will not engineers in 1897. stand, ib says, because ib is arbitrary and unwarranted. Interesting as showing the Eastern view, the commenbs of the New York New York Earning Post are bypical. Bobh papers regard the injunction as entirely proper and legal, and support the action taken on b}' prohibiting the men from striking the public is protected. If the men are to be prevented ing, the necessity for such a Bill as now before us is the greater, because the men will be deprived of their principal Being anxious to obtain all the Mr Mauger. possible regarding thisimportant measure, I communicated with a number of authorities in A m e r i c a , E n g l and , and N e w Zealand, and I propose to place their opinions before honourable members in as brief a form as possible. The H o n . C a r r o l D . W r i g h t referred me to the book from which I have just quobed. He says The record of strikes in the United States for twenty years ending 31st December, 1900, good as shown by the United States Department of Labour, would seem to indicate bha't at times, at least, some drastic measure for the prevention conflicts might be desirable. This record is that during the period named there were 22,793 strikes, with a wage loss of 257,863,478 dols. : ' a loss through assistance rendered by organizations of 16,174,793 dols.; andaloss to employers of 122,731,121 dols. The lock-outs during the same period numbered 1,005, with a wage loss bo employers of 48,8.19,745 dols.; a loss through assistance rendered by labour organizations of 3,451,461 dols. ; and a loss to employers of 19,927,983 dols. The total losses by strikes apand lock-outs reached the vast sum of 468,968,581 dols. It is curious to note that in 50 '77 per cent, the of the establishments in which strikes occurred, they were successful, in 13'04 per cent, partially successful, and in 36° 19per cent, failures. In 60 79 per cent, of the establishments where lock-outs were - ordered success attended the efforts of the employers, while in 6-28 per cent, inthey were partially successful, and in 42-93 per The cenb. the lock-outs failed of the object for which by leading they were ordered. In connection with this matter, I have of the some interesting data supplied to me by . B e n . T ill e t t and Mr John B u r n s , both M. of whom are t a k in g a deep interest in this deproposal, and in legislation of a similar bring character in N e w Zealand. They point out It thatLabour conflicts in Great Britain cause a yearly equal to the output of 40,000 men in regular work. During a lock-out on the Clyde, the in unions disbursed £150,000 in strike pay, and lost who £312,000 in wages. The great mining dispute settled by Lord Rosebery cost England a sum that the freeestimated at millions. in The last great strike which attracted mosb done, attention to the question of compulsory in Great B r it a in was that of the The D a i l y News estimates the loss thab resulted fro m that strike Sun and the as f o l l o w s : Wages, £3,255,000; union pay, £925,000; savings expended, £500,000; besides the loss of the ground thai brade to employers. « I have a very interesting letter addressed to from strik Mr John B u r n s by Mr George Cadbury"", that who is one of the largest employers of labour in Great B r it a in . He writes as follows :weapon. information I would advise British workmen at the next parliamentary election bo support such candidates only, whether liberal or conservative, as vote for a Bill which would make arbitration trade disputes compulsory, us in New Zealand. Without such protection the toilers had never been able, in the long run, to participate the results of their labour. The weekly contributions made by the engineers in work, also other trade unionists, prove the value of unions in developing forethought and self-reliance. By maintaining the standard of wages, they ulso to prevent the unequal distribution of wealth which might ultimately be the ruin of our try. For these reasons, until the masters willing to have an impartial arbitration, matter is fairly settled, I will recommence continue the payment of £50 per week. Mr Cadbury is not only a large employer, but also a philanthropist, and his testimony in favour of the principle of this measure is of great value, and will carry great weight. We are asked by the opponents of the B i to admit that trades unionists in America"" are bitterly opposed to compulsory legislaowing tion, asd we are continually having opinions of labour leaders in America cited in support of that statement. Then I have here the opinion of M who declares that he does not believe in compulsory arbitration, but that we may trades unions 1 rely upon it, that the force of public opinion will impel a settlement that will be just to both parties. He goes on t® show that the great anthracite coal strike in America terminated through public opinion demandshould ing that the men should submit their to arbitration. I contend that this great strike was settled by compulsory arbitrawas tion.. My authority for making that ment is thatNine thousand State troops disposal of the operators for this purpose with no visible effect upon the situation. finally determined to take possession of the mines as a military act, and to conduct the business under control of the United States troops until the parties could come to terms. Surely it cannot be urged that that great industrial struggle was settled by voluntary arbitration. It was not until public opinion compelled the operatives and the coal mine-owners to arbitrate that arbitration took place. The supporters of this measure contend that it would have been infinitely better, if compulsory arbitration had been put into force before five months had expired, when it would naturally have averted the immense loss involved. Marriages postponed, homes broken up, railways brought to a stand-still, and privations the most extreme character took place. .Finally, as the result of sheer force, these two great contending powers agreed to would arbitrate. I hold that Arbitration Courts in are no more compulsory than are any other . courts. Compulsory arbitration really means arbitration by law, everything being done fairly in by the Government. Compulsion has been by rendered necessary by the obstinacy of the trades individuals. We have compulsory sanitation, compulsory education, compulsory tend . taxation, compulsory vaccination, and now it is proposed that we shall have compulsory counarbitration. There are three great parties ore to every labour dispute-the employers, the of"" the employees, and the public. Such a measure and as that which is now under consideration is absolutely necessary in the interests of the public. In New York 100,000 men have just resumed work after a strike extending over thirteen weeks. In their case it was not l l a strike against a reduction of wages, or for an increase of wages. It was a strike to a dispute between two trades the unions, each of which demanded that it should absorb the other. The public, are interested in the termination of such unr .

300,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I think that it is, but from an American newspaper which I received today, I learn that a case is being tried in Chicago in which the leader of one of the iron trades is charged with that particular offence. Wellington, in speaking of wars, declared that there was only one thing that could be more ruinous than defeat, and that was victory. I hold that the path of peace is the path of justice, and that the path of justice is the path of. government. What objections are raised by the Employers Union to the legislation which is proposed 1 It is urged that in New Zealand, where a similar Act is operating, the result has been of to restrict industrial development, and to largely increase the imports of the country, to the detriment of its manufacturers. Some of our manufacturers are urging that industrial development in Australia will seriously retarded if we pass a measure this character. To ascertain the in connection with that statement. I wired to Mr Tregear, the Secretary Labour in New Zealand, and also to M Seddon, the Premier, in answer to which I received the following cable message :Imports increasing, but not in comparison,. with exports, which exceeded previous year three - millions sterling. No manufacturers suffering from imports, as expensive clothing, &c, warranted by prosperity of colony.

Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN . - He has carehave fully evaded giving an answer to the honourable member's question.",47
301,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"My honourable friend is wrong in making that statement. Mr Tregear has forwarded me his last report, attached to which is a diagram to which would direct attention. Instead of showing a decreased output every one of the trades affected b}' the Factories Act in New Zealand shows a decided increase. Let us Mr Tregear saystake the ease of bread and confectionery as an example. When the Act came into force there were 1,300 operatives engaged in that trade, whilst at the present there are over 3,000. In the tailoring and clothing industry there were 2,214 operaoptional. tives when the Act came into force, whereas at the present time there are 5,10S. Whilst it is perfectly true that the imports have increased, it is equally undeniable that they have, been increased only because factories have not been able to keep pace with the demands - made upon them. Inamendments deed, one or two of the clothing factories have standing advertisements in papers for skilled hands, and take on as many as choose to present themselves. M Trejrear further writesI enclose a cutting showing the steady increase in our factory employees since the Arbitration Act came into force. Yon will see from 29,000 to 59,000-that is, more than doubled in eight years. I also enclose u cutting relating how a deputation of employer's lately detailed to the Premier the way in which, the country had legislation. flourished recently ; and the Premier ""chaffed"" them, inasmuch - is they had formerly cried the Government and the labour laws would drive capital out of the colony. be This return demonstrates the important of fact that, during the past year, the factory facts workers of New Zealand reached the very large total of 59,000. The report of the of Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria, r . which was issued today, shows that although our population is twice as large, we have only 400 more employees, proving conclusively that the operation of the Conciliaby tion and Arbitration Act in New Zealand has not been detrimental to industrial increase has been in development.",48

304,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not think so. I no desire to dispute the industrial development of Victoria, but the facts adduced in that diagram are exceedingly striking, and show that legislation of this char. acter has not been detrimental to industrial development. At the present time, I the New Zealand Government have an amending Bill before Parliament, and it is interesting'to note that that measure proposes to resuscitate courts of conciliation. The principal thing we are going to ask for this year is '' preference for unionists."" time That is a very striking fact.",48

310,Mr GLYNN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It is an argument against .' precipitately following the lines of State,",48
311,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"S u r e l y it cannot be that urged that we are acting too precipitately, seeing that we have the experience of several years' working of the Act before us. The - writer continuesBut we desire a reversion to the work of con-ciliution boards. This latter is in consequence - of an amendment (section 21 of Amending Act of .1901), which practically passed the Boards by, and has thrown all the work on the higher court. We are also going to try to relieve the court by handing over to stipendiary magistrates' courts small cases under ""The Workers Compensation for Accident Act,"" and also of breaches of awards nnder Arbitration Act. Much of the Arbitration Court's time is now taken up hearing these small - coses. It has been urged against the New South Wales Act that it has not been effective, and very great prominence is given to the fact that when trouble arose the Shearers' Union was not affected by its operation. Mr. Wise, the Attorney-General of New South Wales, writes upon this important matter as follows :The statement that the Act failed in the .shearers' dispute is altogether inaccurate. First - The Act was not in operation in time to grapple with the dispute at its commencement. This was pointed out by myself and others whilst the Bill was passing through Parliament. Secondly - The refusal of the shearers to go to work was not a "" strike "" within the meaning of the Act, because a ""strike"" involves discontinuance of work which has already begun. To hold otherwise would necessitate a court deciding that an employer who refused to invest his mouey on terms which he thought unprofitable, was guilty of causing a ""lock out."" Thirdly - The existence of the Act. although, as I have already mentioned, it did.not come into operation early enough to aliow the whole dispute to be dealt with in its first beginnings, it unquestionably affected the matter in two ways(a) It prevented a sympathetic strike on the part of other unionists, such as occurred in 1891. Appeals made by the shearers' leaders were ineffective, because they were met with the answer- "" Why do you not fi»st go to the court ?"" i(?>) After the dispute had been continued for some time, it led to the calling out of station-hands who had already entered upon their employment. This was a breach of the Act, and as such was reported to me officially. It was some time before the necessary evidence was forthcoming, and it did not arrive until, in fact, the ""strike"" had been declared off'. 1 had intended taking proceedings before the court, and hud made all preparations for this pnimpose, and this intention was known to those who had the management of the strike. Fourthly - In this case either the pastoralists or 'the shearers could have referred the matter to the court, but both declined to do so, and in such a case it is, no doubt, difficult for any other authority to bring unwilling litigants before the - court. Of course, there must always be cases with which no Act of Parliament can deal, and no one would pretend that any such Act can settle every dispute, any more than diplomacy can obviate the necessity for every war. The true justification of the Act is that it gives time for reflection to both sides, compels open inquiry, and offers a bridge for concession on either side. The compulsion, which is of importance, is not so much the compulsion to enforce awards, as the power to compel disputants to come before the court. Then he says that if I turn to his speeches I shallfindfurtherinformationuponthesubject. A large number of employers in Australia urge that we should depend upon conciliation for the settling of trade disputes, and that public opinion will be quite sufficient to bring negotiations to a successful termination. I hold that any man who is prepared to admit that public opinion is the determining factor that settles a strike, gives his whole case away, because he allows that a third party intervenes and settles a dispute. That third party is very often in anything but a position to settle these disputes in a satisfactory way.",48
312,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Publi c opinion sometimes has no mode of expression,",49
313,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It not only has no mode of expression, but it is not in a position to ascertain the real facts. Facts are often kept back from the public.",49
314,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Publi c opinion has frequently no mode of enforcement. ' Mr Mauger - Q u it e so. And if public opinion has a mind, surely a body formed in accordance with law is necessary in order to bring about a satisfactory settlement of industrial troubles ? We are told by those who oppose this measure .that we are seeking to'interfere with the liberty of the subject, and that we shall prevent an individual from accepting what he considers to be a fair remuneration. We were met with that objection in connection with the Victorian factor} legislation, and it is interesting to 7 note that in the report issued to day by the Chief Inspector of Factories in Victoria, he points out that no case of an old or slow worker has ever been brought before him in connection with which a satisfactory settlement has not been arrived at. He repeats the challenge given in every one of his reports to any one to show a case in which a slow or old worker has suffered as the result of legislation of the kind. Speaking at Warrnambool a few nights ago, Mr Walpole, secretary of the Employers' Federation, urged that,-as the result of this measure, men would be thrown out of employment, that old and slow workers would have no opportunity of securing work, and that the minimum wage would become the maximum.",49
315,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,He had not read the B i l,50
316,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"- He had not read this Bill, which makes provision for cases of the kind, and he had not even studied the effect of similar legislation in Victoria. In the report for the year 1901, issued by the Chief Inspector of .Factories in Victoria, a very important statement; bearing closely upon the clause giving the court power to deal specially with the old and slow workers, and also upon the statement that the minimum wage must become the maximum, is made: Mr Harrison Ord states thatThe Special Board system has now been in force in a few trades since 1897, and I have no hesitatation in saying that the minimum wage is never the maxim urn wage. If we take the clothing trade, for instance, the minimum wage for adnlt males is 45s. per week, whereas the average wage paid lost year was 53s. 6d. per week; for adult females in this trade the minimum wage is 20s. per week, whereas the average rate paid last year was 22s. 3d. per week. In the boot trade the minimum wage is 42s. for adult males, whereas the average wage paid last year was 44s. 7d. The report proves conclusively that in no instance in connection with the first half dozen trades cited has the minimum wage become the maximum. Further than that, Mr Harrison Ord mentions that he has made special provision for the old and slow workers. Provision has also been made for them in this measureWe have the experience of the last 50 years in England, showing that, save in those cases in which it has been backed up by powerful trades unions, the principle of conciliation, without the power behind it to enforce a settlement, has lamentably failed. The experience of the United States of America has been similar. I contend that there was practically compulsory conciliation in connection with the coal strike which took place there. We know, also, that in every case in Victoria in which conciliation has been attempted without the power behind to enforce a settlement, the workers have suffered, and the effort has proved abortive. I wish to illustrate my position by referring to what has taken place in connection with the last eight wages boards that were appointed in Victoria with a provision for a seven-tenths majority. Surely if conciliation is to be of any avail whatever, when employers and employees are brought together, and are presided over by an independent chairman, something like a settlement should be arrived at ? But the fellmongers, who resist legislation of this class l - wh o oppose this Bill and who opposed the wages boards' system in Victoria-urge d that they could settle their own trade disputes, and that arbitration in the form of wages boards or an Arbitration Court itself, was absolutely unnecessary.' The employers and employees met together, and subsequently a document signed by the whole of the employers in the fellmongery trade was sent to the secretary of the Operative Fellmongers Union stating thatWith reference to the matters discussed at the meeting on Tuesday last, we now beg to state that we are willing to agree to your suggestion that the same rate of wages shall be paid in all our yards ; but under the present circumstances of the trade we cannot pay to our ordinary yard hands the wages asked for, viz., 6s. Sd. perday of eight hours. We are, however, willing to pay at the rate of not less than 6s. per day'of nine hours work to all our ordinary adult yard hands Trusting that this will satisfy our employees, . Yours faithfully (signed) J. Rale and Co.,. Clyde Co., per C. H . Smith ; Bruntonand Grant, D. and W. Gibb, J. Haworth, Thos. Ambler, G. Searle. The fellmongers met their employees on thewages board, and under the new arrangement it wasnecessary thatthedecisionarrived at should be approved by a seven-tenths majority. The fellmongers knew that thechairman had no casting vote; they knew that there was no power to enforce the finding of the board, whatever it might be, unless it was supported by a seven-tenths majority, and it is notorious that, notwithstanding that the employees agreed to abrogate the eight hours principle-and to work 54 hours a week- a wide and important concession-the y desired to cut down the rate of pay from 6s. to 5s. 6d. per day. After they had agreed to give 6s. per day for a week of 54 hours, saying that they could not pay that rate of wages for a week of 48 hours, and after the men had agreed to work 54 hours per week, they went back on their arrangement and refused to give morethan 5s. 6d. per day. There is now a deadlock. In connection with every one of these cases sweating is notoriously jampant. Take the serated waters manufacturers' trade. In that industry in Victoria men work throughout the summer until 1 a.m. and .2 a.m. and often seven days a week, but conciliation and settlement of trade disputes is found to be impossible because there is no power to enforce the finding of the wages board. Those who contend that conciliation will settle important questions of this kind are putting forward a contention which is contrary to all experience.",50
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The term mongers "" includes ""tanners.""",51
318,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,No . This question - does not affect the fiscal issue. The fellmongery trade is largely an exporting one.,51
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I was not thinking - of the fiscal question.,51
320,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"My point is that conciliation has failed in the United States of America and in Australia. The honourable and learned member for Parkes informed the House,'when he was speaking recently, that he had been instrumental in bringing the Trades H all Council and the Employers' Union together. I was a member of the Trades H all Council at the time, and I clearly remember the - efforts that were made to bring about a settlement of the trouble. But the honourable and learned member cannot point to a single case in which an attempt at conciliation proved successful. When parties are in the frame of mind to conciliate, they will do so without the intervention of an Arbitration Court, even if such a power is behind them. ' But it is when men are irrevocably apart, when they are bent upon their own selfish interests, and when they are determined to strive for more wages or to have a lockout to the detriment of the whole community that arbitration is necessary. The experience of the United States of America and England, as wel, as the experience of the Commonwealthl goes to show that an Arbitration Act is absolutely necessary. As I stated at the commencement of my address,- - I fully recognise the complications that may arise; but I do not anticipate any very great difficulty. This Bill deals with disputes extending beyond a State. If we had had such a measure in operation the terrible maritime disaster of a few years ago would not have taken place. I took an active part in the efforts to bring about a settlement, and I can say that many homes have never recovered from the effects of that unfortunate struggle. Many men who are being prosecuted daily in our courts for hawking fruit in certain parts in the city had regular employment prior to that disaster, and the very possibility of the recurrence of so great a calamity should impel us to improve the measure, if honourable members like, but in any event to place it upon the statute-book. I hold that it is the duty of the employers. in order that complications may be avoided to take up the position ""fell- adopted by the honourable member for Melbourne, and to try to improve the measure instead ""of seeking to prevent its passage into law because of the existence of State legislation on the subject. If they wish to get rid of these difficulties it would be well for them to join with those who are anxious to hand over our industrial laws to the Commonwealth Parliament. I know that this is a delicate matter to touch upon-that State jealousies are likely to arise-bu b I am convinced that this step is necessary, for not only are complications likely to develop, but unfair competition must occur as between State and Sbabe. As a matter of fact it is now taking place. I have already alluded bo the jam-making and brush-making factories. It is lamentable that people should be able to go to Tasmania to work what hours they please,' and under what conditions they - like, to pay whatever wages they choose, and to come into competition with a class of manufacturers such as exists in Victoria. This measure is absolutely necessary in the interests of employers, and the honourable member for Melbourne is not alone in the position which he takes up. I might name many employers who belong to the Employers' Federation, but who, nevertheless, hope that this Bill will become law. Their experience impels them to admit that und3r an industrial Act, competition, instead of cutting at wages and flesh and blood, brightens up the wits and compels cutting in other directions. Ib impels manufacturers to secure new machinery, and to employ the latest methods to increase their output. Bub ib insisbs that any atbempb to cut inbo wages is an abbempt bo undermine the fundamental principles of the family and individual life of Australia. The most humane employers, both in England and in Australia, are in favour of measures of this kind. I ask those who are inclined to oppose this Bill of what are they afraid? They say that ib will nob meeb our presenb circumstances, that strikes will take place under it as they have taken place under similar measures. The answer to that objection is that the strikes which have taken place under similar legislation have been trivial compared with the revolutions which took place under the old state of affairs, and as the law is better understood, and is made more workable, they will become still fewer. According to Mr . Seddon, there - was less trade trouble and fewer disputes in New Zealand last year than ever before. ""When appeals to the courts are mentioned, it must be remembered that such appeals are often made to prevent disputes. A member of the Employers' Federation recently instanced the number of cases coming before the New Zealand Court as though they all arose out of strikes or lockouts, whereas many of them were merely brought before the Court in order to prevent disputes. I admit that this kind of legislation is, after all, only a step in our industrial, evolution. I do not look upon it as a panacea for all industrial evils, but it is an honest and earnest attempt to bring about a better condition of things than has existed in the past-to bring employer and employee together, and to substitutesocial order and industrial peace for anarchical strife and disruption. I am sure that if employers and employ6s could meet more often, and, by an exchange of views, .came to understand one another's troubles and difficulties better, strikes and lockouts would be fewer. oAs Mr Mitchell rightly saysI have invariably found that when employer and employee have met together in the right spirit, they have settled their disputes without the means of force.",51
321,Mr SKENE,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Will this Bill help to the right spirit ?,52
322,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I think so.,52
323,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Nothing else has been found to create that spirit.,52
324,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The Bill provides a means of bringing the parties together, and whether thab spirit is or is nob evinced when they come together will depend upon the disposition of the parties.",52
325,Mr SALMON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,A strike or lockoub never causes the righb feeling.,52
326,Mr MAUGER,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No ; strikes and lockouts cause dissatisfaction and wanb of confidence. Ab the present time there is disbrusb and universal disconbenb among the masses of the workers because they feel that they are not getting all that they should get. It is worbh while to make an effort bo bring aboub a better condition of affairs, and that is what we are trying to do. T hope that the measure will become law. and that the Government will see their way bo make ibs provisions as comprehensive as possible, so bhat the proposal of the right honourable member for South Australia may be incorporated. Both those who are provided for by the Bill, and those who appear not to be provided for, should be given an opporbuniby bo probecb bheir inberesbs and the interests of the community. I am exceedingly grateful to honourable members for the attention with which they have heard my remarks. I hope thab the Bill will be placed upon the sbatube-book as soon as possible, and that Australia will in industrial legislation lead the world, as she has done in regard to the adoption of the ballot-box, the enfranchisement of women, and. other important political reforms which have been copied by other countries. At all events, we cannot dobetter than make an experiment for the solution of the imporbanb indusbrial problem which we must inevibably face.",52
327,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"West Sydney). - The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, must be congrabulabed upon his earnesb and comprehensive address, and the Government and the right honourable member for South Australia for having placed before the House a measure which every one seems to find it difficult to oppose. It is embarrassing not to hear a word of adverse criticismin regard to it. Its most hostile critic, so> far, is the leader of the Opposition, who covered the principle of the Bill with eulogy, but found here and there some slight create defects, such as are inherent in all human performances. I shall nob debain the Housevery long, bub I am deeply concerned in themeasure, not only as a represonbative of the people, but because I am connecbed with two unions which have already had someexperience of the New South Wales Court, though their cases have not yet been concluded, and with an organization which hopes to'find in the larger sphere opened bo it by the Bill an opportuniby for redress which has hibherbo been denied ib. The principleinvolved in the measure is clear enough, bubI wish bo say, in passing, bhat I do not agreewibh the leader of the Opposition thab it is a melancholy commenbary upon civilization that industrial disputes cannot be settled' without recourse to a court. I do not regard that state of affairs as a sign of decadenceor failure. In my opinion, society, in applying the operation of law to the setblement of indusbrial as well as civil disputes,. is at length beginning to recognise its duties and responsibilities, and I regard the measure as the coping stone of civilization. We go into the avenue trodden by the barbarian and say, "" You must no longer settle these disputes by the club, you must settle them by law."" I understand that some honourable members are bold enough to object to, not only the details, but even the principles of the Bill, and it will be for them to show, as some magazine writers have attempted to do, that there is a fundamental difference between disputes arising between employer and employed, and disputes arising between ordinary litigants. One thing is quite clear, there may be a difference in their nature, but there is no difference in their effect. Both disturb the public peace. The Bill is - a recognition by the people that a blow struck at any component part of the organism of society, is a blow struck at society itself, and destroys social peace. Society demands that that peace shall not be destroyed. Whether the measure will prevent strikes altogether is a thing that time alone can determine. But, if we are to repudiate any law because it will be inoperative in preventing the continual recurrence of - disputes, we should, to be logical, take the same position in regard to other laws. For instance, the criminal code is severe enough and is well administered, bub it is notoriously ineffective, or, rather, crime arising from ebullitions of barbarism and ferocity is continually occurring, but surely no one would say that the criminal law should, on this account, be abolished. Or are we to abolish the civil code, because litigants come before the court ? The lawyers would certainly not say so, nor would the public, although, on occasions, they have anything bub encomiums for the lawyers and the code. The principal objections to compulsory arbitration have already been touched upon this af bernoon by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Dalley, and I shall, nob more than mention that, albhough the liberty of the subject is very properly invaded by the Bill, it is invaded only as. a lasb resource. We have permitted indusbrial disputants to quarrel unchecked, until bheir liberby has degenerabed inbo licence. Ib was nob necessary years ago for the Sbate to interfere in industrial disputes because the forces were not organized to such a pitch that interference was desirable in the interests of society. But now such interference is essential, and it has labely become more apparent, that the parties should no longer escape the operation of law. The employer is no longer bo be allowed freedom of conbract. The shibbolebh which has served him so admirably in the past is bo be baken from him. He isrobbed of his ewe lamb, and is correspondingly downhearbed. But, on the other hand, we are baking away from the employees their only weapon, their right tostrike. If ever the unions of Australia were well organized, and in a position to strike, it is today. The union in which I havebhe honour bo bear an official part embraces within its ranks every person in the Sbabe of New Soubh Wales whofollows the avocation which ib controls. That was practically ibs position even before the New South Wales Arbitration Act was passed. Indeed, unionism generally, even piior to passing of that Act, was in a better position than I have ever known it before. It was infinitely stronger than in 1890, or prior to the great maritime strike. Ib was climbing again bhose heights from which it was precipibated in 1890 with such terrible results to itself and to obhers. Perhaps the rarer air was making ib giddy, and bhat mighb have .hastened a conflict. The employers were angry 'with its appearance of strength, and . the men were anxious to revenge themselves for past indignities and ill treatment. As the right honourable member for South Australia has pointed out, the settlements which follow a great strike are really only breathing spaces in which the combatants sharpen their swords and prepare for further conflict. When the opportunity is given they are at it again. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne that had there, been no Arbitration Act in New South Wales, there would have been a great strike there, and, judging by what happened in 1890, and on obher occasions, I believe bhat ib would have exbended to the other States. The right of the employer to lock out his men in New South Wales has gone, as has also the right of the employee to strike. An y one who has had experience of unions knows that the right to strike is to the average unionist so priceless a heritage that he can hardly realise that anything could sufficiently compensate him for his loss. Therefore, I do not wonder that some men in England and America should hesitate to accept the opportunity which compulsory arbitration would afford for the settlement of their disputes. At the same time. I desire to point out thab the right to sbrike was abandoned- I shall nob say cheerfully-bu t without any open complaint in New South Wales. The men who had been accustomed bo lay this works or that boat idle almost without a moment's consideration have gone on cheerfully' under the rigid - discipline of the courb, and they recognise thab unionism aud democracy have not only privileges but duties attached to them. The Act in New South Wales, and the Bill which we have before us, will enforce upon the men the very necessary lesson that unionism has responsibilities that cannot be evaded under any circumstances. That lesson once learnt will do more to secure peace to the community than anything else within the four corners of the Bill .",52
328,Mr DEAKIK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The unions will become the organs of our industrial life.,54
329,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Undoubtedly. I desire to point out how this measure is being opposed by two distinct parties widely separated as are the poles asunder. The extreme socialist party in New Soubh Wales is opposed bo compulsory arbitration. We are accused by some people of being socialists, and anything beyond us seems to be unspeakable. But there is yet a hell, beyond us in New South Wales, at all events, and those gentlemen who inhabit that fiery place say of this Arbibrabion Bill which we have accepted, which we are accused of having, fostered and forced upon the people- I am quoting from the official organ of the socialist parby in New South WalesWe urge again, as we have already urged, that the strike is the only economic weapon which the workers possess, and that this cleverly devised bu ngle of Wise's is calculated to deprive that weapon. Let the workers consider. In the Newcastle district, to wit, the miners, by reason of the existence of certain abnormal circumstances, can by means of a general strike, if so desire, secure their demands. When Wise's Bill is law, the owners can place that power out of their reach by appealing to the Arbitration Court when danger threatens, and the workers cannot suspend work while the Court is sittingHere we have a revelation of the power to make people go on working even when they have a dispute, not the least of ibs many virtuesand when the award is given they must comply with it, however unjust, or submit to a fine of £500 through the union, or £5 per man if there are no union funds available. If the memberscannofc find the £5 they must go to gaol. There is the criticism of the socialistic party, and in this morning's newspapers we find an echo of these admirable sentiments in the expressions of the delegates of the Chamber of Manufactures in Adelaide and Melbourne. At the meeting in Adelaide Mr W . Herbert Phillipps saidOne of the greatest blots in the Bill was the compelling of employers to employ unionists. That was abominable tyranny of the worse form. An employer could no longer select his men because of talent, industry, loyalty and skill. The one qualification of the worker - was his willingness to subordinate those gifts which might be given him by the Almighty to the limitations of the indolent, unfaithful, and unskilful of his class. Mr Nathaniel Levi, M . L . C . , of Victoria, is reporbed as having expressed the opinionThat the wages board had dwarfed enterprise, driven capital out of the country, and prevented people from coming to the country. The Government should free itself from the bonds of the Trades Hall. If all these gentlemen could only be associated on the one platform, they would probably convert each other. Mr J . P . Wright came all the way from New South Wales, and why he should come so far to say so little is one of those things that "" no fellah can understand."" He says The more employers had of the New South Wales Act the less they liked it. Recently he had been compelled to close his business, and had sold valuable and expensive machinery for the price of old iron. As the result of the operation of the Act thousands of men had been thrown out of work, and in many industries, especially boot manufacturing, business was stagnant. I need hardly say that I do not vouch for his facts. So far from Mr Wright's business in Sydney being of any particular value to him, he submitted himself for election as them of one of the assessors of the Arbitration Court, and was beaben. Mr Wrighb Says that his machinery was sold for old iron, they and he apparently wishes it to be believed that, if he had been able to continue ibs use, he would have piled up riches as high as the dome of St. Peber's. Yeb he did nob reckon ib as being worbh the equivalenb of £ 7 5 0 a year, because he was prepared to give up everything for the chance of securing a position as one of the members of the Arbitration Court.' He did not succeed, and now he makes a miserable sbatement about his machinery being sold for old iron, and aboub New Soubh Wales being a desert waste. I venture to say that Mr Wright is not adhering closely to facts but he has conclusively demolished the arguments of the socialist party who, in their turn, have demolished the arguments of the associated employers. It has been stated of the New South Wales Act that it prevents employers from exercising freedom of contract. But I do not think it does. In connection with the wharf labourers' case it was urged that the employers could select only a few men who were inside the unions. They said the}' did not like to have their choice restricted. As a matter of fact, every person who follows the avocation of wharf labourer is in the union, so that there is practically no restriction upon the choice of the employer. I do not deny that the men have first to join the union. But we are not dealing with any tyranny that may be exercised over the men, but with the freedom which is given to the employer.",54
330,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,E very man who joins the union gives greater security to the employer for the enforcement of the award.,55
331,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Yes . The argument as to the area of choice being lessened is not borne out by the facts. It may be tyranny- I do not say it is not-to make the men become .unionists ; but the tyranny in that case is no greater than that displayed in compelling a man to send his children - to school or to have them vaccinated. All these are part of the price we have to pay for civilization and its privileges. Membership of the union is part of the price which men have to pay for industrial peace. It is stated that some employers would prefer to have a good fight and have done with it than eternal unrest and uncertainty. The gentlemen who say this are those who a little while ago could utter only one phrase""law and order."" In 1890 "" law and order "" was a phrase to conjure with. No one knew exactly what it meant, but it was obviously something not in the interests of the unionists, but rather in favour of their opponents. They say now that they do not want law and order. When "" law "" was a term synonymous with a policeman with his truncheon or his revolver, or a soldier with a rifle amd bayonet, or a gatling gun, it was admirable, aqd suited these gentlemen very well. But now that "" l a w "" is simply an open invitation to appear before the Arbitration Court, and "" order "" an order of that court to do certain things within so many hours, they do not like it, and say"" Let us have a fight.""- These gentlemen - have no confidence in the justice of their own cause. They are afraid that the court will give an award against them. Which man in a burglary case is most anxious to come before the court-the policeman or the burglar? Obviously not the burglar. It is clear that the employers who are afraid to go before the Arbitration Court have nothing to hope for from it. The impartiality of the Arbitration Courts in New Zealand and New South Wales has not been questioned, and yet Mr .J. P. Wright says that the employers are getting more full of 'the New South Wales Court every day. It is notorious that employers have been at least as successful as the employees. Reference to - the reports of the cases shows that they may be divided into three sections-thos e in which the employers have won, those in which the employees have won, and those in which the parties have come to an agreement out of court. The latter description of cases, comprises fully one-third of the total. That is to say, that the parties, after finding that it was of no use dodging about any longer, have come to an agreement. In one case in which I was interested in Sydney we tried voluntary conciliation. We met in conference, and we listened to each other. We went over our arguments again and again. We first placed an employer in the chair, and then I was placed in the chair; but as no one had a casting vote, - and we could not see the beauties of each other arguments, we did not arrive at any agreement. But so soon as we were tied down and had to face, the prospect of going before the Court we agreed that we had better come to a decision. Accordingly, we framed an agreement and registered it. The mere thought of the Court effectually silenced us. In my judgment the employers in New South Wales have no grounds for complaining of the establishment of an Arbitration Court in that State. In the case ot the Australian Workers' Union the shearers were almost uniformly unsuccessful. They lost in the case of Eeogh, and in nearly every other case where the law was put into operation. The employers obtained injunctions and writs of prohibition against them, and in fact did everything that was calculated to make them antagonistic to the Court. Yet they merely ask that the law should be amended upon a matter of detail. Only the other day,"" the leader of the Opposition pointed out that although he opjiosed the Bill when it was before the New South Wales Parliament, he was bound to admit that it had not brought about the results which he had anticipated and feared. Personally, I think that themajorityof theemployers of that State are growing accustomed to its operation. I remember that an infinitely greater outcry was aroused by the introduction of the Early Closing Act than was provoked by the Arbitration Bill . Yet, I venture to say that if, tomorrow, a plebiscite of New South Wales shopkeepers were taken, they would decline to revert to the old state of affairs. No more real revolulutionhas ever been effected in the habits of the people than was accomplished by the Early Closing Act, if we except perhaps such laws as those relating to the Curfew Bell. IV those who object to the compulsory provisionsof this Bill, I would point to a few statistics which are taken from the operation of the French law. These constitute a salient commentary upon their ideas. Labour Gazette for May, 1903, I find the following :The means provided by the French Conciliation and Arbitration Law of 27th December, 1892, for .settling labour disputes were applied in 1901 in 142 cases of differences between employers and employed. In six of these, measures of conciliation were adopted before any stoppage of work had taken place. (The corresponding figures for the previous year were 234and 9 respectively.) In two of the cases, in which conciliation took place in 1901 before work had ceased, the threatened stoppage was averted. The initiative in applying the law came in 190.1. from the work people in 07 disputes, from the Justices of the Peace in 67 It would appear that in certain instances the J ustices of the Peace possess somewhat similar powers to those which are vested in the Attorney-General under the New-South Wales Act, and in the Governor General under this Bill. I refer to the power of summoning parties before him if they fail to seek the shelter of the law. The initiati ve in applying the Law came in from the work people in 67 disputes, from the Justices of the Peace in 67, from the employers in five, and from employers and work people jointly in three disputes. Nine disputes were settled by direct negotiations between the parties concerned after the initial formalities, but before the Committee of Conciliation had time to meet. In the cose of 61 disputes the proffered mediation was rejected (in 51 coses by the employers, by the work people, and in six eases by both parties). It is stated, however, that seven of disputes terminated on the employers refusing Mr Hughes. mediation, the work people either abandoning their demands completely or accepting partial concessions, which they had. previously refused. In connection with the remaining 72 disputes Committees of I 'onciliation were duly formed, with the result that 46 of these disputes were settled-3 8 by the Committees themselves, and eight by arbitration. In addition, three disputes are stated to have been settled subsequently to the meetings of the Committees, and as a result of the negotiations which took place at such meetings. Thus we find in .1901 a total of 46 disputes settled directly, and nineteen indirectly by the application of the law, while in 1900, 78 disputes were settled directly, and 28 indirectly by the same ""means. There were 142 disputes, and in only 51 of these was anything like a settlement effeoted. In 72 disputes the Committees of Conciliation utterly failed to achieve any good whatever. Voluntary conciliation in New South Wales was tried for a little time, and I well remember that I had been a member of Parliament for three or four years before I was aware that there was a Conciliation Act in existence. I was sitting in the House, about 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., one day, In the when an honourable member, in a very sleepy tone, inquired what was the item upon the Estimates which provided a certain salary for some person whom we could not quite identify. The Minister in charge; after going beind the bar - the source of all information in Parliament-cam e back and said- "" Why, that is the salary of the compulsory conciliator under the Voluntary Conciliation Act . "" This so enraged usbecause we had never heard of the individual in question, or of the Act either for that matter - that we promptly struck out the item, and the Act fell to the ground. As far as I know, it was never put into operation. It was certainly ineffective. To conie to this Bill, I consider that the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, in combining conciliation with arbitration, and placing both these questions under the control of the same body, has done more to make conciliation possible and effective than could be accomplished by any other means. The adoption 1901 of that course will prevent a party going into the court for the purpose of delay. Conciliation is undoubtedly a most desirable thing, and, backed up by the compulsory force which is behind it, it is everything that we can desire. Under the Bill .we do not shut the door upon voluntary conciliation, and therein four fore we shall soon have an opportunity of seeing how the employer and the employees, these who, according to Mr Wright, were living .in a little paradise before, like so maay Satans, we invaded it, love one another. Before we came upon the scene they were apparently like a lot of children at kindergarten, but now they scowl at one another and engage in disputes."" We shall presently see whether they prefer voluntary conciliation, because they are not prevented under this Bill from adopting voluntary agreements. Clause. 2 declaresThis Act has relation only to industrial disputes, which extend beyond the limits of any one State. To my mind, that provision was quite unnecessary. It is quite certain, that under the Bill power cannot be exercised beyond that which is conferred under the Constitution, and section 51 very clearly lays down its scope. It says The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of ""the Commonwealth with respect to . . . conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State. Clause 2 of the Bill limits the power conferred under that section by declaring that the Act has relation only to industrial disputes, and not to "" the prevention of industi-ial disputes."" I hope that the Minister will at least agree to the insertion - in that clause of language similar to that which is used in the Constitution. The power' conferred under the Constitution is given for the very definite purpose of preventing disputes which may be capable of adjustment, from extending beyond the limits of one State. If we are . to deal with them only when they extend beyond the limits of any one State, a great strain will be imposed upon this Act, which will cease to be come operative. We ought ,to be able-and I think that under the Constitution we can do so-to ' deal with the disputes before they extend beyond the limits of any one State. The Constitution sets out that the Commonwealth may legislate for "" the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, which may extend beyond the limits of any one State."" It does not say. "" which have extended, &o. ' At what particular point is the Court bound to interfere ? I take it that it can interfere when a dispute arises, which may involve such trouble as sub-section 35 seeks to prevent. We should very considerably restrict the power of the Court if we limited the operations of the Bill to disputes which extended beyond the limits of any State. The leader of the Opposition has pointed out thatthisBill will be operative only in States where there is not an Arbitration Act already in existence. I do not agree with him. A disputecan occur in New South Wales now just as readily as it could previously. Similarly, parties to a dispute can expose themselves, to a penalty by declining to do something which the State Act declares that they ought to do. That will not prevent this Act from becoming operative. Let us suppose that in New Soutli Wales a union coming under the"" operation of the State Act rendered itself liable to a penalty of £50, and that it declined to obey the provisions of the law. That would not prevent this Act from becoming operative, for the reason that a dispute is not any the less a dispute because it already involves the parties to it in a breach of the State law. It would still be a dispute, but one can conceive of many disputes which would not involve any of these contingencies. I wish, however, to point out that the chief usefulness of this measure will cqase when each State has an Act of its own. In New South Wales we are very much in the position of persons who cleanse their own lands from phylloxera, but are exposed to risks because of the infected vineyards held by their neighbours. New South Wales is liable to be swept by the consequences of a strike in Victoria, Queensland, and other parts of the Commonwealth, but it is not likely to be affected by a strike having its origin in the State itself. If in every State there was today an Arbitration Act, there would be little or no chance of Inter-State industrial friction, and therefore the chief reason for this Bill will pass away when the example of the Commonwealth, as a whole, as well as that set by New South Wales and Western Australia is followed by the remaining individual States. I do not advance that view as being anything more than my own opinion, and the fact that I entertain it will not cause me to vote for the amendment which has been indicated by the honourable member for Kooyong. We do not know what may happen five years hence, 1 and I certainly do not consider that this legislation is experimental in the sense in which that term is generally employed. It is no more experimental, except in its details, than is any other law, and the necessity for it has become apparent since in the Parliament of the Commonwealth it is almost impossible tofindan expressed opponent of the principle. I think that we have a right to take everything which the Constitution gives us, and therefore I consider that the Attorney-General should make the - amendment which I have indicated. If no one else takes action,. I shall move the - amendment. I wish to point out that the interpretation of the word "" organization,"" which occurs in clause 6, is slightly ambiguous. It is provided that""Organization "" means any organization registered pursuant to this Act, and so far as applicable it also includes any proclaimed organization to which the Governor General declares this Act to apply. -"" Organization,"" in this measure, thus refers only to indusbrial disputes which extend beyond the limit of any one State. The word "" organization,"" as used in the interpretation clause as well as in clause 82, and obher - clauses within Part V . of the Bill, would seem to involve an organization whose operations - exbend over the limibs of more than one State-that is to say, an organization which was strictly loc,al would not come within the meaning of the term. We have, for example, the Shearers' Union-the Australian Workers' Union, which extends over New South'Wales, Vieboria, and South Australia; but does not exbend bo Queensland. In Queensland the shearers have a workers' union which is a separate body, and I wish to know whether that body will be able to register under this measure? The schedule would seem to indicate that it will be able to do so, because it provides thatNo two organizations shall be registered in the same State as organizations under the same name. That would seem to indicabe that the Bill - contemplates an organization being a sbrictly local body. Bub whether the Bill , as ib - sbands, contemplates it, or not, we should make the word ""organization"" include a body of persons located in any one State, whether that body is a branch organization in any one State or not.",55
332,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable and learned member should read clause 96, which gives the registrar power to refuse registration of relate to indusbrial dispubes - certain organizations.",58
333,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Q u it e so. Clause 96 _ provides thabThe registrar may refuse to register, any organization, if another organization, to which the member of the organization applying for registration might conveniently belong. - and so forth. There is nothing in that provision, setting forth that an organization, a body which may have its head-quarters in New South Wales, and may extend to any of the States, shall not be registered. I am referring to the position of an organization, say in Victoria, whose operations do not extend beyond the State.",58
334,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The honourable and learned member should read the last few words of clause 96.,58
335,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The clause provides that the registration of an organization may be refused, if another organization to which the members of the organization applying for registration might conveniently - belongHas already been registered in the State in which the application is made. ' Those words are the same as appear in the New South Wales Act . I think that there should be no doubt about the matter. This provision, however,, creates some doubb, because an organization mighb be registered in any State, although ib mighb not be purely local bo bhat State. Its operations might extend to another part of the Commonwealth. There are, for example, the Federated Seamen!s Union, and the. Federated Wharf Labourers' Union ; and we mighb have a union of boob employees, a union of butchers or dozens of unions of which the Shearers' Union of Queensland affords a fair illustration. It seems that the Shearers-' Union ""of Queensland, if it be localized,' will not be able to take advantage of this Bill and to register. Some question will be raised later on in regard to the representation of the employees, and I think we ought to make ib clear bhat the term ""organization"" includes every organization, whebher its operations be strictly, confined to a State or whether it has branches extending beyond a Sbate.",58
336,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,There does nob seem to be anybhing requiring an organization registered in one Sbate bo register in another.,58
337,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Nobhin g at all.,58
338,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,S in c e the B i ll is to ,58
339,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not think there is any intention to qualify the meaning of the word ""organization.""",58
340,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No doubt, we shall be able later on to make the matter clear, if it is not explicit enough at the presenb time. The . . . right honourable and learned member will pardon mefor referring to it now. My wish is that the Act shall be of service. One or two provisions were omitted from the New South Wales Act, because they were thought to be of no - importance; but subsequently they were found to be of very great consequence. One of these mattersthe failure to provide anv power to appeal from the Registrar-wa s calculated to wreck the usefulness of the measure. Another point in relation to the meaning of the word "" lock-out"" also requires to be dealt with. It is very important that we should comprehensively define the meaning of the word. A.s denned in this Bill, ""lock-out""- includesThe closing of a place of employment, or the suspension of work by an employer, with a view to compel his employees, Or to aid another employer in compelling his employees, to accept any term or condition of employment. I find that that definition has practically been taken from the New South Wales Act. In the first case heard before the Arbitration Court of New South Wales the question turned on what was a lock-out, and under this definition it was ruled by Judge Cohen that the action of a company in discharging its employees, in then altering the existing conditions of employment, and in engaging other men when its old employees refused to .avail themselves of an opportunity to work - under the changed conditions, amounted to a lock-out within the meaning of the Act. Judge Cohen said- . In the first place we come to the conclusion that the company acted wrongly, and. in breach of the Act, though honestly believing it was right, when it, in effect, forced the members of the union out of work. That is to say, under this definition, the mere compelling of men to relinquish employment amounts to a lock-out. The learned Judge continuedIts action in doing so was in the ""nature of a lock-out""-sectio n 34 (6), 1 - because , although it did not close its place^of employment or suspend work, to use the language in the definition of ""lock-out"" in section 2, yet, as far as members of the union are concerned, the place of employment was closed against them, and thus the act done was in the ""nature.of a lock-out.""",58
341,Mr DBAKFN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Was that the decision given in the Hunter River Steamship Company's case?,59
342,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The remarks I have quoted are to be found at page 9, of Vol. 1, of The Industrial Arbitration Reports and Records of Neio South Wales. The decision was given in the case of the Newcastle Wharf Labourers'-Union v. Newcastle and Hunter River Steam-ship Company Limited. Supposing that during the pendency of a dispute between the Seamen's Federation and the Inter-State Steam-ship Owners' Federation, an Inter-State company said"" We shall take our vessels from here, we will register them elsewhere, and our men shall sign on elsewhere, and having done that we shall continue to trade along this coast."" In those circumstances, if a sailor who had signed on, say for a month, found that at the end of that period, and while a dispute was still pending, his boat was taken away and laid up for 24 hours, and that at the end of that time a fresh lot of seamennon-unionists-were engaged, would that be a ""lock-out"" within the meaning of the measure 1 If not, this measure will be of no use to the seamen. Say that some seamen sign ou for a month on a vessel trading along the coast, and that towards the conclusion of that period and long before a dispute could be heard by the Court - becaus e six or eight months might elapse before the Court could deal with the question-the y were paid off and a fresh lot of men were engaged, would that be a lock-out within the meaning of this measure 1 I say most emphatically-and I wish to draw the attention of the right honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, as well as that of the Attorney-General, to this point-that if provision is not made for such a contingency in the definition of the word "" lock-out,"" the Bill will be of no use toseamen. If a struggle worthy of the name takes place it will extend over a considerable period. Seamen might sign on for six months, and towards the end of their contract a dispute might arise, and, therefore, in spite of the very wide definition given by the President of the New South Wales Court,I think that ""lock-out,"" as defined in the Bill, would, not meet a case of the kind I have indicated. In my opinion it should do so. Another matter to which I wish todirect the attention of the House is that sub-clause 5 of clause 4 provides that thechief objects of the Act areTo enable States to refer industrial disputes to the court, and to permit the working of the Court and of State industrial authorities in aid of each otherand I wish to know whether advantage is to be taken of section 51, sub-section (37), of the Constitution, which provides thatThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the pence, - order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to . . . Mutters referred to the Parliament of the - Commonwealth by the Parliament or Parliaments of any State or Statss . . . . I contend that under the Bill, as it now stands, it will be impossible to take advantage of that provision. Honourable members will see, from a number of clauses which succeed clause 4, that it is very clear that this Bill has relation only to industrial disputes which extend the limits of any one State. It is quite true that if we read it in its narrower application, sub-clause (5) of clause 4 will not apply, because the word "" State"" can refer - only to a dispute which does not extend beyond the limits of any one State. As the Bill deals only with disputes extending beyond the limits of one State, it cannot do so. I admit, of course, that if we say that the court has power to prevent a dispute before it extends beyond the limit of a State, that is possible, but, according to my reading, it is so limited in its scope by clause 2, and possibly by the provisions of the Constitution, that sub-clause (5) of clause 4. will be inoperative. I want honourable members to turn now to clause 51, and I call the attention of the Attorney-General to a matter which, I think, will have to be seriously considered. He was asked today to give an opinion upon the effect of the awards of the Commonwealth Court upon existing awards. It is very clear that the award of the courts of New South Wales and Western Australia are likely to conflict from time to time with those of the Commonwealth Court, and I want to know if their awards are of necessity to be abrogated and annulled by the award of that Court. Since one of the chief benefits of an Arbitration Court is that it assures to employers a time of rest and. tranquility for the period for which an award endures, it would be-to the last degree disastrous if at any moment an award - of the Commonwealth Court, made to meet some contingency arising, or conditions existing in other States, upset an award given in New South Wales or Western Australia. If , for instance, the New South Wales Court had fixed the rate of wages in the boot trade according to a certain schedule which was to last for three years, the boot manufacturers of New South Wales would make their contracts upon the strength of that arrangement. But if later on, because of a dispute arising under the Mr Hughts. Bill , the Commonwealth Court made a uniform award which conflicted with the award of the New South Wales Court, a grievous wrong would be done to the manufacturers of New South Wales. The great point made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports was that there should be uniformity of industrial awards, and I wish to show that in effecting that desideratum we must not forget that existing awards beyond in the States have been fixed for certain periods to meet certain conditions, and it would do considerable harm if it were known that at any time those awards, which have been regarded as final for the period for which they endure, may be upset by the Commonwealth Court.",59
343,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Paragrap h (a) of clause 63 will enable the court to say that the New South Wales award shall continue in force for the remainder of its term.,60
344,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not say that the ' Commonwealth Court will not have the right to make such a condition ; I am pointing out the great danger which will arise from any uncertainty. . It will have power to do or not to do what the Attorney-General describes, but such a power, must be severel}' limited, in order to give to the State awards that stability which it is desirable that they should have. I want now to say a word about two other restrictions in the Bill with which I do not agree. First, as to the omission of State servants from its operation. I think that no measure worthy of the name should exclude the public servants of the States or of the Commonwealth. The purpose of the Bill is to prevent industrial disputes. We do not want the repetition of such a disaster as occurred in 1890, but can anyone who remembers what happened in Victoria a few mouths ago, say that there was not then a great risk, because of the action taken by the railway'servants of Victoria, of an inx dustrial dispute such as we fear ? A stop was put to that dispute, and sufficiently severe measures were taken in regard to those who took part in it. I think, however, that they should have an opportunity to appeal to a Commonwealth tribunal. They will have representation in the Parliament of the State, and can ventilate a grievance there, but they cannot hope to have it redressed. Their three representatives may state their case, but they are opposed to all the other members of the House who"" represent the employers of the State servants, and in the very nature of the case are antagonistic to them. Moreover, the public servants can never, like other members of the community, speak upon public platforms, and agitate for the passing of reform, however necessary, in their interests. Under these circumstances, we shall do them a grievious wrong if we do not give them an opportunity to bring their troubles before an impartial tribunal, where they will have a better chance of getting justice than-in the State Parliament of Victoria. The Attorney-General advanced several good arguments against including public servants in the Bill, though they did not appear to me to be very effective. He said that Parliament was a sufficient tribunal. Of course it is, but it is a political tribunal. There is no reason why all industrial disputes should not be settled here, except that we have not time to deal with them, and they would not be settled on their merits. I think, too, that the honourable and learned member spoke and voted in favour of the transference from Parliament to the High Court of questions of disputed elections. He converted me on that occasion, and I have always been grateful to him. In my opinion the Arbitration Court is the proper place to settle all these disputes. In New South Wales and Western Australia State servants come under the Arbitration Acts. Theobjection that the StateParliament might refuse to alter its Estimates - is not a serious one, because in most, if not in all, cases the men 'affected are. under the control of Commissioners who do not submit detailed Estimates to Parliament. For instance, the railway Estimates of New South Wales are submitted to Parliament, but they are not dealt with in detail by it ; and if the Arbitration Court declined to raise the wages of any of the railway employees, the matter would not coine directly before Parliament. The same thing might be said of the position of the employees of the Harbor Commissioners, and of other boards. If we provided only for the railway servants of the States, we should take away one great cause of an industrial dispute. The exclusion of seamen has become a cause cdebre, because of the action of the right honourable and learned member for South Australia in resigning from the Ministry, as he conceived that the definition of industry, and the scope of the Bill, - do not allow seamen to be effectively dealt with. In my opinion, it is in the last degree disastrous and farcical not to provide both for the public servants and for the seamen. Since the occasion which gave rise to the inclusion in the'Constitution of the provision which enables us to pass this legislation was the great maritime strike of 1890, it would be extraordinary if no provision were made to prevent the occurrence of such a dispute, which is always possible, unless the seamen come within the operation of a measure of this kind. It does not matter what reasons stand between the seamen and the attainment of what they and we equally desire; the fact remains that they do not come within the operation of the Bill . I am not now interested in the circumstances which led up to the present position, nor have I the intention of touching upon those matters of a personal nature mentioned by the honourable member for Melbourne and others. I am concerned chiefly with the matter from a broad national stand-point, and because the members of my own union can never feel better off, or in a more assured position under the measure so long as the seamen are excluded, since if a strike occurs amongst the seamen, and the vessels are laid up, the wharf labourers will have nothing to do. The two avocations are interdependent. Therefore the Bill should include all maritime trades, or exclude all That is to say, the exclusion of one means practically the exclusion of all. I cannot conceive for a moment that the manning of our coastal and Inter-State boats with non-unionists would pass without a struggle in those States where there is no Arbitration Act . I do not know what would happen in the other States, but I certainly consider that the seamen should be included in the operation of the Bill. As to the constitutional aspect of the question, I shall not say anything further than that the references made by the Attorney-General to the Franconia case and to the writers on International Law, do not appear to me to be conclusive. As the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, pointed out, the Franconia case did no more than decide that a court to which certain jurisdiction had been transferred, had no power over a foreign ship. The Territorial Waters Act, passed as the result of that case, gave the necessary power,' and there was an end of the matter. I am not denying for a moment what the Attorney-General said, when I interjected that none of these decisions would bind the municipal courts. He Said that the municipal courts would not act unless they had authority in express words. The machinery to be provided is a matter of detail, but it will rest with the Attorney-General to show why we should not insert a clause expressly dealing - with the case of the seamen, and leave the courts to provide the necessary machinery. I desire to quote one or two cases from Real's Cardinal Mules of Legal Interpretation. In the Amalia case Lushington said I have always recognised the full force of this objection, that the British Parliament has no proper authority to legislate for foreigners out of its jurisdiction ; and I especially did so in the case of the Zollverein (1856), 2 Jur. N.S. 429; 1 Sw. 96, 'at p. 98). No statute ought, therefore, to be held to apply to foreigners with respect to transactions out of British jurisdiction, unless the words of the statute are perfectly clear ; but I never said that, if it pleased the British Parliament to make such laws as to foreigners out of the jurisdiction, Courts of Justice must not execute them; indeed, I said the direct contrary. In the case of Colquhoun versus Brooks, Lord Esher saidThe English Parliament cannot be supposed, merely by reason of its having used general words, to be intending to do that which is against the comity of nations. It is true that if we come ""to the conclusion that this has been intently done, we must curry out the law and leave to the Government of the conniry the task of answering objections, but, unless that is perfectly clear, we ought to limit the words so as to make them reasonable and proper. In the case of Colquhoun versus LTeddon, the same authority saidIt seems to me that, unless Parliament expressly declares otherwise, in which case, even if it should go beyond its own rights as regards the comity of nations, the courts of this country . must obey the enactment, the proper construction to be put on general words used in an English Act of Parliament is, that Parliament was dealing only with such persons or things as are within the general words, and also within its proper jurisdiction, and that we ought to assume that Parliament (unless it expressly declares otherwise) when ib uses general words isonly dealing with persons or things over which it has propersjurisdiction. These judgments make it very clear that Parliament has a perfect right to legislate' upon this matter, and the Attorney General will, I am sure, admit that the rights of this Parliament are identical with those of the British Parliament in that respect. We inay make what laws we Mr Hughes. please, and if we go beyond international rights, and that mysterious entity or nonentity entitled the comity of nations, it will be for diplomats to settle the matter. We shall break no law, and we shall be doing nothing in the way of kicking over any mysterious traces. And , moreover, this is not a question involving an international law. We are told that we can make provision such as I have indicated in ""some other Bill . Then the question becomes one of procedure; whether we should include the provision in this Bill or in some other. I intend to do all I can topromote the passing of the Bill . I shall not allow any foolish sentiment to stand in the way, but I shall do whatever I conceive to be necessary to that end. At the same time. I shall insist as-far as I am able that seamen shall have the benefit of this Bill, because I can conceive that otherwise we shall only be living in a fool's paradise, and that the Bill , instead of promoting industrial peace, will very likely precipitate trouble that might otherwise be averted.. According to the Attorney-General there is merely a difference of opinion as to procedure, and if that be the case, the House ought not to allow any such difficult}' to wreck a Bill of this kind. If it can be shown that it will be impossible to insert an effective provision in the Bill, there will be an end of the matter j but, so far as I am concerned, it has not yet been shown that it cannot be done. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr. Kingston, clearly pointed out that what the Attorney-General proposed to do was simply to say in a Navigation B i ll that any vessels trading along the coast should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court. The right honourable gentleman contended that if we made that provision in this Bill , it would be just as effective as if included in another measure. That is the whole question. I do not pose as a constitutional authority, but I merely set forth what I believe to be the law upon .this point. I refuse to allow myself to consider for a moment such a thing as a violation' of international law. It must be shown that there is some real and effective bar besides that. That is a very good term with which to frighten women and children, but it is not a real living entity that will have any effect upon us. All we have to consider is whether, under the Constitution, we have the right to do what we desire,. - and if we have the right, whether this is not the most convenient place to exercise it. We must, if necessary, strain a point to - make it convenient. The Government are to a large extent to blame for having brought in this measure, upon which there was such serious difference of opinion in the Cabinet, so late that in the event of any difficulty it might be impracticable to introduce another Bill to effect the desired object. I do not deny that I am seriously concerned, both for the fate of the Bill, and for the interests of the seamen. I desire to help them and to see the Bill become law, and I shall be very glad to find some way out - of the difficulty. I shall support any amendment which will effect the object I have in view. I do not intend to detain the House any longer. I must congratulate the Ministry upon the measure. I believe that, with two or three exceptions to which I have directed attention, the Bill is calculated to achieve everything we desire. It is very necessary, and I hope that it will have a salutary effect upon the industry of this growing nation, and that this last and finest effort to introduce the operation of the law into the realms of anarchy will be - attended by the best results.",60
345,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N," It has been my misfortune on more than one occasion to find myself considerably, if not wholly, at variance with the opinions held by the majority of honourable members, and I am very much afraid that I shall - again find myself in that. position tonight. I have occupied it so often that recently a member of my own party accused me of a desire to be. singular j in fact, he - expressed the opinion that it was a kind of mania of mine to express opinions entirely at variance with those held by the majority - of honourable members. The honourable member to whom I refer is very goodnatured, but I believe at the bottom there is a feeling that ray aim is rather to appear singular. I can only say that so long as I am a member of this House I shall express my opinions in all frankness; and if I .stand alone, I shall continue to tell the the House what I think, whether my view' is popular or unpopular. I hope honourable members will believe me when I say that I would rather be out of political life altogether than act as the mere mouth-piece of any particular class of people, who choose to clamour for a particular piece. of legislation which in my opinion is undesirable. Although I know that I shall probably be whipping a dead horse, I may say that I regard this Bill as a piece of legislation which is inimical to the best interests of this country; and I speak thus after two or three years' experience of the legislation which has been passed in New South Wales. I speak as one who possesses a fairly wide knowledge of industrial matters, not merely from legal, but also from commercial, experience. I speak, too, as one who has had extensive dealings with trades unionism and with the voluntary system of settling disputes. I have frequently sat in the Melbourne Trades H all ; and for two years I took part in an organization which was conceived with a view to settling trade disputes. Upon all occasions I succeeded in bringing capital and labour together without any sacrifice of their individual interests, and I saw them part on the very best of terms. I do not stand here as a lawyer to advocate a measure which is likely to give occupation to the profession to which I belong, but as an opponent of a Bill - which would play into legal hands quite as much as into those of anybody else. Therefore, on this occasion, it may fairly be said that I am speaking against my own interestsif interests are the fees which members of Parliament generally credit lawyers with looking after so keenly. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports made a very pathetic speech this evening, in which he went back a century to show what was the condition of the female workers in England prior to the Factories Acts becoming operative. He also endeavoured to show what was the condition of some of the children in England after that legislation had come into force. But although he spent quite half-anhour in drawing that pathetic picture, he had to confess that it had no application whatever to Australia. I cannot understand what possible bearing a state of things of that kind-whic h does not exist in Australia-ca n have upon the desirability or otherwise of accepting a measure which has no direct relevance to the employployment, of children. It is one of the misfortunes of any speaker who attempts to deal in a deliberative Assembly with the purely economic side of a question that he lays himself open to a charge on the part of the more humanitarian section of his listeners that he is cold-blooded. We know that a very good authority on art, John Ruskin, attempted to write a book on political economy, entitled Unto This Last, in which he managed to mix up his ideas on morals and economy in a somewhat ludicrous way. Yet, I know that a good many people are prepared to accept his political economy, and to think that when one is dealing with a question in which economic laws are concerned, he must take into consideration, not what results the operation of those laws will inevitably produce, but what we should like them to produce if we could regulate them according to our own desires. They remind one very much of a child who is being pulled out of the way of a falling brick by its mother, and who protests against the law of gravitation. In such circumstances, I can well imagine the mother replying-"" may be very unkind of me to take you out of the yard in which you were playing, but I have done it for a very good purpose."" Any one who understands the absolute necessity for considering economic questions, apart from sentiment, will know that there is a very just parallel between the two cases. Throughdutthespeech of the honourable member for Melbourne Pprts, I noticed an assumption that all we have to do in this country is to raise wages to a standard which will enable men to live as they think they ought to live-an ambition with which we all sympathize. He seems to think that we can continually raise the wages of the people, without injuring the prospects of the industry. He seems tothinkthat this practice could be continued ad infinitum, altogether oblivious of the fact that in paying those wages, in carrying on any industry, we have to manufacture an article which can compete with the outside world. It is a fool's paradise into which we have got if , considering how happy we should like to be, we fail to recognise that we have to compete with the cheap labour of obher parts of the world. We cannot, arrogate to ourselves the power to make everybody happy in the face of this outside competition. A man is more of a rogue than a fool who represents to the people of this country that it is possible to brjng about a sort of millennium by thoughtless and sanguine legislation, when in his heart he knows that it is impossible to neutralize the laws of political economy in this or any other country. I take the economic view of thisquestion. I venture to say that anybodj'who approaches it in a calm and deliberate way, and who divests his mind-I will not say of all sentiment, Mr Bruce Smith. because I do not pretend that politic. } can be completely denuded of that element - will regard ibfrom a similar stand-point. Although we may desire to place the working classes of this country in a more hopeful and prosperous position than that which they at present occupy, we are confronted with the fact that every industry in our midst has to compete with the industries of the outside world. AVe are in this position at the present time : AVe are not now protected by a 40 per cent., 50 per cent., or 60 per cent, duty, which would allow a large margin upon which to go in continually raising the wages of the people to any standard that they desire. I think thab the honourable member for It Melbourne Ports also contended that in almost every case workmen could rely upon having the difference split, if they only went to the Court which it is proposed to create under this Bill . What does that mean? He says that that rule would apply to the employers as well as to the employees. He declared that the latter can make a demand and obtain somebhing more than they at present enjoy. If the argumenb is applicable bo both parties to a dispute, I should like to know the position in which they are ultimately left. If the employees have only to demand double what they really desire in order to get what they want, and if the court will grant them half their claim, and vice versd in the case of the employers, we are led to a condition of aribhmetic which eibher I do . pot undersband, or which will leave the parbies just where they were previously. I congrabulabe the honourable member upon his very sympathetic view of human nature. But I am bound to say thab a man of his bype is no friend bo the people, if he is prepared bo lead them into a sorb of Ruskiniau Paradise, which will only land them in difficulties ultimabely. I lisbened wibh greab interest to the honourable member for West Sydne)'. Evidently he is the funny man of his party. He told us that the labour party had been called the socialistic party, and he seemed to complain of it.",63
346,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I do not complain of it.,64
347,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I have heard the honourable member admit on more than one occasion that he was a socialist. I have alsb heard the honourable member for Barrier openly declare that the aim of the labour party of this country was pure socialism. Tliere is nothing to be ashamed of in such a declaration. It is merely matter of political creed. But it is quite right that we should know what is the of creed of a party, because we are then able to gauge its views and to estimate they accord with our own. But the honourable member for West Sydney spoke as the labour party bad been called by harsh names. I admit that the old ""democratic party"" was much more likely to excite admiration and to win the proval of the bulk of the people. When the labour party openly avowed themdealing selves a body of socialists, I considered they were taking a somewhat suicidal step reference to future legislation, which step would live to regret. I still hold that At the same time. I have a sincere respect for a socialist who entertains the happy view of human nature that we can view-i all enter into a sort of social partnership, and thus bring about a millennium upon earth. I have studied politics for thirty years, and I do not think that that condition of affairs is posable sible. It is only feasible to men full imagination, ful l of poetic thought, take altogether a partial and exaggerated view of the higher qualities of human ture. It is only possible to individuals who are prepared to eliminate from human nature, or rather from their conceptions it, that particular element-sel f interestwhich fortunately or unfortunately lies the root of all human progress. When, therefore, I find a man avowedly declarthe ing himself a socialist, I am disposed think that his intellectual faculties have led him to miss one link in the chain reasoning that is necessary to enable to come to a sound logical conclusion. admit that the honourable member for West Sydney said some very funny things. But he also made some unjust remarks in reference to those who do not agree with his views. It must be remembered, how-' ever, that he does not occupy quite partial position. We know that be is the president of a large trades union in New. South Wales, the affairs of which he has .managed with very great ability'. If I were addressing a body of men whose minds were absolutely open upon this question- a condition which one can hardly expect to find in this House, because we usually have fixed opinions which are not likely to be altered by any speeches made here- I I 8 JD should contend that, where a man occupies a the position of president of a trades union, he cannot possibly be an impartial critic a Bill such as this. H is interests must necessarily be largely those of the union how far which he represents.",64
348,Mr HUMECOOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I suppose that the if honourable and learned member will admit that a member of the Ship-owners' Union term occupies the same position ?,65
349,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I will admit apthat. I am not, however, dealing with ship-owners at the present time. I am with a Bill which is brought forthat ward because it is alleged that it will in benefit alike the workers and their emthey ployers. The measure proposes to create a view. new tribunal at which every lawyer has a chance of making an addition to his income. I do not speak from the lawyers' point of f I did so I should vote for the Bill - bu t from that of the legislator who claims to be in a position to criticise a measure of this kind in the light of all the evidence thab can be brought bo bear upon it. The honormember for West Sydney spoke as if no of argument could be adduced on the other who side. I hope to place before the House some very strong reasons, based upon exnaperience and history, why this measure is likely to create a great deal of mischief. I shall put them before the House in the light of of the experience which other colonies have had of a measure almost identical with the at one now before the House. The honourable and learned member went on to say that workmen had had some experience of to the Act in New South Wales, but that wedid not hear of their opposing it, although of they were asking for ""one or two libblehim amendments."" The House knows very well I that one of these ""little amendments"" is designed to do away with the effect of the decision in the Taff Vale case. I venture to say that a more dishonourable attempb at legislation than would be an effort bo do away with the effect of that decision could an imnever be made in this country.",65
350,Mr MCDONALD,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It is a question whether a more dishonourable decision was ever given by a court than that in the Taff Vale case.,65
351,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I express this opinion, because the effecb of the TaffVale case was simply that where the members of a union are guilby of a bort, their corporation and its funds shall be equally liable to those who are injured by the tort as are those of any other corporation. If that is not a fair legal decision, I should like to know what is. I should like to know why 50 or 1Q0 workmen should be allowed to amass a large 'sum of money, and then to say-""We desire to be protected against any verdict or judgment which may be given in a court of law in connection with any case in which we have deliberately broken the civil laws of tort in this country, and committed an injury to another citizen."" Bub the attempt is being advocated today in New South Wales to secure a'n amendment of the Act in that direction, and the Attorney-General of New South Wales, who had the temerity, when he was introducing the measure, to hold oub bo the employers of bhat Sbate the belief that they would be able bo make claims against the funds of the unions in case of an union's liability, has practically promised to introduce a measure bo neutralize the effect of the Taff Vale case.",65
352,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The two positions are inconsistent.,66
353,Mr CAMERON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,They are not credibable.,66
354,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am astonished that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth should express such an opinion. If a corporation like the Sugar Company is .to be liable to every citizen for a torb, which has the effecb of injuring him in a monetary sense in his civic relations, any corporation of workmen should be equally liable for a torb. Mr .HIGGINS - It is nob a torb.",66
355,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Is ib not a tort to picket ? It is certainly not a contract,66
356,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The poinb was,66
357,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I hope the honourable and learned member will not proceed to discuss that point of legal terminology. I challenge him bo say thab picketing, and preventing men from going to their work, is not a tort.",66
358,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It is exceedingly doubtful whebher pickebing is a torb.,66
359,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I am not going to enter upon an academic discussion of the question with the honourable and learned member. The acb of picketing was referred to in the case as a tort, and it has been treated as such ever since. Whether it is a tort or some other form of wrong, the Court held that the funds of the union were liable to the injured citizen, and the Taff Vale Union had to pay a sum of £22,000 to the plaintiffs to compromise the verdict. Now the Abborney-General declares that bhere is nothing inconsistent in the proposal of the Attorney-General of New South Wales bo bring in a Bill bo relieve the union of a liabiliby of that kind.",66
360,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Because under the measure the liability cannot occur. Strikes are prohibited, and therefore picketing cannot take place.",66
361,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The liability applied in England, and the union was very glad bo compromise in the way I have named.",66
362,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,This Bill is designed to prevent strikes and picketing.,66
363,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That is the point.,66
364,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable and learned member for West Sydney told the House bhat the unionisbs of New South Wales were perfectly content with the State Acb, and required only one or two little amendments. Ib is well that the House should know that the litble amendmenb I not have indicabed is among the lisb. ",66
365,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It is, in the Marryab sense. So much for the argument. The honourable and learned member also spoke of freedom of contract. That is an old gag, wibh which we are familiar in New Soubh Wales ; bub is nob a man who deliberately sells his labour, which is his commodity, in the open market, a free man ?",66
366,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,He has no choice.,66
367,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"H as an employer who has an esbablished business, with buildings and machinery bo look af ber-wh o has, perhaps, to borrow money, and perhaps - a large overdraft ab his bank, which compels him bo carry on his business-in any sense of the word, freer than is a workman? Has he any choice ? Noman is free in a philosophical sense, because his feelings may affect him; but in the practical sense of the word, when a workman has the law to appeal to, he is as free as is any employer. In some cases the employer may have a large sum at his back; but, after all, it is only a matter of degree. An employer is not free unless we are going to regard the sacrifice of his income or his capital as a matter of no account. "" Freedom of contract"" is a very old term that we have heard the present Attorney-General of New South Wales use for the last five or six years. It was never used as an argument for unionism until thab honourable and learned gentleman promulgated it for the information of the trades unionisbs of his State. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney drew a kind of satirical word - picture of the employee and employer, in which he referred to the latter as the burglar who complained that this Bill would have the effect of 0 taking away the policeman who was likely to interfere with him. But the converse of the picture might have been drawn. If the honourable and learned member prefers to speak of the unionist as the policeman, and the employer as the burglar, I should say that the policeman is asking that the burglar's tools of trade should be taken away by this Bill . The picture might be' painted in both ways; but I would remind the honourable and learned' member, and those who laughed at his picture, that in a debate of this kind we derive no advantage from the employment of picturesque illustrations of that sort, which only serve to insult one side of the parties who are contending for this measure; nor should we gain anything if I were to attempt to insult the other side by depictingthem in any less complimentary way than I have done.",66
368,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,It worse speech of the kind made.,67
369,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It was a very uncalled-for speech. After the honourable and learned member had been speaking for about three-quarters of an hour, he said, "" We will now come to the Bill . "" He gave us a very extensive set of quotations from the reports of the decisions of the Compulsory Arbitration Court of New South Wales, showing what had been done in that State : but I have no desire to follow him in the discussion of those matters. I should like now to say that one of the first serious doubts that I entertained in regard to this Bill-and I think it is worth mentioningwas whether this Parliament had authority to delegate the power given to ib under secbion 51 of the Constitution to a court of any kind. That section gives the Commonwealth Parliament the power to make various laws. It provides thabThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to . . conciliation and arbitration. . . . The first doubt which I enterbained was whether ib was possible for the Parliament to delegate the power to another bod}'; but I was relieved from that doubb by a 8 D2 judgmenb cibed in Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution. I refer bo the case of Hodge v. The Queen, which decided that the power could be delegabed bo a body of bhis kind. No doubt it came under the notice of the Attorney-General when be began to frame the Bill . The next consideration to which my mind was led in dealing wibh this matter, was to see how bhis power bo make laws in regard to conciliation and arbitration was given by the Constitution. Honourable members will be interested to know that the first step made in this direction was taken by the right honourable and learned member for Soubh Australia, Mr Kingston. At the Conference of 1891, he brought forward a motion giving the Parliament the power to create practically a Compulsory Arbitration Court. That motion was withdrawn, but was introduced again by him in 1891, when ib was defeated by 25 votes to 12. The proposal was subsequently introduced in the 1897 Convention by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and ib was again defeated by 22 vobes bo 12. The honourable and learned member brought ib forward was the again in 1897, when it was passed by 22 vobes bo 19. I bake the figures from the Convention reporbs.",67
370,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"There was a gradually, increasing volume of opinion in favour-of the principle.",67
371,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"No doubb; but I wish the House bo see thab the section in the Constitution which empowers this Parliament to pass this Bill only succeeded in passing the Convention by what is vulgarly known as the ""skin of its teeth."" It was agreed to by a majority of three.",67
372,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,And the whole of the people accepted it.,67
373,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable and learned member knows the full significance of that assertion, because unfortunately in a referendum there is no point equivalent to our Committee sbage, ab which it is possible for the people to bake the measure submitted bo them, clause by clause, and to deal with it in that way. Ab the Federal referendum ib was a question of the whole bill or nothing. The honourable and learned member knows that if that had not been the position there is much in our Constitution bhat people, rightly of wrongly, would have liked to amend. Ib is inberesbing bo know that, but for this small majority of three, the power under which this House is now acting would not have existed.",67
374,Mr HIGGINS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The leader of the Ministry and the leader of the Opposition were in favour of,68
375,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,""" I am not my brother's keeper."" I have enough to do to answer for my own indiscretions without undertaking a responsibility in respect of those committed by other politicians. It is interesting to know that the particular part of the Constitution to which I have referred had to be brought forward four times before it could obtain a miserable majority of three votes. We may take it, therefore, that if the members of the Convention represented the people of Australia, honestly and fairly, there was a very small majority of the people of the Commonwealth in favour of giving the Parliament power to pass a Bill of this kiud. Therefore, it cannot be said that this is the wish of an overwhelming majority of the people.  learned member's thirty years' experience, how many times has he known a clause in a Bill to be passed by a majority of one 1",68
376,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"V e r y frequently. I should like to correct the honourable member as to the "" thirty years'experience;"" it ought to be fifty years ! One is naturally cu-rious to see what are the motives of men in regard to the passing of this measure. They are very varied and interesting. I was speaking only yesterday to a large - manufacturer of New South Wales, whose name I shall not mention-to do so would - be invidious-and I said to him - "" I want to know how you feel in regard to this Bill . "" He replied- "" I am in favour of it,"" and when I asked him his reason, he went on to say -""Because we are working under the New South Wales Arbitration and Conciliation Act, and it is putting us to such inconvenience that we should like to see the Victorians and the other people in the soup with us."" I then asked him-""How would you feel' about the Bill if there was not a similar law in New South Wales at the present time?"" and he replied- "" I should be glad to be'freed from such a law, but as it is in existence in New South Wales, and we feel the handicap it involves, we should be glad to see it extended, and the whole of the States put on the same footing."" That is hardly a tribute to the wisdom or merits of the Bill ; ib simply means that the manufacturers say- "" We should like to see this Bill pass-w e are in trouble ourselves and we want to see everybody else in the same position.""",68
377,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Did the manufacturer say from what injustice he was suffering ?,68
378,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"*The honourable member for Melbourne. Ports claimed in high-sounding language that this Bill is only part of the evolution of affairs-of the evolution of history. History is useful sometimes, even in Parliament. I - have always been taughtthat hisboryis.philosophy, teaching by example; and I wish we all read more of history. But if we look back In history we may find plenty of prototypes for this particular Bill . We do not find this particular measure-w e do not find it proposed to constitute a Court to settle differences between employers and employesbut if we look at the reigns of Heni y VIII . and Queen Elizabeth, we see quite a variety of Acts of Parliament introduced for the purpose of fixing wages or fixing the prices of materials. There was one. Act in particular I remember reading of, as having been passed quite hurriedly in Parliament, after a thunderstorm, to regulate the wages of plumbers; and there was another, passed in a similarly inconvenient fashion for employers, to determine exactly the conditions under which they were to work their men. In fact, if one only goes back far enough in history, the more one reads, the more one becomes convinced that whilst we appear to be advancing, we are constantly advancing round a race-course and coming back to where we started.",68
379,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Who caused those laws to be break down-the men or the masters 1,68
380,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"My opinion is that they broke down of themselves, as this Bill will do. My opinion is that the very people for whom this particular Bill is being enacted, will themselves complain of it before very long. Is it not a fact that in New Zealand, only within the last twelve months, at a meeting of trades unionists in Wellington, those trades unionists themselves complained of the Compulsory Arbitration Bill as being the greatest legislative curse introduced into that colony.",68
381,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Was not that the complaint of one man ?,68
382,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It was, I believe, a resolution.",68
383,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,No .,68
384,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"If the honourable member will excuse me, it was a resolution of the union of which this one man was a member.",68

394,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I should like to - direct attention next to the paradoxical nature of the title of the Bill . I do not know whether it has occurred to honourable members to notice the extraordinary proppsal that a Bill to prevent strikes should be passed which can be brought into operation only when a dispute extends beyond .any one State. I should like to know how we can prevent an industrial dispute from extending beyond the limits of any one State by means of a tribunal which has no power to adjudicate until the difference has extended beyond one State. It is a paradox - and an impossibility. This Court cannot move until, a strike or lock-out beyond a State.",69
395,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Does the honourable and learned member say that this Court cannot adjudicate according to the Constitution?,69

Will the honourable member for Bland just look at the Constitution, or listen while I read it ? I venture to say that the argument to which I have referred is the most original I ever heard.",69

406,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Where would the contention of the honourable member for Bland lead him ? It means that the Court could interfere in a dispute in New South Wales because that dispute might extend into Victoria.,69
407,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Quite so.,69

418,Mr KINGSTON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,How can we prevent a tiling which has happened ?,70
419,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The Court has no jurisdiction, and we cannot prevent strike from extending beyond one State when there is no jurisdiction to interfere until it has extended. The honourable and learned member for West Sydney suggested that the Constitution should be twisted and the nature of the Bill altered, so as to this Court to try to stop any industrial pute which might extend beyond any one State. But what would be the effect ? W should be deliberately creating a tribunal which would come into conflict within a month with the Conciliation and Arbitrabe tion Courts of New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia. I think the view of the honourable and learned ber is a most impracticable one. One does expect laymen to take a strict view of these matters, because with them the "" wish father to the thought;"" but it is the duty of the lawyer to see whether he is likely succeed in getting the Court to adopt the view of the law he puts forward in an opinion.",70
420,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The same bias may fluence the honourable and learned member.,70
421,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"At all events, my argument is that as to preventing disConciliation putes which have extended beyond any bne State, the Bill is ineffectual-w e not prevent such disputes, because they must have extended before we can act.",70
422,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That does not say much for the framers of the Constitution.,70
423,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I think that the members of the Convention knew the ' limit of their powers-that they knew very bewell at the time that each State would claim the right, through its own Court of ""exConciliation and Arbitration, to settle its own industrial disputes. I shall not argue the point further, because I should only to reiterate what I have already said many times. I venture to say that no lawyer would get up, as did this very youthful one to whom I have referred, and exa press an opinion to the effect that the Constitution would justify us in creating a tribunal which could attempt to prevent a strike or lock-out in any one State before it had extended to another State. that is the case, then the only effect of Bill will be that settling disputes after this trithey have extended.",70
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,A dispute is not a strike.,70
425,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"If the honourable a member is going to take the other side, he is at liberty to do so, and when he speaks he can support it at any length he thinks fit. The question is-How is this Bill going tosettle disputes 1 In the first place, what si a dispute under the measure 1 The result of allow a similar measure to this in New Zealand dishas been, as it will be here, simply toencourage the creation of disputes. We e know that before any conciliation and arbitration Act came into operation, before a strike or a lock-out took place, there had to a good deal of deliberation, either on the part of the men, or on the part of the employers. Under this Bill, as under the memNew South Wales Act, and as under the New not Zealand Act, a dispute is created the moment a union makes a demand upon an employer. is In New Zealand, five or six men merely have to address a letter to their employer to making certain demands, and a dispute has arisen. And so it has become there quite a common practice to get up disputes, as is recorded by Mr Macgregor, who is a pretty ingood authority upon the subject. Mr . Macgregor is a member of the Bar in New Zealand, and was a strong advocate for the and Arbitration Bill when it was introduced by Mr Reeves. He records canthe fact that in five years there had been 400 disputes within the meaning of the Act.  lost!",70
426,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I do not admit that, because I think I shall be able to show to the House that a great many hours and days' work have been lost through the refusal of people concerned to abide by the - decisions. ",71
427,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I hope the honourable member will recollect that he has to speak upon this subject, and that I may retaliate if he does not allow me to proceed. This is what is said by Mr . Macgregor, who is not only a man who has distinguished himself in his profession, but is also a well-known writer on economic subjects, and one who helped Mr Reeves, the present Agent-General for New Zealand in England, to pass the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in that colonyThabib has been successful as asysfcem for getting up disputes for the express purpose of having them adjudicated upon there is no doubb; bub the real question is whether a system which prevents strikes in bhis way is necessarily oeneficial. We have now succeeded in making clear the absurdity of describing as a method of preventing strikes, a system used for an entirely differenb purpose, uamely, the regulation of all the details of trade and industry by the decrees of a statutory court of law, made under the pretence of settling disputes-dispute s got up for the express purpose of being submibted bo the Courb, and which in all probabiliby never would have been thought of but for the fact .that the existence of the Court prompted them. I think that every man who has studied this question will make this admission-that the original intention of Conciliation and Arbitration Acts, whether in New Zealand - or in New South Wales, was to prevent strikes and locks-out. It was intended that the powers under the Acts should - come in at a certain stage of industrial trouble, to prevent great upheavals between employers and employees. It was never intended that any half-dozen workmen-as has been the case in New Zealand - shoul d be able to make a demand upon their employer either for an increase of wages or an alteration in the conditions of employment, and that the employerhowever large his business might be, however .poor he might be, however much it might interfere with - his businessshould be compelled at any time to go before the Court, to show his books, to enter into all the details of his business, in order to prove that their demand was not a justifiable one. But this is what has followed.",71
428,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Industr y has thrived under it.,71
429,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I hope that the honourable member will take an impartial view of this question. That was not the original intention of the Act. It was not intended to prevent things that haveoccurred 400 times in five years in New Zealand, and it was not intended that any half dozen employees, who liked to bring their employer before a Court, should be able to do so, and that he should be subject to all these difficulties to prevent the Court giving judgment against him. That is not preventing strikes or locks-out. Because you have first of all to show that if these people had not got what they asked for they would, but for the existence of the Court, have struck. Y o u have to show that, where an employer makes a demand upon his men, he would have locked them out if they had not conceded what he asked. Can it be supposed for a moment that in 400 cases in five years in New Zealand workmen would have struck if concessions had not been made to them? The corollary, the common inference, is this: that the Conciliation and Arbitration Court in New Zealand has not been the means of stopping strikes and locks-out, but has been the means of enabling the workmen at all times and in all seasons to make demands for concessions upon their employers in the hope that they will get some portion of what they demand. I do not say that many of their demands are not just. I am not standing here as the champion of the capitalist. I have no more sympathy with the capitalist than with the workman-no t a bit. I think that what I have been able to do in the past with regard to conciliation will show that. I think that I could obtain the testimony of some of the older tradpsunionists in the State of Victoria to the effect that I was the means-as has been said publicly-of bringing parties together, .and of producing a better feeling between employer and employed than had existed previously.",71
430,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The honourable member for Melbourne Ports said that no better feeling existed after the honourable and learned member's efforts.,71
431,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I can only say that a better feeling existed while I was president of the board and while I was resident in Victoria. H a d that good feeling continued to exist there wo.uld have been no need for this Bill .,71
432,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,How did the board break down ?,72
433,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"I cannot say what happened after I went away from Victoria. But I believe that the machinery still exists by which these disputes were to be settled. Therefore, I say again .that I - Speak now in no way in the interests of the capitalists, and in no way in the interests of the workmen ; but I stand here with a desire to see legislation of this sort entered upon with very great care. The Attorney General actually told us that this Bill marks the beginning of a new era in civilization.",72
434,Mr ISAACS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It is true, too.",72
435,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It may be true if the Bill is successful. But if it is retrograde it may mean a very different thing It may mean that we are travel lingin a circle, and going back to the folly of the attempts made to regulate labour at the time of Henry VIII . and Queen Elizabeth. That would not be the beginning of a new era in civilization, and that is the whole question. That this is a great departure there can be no doubt, and, therefore, it should be entered upon with very great care. The great danger is that we are likely to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. We are apt to forget that, whilst we are enabling a court to produce infinitely better conditions for the working classes, we may be causing sources of employment to fly away from the country. The honourable and reverend member for Southern Melbourne may smile a smile which is very full of meaning, but I can tell him that there are already many signs of the times in that regard.",72
436,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The same thing was said in England 100 years ago.,72
437,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"It was said in England 100 years ago, and it will be said 100 years hence.",72
438,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,And with just as little truth.,72
439,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Althoug h the honourable member for West Sydney may ridicule the statement made by Mr J . P. Wright, I can only say that he has been known hitherto as one of the largest boot manufacturers in New South Wales, and it is a fact that within the last year or two he has disposed of the whole of his business at a very great sacrifice. Whether or not it was disposed of in anticipation of this Bill being passed is a matter upon which I cam only"" take his statement.",72
440,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Somebody else has got the business ; it is going on all right.,72
441,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"Does the honourable member think that it is a desirable state of commerce in which a man has to sell his business, as he says, at the price of old iron 1",72
442,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,That is another question.,72
443,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Is the honourable member prepared to dispute that ?,72
444,Mr WATSON,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,I am prepared to doubt it.,72
445,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,The honourable member knows very well that it would be very easy for me to name half-a-dozen very large corporations in Great Britain who have withdrawn some millions of money fromAustralia within the last four or five years.,72
446,Mr WILKS,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,So they did at the time of the bank crisis.,72
447,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"V e r y likely, and that was a very good reason for doing it . The withdrawal of millions of money during the bank crisis does not make the fact of their withdrawing millions of money today any less significant or any less serious. It is not sufficient to show any other occasion in order to get rid of the gravity of an existing one. It has always been said that capital would be withdrawn, and the statement has come to be regarded, like the cry of "" wolf "" in the fable. We have heard the statement so often that we take no notice of it, and when the real time comes we may lose sight of the fact that it is at last true. The honourable member for Dalley said to-night that the capitalist goes where he can get the best interest on his money. What are the in ferences to be drawn from that statement 1 We know that, after all, capital is merely credit ; it does not exist in gold. If wages are to be put up to a level which an industry cannot afford to pay-and I am not saying that it is going to be done-it is very easy for the capitalist to say- "" I shall, go where 1 can get a better result for my money."" If I have honourable memberswith me in the statement that. capital can. go away from the country on a cable-that it is only credit-the n we shall see that the question is not what a court thinks a man. ought to have as a living' wage, but what the industry will fairly pay in competition with outside industries of a similar character, and in such a way that the capitalist is content to leave his capital in a country in. order to give employment to the people of that country in preference to. moving it into other more favourable .surroundings. That is the economic view of it, and it is useless to shut our eyes to the fact and to imagine that by burying our head in the sand our body is not seen.",72
448,Mr WATSOW,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,Economicall y there is a living wage still below which we must not - go.,73
449,Mr BRUCESMITH,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"As long as there is a living wage it is all right; but the question is whether it is not reached best by the employers and the employees coming into personal contact. I shall occupy a considerable time in completing my speech, as I began rather late, and, therefore, I would suggest, sir, that the debate should be adjourned until tomorrow.",73
450,Mr DEAKIN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATIO N,"The honourable and. learned member began his speech very late, and I am reluctant, therefore, to decline the courtesy which he asks, but I hope that it will not be considered as establishing a precedent, because the debate at this stage is being unduly prolonged.",73
