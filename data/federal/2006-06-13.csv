2,Mr BEAZLEY,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional ders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition from moving the following motion, forthwith: That the House: (1) recalls and records the solemn commitment given by the Prime Minister to Alan Jones on Radio 2GB on 4 August 2005 that: “I mean some people are going to have to work public holidays … it would be absurd and unfair and unreasonable if somebody has to work on a public holiday that that person isn't compensated by being paid whatever it is, the double time or the time and a half … those arrangements are going to continue …” (2) notes that appropriate compensation includes things like penalty rates and public holiday leave loadings; (3) notes that since the Government's extreme industrial relations changes commenced on 27 March 2006, a single sentence in an Agreement can remove all entitlements to public holiday pay, penalty rates and overtime pay, and that the Government's own statistics show: (a) 64 per cent of assessed AWAs have removed penalty rates; (b) 63 per cent have removed leave loadings; (c) 52 per cent have removed shiftwork loadings; and (d) 41 per cent did not contain gazetted public holidays; (4) affirms its support for the Prime Minister's August 2005 commitment that employees should receive adequate compensation for working on public holidays; and (5) calls on the Government to immediately restore adequate compensation for Australian employees who work on public holidays, thereby holding the Prime Minister to his solemn promise to Alan Jones and the Australian people. or- You do not support family values if you do not support decent holidays.

FUEL TAX BILL 2006 Cognate bill: FUEL TAX (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 29 March, on motion by Mr Dutton: That this bill be now read a second time.",20
7,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"The Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and cognate bill are important bills and bills we should have been debating the last time we were here. But I will come back to that topic at some point during my speech. The Fuel Tax Bill 2006 is complex, but it is broadly about three things. The first is moving business from the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme onto the new Fuel Tax Credits Scheme. The second is promoting changes to the way businesses that are exempt from excise claim back tax paid on fuel. The third is putting in place the legislative structures required to give effect to the phasing in of tax or excise on LPG, CNG-that is, compressed natural gas-and biofuels, including ethanol. The opposition has expressed support for the broad structure of the new fuel tax regime, which provides for: (1) a single system of fuel tax and associated credits; (2) reductions in the incidence of fuel tax levied on taxable fuels; (3) a staged introduction of a framework for the taxation of liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas from 1 July 2011-that was going to be 2009 originally, but, as a result of industry lobbying, particularly ethanol and biodiesel industry lobbying, it was pushed out to 2011; (4) a staged introduction of excise and phasing out of domestic assistance for biodiesel and domestic ethanol; and (5) the linking of fuel credits to environmental standards. Under the fuel tax credits system, all taxable fuel acquired or manufactured in or imported into Australia for use in off-road applications for business purposes will become tax free over time. There will be effective tax-free status introduced over time for business off-road use. Petrol for off-road business use will also be eligible for a fuel tax credit from 1 July 2008. This is a part of the phase-in introduction. For off-road usage, the current Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme will be phased out from 1 July 2008, when a 50 per cent fuel tax credit will apply, and 100 per cent for petrol for uses that the current grants scheme recognises. However, the new tax regime will gradually impose a fuel tax for biodiesel, domestically produced ethanol, LPG, CNG and liquefied natural gas. This will be phased in from 1 July 2011 to 1 July 2015. This delay has been essential, as the industry argued, for the development of new capital projects as they work through their infancy. In layman's language, all of that means a couple of things. For many years in this country, we have had what used to be called a diesel fuel rebate-a proposition that applied to both off-road and on-road users of diesel. If it was used in business for business purposes, it was effectively tax exempt, and the tax was claimed back through the tax office. It is interesting to note that originally the principle lying behind the off-road process was that, because fuel taxes were hypothecated-that is, spent specifically on road funding-then people off-road should not be making a contribution to that funding model. Of course, over time, the rebate became extended to certain heavy on-road users. That has been a proposition that has enjoyed bipartisan support in this place for many years. Not all that long ago, the diesel fuel rebate was replaced by what was called the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme, and that changed the way business claimed back the tax, as well as making various changes to the regime, which I do not think we need to go into the detail of today. Now we are going to a new scheme called the Fuel Tax Credits Scheme, which effectively has the same net result. It is a different name, a different model, and there are some changes around the edges, including extending the rebate-if you want to call it a rebate-on petrol. I have made the point in this place that not too many vehicles driving around in this country are 4.5 tonnes or heavier and use petrol, so I do not know what benefit that is going to have for business. Probably the most controversial aspect of this bill is the way it changes the way business claims back its tax. This is the reason why we are debating this bill this week rather than the last time we were in this place. At the moment, businesses pay for their fuel and, along with that payment, they pay the excise on that fuel. They are then immediately able to claim that back from the tax office. Rightly or wrongly, for some businesses this is actually cash flow positive. You might have a 14-day or even a 30-day credit arrangement with the supplier, and, if that is the case, it is more than likely that you are claiming the tax back before you have actually made the payment. Cash flow is a very important matter for businesses generally, but in particular for small to medium businesses. I certainly do not have a problem if some businesses have been getting a cash flow positive result out of the existing system. Whether they are or they are not doing that under the current system, if it is not positive cash flow, it is certainly a neutral cash flow if they have been able to claim back the tax at the same time, if not before, they have to pay the tax. The proposal in this bill is to force businesses, including small to medium businesses, to wait until they lodge their BAS to claim back the tax paid on those fuels. You will appreciate that many small to medium businesses lodge a BAS on a quarterly basis, once every three months, while some only lodge one once a year. Once a year is less frequent, but quarterly is very typical. Under this proposal, you will have businesses carrying literally thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars for up to three months until they have the opportunity to claim that money back on their BAS. I had someone, whom I shall not name, suggest, ‘That's not a problem, they can just lodge their BAS monthly.' The people who say these things obviously know very little about the pressures faced by small to medium enterprises in this country. The BAS is a nightmare, and I do not say that in a political sense. I am sure those on both sides of this place would acknowledge, whether or not they are supporters of the GST, that the BAS is now a fact of life-it is a part of doing business-and that the less often you have to do it the better. It is a significant burden on business and you would not want to do it once a month, so to suggest that businesses can fix the problem by lodging monthly is ridiculous and does not fall too kindly on the ears of those who operate those businesses. This is a significant issue not just for the people you would typically think about in respect of this bill-those who are engaged in the petroleum industry and those who drive trucks or transport as part of their business-but for all of the associated people who are caught up in this regime. People in the plastics industry, for example, use petroleum based ingredients to make their products, and they will be caught up in these changes. So it is very significant. The impact that this will have on businesses around the country will go well beyond those whom we would think about in the first instance. The member for Swan, when he speaks to this legislation, will highlight another issue that has just come to my attention: the prospect of some businesses being faced with tax for the first time. A representation has been made to the member for Swan by a business in his electorate. I will let him go into the detail and to name the business if he so wishes. This business simply buys and packages goods to on-sell to the supermarketsfor example, mineral turpentine, white spirits, kerosene, methylated spirits and thinners. The business says that it was not subject to this tax regime under the previous arrangements but it will be under the intended regime, which the bill we are considering today gives effect to. I apologise to the minister for not seeking his imprimatur before I spoke, but I now seek leave to table the letter from that business so that he can look at the claims it contains. It is not a political letter in any sense. When the minister summarises the debate, he will be able to clarify whether the business that has written to the opposition is right in assuming the impact the bill will have on it. Leave granted. Mr Nairn interjecting",22
8,Mr FITZGIBBON,NOES,"I am about to acknowledge that, Minister. This is a significant issue for business. The minister has given me the lead-into go on to the reason we are debating this bill this week rather than the last time we were here. The government did face a revolt from its own backbench. I see the member for Gilmore smiling up the back, and I know she was part of that campaign against her own government. Many members on both sides were very concerned about the significant cash flow impact on small to medium businesses in particular. The government pulled the bill last time we were here-it was on the list for debate all that week-to deal with that significant backbench revolt. The bill is before us again with a not insignificant government amendment. That government amendment effectively defers the introduction of this system for some two years; in other words, it puts in place a transitionary arrangement. While that was welcomed by business-indeed, welcomed by the opposition-it does no more than to defer the issue. In two years time business will be facing the very same proposition that we have been discussing publicly now for the last month or so, so it is really no solution at all. I have thought long and hard about how businesses might prepare themselves for the new system during the transition phase in such a way as to lessen the burden of the new arrangements, but I have not been able to find any answers to that question. The amendment does not change the regime in any way. It simply says, ‘We are still going to do that, but we will allow you two years to prepare yourself for it.' I can foreshadow for the Assistant Treasurer the possibility of my moving an amendment in the consideration in detail stage-if not in this place, in the other place-that will extend that transitionary period ad infinitum. In other words, if this change is going to cause significant pain for small and medium enterprises-and for larger enterprise, for that matter-they will be able to stay in the current system. Let us think about what that means. I suspect there will be some who will say that having some businesses in one system and some in the other will be a bit of a nightmare for the tax office. I say to the members opposite: do we care if there is a small increase in burden on the tax office, with all of its resources, means alleviating a significant burden on small to medium businesses in particular? They might ask whether there is a financial implication. I think not. This is only a timing difference. The government should be able to clarify that point, and I invite sistant Treasurer to do so during his summary on the bill. Would extending the transition period have financial implications for the revenue base? Does the transitionary period have financial implications for the revenue base? I suspect it does not, and that it is no more than a timing difference. I invite the minister to confirm that or to do otherwise when he speaks at the conclusion of the second reading debate. I do this with good intentions. I am inviting the Assistant Treasurer to come back and tell me why this is not a good idea. Come back and tell me why business, particularly small to medium enterprises, should not be able to stay in the current system ad infinitum if the new regime is going to cause significant problems for them on the cash flow front. I notice that the most recent Sensis survey of small business has cash flow amongst the top three issues facing small business, and of course the issue of cash flow is always amongst the top concerns. The government quite rightly argues that, in many senses, the new system is better than the old. Instead of having to do the extra paperwork of claiming back the tax in isolation, simply mould it into the business activity statement. That is a good concept and I do not have any problem with it. But I do have a problem with it if it is going to cause significant cash flow problems for small to medium firms. If the change is only about helping business-and I have not heard the government say it is all about helping the tax officewhy not let business choose which is the better system for them? If they want to do the if it extra paperwork on a more regular basis to secure the rebate earlier, then let them do it. So we say-though it might seem like a conflict in terms-extend the transition period ad infinitum. Give business a choice. Again, I foreshadow that we are considerthe Asing moving an amendment in the in detail stage of the bill. I invite the Minister for Revenue to come back, debate the point and tell us why that should not be done. If he comes up with some good reasons that I have not considered, we will be happy to drop the idea. If it is unworkable we will accept that, but there would have to be some pretty strong points. I want to move on to the introduction of tax on biofuels, LPG, CNG et cetera. This has been a long-running debate. I hope that the politics of this is now settled. People on both sides of this chamber want to support the biofuels industry. They want to support alternative fuels. They want to wean us off our very heavy and increasing dependence on more traditional fuels, as we approach 60 per cent import dependence on oil and are now importing some 22 per cent of our refined petroleum products. Often, when we have this debate, we get bogged down in talking about ethanol, so I want to address that issue. The Labor Party started the ethanol industry in this country. I think it was in 1992 that we first began providing capital grants assistance for the construction of ethanol plants. When we left office, ethanol still enjoyed tax-free status and enjoys tax-free status today. A couple of years ago the government decided-and the opposition agreed with this proposition-that the time would come when ethanol and biodiesel would be allowed to stand on their own feet. In other words, it is great to give these industries support during their infancy and development, particularly given their high up-front capital costs and time it takes to get a return on investmentand we all agreed that they should have that support-but, at some point, they should face the tax regime. On that basis, the Prime Minister finally announced that the phasing-in of those tax arrangements would come into effect. I think it was originally to be in 2008, beginning at very small rate of taxation-2.5 cents, I think-and phasing up to a tax rate equivalent to the fuel's energy content. These provisions also applied in varying ways to other non-traditional fuels like LPG, CNG et cetera. There was a backlash from the industry and, in response to that backlash, and to political pressure, the Prime Minister pushed back the introduction of that regime to 2011. I think there is to be a five-year transition, taking it out to around 2015 or 2016. But the Prime Minister did one other thing. He also announced that, instead of applying the tax at a rate equivalent to energy content, he would apply a rate of tax equivalent to the energy content discounted by 50 per cent. There was no logical reason for discounting it to 50 per cent rather than 40 per cent or 60 per cent or not at all. The Prime Minister was looking for a response to the political pressure and effectively backed down and significantly reduced the tax. At around the same time, the Prime Minister decided that he would give the industry total protection from import competition by applying a full rate of taxation but offsetting it with a production subsidy of the same amount-effectively applying a zero tax regime to all of those fuels. So where are we? We have an industry that has been enjoying government assistance through capital grants since 1992 and which continues to receive capital grants. We have an industry that will be exempt from fuel tax until 2011 and then will receive a the phased-in tax regime which will be less than half of the tax applied to LPG, for example, when it is fully phased-in. And we have an industry which, for the next half dozen or so years, will be fully protected from import competition. It is true that we should be supporting these industries in their infancy. Ethanol crea ates regional jobs and is slightly better for the environment than are some of the more traditional fuels. It is also a very significant ingredient in giving independent fuel retailers a competitive edge over the major players, because whenever you displace a taxed fuel with an untaxed fuel it is obviously cheaper and, if you choose to blend that in your fuel, it gives you a competitive edge. But the concept of mandating I reject. We should not be legislating in this country to force people to buy things. What is next: lemonade in your beer or skim milk in your coffee? And I am still concerned about the state of the market in this industry. It is still dominated in a very large way by one player-to the tune of more than 90 per cent market share, I think. You would be mandating close to a monopoly. So I reject that proposition. But I believe that we should continue to do all we can to grow the market share for these very important alternative fuel supplies, and I extend those sentiments to both LPG and CNG. Very importantly, I also extend those sentiments to the concept of the gas to liquids industry, because, if we are really going to get serious about establishing energy independence in this country in transport fuels, we have to start making use of our abundant reserves of natural gas. There are 140 trillion cubic feet out there which, by using today's technology, could be transformed into liquid diesel fuels which would go straight into existing diesel engines without any modification whatsoever. These liquid diesel fuels will be available to us in abundance if the government just does something about making sure that the oil companies take up those opportunities. It is about broadening the base. We cannot allow oil companies to concentrate only on LNG-that is, liquefying gas and exporting it to the global market. That is a good thing, and the opposition supports that proposition, but at the same time Australia has to be developing itself domestically as a country which is smart enough to use those significant supplies of natural gas for its own domestic purposes. We cannot afford to sit back and wait for the oil companies to tell us, when we really need this gas, that it is a bit too late, that all the easy-to-win stuff has been sold off in global LNG markets and that if we want this gas now we are going to have to pay the higher prices involved in securing the gas, which is typically further offshore and deeper in the sea and therefore much more expensive to win. We need an energy plan on that front, and that energy plan has include a plan for our land transport needs and take into account the need to address the environment. I am not saying that gas to liquids is squeaky clean on the environmental front when you look at it on the whole-of life-cycle analysis, but it does have significant environmental advantages. So the opposition is supporting this bill. It is a new regime that the opposition does not have any great difficulties with. Indeed, there are some improvements in that regime as compared to the one currently being used by those who rely on the scheme. We accept the taxation arrangements on biofuels, LPG and CNG. Again, as I said, we had that debate some years ago, so we are not looking to criticise that or to make changes there. I am conscious that some in the industry are now on the lobby, hoping to phase in the introduction further out-in other words, instead of introducing the scheme from 2011, maybe going out to 2013. They say that the process has been tardy-I will not say that the government has been tardy; the process has been tardy-and that they need a full five years from the inception of the project to reach a maturity where the project becomes profitable. Because the government has been slow to put this into effect, while the date of 2011 gave those in the industry five years when the agreement was made, it does not now give them those five years. If the government wants to bring that debate to the table, we will be happy to hear those arguments as well, but at the moment I am assuming that there is no intention to do so and the government is sticking to the proposals as they are contained in the bill. On that point, the industry is also complaining about the phasing out of import competition. This bill is not specific to that, because the government does not need legisto lation now to begin to reduce that customs levy on imported ethanol and biodiesel. It will not need to do so until 2011. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has kindly written to me in response to some questions I asked on an earlier bill about the parity between domestically produced biodiesels and imported fuel, and he has confirmed that, by the end of this phase-in period, imported ethanol and biodiesel will face the same taxation regime as domestically produced ethanol and biodiesel. I am not sure that the industry was aware of or fully conscious of that when we reached this agreement on the phasing in of this taxation regime. I am not criticising it per se; I think a bit of import competition can be a good thing, and to those who want to mandate ethanol I say that we need imports if we are ever to reach 10 per cent market share. The domestic industry, in my view, would never reach that level of supply. But, having confirmed that the tax regimes will be equivalent after the phasing in of this regime, I want the minister now to confirm that that means he is going to reduce the customs levy rather than provide offshore producers with the production subsidy. I would assume that it means a reduction in the customs levy, but I would like him to confirm that for the House-as obvious as the question might be-because I think the industry needs to have absolute clarity on that point. I remind the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer that I pose those questions to him and that the opposition is considering amending the bill in the consideration in detail stage to make the new arrangements for business permanent so that business, particularly small to medium businesses, will have a choice. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for failing to properly consult with commercial fuel users on the appropriate model for payment of fuel tax; (2) condemns the Government for circulating major amendments less than two hours before debate on the Bill is to be resumed; (3) calls upon the Government to reduce our dependency on foreign oil and to promote: (a) existing alternatives like liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel; (b) emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity; and (c) future fuels, such as hydrogen as Labor has committed to in its Fuels Blueprint; (4) condemns the Government for ignoring the impact of rising petrol prices on Australian families; (5) condemns the Government for increasing petrol prices in regional Australia through the abolition of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme at a time of very high petrol prices; (6) condemns the Government for failing to strengthen the Trade Practices Act to protect competition in the petroleum industry; and (7) condemns the Government for failing to guarantee that the money saved as a result of the abolition of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme will be specifically directed to roads in regional, rural and remote Australia”.",24
9,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Is the amendment seconded? Ms Corcoran-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,28
10,Mrs GASH,NOES,"I rise to speak on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006, the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006 and the additional amendment. Before I start, and while the member for Hunter is still in this place, I say to the member for Hunter: what hypocrisy to say that you started the ethanol projects when you were in government. If not the member for Fraser, who was it who killed the ethanol industry? The member for Fraser told a sob story in this House about a garage mechanic saying that ethanol caused problems in a car system. The owner of the car had to go through all the hassles of having his motor reformed. The truth is that the problems were not caused by ethanol but by kerosene. Did the member for Fraser have the guts to apologise to this House? No, not the member for Fraser. He hid behind his constituents and said absolutely nothing; it suited him not to say anything. Just remember that, member for Hunter. I point out that some unintended consequences could occur with this legislation. I refer to statements made by Renewable Fuels Australia, the RFA. In particular, I want to address the issue of impacts, imports and market access with regard to biofuel operators if this legislation goes ahead in its present form. I have long been an advocate of the Australian biofuels industry and boast a significant Manildra ethanol plant in my electorate of Gilmore. Contrary to the member for Hunter, I am clearly on the record as being in favour of mandating ethanol in Australian fuel and have strongly supported the expansion of the biofuels industry. It is fair to say that we have taken some dramatic steps in the right direction, and for that I am very grateful. The agreement reached between the government and the oil companies is a substantial step in the right direction, the proof will be in the pudding and we will all have to wait and see what the oil companies will do to meet their part of the agreement. I also want to refer to the original proposal, the object of this legislation, which is that the proposed amendments to the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006 are intended to assist taxpayers to make the transition to the new fuel tax credit system by enabling eligible taxpayers to make claims for the early payment of fuel tax credits. In the context of the changes, the amendments will allow taxpayers a two-year transitional period to align their business practices to the new claiming arrangements and will ameliorate negative cash flow effects that may be associated with claiming fuel tax credits via the BAS. This is wonderful news for our fishermen in the Gilmore electorate, but it is also fair to say that in this Fuel Tax Bill the consumer is becoming more and more aware of the need to explore alternative fuel options and, with that, all support should be given to the Australian biofuels and ethanol industry. I believe that support of the Australian biofuels industry can be strengthened within the Fuel Tax Bill 2006. In saying that, I would like to see the legislation (1) recognise the market barriers to ethanol and biodiesel fuels entering the mainstream transport fuel market prior to 2006 and ensure that applicable excise rates commence on 1 July 2016 and reach their final stage by 30 June 2020; (2) acknowledge the unique benefits of domestically produced ethanol and biodiesel by providing that any tax or duty imposed be incurred at half the rate imposed on imported ethanol and biodiesel; and (3) ensure that end user levels of diesel and diesel-like fuels meet the national diesel and biodiesel fuel quality standard and be treated the same in but terms of tax credits and rebates. The bill provides that alternative fuels that were previously untaxed would start their transition to their future tax rates from 1 July 2011 at specified annual rates of increase until their final fuel tax rate of 12.5c per litre for ethanol and 19.1c per litre for biodiesel by 30 June 2015. This policy was introduced in 2003 together with a range of measures designed to assist alternative fuels in establishing their place in the transport fuel market before the fuel excise tax regime was introduced between 2001 and 2015. While alternative fuels such as LPG and natural gas have already established their place in the market and are able to enjoy this benefit, biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel were not, due to fuel market entry barriers to ethanol and biodiesel that were not effectively addressed until 2006. Consideration must be given to measures that enable the biofuels industry to access these intended benefits and assist in stimulating new ethanol and biodiesel industry growth in Australia. This is consistent with government policy that a viable and sustainable biofuels industry is in the national interest of Australia. In addition to the transition of previously untaxed alternative fuels to their final fuel tax excise rates between 2011 and 2015, it is proposed that restrictions on the import of alternative fuel would also be progressively removed between 2011 and 2015, at the same time as the transition to the rate of new fuel tax excise regime on alternative fuels. Whilst the formal tax rates are set at 25c per litre for ethanol and 38c per litre for biodiesel, alternative fuels were granted a 50 per cent discount in recognition of the benefits of domestically produced biofuels such as energy security, greenhouse reductions, carbon credits, rural and regional economics, jobs growth et cetera. Imported ethanol and biodiesel make no contribution to domestic benefits. On this basis, the final excise rates for ethanol were set at 12.5c per litre for ethanol and 19.1c per litre for biodiesel but totally ignore the restricted policies of other countries that Australia will have to compete with. I believe that the measures I have stated for consideration would better acknowledge the nationally recognised benefits associated with domestically produced alternative fuels. Today the Australian biodiesel industry has access to 100 per cent of the petroleum diesel fuel market and is supplying 100 per cent biodiesel fuel, a 50 per cent biodiesel blend with diesel fuel and a 20 per cent biodiesel blend fuel to on-road and off-road diesel fuel users in Australia which meet the national biodiesel standard and/or the national diesel fuel standard. Consideration must be given to my earlier stated points to avoid any circumstance that will deny biodiesel access to 70 to 75 per cent of the Australian diesel fuel market under the proposed road user charges regime. This embraces the off-road market, including agriculture and mining activities and the heavy transport market associated with vehicles over 4½ tonnes. Under this regime only a fuel containing a five per cent biodiesel blend with petrol will be deemed to meet the diesel fuel standards and thus be eligible for tax credits or grants. This would place Australia out of step with world practice and create a discriminatory, artificial industry and market barrier that will force biodiesel sales to the major oil companies and distributors via a B5 blended diesel fuel. Consideration should be given to guarantee equal treatment between petroleum diesel and alternative fuels such as biodiesel and, in the future, ethanol in the Australian diesel fuel market. The issue of fairness in the biofuels industry is of utmost importance to those Australians who have invested heavily in local and regional areas, such as my electorate of Gilmore. I do not want to see $500 million and 285 direct jobs jeopardised. It has been a long hard road to rebuild consumer confidence with ethanol after, as I mentioned earlier in my speech, the deliberate scare campaign by members of the Labor Party to discredit not only ethanol-a large percentage of which comes from my electorate-but also the owner of our Manildra plant. In doing so, they succeeded in seeing 30 jobs go from Manildra in Bomaderry and many others in rural areas of Australia. I note that Minister Macfarlane stated, from a recent meeting with the ethanol sector, that there are further plans to increase sales over the next two years by BP, United Petroleum, Woolworths, Caltex and Farmers Fuel. While all this is fantastic news, together with the reaffirmation of the target of 350 million litres by 2010, I would like to add my support to Minister Vaile's comment that this date needs to be brought forward and that supply needs to be increased. With our ever-increasing fuel costs and growing demand, I feel that 350 million litres by 2010 is merely a drop in the bucket. Australia can and should do more to ease the crisis and, if that means imposing further voluntary demands on the oil companies, then so be it. One only has to look at our ever-increasing fuel deficit to realise that this trend cannot allowed to continue. To increase tax on Australian produced ethanol and lower the cost of imported product is not the way to go. It concerns me to see how the large fuel companies can influence our policies. On a closing note, I note that the ethanol industry in Brazil is quite advanced. If matters continue to unfold as they are, Brazil is set to become a major exporter of ethanol. By imposing extra taxes on our fledgling industry, we are in fact discouraging selfsufficiency and pushing towards a reliance on overseas imports. We have the capability here to be self-sufficient in ethanol and biodiesel, with the accompanying potential to export to other countries. Unless we encourage the growth of our home industry, we may well be consigning ourselves from the frying pan into the fire. We are a net importer of oil and, as our own supplies dwindle, this will inevitably increase. We need to look beyond immediate needs and adopt a longer term strategy that will not ransom us to overseas interests. To suggest that we ought to start taxing ethanol production from 2011 is to me a retrograde step and should be discounted. It was in September 2005 that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister announced that a viable biofuels industry was in the national interest and certain timetables and take-up use was committed to by Caltex, BP and Shell. It was these take-up targets together with the finally revealed tax implications of the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 that lead me to ask this government to rethink its policy by making further amendments and/or changes, as I stated earlier in my speech, in considering to extend by five years from 2016 to 2020 the transitional phase in percentage of excise of imports for biofuels. Finally, I would like to mention the phasein timetables for the biofuels industry entering the market in relation to the new exbe cise/import regime. The take-up rate has been very slow. Already some six years have been lost. Therefore, there is a definite need to reconsider the phase-in period; if not, it could pose great difficulties for new entrants into the biofuels industry, as it will be some two to three years before new projects are completed. In speaking to this bill, I ask the government to consider some of the unintended consequences of this bill. I also remind once again the Australian people who it was that killed ethanol in this House.",28
11,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,NOES,"I rise today to speak on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006. In response to the member for Gilmore with respect to the ethanol industry, I want to say this: this House is generally supportive of the ethanol industry. It is about time that some ethanol producers understood and accepted that, whilst we are supportive of the development of the ethanol industry, we are not supportive of their endeavours to intimidate refining companies in Australia into purchasing not ethanol but their product, representing imported oil including ethanol, so as to maximise their own profit and their own dividends. If those producers want support for ethanol, let us sell ethanol and not let it be about them trying to intimidate industry into purchasing their refined product inclusive of ethanol, which is what they are currently seeking to do with respect to some of the oil refining companies in Australia and outlets around Australia. Having said that, I think-and I am surprised the member for Gilmore did not comment on this-it is unfortunate that this debate is occurring at this time. The government has proposed significant amendments to the bill but, in a flagrant abuse of courtesy to the parliament, the amendments were only available two hours before the debate commenced today. Not only has the government provided insufficient time for proper review and consideration of the proposed amendments but we are debating these bills before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee has completed its inquiry into them-an inquiry going to some of the concerns raised by the member for Gilmore. Again, I believe the government is making a mockery of parliamentary process. The Senate inquiry had the support of members in this House but, for the purposes of this debate, the government is requiring members of the House to ignore that inquiry and anything it might find that might go to the application of the bills once they become law. The committee's report on the inquiry will not become available until this afternoon, we are told. What message does that send to the 32 organisations and individuals who made written submissions to the inquiry and to the many who appeared in public hearings before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee? It simply sends a message that this government, in an arrogant way, will only pay lip-service to parliamentary processes. They could ask, ‘Why bother? Why waste our time in the future?' I simply believe that the least the Australian electorate and the peak bodies that represent varied constituencies should be able to expect is that the government follows due process. What confidence can those organisations have in a parliament that flagrantly disregards due process? It has taken two years to get from the last policy pronouncement to the introduction of these bills into this parliament. It is laughable to now suggest that there is such urgency that debate cannot wait until tomorrow or the day after to enable us to properly review the outcome of the Senate reference. I remind the House that it has taken a long time to get this legislation. The initial policy announcements date back as far as the 200304 budget, culminating in the June 2004 energy white paper. These bills are just another example of the tardiness with which legislation is being handled by the government. Just look at the backlog of the legislation before the House. The standards of the House and the Senate are something that I would expect both sides of politics would want to uphold. I ask members on both sides to take a firm stand and to put an end to the sloppiness and stop the slide with respect to the performance of the House and the Senate. I believe we owe it to our constituents. Let us go to the bills. One of the key features of the proposed reforms is to implement a four-band fuel excise system loosely-and I emphasise loosely-based on energy content. The bands define fuels as having high-, mediumand low-energy content and there is a fourth band for other fuels such as compressed natural gas. Federal Labor supported the proposal to extend the effective excise-free period for biofuels and the LPG industry by three years until 2011 and has supported legislation to introduce mandatory cleaner fuel standards that should benefit environmentally friendly fuels and benefit the Australian community generally with respect to the debate about a clean environment. However, whilst Labor supported this approach, I remind the House that the overwhelming reason was to provide some certainty for the alternative fuels industry and refining industry. That is the crux to investment in Australia-certainty in the legislative environment that industry confronts in making investment decisions. It is also important, contrary to the views suggested by the member for Gilmore, that we put on the record that federal Labor has always supported the alternative fuels industry. It is interesting that the member for more, who was elected in 1996, did not raise the issues that I now seek to remind the House about. It was the Keating Labor government which introduced an 18c a litre production bounty for ethanol in the 1993 budget in addition to the zero excise rating for the product. The Howard government abolished the bounty scheme one year early in the 1996-97 budget, the first budget the member for Gilmore had to respond to, and it has consistently undermined the industry since by changing the playing field on a regular basis. In the last parliament alone Howard government changed its mind three times on the excise regime for not only ethanol but also LPG. And they talk about certainty for the purposes of encouraging industry investment in Australia's long-term future! The record of the Howard government on this very important industry has been the lack of certainty it has put in place. Despite his May 2002 view that applying excise to ethanol and LPG was a bad idea, the Treasurer announced that he would do just that in the 2003 budget. He announced that biofuels and LPG would be subject to excise from July 2008. In December 2003 he changed his mind yet again, announcing a new excise regime to apply from July 2011. Between May and December 2003 the LPG industry was in absolute turmoil-and one can understand why. Many of the small business operators involved in LPG conversion and maintenance suffered serious business downturns due to the uncertainty about the excise regime. Of course, the biofuels industry also suffered during this period, with no certainty for new investors in the industry. And the member for Gilmore wants to talk about certainty in the industry! With the problems in the industry because of the lack of strong direction and certainty from the Howard government over the last 10 years, it Gilhas taken some time for the industry to recover. It has recovered mainly because record-high petrol prices have meant that consumers have been more willing to set aside their concerns about fuel tax uncertainty than they would otherwise have been and that biofuels are now more price attractive to refiners and marketers. The history of the Howard government's double backflips on alternative fuels-and they amounted to double backflips-is in stark contrast to the stability of Labor's position throughout its 13 years in office, when it maintained the LPG the excise exemption introduced in 1979 for fuel security reasons. The other stark contrast is the Prime Minister's interest in fuel security back in 1979 compared to his complete lack of interest today as Prime Minister, when fuel security has never been so important and petrol prices have never been so high. As I have said before, this government treats tax cuts as ‘go away' money for motorists worried about petrol prices. It has no long-term vision for where we are going with the very serious challenge of fuel security for Australia. It is the debate and the new Cold War internationally. It is where we really are in the global community at the moment in terms of energy. Energy is the cause of tension in the global community. Yet we found nothing in the recent budget to bolster Australia's fuel supply security or to look to the long term. The fact is that, without developing large scale alternative fuel industries in Australia, we will increasingly be hostage to supplies from the Middle East, West Africa and Russia-and, frankly, who would want to put our future in the hands of the instability that rently exists in the Middle East, West Africa and Russia? We need long-term government action now aimed at securing Australia's future and the future of our children and grandchildren. We should not leave Australia to be held hostage to the Middle East, West Africa and Russia. It is about time the Prime Minister understood those concerns, which are widely held by Australian industry and ordinary householders. I do not need to spell out the implications of that for energy security. Australians around the kitchen table tonight want to know that their governments and the companies with stewardship of their resources have a plan to secure their energy supplies for the future at affordable prices. That is what ordinary Australian households are concerned about at the moment-security at reasonable prices. But there is no plan by the Howard government and, therefore, those people sitting around the kitchen table this evening are not relaxed and comfortable with the lack of the Howard government's action on fuel security and Australia's mediumto long-term interests. Creating the right fiscal and regulatory regime to make gas to liquids a new industry option and a new fuel supply source for Australia is just not on under the Howard government, and it ought to be. The Prime Minister was thinking about energy security in 1979, but it is not on his radar in 2006. Despite its enormous potential for Australia-and it is enormous-the Prime Minister has decided to tax gas to liquids diesel as a high-energy fuel with no discount as an alternative fuel. Unlike other alternative fuels, he has done nothing to provide any industry framework to encourage the establishment of the gas to liquids fuel industry in Australia. The Labor Party, alternatively, has always been a strong supporter of both gas to liquids and coal to liquids. This is, of course, interestingly about the curcommercialisation of clean coal technology for power generation in Australia, which is about the greenhouse debate and the environment debate whilst also giving us a sense of security with respect to access to fuel for the future. I can recall the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, as the resource minister over 20 years ago, being a great advocate of gas and coal to liquids technologies. He was ahead of his time on this issue. Similarly, we pursued this issue in the last parliament with the position of Joel Fitzgibbon, the former shadow minister for resources, and we will continue to pursue it because we believe establishing new nation-building industries is not easy. It requires more than anything sustained leadership, a focus at the national level, to actually make it happen. It requires leadership and determination, something that the Howard government lacks with respect to this major challenge. I also remind the House that there is a more recent history. It is now almost five years since Senator Minchin, who was then the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, appointed a gas to liquids task force to investigate the feasibility and benefits of establishing a gas to liquids industry in Australia. So the Prime Minister might not have much interest, but there is a little bit of form on the other side in the actions of the former minister for resources, Senator Minchin, to actually consider the gas to liquids industry. But, despite that report, five years on no action has been taken. Our reliance on imported oil and fuel is increasing and, while the LNG market is booming, it remains a tough job to get new gas projects off the ground in Australia. Senator Minchin's task force noted that, while Australia could simply wait for the market to provide an incentive for a gas to liquids industry, once gas supply infrastructure is in place and investment is sunk in other countries where taxation infrastructure incentives are on offer today, those countries will serve as investment hubs for expansion for many years to come. It is about focusing on potential lost opportunities that would be lost for many years to come. Unfortunately, that is what is happening. Just go to Qatar to see whether the findings of the task force are actually happening at the moment. The implication of the task force was that Australia's remote gas fields could be left stranded from markets for even longer because, by and large, it will be cheaper to expand existing projects than to build new ones here. I am sure this is a concept Australia's LNG industry already fully understands. The task force highlighted the potential significance of a gas to liquids industry to Australia's economy, saying it could underwrite offshore gas supply infrastructure to bring forward the possibility of major new domestic gas pipelines to connect the national market, increase domestic gas competition and energise gas exploration-a pretty important challenge and objective for Australia. The task force said: These benefits would be of national strategic significance to Australia. It further went on: The cost of any government intervention must be considered against the potential benefits. The potential benefits, as we all appreciate, go beyond unlocking new resource wealth and creating new industry, more jobs, more apprenticeships and more exports. They include the opportunity for Australia to address this most pressing problem of all: our future transport fuel security. When do you ever hear the Prime Minister addressing our future transport fuel security? It was not addressed in the recent budget and it is not being addressed by the Prime Minister today. It is also interesting that three years ago a CSIRO report, Energy and transport sector: outlook to 2020, laid out its proposed strategy for Australia's transport future. It defined that strategy as one that identified gas to liquids and coal to liquids as the keys to our future transport fuel security. It was not just the opposition, it was not just Senator Minchin, as the then minister for resources; it also included CSIRO. The report said: The global future for evolution of transport fuels and vehicles is driven by greenhouse gas and oil supply issues and is very uncertain. Australia's strategy must be flexible and segmented. The proposed strategy, offering a 60% reduction in GHG, decreased dependence on oil and a platform for future H2 use, involves: - Migration to diesel, using best practice technology and fuel standards; - Production of “clean” diesel from natural gas or coal with CO2 sequestration; - Development of hybrid cars and light vehicles, fuelled by diesel. - Niche segments may be developed for compressed natural gas, with the added advantage of commencing infrastructure options for future hydrogen-based systems. These are all current issues in the debate not only about nuclear, clean coal technology and solar energy but also about where we as a community will achieve security with respect to transport fuels. The tragedy is that we can all see the potential but that the reality remains just beyond our grasp. Without sustained and committed national leadership to deliver the right policy settings and the right fiscal environment-that is about government policy, if the House does not understand it-it will remain beyond our grasp. It will leave us open to pressure from the Middle East with respect to future access to transport fuels. I am not prepared to risk Australia's future in the face of the instability that currently exists in the Middle East. Just look at the price of oil in Australia at the moment. Therefore, I suggest it is time for the Prime Minister to seriously review the petroleum resource rent tax regime and, in doing so, consider special treatment of capital investment in gas to liquids projects and associated gas production infrastructure. The Prime Minister should be facing up to some responsibility for resource related infrastructure instead of passing the buck to the states. In that context, he should think about the dividend to the Commonwealth from the potential Gorgon project-a huge dividend to the Commonwealth that could be ploughed back into the development of this industry. Above all, the Howard government should be sending a clear signal to Australians that it is interested in their future supply security and will not deliver it to the perils of the Middle East. The Prime Minister should be sending a clear signal to industry that we want a gas to liquids and coal to liquids industry as part of Australia's national energy strategy. I return briefly to the objectives of these bills. The opposition welcomes the measures in these bills and proposes amendments that provide for a more appropriate framework and administrative regime for providing credits for business fuel use. However, the government is to be condemned for failing to properly consult with commercial fuel users on the appropriate model for payment of fuel tax and for its failure to understand the implications of the workings of the BAS on cash flow in small and seasonal businesses. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. (Time expired)  Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006 is a companion bill to the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and provides the transitional arrangements to phase in the fuel tax credit scheme while phasing out the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme, Fuel Tax Grant Scheme and the state administered Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme. The Commonwealth government announced a major program of reform to modernise and simplify the fuel tax scheme in its energy white paper, Securing Australia's energy future. The reform program is scheduled to commence on 1 July 2006 with the introduction of a single fuel tax credit scheme to replace the current complex system of fuel tax credit concessions, with final changes taking effect from 1 July 2012. The changes will lower compliance costs, reduce tax on business and remove the burden of fuel tax for thousands of individual businesses and households. fuel When fully implemented, the fuel tax credit scheme will ensure that general fuel tax is only levied on business use of fuel in travelling on a public road in motor vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of 4.5 tonnes or less; onroad business use in motor vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of more than 4.5 tonnes but only to the extent of the road user charge; on-road private use in motor vehicles and in certain off-road applications; and aviation fuels. The break point of 4.5 tonnes or less gross vehicle mass aligns eligibility for fuel tax credits with the additional licensing conditions that must be met in all Australian jurisdictions to drive a vehicle of this mass or greater and the Australian design rules for heavy vehicles. In addition, the heavy vehicle charges determination that establishes the road user charges for heavy vehicles applies to vehicles over 4.5 tonnes. Under the fuel tax credit system, all taxable fuel acquired or manufactured in, or imported into, Australia for use in off-road applications for business purposes will become tax free over time. This will for the first time provide fuel tax relief to businesses involved in a range of activities. For example, businesses involved in manufacturing, quarrying and construction will become entitled to fuel tax relief. Other major beneficiartion ies will include primary production, mining and commercial power generation. Further, the excise currently levied on burner fuels such as heating oil and kerosene and on fuels used in commercial and household electricity generation will be effectively removed from 1 July 2006. As part of this process, all currently untaxed fuels used in internal combustion engines will be brought into the fuel tax system over time with the intention of imposing fuel tax on fuels where they are used in transport applications. Fuel tax will be applied to the currently untaxed fuels of liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas from 1 July 2011. Effective fuel tax on these fuels will phase in over five equal annual steps commencing on 1 July 2011 and ending on 1 July 2015. The final fuel tax rate applying to these fuels incorporate a 50 per cent discount on the energy content fuel tax rates that would otherwise apply. The purpose of the transitional provisions is to ensure that the claimants receiving a grant continue to benefit from the fuel tax concessions and to phase in the extension of eligibility for off-road business use and fuel over time. Currently ineligible off-road activities will become eligible for a 50 per cent fuel tax credit from 1 July 2008 and a full tax credit from 1 July 2012. The bill also makes consequential amendments to 10 other acts which will operate under the general compliance and administrative umbrella of the Australian Taxation Administration Act 1953. The Fuel Tax Bill 2006 administers certain other indirect taxes, such as the GST, luxury car tax and the wine equalisation tax, and will operate under a new part of the schedule to the Taxation Administration Act 1953. This part will be modelled on the current indirect tax provisions in part VI of the TaxaAdministration Act 1953. This means that entities will generally have the same rights and obligations in relation to the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 as they now have to other indirect tax laws. The bill also repeals the Fuel Sales Grants Act 2000, from 1 January 2007, and the States Grants (Petroleum Products) Act 1965 from 1 July 2007 in accordance with the government's decision to abolish the Fuel Tax Grant Scheme and the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme from 1 July 2006. As a supplement to measures already in place for addressing the environmental impact of fuel use, the government will introduce two new measures to ensure that those businesses receiving fuel tax credits meet appropriate environmental standards. These environmental measures are the requirement of large fuel users who claim over will $3 million each year in fuel tax credits to become members of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program.",31

13,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his statement to Alan Jones on Radio 2GB on 4 August: I mean some people have to work on public holidays ... it would be absurd and unfair and unreasonable if somebody has to work on a public holiday that that person isn't compensated by being paid whatever it is, the double time or the time and a half ... I just want to make the general comment that those arrangements are going to continue. Prime Minister, given that under the Spotlight AWA Mrs Harris gets an extra 2c an hour for working on a public holiday but loses $21.40 an hour in penalty rates, isn't this absurd, unfair and unreasonable?",38
14,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let me inform the Leader of the Opposition that Mrs Harris is not on that AWA. Employment,38
15,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister update the House on the latest labour market survey from the Australian Bureau of Statistics? How does this survey compare to previous surveys? What factors have influenced these results?,38
16,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe. As he and many will know, last Thursday was a great day for the workers of Australia. Last Thursday saw the unemployment rate in this country fall below five per cent for the first time since 1976. We recorded a magnificently low unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent-and this despite the fact that the workforce participation rate had increased. This was a fall in unemployment in the face of a greater number of people looking for work and being more confident about getting work than virtually at any time over the last 40 or 50 years. This is a reminder that good economic policy reforms over a period of time ultimately produce great economic dividends. The low unemployment of today is a product of yesterday's reforms. The still lower unemployment of tomorrow will be a product of today's reforms. There is not much doubt that in Australian politics at the present time only one party stands for reform, and that is the coalition parties. Only the Liberal and National parties have the courage to make the reforms that are necessary to guarantee that, as the years go by, unemployment not only will remain where it is now but hopefully will go even lower. When I heard the ABS figures, my mind went back almost 10 years to a speech made by the then opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the then member for Canberra, now the member for Fraser. When the message conveying to the House that the industrial relations legislation of 1996, in its amended form, had come back from the Senate, the then member for Canberra, speaking on behalf of the opposition, criticised the legislation. He called it ‘flawed and unfair' and said that it left many bad features intact. He said it left a bill that undermined the three pillars of the Australian industrial relations system. But, interestingly, he asked a series of questions. No doubt he intended those questions, 10 years ago, to be rhetorical, but nonetheless he asked them. The first question he asked, in November 1996, was: Will there be fewer industrial disputes over this three-year term under this regime than there were in the last three years under the old regime? The second question he asked was: Perhaps more importantly, will there be more jobs created in this parliamentary term under this regime than there were in the last term of the parliament? Particularly, will there be more jobs created in small business? Everybody remembers the doomsday talk by the then Leader of the Opposition-he is still the Leader of the Opposition-and the then industrial relations spokesman. They said that the world was going to come to an end and the sky would fall in. We all know that the only thing that has fallen in the last 10 years is the level of unemployment; it has more than halved under this government. I can also inform the member that not only has the unemployment rate more than halved under this government but the ABS figures released last week for the March quarter show that 81 per cent fewer working days were lost in the March quarter of 2006 than in the March quarter of 1996. So that is the answer to the question posed by the then member for Canberra almost 10 years ago, when he was trying to whip the House into a frenzy. He was saying that if we passed the legislation Armageddon would come, the world would suffer great pestilence and desolation, there would be riots in the streets and murders in the homes and you would have to maintain the barricades-and so he went on. Isn't that all very familiar? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order understanding order 104. This has been going on for more than eight minutes now. It is just a rant.

37,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sydney is warned!,40
38,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"has fallen to a 30-year low. One of the things that has underpinned this remarkable performance by the Australian economy has been the industrial relations reforms of this government. Those reforms of 10 years ago, which the Labor Party said would destroy the living standards of Australia, have enhanced the living standards of Australia. One of the features is of course the introduction of Australian workplace agreements-those same workplace agreements that the Leader of the Opposition said in October last year that you could not get rid of. Yet eight months later the Leader of the Opposition, in his speech to the ALP conference in Sydney at the weekend, said that, if he became Prime Minister, he would get rid of Australian workplace agreements. In the process he is committing himself to reducing the living standards of hundreds of thousands of Australian workers. He is attacking the aspirational, the workers of the outer suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne. He is taking on the hopes and the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of people in this country who want to negotiate free of union interference, who the do not believe they need a union supervisor beside them to look after their own best interests. The Labor Party's policy announced at the weekend is all about handing back total control of Australia's industrial relations system to the trade union movement of this country. The Leader of the Opposition's logic is that a movement that has only 20 per cent of the participants in the private sector of the Australian workforce should control 100 per cent of the deals that are made between Australian workers and their employers. The real explanation for the decision that was announced by the Leader of the Opposition is not job security for Australians but job security for the Leader of the Opposition. He should have taken the advice of his highly successful British counterpart, Tony Blair, the leader of the British Labour Party, in a famous speech to the British Trades Union Congress on 9 September 1997. I have quoted that speech before, but I think it is worth quoting again. He famously said: You should remember in everything you do that fairness at work starts with the chance of a job in the first place ... That is not an attitude that the Leader of the Opposition has ever been particularly interested in, because he has never displayed a great deal of interest in the unemployed. One of the most revealing interviews of his life was given on The 7.30 Report on 6 May 1993, when unemployment had reached almost 11 per cent and he was the minister for employment. The interviewer had this to say: So this groupthe unemployedare being told, in their twenties, by society, tively: You're the losers; go to the scrap heap. The Leader of the Opposition said in reply: Well, those who haven't made it into work and who are among the long-term unemployed, that's a reasonable statement. In other words, with 11 per cent unemployed, with his government having been in power for 10 years, he cared not a jot about the unemployed. He does not care about the unemployed now. He did not care about them then. Not caring about the unemployed was bad enough, but at the weekend he added another group he does not care about: the strivers and the aspirational people of Australia-the people who want to do better, the people who want to work harder. They want rewards for that hard work and they want to make their own decisions about their future. I have another piece of advice for the Leader of the Opposition, and it is to be found in the same speech made by Mr Tony Blair to the Trades Union Congress on 9 September 1997. As I read this part of the speech, I thought of the New South Wales ALP conference. This is what Mr Blair had to say: The old ways of the Labour Party were the resolutionists, the committee rooms, the fixing and the small groups trying to run the show. That is what happened at the weekend. There was a meeting between Mr Beazley and Mr Robertson of Unions NSW, and out of that came the big flip-flop of the Leader of the Opposition that has resulted in his absurd attack on the aspirations of hundreds of thousands of Australians. Workplace Relations",40
39,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Doesn't the government's own Employment Advocate confirm that 100 per cent of Australian Workplace Agreements, AWAs-that is, all effecof them-exclude at least one protected award condition, 64 per cent exclude leave loading, 63 per cent exclude penalty rates, 52 per cent exclude shiftwork loadings and 16 per cent expressly exclude all protected award conditions? Prime Minister, how can this lead to anything other than a 2c an hour wages race to the bottom?",41
40,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the member for Perth knows, those same figures confirm that there have been very significant wage increases over and above the awards under all of those things. The member for Perth, like the Leader of the Opposition, is very good in his selective quotation. Ms Plibersek interjecting",42
41,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sydney has been warned.,42
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"But nothing can alter the fact that 10 years ago you said the same thing; 10 years ago you said that living standards were going to fall and 10 years later Australians are better off than they have ever been. The problem that the opposition have is that they hate the prosperity of today's Australians. They resent the fact that it is government that has delivered unparalleled prosperity to working Australians. They resent the fact that the very hard working aspirational Australians are the very people who rejected you in 2001, who rejected you in 2004 and, the way you are carrying on, who will reject you in even greater measure the next time they have an opportunity. Workplace Relations",42
43,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how Australia's exporters have benefited from the government's workplace relations reforms over the past decade? How are the new workplace relations reforms further assisting exporters to keep our economy strong and provide jobs in regional Australia? I ask: are there any alternative views?,42
44,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Mallee for his question. It is a well-known statistic that during the course of the last 10 or so years Australia's exports have increased from $99 billion to $177 billion. There have been record exports of beef, lamb, iron ore and coal-all exports and horticultural products coming from the member for Mallee's electorate and coming out of regional Australia. That is the powerhouse of Australian exporting. The coalition government have undertaken some significant industrial relations reforms in the 10 years since we have been in office, and none more important than the reforms of 10 years ago, particularly the waterfront reform that took place around that time. We were languishing in international competitiveness scales at an average of 17 lifts of 20-foot equivalent containers per hour on our waterfront. We were being told we could not do any better, that it was impossible to improve. This government had this the backbone to take on the challenge of reforming the waterfront, and today that 17 lifts an hour has moved to 28 lifts an hour. It has been one of the most important reforms. It has improved the efficiency and competitiveness of Australia's export industries. Our other workplace reforms during our term of office have helped to generate new jobs. Our exporting industries generate one in four jobs in regional Australia and one in five jobs across Australia. Our workplace relations reforms have helped create 1.8 million new jobs in Australia. Last week unemployment fell to 4.9 per cent in Australia, which is something that the Labor Party, when they were in office, could only dream about, let alone ever achieve. Over the weekend, we saw a new-found policy dimension of the Leader of the Opposition. He is going to completely abolish Australian workplace agreements where, on average, people on workplace AWAs are earning more today than people on certified agreements do. At the end of last year, I heard an interesting case in point. The Leader of the Opposition should listen to this, because this is the effect his policies are going to have on one of Australia's major export industries. Earlier this year or late last year, I visited Hamersley Iron, run by Rio Tinto in the Pilbara. The entire workforce is on individual workplace agreements. Twenty years ago, the productivity in that industry was 10,000 tonnes of iron ore per full-time employee. Today it is 41,000 tonnes. That entire workforce is very happy with the arrangements they have today, which have been negotiated between the company and the individual employees-and the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip this up. He has picked up a policy from the playbook of the former member for Werriwa. The former member for Werriwa went to Western Australia in 2004 and told the mining industry about it, and they were aghast. Now the Leader of the Opposition has picked up this policy, because his prospects of staying on as Leader of the Opposition are shortening-to put it mildly. He has picked up this policy of Mark Latham's and he is showing a distinct lack of judgment, as he did in the lead-up to the 2004 election when he said that Mark Latham was ready to be Prime Minister. Workplace Relations",42
45,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister.

I cannot and will not even attempt, because I am not in possession of the facts, to pass a judgment on the circumstances of that lady's position. What I am in a position to do, and to do with some authority, is to tell the parliament-and through the parliament, the Australian people-the aggregate jobs position under this government compared with the aggregate jobs position under the alternative government. I can tell the Australian people that unemployment has reached a 30-year low. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 104, this was a specific question about an individual worker and her loss of unfair dismissal rights.

61,Mr JOHNSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer outline for the Ryan electorate recent data on the Australian economy? What does this indicate about the Australian economic outlook? Are there any threats to this economic outlook?,44
62,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to outline for the Ryan electorate what is happening with the national economy. The national accounts were released for the March quarter last week, and they showed that growth in Australia has kicked up, growing 0.9 per cent for the March quarter and 3.1 per cent through the year, which is a significant tick-up. Household consumption was moderate, and national growth was led by business investment. New machinery and equipment investment grew by 1.5 per cent and is 27.1 per cent higher through the year. Although private engineering construction fell in March, it remains 13.8 per cent higher through the year. Exports grew by 0.5 per cent, whilst imports grew by only 0.4 per cent. As a consequence of that, net exports did not detract from growth. We are now seeing the Australian economy adjusting out of what was unsustainable housing investment and into business investment and we are beginning to see increasing export volumes. The good news about the growth in the national economy is that new jobs continue to be created, with 56,000 new persons given jobs in the month of May. All members of the House will welcome the fact that new jobs were created in the month of May. Over the last year, 172,000 new jobs have been created. I am asked about threats to the economy. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 104, answers must be relevant to the question. The question was very specific. It was about the electorate of Ryan, which the Treasurer has not mentioned once.",44
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler would be aware that there were more parts to that question than just one. I call the Treasurer.,45
64,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asked what threats there are to the economy. Obviously there are threats from international factors such as oil prices, which are not good for the economy, but the greatest threat to the Australian economy domestically-in Ryan!would be the election of the Leader of the Opposition. I can think of nothing that could be worse for the Australian economy than Kim Beazley being in a position of influence. Unemployment went below five per cent last week, and the Leader of the Opposition was nowhere to be seen. As a journalist in the Australian recorded: Australia records its lowest unemployment rate in 30 years and poor old Kim Beazley is worrying about temporary immigrants undermining union rorts. The journalist said: Beazley is the leaf blower of Australian politics Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, understanding order 104. It is true that the Treasurer did mention Ryan once, but now he is straying again and I ask you to bring him back to the question.",45
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will make two points for the benefit of the member for Grayndler. Firstly, as I heard the question, the Treasurer was asked to tell the electors of Ryan about the economy. Secondly, the Treasurer should refer to members by their seat or by their title. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The standing orders require that members remain in their seats. I would point out to you that the Chief Opposition Whip seems to be putting himself in line for the cameras and he should be asked to take his seat.",45
66,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would remind all members that understanding order 62 they are expected to assume their seats when they come into the chamber. I would ask the member for Shortland to observe standing order 62.  of order. I think it is fair enough for me to inquire as to whether one of the members of the opposition has been warned. I know a couple have, and that was the purpose of my question. I think it is a legitimate question for me to ask.",45
67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Chief Opposition Whip, but I was not aware he was asking me a question.",45
68,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am in the process of explaining threats to the Australian economy. There could be no greater threat to the Australian economy than the Leader of the Opposition being in a position of influence. As the journalist recorded in the Australian on Friday: ... Beazley is the leaf blower of Australian politicslots of noise but all that comes out is hot air. He is not just a normal leaf blower. He is not an economic four-cylinder leaf blower; he is a V8 turbocharged double-exhaust leaf blower. There is no end to the leaf blowing and the hot air that comes out as a consequence.

72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Treasurer. I am sure the Treasurer will be bringing his answer to a conclusion.,46
73,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Absolutely: about the dangers of not proceeding with industrial relations reform. The dangers of not proceeding with industrial relations reform will involve fewer jobs, at lower wagesMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was about Ryan.

This country needs a flexible industrial relations system; it does not need a return to the 20th and sometimes the 19th century, going backwards under the antireform party, the Australian Labor Party. NA",46

The delegation is accompanied by His Excellency Mr Hamzah Thayeb, the Indonesian ambassador. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Workplace Relations",46
77,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Freehills, the government's law firm of choice, which helped draft the government's industrial relations changes. Is the Prime Minister aware that, in a presentation in February this year, Freehills concludes that the average annual wage increase between June 2004 and June 2005 for employees on AWAs was 2.5 per cent-the same as the inflation rate? Is the Prime Minister also aware that Freehills concludes that average annual wage increases over the same period were in non-union collective agreements, 3.5 per cent; in agreements generally, four per cent; and, in union collective agreements, 4.3 per cent? Prime Minister, isn't it the case that the government's own hired legal gun says that AWAs will deliver lower wages than collective agreements?",46
78,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen or been briefed on that particular presentation, but I have seen and been briefed on the Bureau of Statistics, which publishes a survey every two years of employee earnings and hours. The results from the most recent survey, conducted in mid-2004, became available earlier this year. This survey allows a comparison to be made between the earnings of individuals on AWAs and those on registered collective agreements. The published data showed that the average weekly total earnings of employees working under AWAs are on average 13 per cent higher than for those employees covered by certified agreements. Both managerial and non-managerial employees on AWAs have higher average total earnings than equivalent employees on certified agreements. Managerial employees on AWAs have earnings that are on average 19 per cent higher than those on collective agreements. The earnings of non-managerial employees on AWAs are on average five per cent higher than those on collective agreements. These comparisons are made on the basis of average weekly total earnings as opposed to ordinary time earnings. It is entirely ate to make the comparison as traditional rigid employment categories, such as full time, part time and casual, are less common in AWAs, where a premium is placed on flexibility. A focus on weekly take-home pay recognises that many employees on AWAs enjoy greater flexibility in the hours they work. I have a message for the people of Australia who are enjoying the enhanced benefits of AWAs: the Leader of the Opposition is after your aspirational prosperity. The Leader of the Opposition wants to dent your aspirational spirit. The Leader of the Opposition wants to rip away the incentives now available to you under the system. The Leader of the Opposition wants to take you back to the backwoods of industrial relations in this country, to a system that presided over more than a million Australians being without a job. Workplace Relations",46
79,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and follows on from the answer given by the Prime Minister to the previous question. Would the minister advise the House of additional and particular benefits enjoyed by employees currently privileged to be on Australian workplace agreements? Further, is the minister aware of any threats to these particular benefits?",47
80,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Fisher for his question. As the Prime Minister indicated earlier, according to the official Australian Bureau of Statistics data, employees on Australian workplace agreements earn, on average, 13 per cent more than employees covered by certified agreements. If you compare those individuals on AWAs with those on the instrument of choice of the Labor Party, the award, those on AWAs earn, on average, 100 per cent more than those appropriwho are on awards. The member for Fisher asked me whether there are any threats to these benefits which are enjoyed by Australians on individual agreements. There are indeed threats, and those threats come from the labour movement in Australia, who want to abolish Australian workplace agreements, who want to rip away, from these Australians who are better off, those benefits that they have obtained under Australian workplace agreements. Of course, in return for $50 million worth of funding from the unions over the last 10 years to the Australian Labor Party, we had this craven caving in by the Leader of the Opposition over the weekend, a caving into the unions in Australia which has been almost universally condemned in the media today.

I draw your attention to page 554 of House of Representatives Practice, and I note that we have only had five questions so far today. It says: Ministers have often been advised that, should a question require a lengthy response, the proper procedure is for the Minister to seek leave to make a statement after Question Time. Mr Speaker, we would be willing to accommodate the minister after question time, and I would ask you to suggest that to him.",48

The Advertiser from Adelaide has ‘Beazley fires wide of a sitting duck'; the West Australian newspaper, from the Leader of the Opposition's own state, ‘Beazley plans return to an unwanted past'; and the Herald Sun, in Melbourne, ‘Beazley steps backwards'. But of course it was one above all that really hit the mark, and that was the Sydney Morning Herald, with ‘Beazley's real agenda: his job'. Every major newspaper in Australia has condemned this weak response by the Leader of the Opposition over the weekend-simply doing their bidding in return for $50 million from the unions in Australia. What is next? Have we got the secret accord coming along? Already we have the union leaders in New South Wales, John Robertson and the like, gloating that the Leader of the Opposition can now keep his job-as if it was a gift of the union bosses in Australia that the Leader of the Opposition can keep his job. In relation to these matters, as the Prime Minister said, the reality for Australians is this: a 4.9 per cent unemployment rate announced last week, the first time in 30 years that unemployment has gone under five per cent in Australia. What we had under the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the employment minister, was 11 per cent unemto state that fact and ploymentMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Surely it is out of order to have filibustering in question time? This has gone on for seven minutes",48

89,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This side of the parliament is interested in jobs for all Australians. That is why we put in place economic reforms that have driven down the unemployment rate from the 11 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment to 4.9 per cent. That is why this side of the parliament has seen a 16.8 per cent increase in real wages compared to 1.2 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment. There could be no more stark contrast in relation to this matter, and a government interested in",48

91,Ms GEORGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister again to Freehills, the government's law firm of choice, which helped draft the government's industrial relations law. Is the Prime Minister aware that, in its presentation in February this year, Freehills said that 20 per cent of employees are paid on awards, 40 per cent of employees are on collective agreements, 20 to 25 per cent have individual arrangements-common-law contractsand 2.4 per cent are on AWAs? Why does the Prime Minister continue to mislead Australians about the prevalence of AWAs when there are only 538,000 AWAs, compared to nine million employees on other workplace arrangements?",49

96,Mr BAIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer advise the House of outcomes from the recent G8 summit in St Petersburg? What progress is being made to reform global financial institutions?,49
97,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. The G8 finance ministers met in St Petersburg over the weekend. An opposition member interjecting,49
98,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There were not many socialists. The Russians are much more proenterprise than the Australian Labor Party, I can tell you. One of the things the Russians want to do is to promote private enterprise and flexible wage bargaining. If I were the member for Lilley, I would not head for Russia; Cuba is more your bag, my friend. To go back to St Petersburg, the G7 finance ministers represent the developed economies of the world. Together with Russia they represent the G8. The G8 finance ministers met in St Petersburg over the weekend and had two topics of conversation, principally. The first was good governance in public finance, on which Australia was asked to lead the discussion. None of the G8 countries has a history of budget surpluses that matches Australia's and none of them has retired all of their net debt. Australia's experience was considered of sufficient interest for Australia to be asked to lead the discussion in St Petersburg. Finance ministers from the developed economies of the world were particularly interested in intergenerational reporting, something else which Australia pioneered with our first Intergenerational report in 2002, and our Charter of Budget Honesty, which provides for accounting against exteron nal standards and also statements of sensitivities and risks. The G8 ministers noted in their communique the importance of good governance in public finance and pledged to work at an international level to improve standards both for developed and developing economies. The second topic of discussion amongst the G8 ministers in St Petersburg this weekend concerned the topic of energy security, which is of interest to all countries around the globe. Russia, of course, is a massive oil exporter, but, to various degrees, the G7 countries are net oil importers. All the G7 countries are struggling with high gasoline or petrol prices. A discussion took place in tion to the measures which could be taken on a global scale to improve prices for consumers and to take the risk out of the global economy which high gasoline or petrol prices represent. It was agreed between the ministers that facilitating further private investment, both from consuming and producing countries in the oil business, was very important. For many of the large oil producers of the world this will mean liberalising foreign investment regimes, giving certainty of title and allowing technical expertise to be brought into increase the take from fields which hitherto may have been thought unproductive or uneconomic but which can be returned to, as well as investment in new fields. Ministers agreed that, whilst not without its risks, the outlook for the global economy remains a positive one, particularly whilst the industrichine alisation which is occurring in China continues to lead global growth. They noted the importance of keeping a watch on inflation and of being vigilant to any inflationary price movements that might get into the general economy as a second-round effect from oil prices or finance. Australia is not a member of the G8. It is the first time we have ever been invited to a G8 summit. This was an invitation which was extended to Australia principally so that it could share its experience in relation to good governance in public finance. But Australia is also chairing the group of developed and developing nations known as the G20. The annual conference of that group will be held in Melbourne, Australia, in November. It has become an important forum for the reform of the IMF and the World Bank. The managing director of the IMF is visiting Australia today and tomorrow. Our discussions will continue on making those global financial institutions more representative, particurelalarly of the growing Asian economies, and more accountable to national governments for the work they do. I expect that these will be positive discussions with positive progress to be reported in the course of this year. Workplace Relations",49
99,Mr BYRNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that on 28 March, a day after the government's industrial relations legislation came into effect, eight experienced machine operators at Triangle Cables were sacked on the basis that their services were no longer required? Is the Prime Minister also aware that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in Melbourne recently ruled that as Triangle Cables had only 97 employees those employees were no longer entitled to unfair dismissal protection? Given that Triangle Cables is advertising for maoperators, doesn't the Triangle Cable case show that Australian employees can be sacked for no reason and replaced?",50
100,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not personally aware of the circumstances of that, but it is the case that the unfair dismissal laws have been changed and that they no longer apply to firms that employ fewer than 100 people. The government has not endeavoured at any time to disguise that fact. The view is taken by this government that, whilst laws relating to unlawful termination should be maintained-and I will come to that in a moment by way of supplementing, if I may, an earlier answer I gave in response to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition-it is in the interests of flexibility and greater employment in this country that the unfair dismissal laws should no longer apply to firms employing fewer than 100 people, and we have never made any secret of that fact. In fact, at the last election when we talked about unfair dismissal laws we did not put any statistical limit on the change we had in mind. But earlier in question time. I was asked a question by the Leader of the Opposition. I think it was about a lady by the name of Karen Palmer, a machine operator at Greer Industries. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the Prime Minister intends to add to an answer, he has got a facility to do that at the end of question time.",50
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Manager of Opposition Business would be aware that the Prime Minister did say that he intended to add to an answer. As it is related, I believe, to the question, I call the Prime Minister. He is in order.",51
102,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about Karen Palmer, a machine operator at Greer Industries. Since being asked that question I have been provided with some information about this, and I would like to share it with the House. Whilst I do not regard this to be an exhaustive statement of the facts, what I have been informed is this: the employee may have been dismissed in connection with her being temporarily absent from work due to illness or injury. If so, that could amount to an unlawful termination of employment, and the Workplace Relations Act makes it unlawful for an employer to dismiss an employee for one or more discriminatory reasons. One of the prohibited reasons for termination is temporary absence from work because of illness or injury. I understand that a union is pursuing a claim about unlawful termination of employment in this matter. If the employee makes a claim for unlawful termination, that person will be entitled to an order from the court unless the employer can prove-in other words, the onus is reversed-that the termination was for a reason that was not unlawful. The government put in place an unlawful termination scheme where people considering whether to proceed to a court can receive up to $4,000 worth of legal assistance on the merits of their claim. The Office of Workplace Services have advised that they are currently examining the matter. It is interesting that, on the basis of this information, a claim for unlawful termination by a union is apparently either on foot or in contemplation. I do not recall, in the substance of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, any reference to unlawful termination. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition knew that and he did not want to disclose it to the House.",51

104,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Members on my right are holding up their own colleague. East Timor,51
105,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister advise the House how the government is working with the United Nations to achieve security and stability in East Timor?,51
106,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for his question and the interest that he has shown. The United Nations has been playing and will play a key role in East Timor's future, but it does need to move quickly to play its part to help East Timor through the current crisis and, importantly, beyond that crisis. The Security Council's mandate for the present mission-UNOTIL, as it is known-expires on 20 June, and we support a short extension of that mandate by a period of a month or two. Any successor mission should focus on areas where the United Nations can be particularly helpfulfirst of all, in assisting the East Timorese with the process of reconciliation and, secondly, in helping with the improvement of the overall quality of governance in East Timor. Thirdly, we believe that there will be a need for international police to remain in East Timor for some time, both in helping to stand up the East Timorese police, the PNTL, and also to assist with overall policing duties. That work would best be done under the auspices of the United Nations. We would be looking at perhaps around 500 international police operating in East Timor under the umbrella of the United Nations. The United Nations can play a key role. They can also play a role in assisting the East Timorese, should the East Timorese wish, to investigate allegations in East Timor, for example. They have been asked by the East Timorese to investigate the killing of East Timorese police last month in tragic circumstances, and Australian police are helping with the forensics of that. The United Nations might be able to assist with other inquiries, should the East Timor government wish to ask them to pursue those inquiriesfor example, in relation to allegations concerning certain politicians in East Timor. But let me make this final point about what the United Nations can do, what Australia can do and what Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal can do: at the end of the day, the East Timorese are responsible themselves for East Timor. They are responsible for the management and the running of their country-and no amount of commentary and criticism of the United Nations, of Australia, Portugal, Malaysia or whoever it may be is a substitute for the East Timorese taking responsibility for their own destiny and their own country. If there are differences between East Timor's politicians, it is for those politicians to resolve those differences in their national interest. It is not good enough to ask the international community to solve those differences. They must learn to solve these problems amongst themselves, just as when we have differences in this country we are able to resolve those in our own way in the national interest. It is very important that the international community sends that message to the East Timorese. Certainly, we are prepared to help them if things go seriously awry and there are useful ways we can help-that is what we are doing now-but that is no substitute for the East Timorese taking responsibility for their own country and their own destiny. Workplace Relations",51
107,Mrs IRWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the government's $55 million advertising campaign, which included this WorkChoices booklet stamping the entitlements of rest breaks, annual leave loadings, allowances, shift overtime loadings as ‘Protected by law'. I also refer to the AWA offered to employees at the New South Wales child-care centre operator, Childs Family Kindergartens, which cuts the wages for child-care workers set by the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission and expressly removes a number of provisions, including rest breaks, annual leave loading, first aid allowance and overtime payments beyond two extra hours work. Rather than being protected, don't these conditions disappear with the stroke of a penyour pen, Prime Minister?",52
108,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is that the reference made, which is apparently in 4.4 on page 22, was entirely correct and entirely consistent with what has occurred. I do not know what is in the workplace agreement to which the honourable member refers. I think I will look at it myself, if she wants to to me, and then I might be able to enlighten the House even more. Rural Health Services",52
109,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House of action the government is taking to increase the number of doctors and nurses in country areas? Are there any alternative views, and what is the government's response?",53
110,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hume for his question. I know how concerned he is to ensure that we do get enough doctors and nurses in country areas. I can inform him and the House that this government is funding the largest expansion of medical and nurse training places in Australia's history. Under policies already in place the number of medical graduates will increase by 60 per cent from 1,300 last year to 2,100 by the year 2011. In addition, the government has recently committed an additional $250 million to provide an extra 460 medical school places a year and up to 1,000 additional nurse training places a year. The government wants to see Australian communities served by Australian doctors, but in the short term, unfortunately, it is important that we make full use of suitably qualified overseas trained doctors to serve our communities, particularly in country areas. Mostly they come into Australia under section 457 temporary skilled migration visas. That is how they get here. But they will not get here if the Leader of the Opposition has his way, because last week he was asked about these section 457 temporary skilled migration visas and he said: Well, Federal Labor can get into office and block it. send it He would block the visa under which so many doctors and nurses are coming into Australia. For instance, in the 10 months to the end of April, these visas were issued to 1,704 doctors, 2,555 nurses and 1,150 other health professionals. The largest user of these visas was not union-busting Perth builders but the New South Wales Department of Health. It is the largest single user of 457 visas in this country. So, if the Leader of the Opposition has his way, communities in Australia, especially the country communities of Australia, will be short more than 5,000 health professionals. That is 5,000 doctors and nurses that they now have that this person here wants to expel. What we have is a Leader of the Opposition who is far more interested in saving his own job than he is in delivering services to the Australian people. What he needs to do is carefully explain how he will stop the foreigners he does not like coming in while letting the foreigners we still need come into this country. Workplace Relations",53
111,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the experience of statutory individual contracts in Western Australia under the Liberal Court-Kierath government during which around 25 per cent of all agreements registered with the Western Australian Commissioner of Workplace Agreements had an ordinary rate of pay that was below the award rate by 1998. During the same period penalty rates and overtime rates were abolished in 44 per cent of agreements and the introduction of WA workplace agreements in the state public sectorMr Tuckey interjecting,53

115,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, isn't it the case that, just like state Liberal AWAs, your AWAs are all about a wages race to the bottom?",54
116,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition brings us back to AWAs. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that, because his promise to abolish AWAs is a promise that he disavowed only eight months ago. What the Australian people want to know is what happened between that interview he gave on television in October of last year the weekend. I think he got mugged by a bit of reality, and the reality is pronounced South Wales unions'. John Robertson and his merry men said to the Leader of the Opposition, ‘Kimbo, if you don't front up and ish AWAs, we're going to roll you.' That is basically what happened. Everybody in this building knows that the Leader of the Opposition's powerbase is the New South Wales Right and everyone knows that his moment of truth was in fact the New South Wales ALP conference. What else would explain a policy which is against the economic interests of this country? What else would explain a policy that will threaten the living standards of hundreds of thousands of Australians? Because that is what is involved here. AWAs are the preferred employment instrument of aspirational Australians. The aspirational people of this country want AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition has declared an open fronted attack on aspirational Australians. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: he has betrayed by this decision a total misunderstanding of the hopes and the aspirations of Australia's future. Australian Capital Territory: Schools Funding",54
117,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister update the House on government funding to schools in the Australian Capital Territory? Are there any alternative policies?",54
118,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and note her interest in this matter. The Australian government is providing some $33 billion for schools across Australia over the 2005-08 period. That is a $12 billion increase on the and last funding period. In addition, we are investing some $1 billion under the Investing ‘New in Our Schools program to make up for the failure of state and territory governments to properly capitalise on the requirements of abol- schools for things such as playground equipment, classrooms and the like, $700 million of that going to state government schools. This year alone the Australian government is investing some $49.2 million in recurrent funding in the ACT and under the Investing in Our Schools program we have already provided some $7.5 million over recent months to government schools in the ACT. I am asked about alternative policies. It seems that the Labor Chief Minister's idea of an education policy is to put the future of young Canberrans in jeopardy by closing some 39 government schools. Through gross mismanagement of the Canberra economy, 39 schools are being closed. It is a disgrace that parents, students and teachers were not notified that 39 government schools are being closed in the ACT. I want to know how Jon Stanhope intends to account to Commonwealth taxpayers for the $7.5 million that has already been paid in recent months under the Investing in Our Schools program to schools that he intends to close. I will ask him: how does he account to the Commonwealth taxpayers for that $7.5 million? Not only is he ruining the Canberra economy but he is burning up Commonwealth taxpayers' funds. The member for Canberra, the member for Fraser and the Leader of the Opposition, as Jon Stanhope's mentor, ought to be ashamed that a Labor colleague is closing government schools in the name of an education policy. Not only has he ruined the Canberra economy but he is ruining the Canberra education system and they ought to condemn him for it.",54

I saw at least nine points of order from the Deputy Manager of Opposition Business, I heard orchestrated barracking from members opposite and then, of course, there was the consistent holding up of bits of paper in defiance of the chair. I wonder whether you could review the footage and rule on that at the start of tomorrow's question time.",55

I do not know anybody at all on the Mariners; I have never spoken to them. This Coastal Voice is a Labor Party front. She also went on to say that the Coastal Voice will publish numerous emails and comments sent from the member for Dobell. I have not done that.

134,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I have been misrepresented by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in a press release issued after question time the last time we met, Thursday, 1 June. In that press release, he asserted that I quoted the chair of the government's low pay commission in the following terms: ‘pushes the Low Pay Commission to reduce the minimum wage in real terms'. I refer to a draft of the question distributed advance of question time for media purposes where the only work that is in quotation marks is the word ‘pushes'. I refer to the Hansard chamber green distributed by the Content Management Branch which has the word ‘pushes' in quotes. I refer to the daily Hansard which has the following: ... and I quote-‘pushes' ... And I refer to Professor Harper, the chair of the government's low pay commission on the Lateline program of 31 May 2006, in response to a question about minimum wages going down in real terms, saying: ... the act pushes us there. I did not make the quotation that the minister misleadingly asserts. NA Points of Order",56
135,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, my question relates to page 41 of the Hansard of Thursday, 1 June 2006 and some, I am sure, inadvertently inconsistent matters that occurred today. On 1 June I sought to speak to a point of order raised by the member for Mackellar and you said that I had no right to do so, which I think was incorrect-but nevertheless you made that ruling. Today a point of order was raised and, as I understood it, the Leader of the House spoke to that point of order. In my view, the procedure is that members do have a right to speak to points of order, and I feel that the Leader of the House was in order, but both rulings cannot be right. Either I was in order on 1 June or the Leader of the House was out of order today. I understand with all the tumult it is difficult, but I wonder if you could review those decisions and make sure that we get a consistent position.",56

141,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Brand proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's driving down wage rates for working Australians by removing their right to penalty rates, leave loadings and shift work ings without any benefit for the economy. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",57
142,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the House. What does the government have against the nans of Australia? What does it have against the grandmas, the granddads, the mums, the dads and the kids? What has the Prime Minister got against them that he wants their wages slashed and their conditions overturned? What has he got against them that he wants to produce fear and uncertainty in the workforce instead of decency and fairness? What has this government got against the Australian people? These Australian workplace agreements are purely and simply about slashing wages and conditions and have nothing at all to do with boosting productivity. They are all about pitting kids, in the first instance, against multinationals and businessmen with years of experience and regarding those kids as potential serious bargaining partners. The government's plan for the future is to cut wages, cut conditions and take penalty rates away. We in the Labor Party stand for a modern, flexible industrial relations system with collective agreements to boast pay and productivity. There is no doubt that Australia's relatively good productivity performance in the nineties was, by and large, related to the flexible enterprise agreement system put in place by the Labor Party. That is why we had substantial growth in productivity, whereas New Zealand, which previously had productivity rates roughly the same as Australia's but instead moved away from collective agreements to individual contracts, found its loadproductivity effectively halved. The gap between Australian and New Zealand productivity rates, which had been non-existent, became quite dramatic. That is why an enterprise agreement-it is not centralised wage fixing we are dealing with here-when put in place for employees and employers to sit down and work out how they can do things better in order to justify a pay rise produces productivity whereas an AWA produces just any old thing. It certainly can increase profitability for the employer, but it has nothing to do with productivity. The experience of AWAs is that they have nothing to do with productivity. They are all about slashing wages. They are a lazy route to profit. They give employers the wrong incentives. Cutting workers' wages does not increase productivity. Cutting pay and slashing conditions does not prepare the Australian workforce for the future. The government is dumping Australian workers on a low-wage, low-skill treadmill and condemning our kids-our youngest and most vulnerable workers-to compete with India and China in a race we can never win. It is a race to the bottom. This is about exploiting our youngest and most vulnerable workers and expecting them to take on multinationals and giant corporations in a no-win contest for wages and conditions. The worse time we are going to have between now and the next election on the issue of AWAs will be January and February next year. That is when the kids will complete their training courses of this year. Many of them have been in traineeships, or what used to be described as traineeships, and some of them in apprenticeships. They are going to experience next year for the first time, as they go for their first jobs, AWAs without a no-disadvantage test applying. We will see horror cases day in, day out all next year arising from the sorts of AWAs that will be thrust upon these kids. As I go around the business community and the broader Australian community, I am surprised at the commonality of views. Over the last 12 months I have talked to hundreds of businessmen and thousands of people in this country. Amongst the hundreds of businessmen to whom I have talked I have not found one who has said that they support unreservedly the policy this government has put in place in its industrial relations legislation. Every one of them says that John Howard has gone too far. None of them-not one of them-argued for what the Prime Minister calls the ‘flexibility' that has been placed in the system. They understand completely the absurdity of the proposition that a businessman would sit down and seriously discuss each year with 1,000 workers the internal content of the AWA, as they would just about anything else. Employers would, of course, talk about a collective agreement. That is, a simplified, simple process. They don't mind doing that. But the notion that they would sit down with every one of their employees is absurd. I remember one fellow telling me that he had signed off his AWA, which had a provision in it for maternity leave. When he raised a question about that the employer said: ‘I don't care about it; just sign the blasted thing. This is the template that we have.' There is a material difference, however, between the AWAs now and those that were first introduced by this government. We have not liked them at any point of time. Despite what the Prime Minister says, he has to concede that they are not a heavily utilised instrument. AWAs have been in place for seven years and they have achieved the magnificent distinction of being only 2.4 per cent of the total number of agreements put in place covering working conditions in this country. That is not much progress, considering that the federal government has been effectively levering in AWAs by forcing its own employees to take them. It has also been forcing state governments to take AWAs when those state governments enter into agreements with it. Anyone who contracts to the federal government for road building or whatever else is also forced to take an AWAMr Adams-It has been standing over them.",57
143,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The federal government has been standing over the workforces that receive government contracts. When one considers that, it is a bit of a surprise that after seven years of AWAs only about 500,000 people out of a total workforce of more than 10 million are covered by them. But there is a difference, which I suspect is going to produce circumstances now where these figures may well start to change. Previously, under the amendments forced on the government when it last put in place its industrial relations legislation, a proposition was put in place for a no disadvantage test. There was a definite limitation on the capacity of an AWA to massively undermine conditions that workers in their previous place work had enjoyed. Now it has all changed. In the legislation put in place by the government at the end of last year and now coming into operation, out went the no disadvantage test and in came the Spotlight AWA. Out went the no disadvantage test and, with it, out went penalty rates for overtime, out went penalty rates for holiday work, out went breaks, out went shift allowances-out went a whole range of conditions which could be effectively traded away for virtually nothing. That is what happens when you remove the no-disadvantage test. The Prime Minister comes in here with absurd statistics on how much better off people are on AWAs. He knows darned well that when you take out the managers, when you take out the supervisors and when you take out groups of miners previously on common law agreements or common law individual contracts and now put on AWAs you get a very different picture indeed. Why do you think Freehills has been going around with these briefing notes? Freehills has been saying to employers whom they are briefing that if you take a look at last year's wage rises, the last year we have statistics for, the average AWA based employee got 2.5 per cent, effectively the same as the inflation rate, agreements generally produced a four per cent increase in income-union collective agreements 4.3 per cent and non-union collective agreements 3.5 per cent. What point do you think Freehills was making to the employers? Do you think Freehills was going to those employers on behalf of the government and saying to them, ‘Look, we think this is a terribly unjust situation, so could you chaps please gird your loins, get yourselves together and make sure that this performance of 2.5 per cent is improved to at least four per cent next year?' No. What Freehills is doing, what the government's of advocates are doing, is saying to employers, ‘Look at this little ripper product we have got for you-the capacity for you to slash away at all those benefits that have been built up by your workforce over the years. And here is the positive feature, here is the proof positive.' It is not about productivity. Freehills were not producing a set of statistics on the productivity outcomes of people who work on AWAs, collective agreements or whatever. It was simply the pay. What they were saying, as this government is saying to employers now, is: ‘Get out there and do your worse. Do your worse first with the people who are entering the workforce. Do your worse second with the people who are changing jobs. Do your worse third with the people whom you can now unfairly dismiss, sack and reemploy. Do your worse with the women who come to you and seek flexible hours so they can deal with their families. Do your worse to the blokes when you have managed to put in place a sufficient percentage of your workforce which is massively underpaid in comparison to your more long-term employees.' That is what is going on here. God help us with these laws if we ever enter into a period of some form of economic and downturn. Because when we enter into a period of economic downturn, you will see this law in full pomp-you will see this law raging through the industrial relations conditions of ordinary Australians. And don't think that ordinary Australians do not understand this. They understand this absolutely, despite the fact that the government has structured the law to conceal as much as possible from public scrutiny the impact of their AWAs. It is an offence, if an AWA is actually signed, for either party to reveal the content of it, so we can only see the statistics in rawest sense; we cannot actually see the statistics involving an individual, unless it is an AWA that is not signed as opposed to an AWA that is signed-though, in the case of Spotlight, I must say they had the brazenness to put their AWA on their website, so I suppose that we can have a good look at the Spotlight AWA. But, generally speaking, the real stories of injustice in this community, we cannot see. But we can see enough of the victims of this government's legislation to this pointpeople like Arthur Ledwidge, a 46-year-old Melbourne field technician, sacked along with 70 other workmates and told he could buy a company van and become a contractor doing the same work but earning $180 less a week; people like Emily Connor, a 23-yearold Canberra child-care worker, sacked after five years' employment, not even allowed to say goodbye to the kids she cared for or their parents-no warning, no reason; and people like Leonie Wong, a 17-year-old worker in an ice-cream shop, sacked because she rejected an AWA that signed away annual leave, overtime, weekend penalties and superannuation. Then we had Karen Palmer here today, sacked after 14 years with a company. The Prime Minister had the brazenness to say to Karen Palmer-so kind, Prime Minister: ‘Go and take a court case against the company that dismissed you, for which we'll give you four grand'-for a case that will start at 50 grand and probably end at 150 grand. Big-hearted old Uncle Arthur on that one! One thing she needs of course is a statement from her employer that he has sacked her because she carried an injury. Do you think she got a statement like that from them? Yeah, go and tell it to the marines; call on them-sure the employer would do that for her! There is no saving these industrial laws, their which is why we say we will rip them up. What we now see is a new AWA in a new format, the format with the no disadvantage test ripped away. And we now have the practical examples, the Spotlight examples and the other examples that I have been referring to. We now know what an AWA-not a terribly popular mechanism for employing people hitherto-can do now that that no disadvantage test has been ripped away from it. That is why we are taking you on on that, and you are going to be defeated on it. (Time expired)",58
144,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (3.41 pm)-On the weekend the Leader of the Opposition showed once and for all why he is unfit to ever be the Prime Minister of Australia. The reason is that what he showed on the weekend was that, in return for $50 million from the unions in Australia, he was prepared to cave into their demands. He was prepared to cave into their demands to keep his job. As the Sydney Morning Herald said in its editorial headline: ‘Beazley's real agenda: his job. Cynical backflip on AWAs'. And almost every major newspaper in Australia over the last day or two has had a similar headline in relation to the announcement by the Leader of the Opposition. The Herald Sun in Melbourne: ‘Beazley steps backwards'. The West Australian: ‘Beazley plans return to an unwanted past. The Adelaide Advertiser: ‘Beazley fires wide of a sitting duck'. The Financial Review: ‘Beazley goes back to the '50s'. The Australian: ‘BEAZLEY'S BACKFLIP'. The Daily Telegraph, from Sydney: ‘Sop to the unions'. And it goes on and on. The small business writer in the Australian: ‘Beazley backs wrong horse in the industrial stakes'. Again, a comment in the Australian: ‘Beazley bombs as economic manager'. On and on it goes-the Courier Mail: ‘Backflip a risky move in IR world'. Steve Lewis: ‘Beazley's backflip on AWAs will undermine the ALP's quest to be seen as economically responsible'. Why is it that almost every major newspaper, almost every major news outlet in this country, has said over the last 48 hours that not only is this a backflip on the part of Leader of the Opposition; it is one that is irresponsible in terms of taking Australia Australians' prosperity forward. There are a couple of reasons for this. The first is that what the Leader of the Opposition proposes is to rip up the wages and conditions of dreds and thousands of Australians. That is what he proposes to do. The reality is, as the Australian Bureau of Statistics data showsnot my data, not some false data manufactured by the Leader of the Opposition-those who are employed under Australian workplace agreements are on average paid 13 per cent more than those who are under collective agreements. And if you compare individual Australian workplace agreements with awards in Australia then the differential is that 100 per cent are generally better off der individual agreements than those people who are employed under awards in Australia. The policy of the Australian Labor Party is essentially to take us back to having an award as the core of every workplace arrangement in this country. So the first point about what the Leader of the Opposition has been condemned for is that he wants to rip away the wages and conditions of hundreds and thousands of Australians who have made use of individual agreements. The second point is that he wants to tear down the economic structure that has delivered economic prosperity in this country. The Leader of the Opposition wants to rip up-to use his expression-not just what was put in place in this parliament at the end of last year, and came into operation on 27 March this year, but Australian workplace agreements in their entirety. He wants to rip up those provisions put in place in this country almost a decade ago. What have those provisions done for the economic prosperity of this country? We saw last week in this country for the first time in 30 years an unemthe ployment rate starting with the figure ‘4'. For the first time in 30 years in this country and the unemployment rate fell below five per cent. We have the Leader of the Opposition complaining in this place and elsewhere about examples. I do not hear him saying one hun- word about the fact that 55,000 jobs were created in the month of May in Australia. I do not know who the Leader of the Opposition is talking to, but as I have gone around this country I have had small and medium business operator after business operator come up to me and say, ‘Because of the changes that you've made to the industrial relations laws in this country, I'm going to or I have employed somebody else.' On television just a few weeks ago, there was an employer from Darwin who said that she had unemployed an additional seven people as a result of getting rid of the unfair dismissal laws in this country. Those sorts of anecdotal experiences, which are related to me day after day and week after week by employers around this country, are revealed in part I believe in those 55,000 additional jobs created in this country in the month of May alone. A 4.9 per cent unemployment rate, something we have not seen in a generation or two in this country, is a result of the nomic prosperity that reforms undertaken in 1996 and again last year have led to. That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip away. No wonder once again editorial writers at every major newspaper in Australia have condemned the announcement made at the weekend by the Leader of the Opposition. Why have they condemned it? They have done so because they know that this has helped to not only drive down unemployment in this country but drive up real wages. Let us make a comparison. What do Australians think real wages went up by under 13 years of a Labor government? During the time that Labor was in government and the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment, real wages went up by just 1.2 per cent. In the 10 years that this government has been in office, real wages for Australians have gone up by 16.8 per cent. They went up by 1.2 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was responsible for employment in this country and have gone up by 16.8 per cent since we have been in government. That is the comparison that Australians understand-a 4.9 per cent unemployment rate, a 16.8 per cent increase in real wages. That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to tear down. He wants to tear down the edifice that has brought about these changes and these benefits for real Australians. There is something more significant in the criticism of the Leader of the Opposition for the announcement he made at the weekend. He announced, ‘I am going to abolish, if I win government, individual workplace agreements in Australia.' The real significance of that announcement was that it showed the weak and vacillating character of the Leader of the Opposition. That is what Australians know about Mr Beazley, the ecoLeader of the Opposition. They know he is a weak man, and this just showed it in spades again at the weekend. It reinforced in the minds of Australians what a weak Leader of the Opposition we have in this country. He did not even consult his backbench. He did not consult his caucus. He apparently did not even consult the shadow ministry. The member for Perth conceded this morning in the media that he did not consult him about it, that he just told him that it was a fait accompli. The Leader of the Opposition could have made a choice at the weekend. The choice can be summed up in two personalities. One of them is a successful Labour Prime Minister, namely Tony Blair, the Labour Prime Minister of Great Britain. Mr Blair had a similar choice to make when he became Prime Minister of Britain. When he became Prime Minister, it was widely expectedindeed, it was being pressed upon him by the trade unions in the United Kingdom-that he would undo, that he would wind back, that he would rip up the reforms which Margaret Thatcher and the previous Conservative government put in place in the labour market and industrial relations in the UK. When Mr Blair, shortly after becoming the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, went to the Trades Union Congress he told his comrades that he was not going to cave into them. The Leader of the Opposition in Australia could have made that decision when he went to the New South Wales conference of the Labor Party and the unions at the weekend. Back then, Mr Blair said: We will keep the flexibility of the present labour market, and it may make some shiver but, in the end, it is warmer in the real world ... If we had a Leader of the Opposition who had some strength of character, who was prepared to stand up to those who were seeking to destabilise his leadership of the Labor Party, as John Robertson and his mates in Unions NSW were doing-and the member opposite, the member for Perth, knows better perhaps than many others in this place that that is what was going on-and who had some real guts and decency and the courage to stand up for his convictions, he would have said what Mr Blair said to the trade unions in the UK when he became the leader. We do not have a Tony Blair insofar as the Leader of the Opposition in Australia is concerned. This is a man who did not have the courage to stand up for his convictions, who did not have the courage to say, ‘We're going to do something to continue to drive down the unemployment rate in Australia.' This is a man who has no concept of and no concern about unemployment in Australia, who presided over almost 11 per cent unemployment and who said when he was the minister for employment and a question about the long term unemployed was put to him that they might as well stay on the scrap heap. This is a man who does not have any concern for jobs in Australia. As the editorial in the ney Morning Herald said, the Leader of the Opposition is not concerned about jobs for Australians. He is concerned about one job and one job only-that is, his job. Instead of doing a Tony Blair at the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition gave a Mark Latham performance. Mr Latham has been widely criticised.",60
145,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,63
146,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Members opposite are laughing now. They were not laughing when the former Leader of the Opposition did not consult them. The two members at the table, the member for Perth and the member for Lilley, know that better than anybody else in this place. We had in Mr Latham a man who did not consult, who just went off and made decisions by himself. He made a decision, for example, about having the troops home by Christmas. We have had a similar response from the Leader of the Opposition: ‘We'll get rid of AWAs by the following Christmas.' Instead of a Tony Blair performance, we had a Mark Latham type performance from the Leader of the Opposition at the weekend. And what is this going to do as far as workplaces in Australia are concerned? This gives a green light to certain sorts of activities. It says to the mining, resources and other industries in Australia: ‘We don't care about what circumstances have actually helped you to make this economy thrive the way it is thriving at the present time. We don't care about that.' The fact is there was a mass migration of workers in Western Australia from the state system into the national system when the state Labor government in Western Australia effectively abolished individual agreements, which the Leader of the Opposition plans on doing. What happened in the mining industry? Not just the employers, but thousands of employees in the minSyding industry in Western Australia went from the state system over to the federal system so that they could take advantage of individual Australian workplace agreements. The Leader of the Opposition's home state has about 10 per cent of the Australian workforce yet some 30 per cent of the AWAs which are utilised in this country. But has the Leader of the Opposition learned anything from that lesson at all? None whatsoever. He just says to the mining industry in Australia, producing billions of dollars of profit and income for this country, ‘Oh, we're going to rip up the arrangements that have enabled you to be profitable in the way you are and that have ensured that this country has thrived in the way it has.' No wonder we have this massive condemnation from the media in Australia. But worse than that, this gives a green light in a couple of ways. As reported in the Australian today, ‘Unions push ALP for more'. I say this to the member opposite, the member for Lilley: once you start to appease people, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, once you start to appease the thugs in the union movement, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, once you say, ‘I'll cave into you, because that's the only way I'll keep my job,' the reality is there is no end to it. What do we see in the newspapers today? ‘Unions push ALP for more'. This is just the start, as far as the unions are concerned, because they know what we know, which is what every Australian knows: you have a weak Leader of the Opposition. If he is prepared to cave in once, he is going to cave in again, and again, and again. I predict that in the coming weeks and months, what we will see from the Leader of the Opposition is not just this first cave-in, but a series of cave-ins, because essentially he is weak, he is known to be weak, and that is what the unions know. But worse than that, he will obviously give a green light to the sort of the thuggery we have seen in workplaces in Australia-a green light to the CFMEU and their mates to go back into the mining sites, to the construction and building sites in Melbourne and Sydney, and push up the cost of building and housing in this country. That is what this sort of decision is going to do. It has happened because the Leader of the Opposition is weak. The Leader of the Opposition could not stand by a decision which he made some eight months ago, and we are going to see the consequence of that played out not just this week, but in the weeks and months ahead in Australia. As the leader writers in the newspapers around Australia said, this is a backward step taken by a backward Leader of the Opposition.",63
147,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You can neither believe nor trust what the government says on industrial relations. You can neither believe nor trust what the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, says on industrial relations, what the Treasurer, Mr Costello, says on industrial relations, and what the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations says on industrial relations. In question time today, we had another classic example. This is what the Prime Minister said to Alan Jones on radio 2GB on 4 August last year-and this quote was put to the Prime Minister in question time a couple of weeks ago, on 25 May from memorybefore the legislation went through the House: I mean some people have to work on public holidays. … … … … it would be absurd and unfair and unreasonable if somebody has to work on a public holiday that that person isn't compensated by being paid whatever it is, the double time or the time and a half. … … … I just want to make the general comment that those arrangements are going to continue. The Prime Minister said: … it would be absurd and unfair and unreasonable if somebody has to work on a public holiday that that person isn't compensated by being paid whatever it is, the double time or the time and a half. That statement was put to the Prime Minister again today at question time, and it was put in the context of the Spotlight AWA-the 2c an hour AWA, where Mrs Harris was offered the princely sum of 2c an hour extra per hour for all her entitlements, penalty rates et cetera being knocked off. She lost 90 bucks a week. Two cents an hour for 90 bucks a week. When you isolated the public holiday pay loading, she got an extra 2c an hour for working on a public holiday, but lost $21.40. The Prime Minister walked away from that at question time, because he knows he disingenuously misled the Australian people on the Alan Jones program in August last year, but he cannot walk away from that quote. It is just another example of how this government can be neither trusted nor believed when it comes to industrial relations. When we draw the adverse consequences of the government's legislation to their attencent tion, they do one of two things: they pretend they do not know about it, or they pretend they do not exist. But then they say: ‘Look, even if those terrible, shocking, adverse consequences are there, guess what? This is good for the economy.' And then they say, because we've now committed ourselves to abolishing AWAs, ‘The heart and soul, the be-all and end-all, of what is good for the economy is the ongoing existence of AWAs.' That is now their position-the ongoing existence of AWAs. I remember the last election being called. We heard nothing about these matters in the run-up to the last election. We only heard about these things when the government got all the power under the sun and returned to its Jobsback 1992 proposal, and returned to the old-fashioned obsession and ideology that John Howard has had since the 1970s and 1980s. In 1996, when the government first came to office, it introduced AWAs, but the Democrats in the Senate required 230-odd amendments, including a no disadvantage test, which protected and secured penalty rates, overtime, leave loading, shift allowances and the like-the 20 allowable matters. That gave some protection to people's rights and entitlements and conditions and living standards. And even before this government's legislation came into effect on 27 March this year, even before then, what did we know? Based on the most recently available government stats, we know that the government's be-all and end-all instrument of good economic management, AWAs, made up about 2.4 per cent of agreements in the workplace. The rule of thumb is that we had 20 per cent of people on awards, 40 per cent of people on collective or enterprise bargains, 30 per cent of people on individual common-law agreements-three million people-and about 2.4 per cent or 2.5 per on AWAs. Of the 10.1 million people in the workforce, there are three million on common-law agreements, four million on enterprise agreements, two million on awards and, in accordance with the most recent stats delivered by the government's man in Senate estimates a couple of weeks ago, 538,000 on AWAs. This is the thing which is the be-all and end-all of our economic performance and our economic future! Before we come to what the OEA had to say, in a presentation on 22 February, the government's hired legal gun, Freehillsafter the bill had gone through the parliament and after it had been enacted but before substantial features of it had been implemented-gave a snapshot of current agreement making: Currently: 40 per cent of employees are on collective agreements 2.4 per cent are on AWAs 20 per cent are paid on awards … … … 20 per cent to 25 per cent by individual arrangements ... Average annual wage increases between June 2004-05: In agreements generally=four per cent Union collective agreements=4.3 per cent Non-union collective agreements=3.5 per cent AWAs=2.5 per cent So the government's own legal adviser-the government's hired legal gun, which is paid hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars over the years to help draft the government's legislation on industrial relations-says that, if you are on a union collective agreement, from 2004-05 your average wage increase was 4.3 per cent and, if you were on an AWA, your average increase was 2.5 per cent. Looks like pretty good legal advice to me! It continues with an ‘Overview of effect of Work Choices': Potential-threats Existing Industry Player: Current Enterprise Agreement with: Overtime Shift penalties Annual leave loadings Based on: Award New Entrant: AWA Overtime has crosshairs through it; penalties have crosshairs through it and loadings have crosshairs through it. All gone. Freehills legal advice under the Prime Minister's so called default position, ‘protected award conditions': Conditions protected but may be bargained: Public holidays Rest breaks Incentive payments Annual leave loadings Allowances Penalty rates Shift/overtime loadings A red box says: Must be specifically addressed by Agreement. On the next page there is legal advice on how to knock them over: This agreement excludes the protected award conditions, as defined in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (as amended from time to time). That is how you do it: a one-line throwaway. All those things that make the difference between Australian families keeping their heads above water and making ends meet have all been sold down the river in a oneline throwaway-under a Spotlight AWA, for the princely sum of 2c an hour. Guess what? The government's hired legal gun says that under a collective agreement average annual wage increases were 4.3 per cent in 2004-05 and under an AWA they were 2.5 per cent. They are now saying that all the things that helped to sustain the 2.5 per cent for the AWAs-penalty rates, overtime, leave loading, you name it-are all gone. So a one-line throwaway, down the river for the princely sum of nothing if you want it to be to that effect in the contract. These things were put to the Prime Minister during question time, and the truth is that he had no response. But it gets worse. That was before the government changed the legislation and knocked off that no disadvantage test. What did we find out from the Office of give the Employment Advocate at Senate estimates hearings? Since the legislation came into effect, there were 538,120 AWAs in operation as at 31 March this year. Since 27 March, when the act came into effect, 6,263 AWAs were lodged. Of the AWAs sampled, guess what? Under the one-line throwaway-sold down the river-all penalty rates have gone, 100 per cent exclude at least one protected award condition, 64 per cent remove leave loadings, 63 per cent remove penalty rates, 52 per cent remove shift loadings, 41 per cent do not contain a gazetted public holiday, 16 per cent exclude all award conditions and 22 per cent do not provide for a pay increase over the life of the agreement. And the Prime Minister clutches a straw and says, ‘Well, that must mean that 78 per cent do.' At question time today the Prime Minister disingenuously misled the House when he said that the quantum was there for all to see. Not true. If the Prime Minister wants to table the quantum in those AWAs, I invite him to so do in order that we can all see that the average increase in those AWAs is a princely sum of 2c an hour. So if the Prime Minister wants to assert that 78 per cent of those agreements have a pay increase, let him tip out the information and show that they are not the Spotlight AWA-2c an hour. We have had other interesting examples from other jurisdictions where this has been utilised. The Leader of the Opposition drew attention in question time to some stats from Western Australia. It is interesting that, the Gallop Labor government knocked over state based AWAs in Western Australia, the state Liberal Party and the business community in Western Australia said exactly the same things that we are hearing now. In the West Australian of 3 May 2003, they said it would take us backward, that the whole world would fall in, there would be a diminution of job opportunities and a return to the bad old days-all the things we are hearing now. Last time. I looked, after 15 years of continuous economic growth and a resources boom to China, Western Australia had 10 per cent economic growth. This notion that AWAs are the be-all and end-all of economic management is a complete nonsense. The government's legislation is not good for the economy. It is bad for the economy because it is a straightforward shift of part of the economy from wages to profit. It rewards bad management and it does not require productivity. It is a straightforward slash on wages-a straightforward attack on wages. It is bad for our economy. The government tries to pretend that 5,338 AWAs are an economic management issue of the same realm as a half a trillion dollar foreign debt, 49 consecutive monthly trade deficits and an increase in the current account deficit of six per cent. It is a nonsense and you will find that out at the next poll. (Time expired)",64
148,Mr SCHULTZ,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hume) (4.06 pm)When I look across this chamber, what do I see? I see union hacks, sons and daughters of union hacks and union hacks that have worked for union hacks. Is it any wonder that I do not see one worker who has bent his back as have many workers on this side of the parliament? Is it any wonder that in 1996 the Australian people woke up to what the Labor Party stand for? It is anti workers, anti incentive and anti productivity. Is it any wonder they are out there making the statewhen ments that they are making today. Is it any wonder that their leader, Kim Beazley, has done an enormous backflip as a result of the pressure by his union mates? ‘Turn over on this legislation, Kim. Get these AWAs out of the workplace or you won't be leader next week.' The Leader of the Opposition does not have the intestinal fortitude that Australian people expect of a leader of a political party, and they will judge him on that at the next election. You can live in hope, comrades, but I can tell you: you will still be in opposition after 2007, and you may still be in opposition for many years after that, because the Australian working class people-and I am oneunderstand what this government is about and what it has delivered to them as a people. They understand where this country has gone in the last 10 years and that the prosperity in this country has been brought about by the strong leader of this nation, the Hon. John Howard. I commend them for their common sense. Just before Christmas last year, members of the opposition condemned the government's changes to the industrial relations system-an archaic system that has operated for over 100 years now-and said that Australian married couples would stop procreating and that there would be no more family barbecues-stupid rubbish like that. But what do we see? Birth rates are going up and there are more barbecues today than you would have seen in the last decade. So much for the irresponsible fearmongering by members of the ALP. The decisions that the government makes now-these are decisions that give me heart for my children, my grandchildren and, hopefully, for my greatgrandchildren-will determine whether jobs growth and the increase in wages and living standards we have seen over the last decade will continue into the next decade. Let me compare what has happened in the last decade to what happened in the previous 10 years of the Labor government. Since March 1996, the coalition has created more than 1.8 million jobs. More than three-quarters of all jobs created in the last two years have been full-time jobs. Under the previous Labor government, when Kim Beazley was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, unemployment reached a peak of 10.9 per cent, putting nearly one million Australians out of work. The unemployment rate under this government is now at a 30-year low of 4.9 per cent. Since the coalition was elected to office, unemployment has been reduced by 218,800, or 29.6 per cent. Is it any wonder that private sector union membership is down to about 19 per cent? And is it any wonder that union membership in the public and private sectors combined around 21 per cent? They are waking up to you guys in droves and moving out of the system. All this nonsense you are pushing into the public arena-you are willing to compromise your principles and your integrity and to lie to the Australian people to get back into government-is being absorbed by the Australian people, particularly by the working class people of this nation. They will react as they reacted a couple of elections ago to not only the former leader, Mark Latham, but also to your current leader. The only good thing that the trade union movement has done is to give Kim Beazley a little bit of confidence to think that he has something to offer the Australian people. The only problem with that sort of mentality is that they have underestimated the intelligence of the Australian people, who know that Kim Beazley has absolutely nothing to offer them. He has no strength. He capitulates to the Australian Labor Party trade union movement when he is put under pressure. A few minutes ago the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations mentioned a significant number of headlines appearing in the national media. An article on page 4 of today's Australian Financial Review by Steven Scott is headed ‘Unions test Iemma over contract deals'. The Premier of New South Wales might get a shock at the polls in March next year. Hopefully, the New South Wales constituency have woken up to what he is about. The article stated: The NSW government is under pressure to block companies that use Australian Workplace Agreements from winning government contracts after the state Labor Party conference endorsed calls for tougher procurement policies. However, before speaking at the weekend conference, Premier Morris Iemma warned such a move could breach federal laws and would be difficult to enforce. is The current New South Wales Labor government has awarded a number of government contracts to companies, including Westpac, who are using AWAs in their workforce. The Labor premier has recognised that the AWAs are a workable alternative for businesses. The unions saying to him, ‘We are cocking the .45 pistol and putting it up against your head through the trade union movement. You had better change your attitude about giving contracts to these companies with AWAs or we are going to do to you what we have threatened to do to Kim Beazley. We will make sure we take you out as the leader of the New South Wales Labor Party and we will put someone else in.' That is the despicable, degrading level once proud Labor Party has stooped to. My grandfather would be turning in his grave to know that the party that he used to be a member of and stand for has stooped to that level-deceiving and lying to the Australian people. But, more importantly, he would be disgusted",67
149,Mr KERR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He would be shocked at where you are standing today, Alby!",69
150,Mr SCHULTZ,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,to see the move away from the working class people that has occurred under this present regime in the last 10 to 15 years. Mr Kerr interjecting,69
151,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Denison is not assisting the chair.,69
152,Mr SCHULTZ,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"So I can understand why the Australian people will continue to reject the Australian Labor Party for what it is. They know that Work Choices offers more employers and employees the opportunity to make agreements that are relevant to the needs of their businesses rather than their being forced to work under the old one size fits all awards system. They also know that our living standards will rely on the productivity of our workplaces. Work Choices will allow Australians to continue enjoying real wage increases, will boost productivity and will provide the flexibility necessary to allow Australian employers and employees the choice to work out what they want. Nobody knows that more than I do, with my experiences in the Australian meat industry. I spent 32 years not only as a slaughterman and a labourer but as a manager, and I saw both sides of the equation there. I spent more time out of work on industrial strikes that should never have occurred than I did at the workplace. One of the reasons I opted out the of the trade union movement and went and applied for a management job, was so that I could support my wife and young children. We were in a situation in those days where workplace agreements were being ignored and pushed away by the Australian Labor Party through its trade union movement, even to the point where we were physically threatened by the trade union movement when we tried to negotiate agreements with our employers on the day. So don't any of you guys over there, who have absolutely no idea what it is like to work for a living, stand in this chamber and preach to the working class representatives of the people over here in the Liberal National Party coalition government, because we know more about what hard work is all about than you could ever dream of. You have listened to what your trade union mates tell you about what work is about; you have never experienced it. (Time expired)",69
153,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I just remind the member for Hume that he is addressing his remarks through the chair, and the chair is trying not to be too thin skinned. Mr Schultz interjecting",69
154,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I thank the member for Hume. The discussion is now concluded. NA NA BILL 2006 Assent Message from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the bill. FUEL TAX BILL 2006 Cognate bill: FUEL TAX (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed.,69
155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Hunter has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.  will continue in the debate on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006. Under the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program, member businesses must measure their greenhouse gas emissions, develop action plans for greenhouse gas abatement and report to the government on their actions. The government recognises that making greenhouse management a core element of business is important to finding costeffective solutions to the long-term greenhouse response. Membership of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program signals an expectation that very large users will particitax pate in an active partnership with government to address climate change. The program complements the government's other energy and greenhouse gas abatement measures addressing very large energy users. Where a taxpayer becomes a member of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program, they will be entitled to claim fuel tax credits for taxable fuel they acquired or manufactured in or imported into Australia before they joined the program by making a decreasing fuel tax adjustment for the amount of fuel tax credit that they were previously not entitled to take into account. The decreasing fuel tax adjustment will take into account the credits the taxpayer was previously not entitled to, up to five years prior to the end of the financial year in which they became a member of the program. A further environmental measure is compliance with emissions performance criteria by vehicles using diesel fuel in on-road applications. Operators of diesel vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of more than 4.5 tonnes are required to meet one of four emissions performance criteria to be entitled to the fuel tax credit. These criteria are designed to ensure that the operators of diesel vehicles have an increased incentive to make sure their vehicle meets the emissions standard set under the National Environment Protection (Diesel Vehicle Emissions) Measure. Accounting and reporting arrangements for business users under the diesel fuel tax credit scheme will align, as far as possible, with the existing arrangements under the GST law. Generally, this means that a taxpayer will have to be registered for the GST to claim a fuel tax credit; will claim fuel tax credits on the BAS in the same way that they claim GST input tax credits; will apply the same tax periods for fuel tax credits as they would apply for the GST; will attribute fuel credits to the same tax period as the GST input credits for the acquisition or importation of fuel; and will be subject to special GST rules applying to the way that their business is organised for the purpose of fuel tax credits. Compliance costs for businesses currently claiming the energy credits through third parties or receiving fuel effectively cise free under the excise remission arrangements will be rebalanced, as the end user of the fuel, rather than the third-party fuel supplier, will claim fuel tax credits directly via the BAS. The Fuel Tax Bill 2006 provides for the payment of fuel tax credits to taxpayers to remove or reduce the incidence of fuel tax levied on taxable fuels. Under the fuel tax credit scheme, all fuel acquired or manufactured in or imported into Australia for use in off-road applications for business purposes will become tax free over time. In this context, tax-free treatment occurs through a credit of tax paid-that is, the fuel is effectively tax free. This system of taxing and crediting is necessary to deal with the fact that currently fuel tax is paid by the manufacturer or importer of the fuel, generally well before its eventual use. Therefore, under current arrangements, the fuel tax is levied on the assumption that the fuel could be used in a taxable way, and credits are allowed to reverse the effect of the tax when it becomes clear that the fuel will be put to a non-taxable use covered by the legislation. There are also additional amendments proposed that will allow certain eligible taxpayers to make claims for the early payment of their fuel tax credit entitlements for a year transitional period for fuel bought between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2008. Taxpayers who make claims for early payment will still be required to report their fuel tax entitlements for the relevant tax period on their BAS and to take into account any claims for early payment. The two-year transitional period will allow taxpayers to align their business practice to the new claiming arrangements and will ameliorate negative cash flow effects that may be associated with claiming fuel tax credits via the BAS. Under fuel tax reform, ex- all the current mechanisms for delivering fuel tax-free treatment for petroleum products will be removed by 30 June 2006, and from 1 July 2006 fuel tax will apply to all petroleum products, including blends of petroleum products suitable for use for internal combustion engines. Effective fuel tax-free treatment for these products, where used other than as a fuel in an internal combustion engine, will be delivered by fuel tax credit to either the user of the fuel or at another point in the supply chain, depending on whether the use is business or private. For the business use of petroleum products as burner fuels or in non-fuel uses, the effective fuel tax-free treatment will be delivered through the fuel tax credit to the business as the end user of the product. From 1 July 2006, a fuel tax credit will apply to the acquisition or manufacture in, or importation into, Australia of diesel and diesel-like fuels in applications that currently qualify for an off-road credit under the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. From 1 July 2008, the acquisition or manufacture in, or importation into, Australia of taxable fuels for use in other off-road applications will become eligible for a 50 per cent fuel tax credit of the fuel tax paid on the fuel. At the same time, the acquisition or manufacture in, twoor importation into, Australia of petrol will become eligible for a 100 per cent fuel tax credit of the fuel tax paid for all users that were previously eligible for an off-road credit under the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. It is intended that alternative fuels such as biodiesel, domestically produced ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas begin to incur effective fuel tax from 1 July 2011. From that date, the acquisition, manufacture or importation into Australia of these fuels for use in off-road business applications will become eligible for the fuel tax credit equivalent to the amount of fuel tax paid on the fuel. Fuel grants will continue to apply from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2010 under the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme for the purchase for use of alternative fuels-biodiesel, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas-in registered vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of over 4.5 tonnes. The grant rates applicable in respect of these fuels will be reduced to zero five equal annual steps commencing on 1 July 2006 and concluding on 1 July 2010. The proposed amendments in this bill are intended to assist taxpayers to make the transition to the new fuel tax system that will commence on 1 July 2006 to replace the existing complex system of fuel tax concessions. Taxpayers will claim a fuel tax credit through the business activity statement in the same way as they claim goods and services tax input tax credits. The claiming mechanisms proposed are intended to simplify administration and compliance arrangements. I commend the bill to the House.",70
156,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the amendment put forward by the member for Hunter to the Fuel Tax Bill 2006. The fuel tax legislation provides a single system of fuel tax and associated credits but overlooks the need for nation building and ignores the immediate needs of motorists and middle Australia. The government ought to be taking action to reduce our dependency on foreign oil, it ought to be taking action to take us in the direction of cleaner, more environmentally responsible fuels, and it should be taking action to develop the Australian fuels industry. With some assistance from the Parliamentary Library, I have put together some data about the Commonwealth revenue from the GST on petrol and excise since the introduction of the GST in 2000. Honourable members might recall that, in the lead-up to the introduction of the GST, the government promised that motorists would not be worse off as a result of its introduction and that petrol taxes would not increase. Although there is no data on GST revenue collected directly from petrol sales, we are able to make reliable estimates based on petrol sales information and average petrol prices. The information which I have available to me in comes from the Australian Petroleum Statistics from the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources, the average retail prices of selected items from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, FUELtrac Pty Ltd, the final budget outcome and Budget Paper No. 1: Budget Strategy and Outlook 2006-07. That collection of statistics shows that excise has remained relatively constant during the period 2000-01 to the present. Back in 2000-01 the Commonwealth take through petrol excise was around $6.8 billion and rose to $7 billion, then to $7.2 billion and then to $7.4 billion. In fact, it has tapered off in the last couple of years and is back to $7.3 billion and $7.2 billion. What has occurred is that the GST take has increased dramatically. In 2001-02, it was $1.4 billion, and it has gone through $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion and, for 2005-06, is estimated to be $2.1 billion-that is to say, a 50 per cent increase since 2001-02. Members might ask: is this increased Commonwealth petrol tax take due to more kilometres being travelled? The answer is no; the excise side is constant, even declining. It may be that motorists may be reducing the amount of kilometres travelled in response to the higher petrol prices they are being required to pay. But in fact we can see that the government has been able to rake in a massive $2.1 billion in GST petrol take estimated for 2005-06-as I said, a 50 per cent increase on that which was occurring back in 2001-02. We have had the budget night tax giveaway, but the government has not told us what it is collecting in extra petrol taxes, bracket creep, GST and the like. Every time the price of petrol goes up, on the inside the Prime Minister smiles and the Treasurer smirks. On the outside they are wringing their hands and saying, ‘We're so sorry, there's nothing we can do,' but on the inside they are smiling and counting all those extra petrol tax dollars that they are trousering. They can use those dollars either to convince us of what good economic managers they are or for election bribes.",72
157,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,The member for Wills would be aware of what the chair believes about the term ‘bribes'.,73
158,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. They should use those dollars to get us off our dependency on imported petrol and onto environmentally responsible, less greenhouseemitting sustainable fuels such as natural gas and, ultimately, hydrogen. Back in 2001 the government claimed that the GST would not lead to higher petrol taxes. That claim is rubbish. Freezing excise has not worked. The government gets more in additional GST through rising petrol prices than it would have got from the indexation of excise. That promise has turned out to be absolute codswallop-a noncore promise. Information which I have collected on the period 2000-01 through to 2004-05-for which relevant information is availableshows that the amount of excise forgone has moved from $90 million in 2000-01 up to $1.1 billion in 2004-05. However, at the same time the GST take has been steadily rising, as I indicated to the House previously, from $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion. So, during the relevant period, all up we get an increase in the petrol tax take of the combined order of over $4½ billion. Of course, this is occurring at a time when motorists are experiencing plenty of petrol price pain. Indeed, I understand that unleaded petrol prices were as high as 143.9c a litre in Sydney today and at a record average of 147.6c a litre in Bega on the New South Wales South Coast. Prices hit a high of 139.9c a litre in Melbourne after peaking at 142.8c a litre on Thursday. This is against a background where the petrol prices in May were said to be at a new record high, with the national average approaching the $1.35 a litre mark. Back in May the Australian Institute of Petroleum reported that $1.35 was the record; it looks as though that will be eclipsed when the latest figures come out. Given these circumstances, I think it is quite inexcusable that the Howard government has failed to act on Australia's growing import dependence and its impact on energy security and fuel prices. We are now importing 60 per cent of our oil. For the past seven years, we have been using oil three times faster than we have been finding it. Given this, a do-nothing strategy is not an acceptable option. It sells Australia short and, if it continues, it will seriously damage regional Australia. What can we do about it? One thing we ought to do is to give up some of the foreign policy adventurism which has been so catastrophic and which I have spoken about on a number of occasions. But, with international oil prices so high, the second thing we can do is to increase competition in the Australian petrol retailing industry. Labor produced a plan to put downward pressure on petrol prices, seeking to break down the power of the big oil companies and help consumers. That plan included amending the Trade Practices Act to guarantee independent wholesalers and retailers access, on fair terms, to fuel supplies from the terminals of the major oil companies; allowing independent wholesalers and retailers to bargain collectively when seeking fuel supplies from the terminals of the major oil companies; outlawing predatory pricing under the Trade Practices Act and strengthening section 46 to stop the abuse of market power, thereby protecting independents against the market power of the big companies; giving the ACCC the power to issue cease and desist orders to provide immediate relief against market abuse and anti-competitive behaviour; granting the courts power to order the divestiture of assets and impose jail terms to tackle cartels and the worse cases of market abuse; and establishing a yellow card system, which would enable the ACCC to keep a register of bona fide complaints of misuse of market power to be used for assessing penalties for proven breaches of the Trade Practices Act. However, the most important thing we can do to give Australia real energy independence is to use some of our huge gas reserves to produce liquid based transport fuels. We have something like 140 trillion cubic feet of offshore gas reserves that, using current techdiesel nology, could be transformed into what amounts to a limitless supply of transport fuel, which is well and truly commercially viable and would remain viable even if there were a fall in the oil price. We should being advantage of these riches to insure Australia against physical supply shocks and give this nation genuine energy independence. The government ought to be making Australia a place of gas to liquids production. We should neither be sitting on our reserves while the price of our transport fuels continues to skyrocket nor be exporting everything we can find and letting other countries do the value adding, guaranteeing that our current account and trade deficits will continue to rise. We need to do more to promote biofuels, LPG, CNG and synthetic fuels produced from gas-to-liquids technologies. There is much more that we can do on this front. I commend to the House an issues paper produced recently by the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. The particular parts of that paper which I find interesting and significant are those which go to the use of gas and using that, in the paper's own words, as ‘a platform for prosperity'. The paper points out that gas is becoming increasingly important in the global energy mix, that Australia has abundant natural gas resources and that these provide great opportunities for us, as gas is a cleaner and less greenhouse intensive fuel than coal. The paper notes that, even though significant gas reserves have been discovered, many remain undeveloped. It goes on to say that there is great potential in the development of an Australian gas-to-liquids industry. It also mentions coal to liquids, biodiesel and ethanol as part of a response towards a sustainable fuels policy for this country. It notes that the commercialisation of gas-to-liquids technology is still in its infancy but that it may provide Australia with a viable additional source of hydrocarbon liquids generated from its large gas reserves. The paper indicates to us that the opportunity takexists to develop new Australian LNG projects of between 30 million tonnes per annum to 50 million tonnes per annum by the year 2015. The commercialising of gas technologies would enable us to move into the area of electricity generation and also the increased conversion of gas to various forms of liquids. There are, of course, forecast capacity additions to Australia's alumina refining capacity, and growth in gas fired electricity generation would be very useful given that background. They do note as constraints that the current fiscal regime is perceived to be more attractive for oil than for gas and they also note as a constraint the fact that the market very fractured and that you do not have a link between the gas pipeline networks in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and eastern Australia-that is to say, an absence of interconnecting natural gas pipelines between these regions. The lack of interconnections between the Western Australian, Northern Territory and eastern markets results in price differentials and lost opportunities for increased gas utilisation. Given that problem, the paper does of course refer to the possibility of the establishment of a national pipeline grid at some stage and notes that cross-country pipeline connections have many stakeholders and any final commitment would take years to develop-indeed, is likely to take 10 years from the commencement of feasibility studies to actually switching on the gas supply. Nevertheless, it seems to me that this is precisely the kind of national infrastructure debate we ought to be having. It is a far more productive debate, quite frankly, than the debate about a nuclear reactor which the Prime Minister has established and which seems to me to be simply a debate about dividing Australians and setting us at each other's throats-more about that than providing the kind of infrastructure which would really give us a sustainable energy policy into the future. The paper also notes that there could be a role for government in addressing the shortage of skilled labour. It is one of the things that it sees as a problem in the promotion of the upstream oil and gas industry. I agree with that absolutely. I think there is certainly a need for more university and TAFE places to deal with the skills shortage. Finally, it comments on some of the greenhouse issues and makes some remarks concerning an emissions trading regime. I think an emissions trading regime is essential for this is country. Indeed, I believe it would prove to be of considerable assistance to the gas industry and would enable them to flourish, which they need to do to meet Australia's future energy needs. It is not just the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association which has been at work in developing policies to give Australia a more secure, a more environmentally responsible and a more sustainable energy future but also the opposition. Late last year our leader, Kim Beazley, produced a blueprint concerning the development of Australia's transport fuel industry. The sorts of policies set out in that blueprint and also referred to by the member for Hunter in his amendment show an opposition keen to take Australia in the right direction of transport fuels. The paper notes that we need to increase the use of Australian transport fuels and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. It notes that we need national leadership to develop existing alternatives like liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel and that we need leadership to develop emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity as well as future fuels such as hydrogen. Of course, in doing so, we make Australia less vulnerable to future energy shocks, we make Australia less reliant on foreign oil, affecting our trade deficit and our foreign debt, and we make Australian motorists less vulnerable to the slings and arrows of fortunes in the Middle East and in other parts of the world. We also invest in preserving our environment by diversifying our fuel base beyond petrol to biofuels, gas and hydrogen. When we consider what has happened to the price of petrol and the availability of petrol over the last few years we would have to ask, if we look down the road, if we look down the time tunnel: where is this going? Surely, the prospects in the future are for falling production and higher demand, and in that case prices will soar. The sorts of problems we are experiencing presently will not improve. They are not a one-off, they are not exceptional; they are things which are going to become more serious. In the past three years we have seen global oil prices triple. The era of cheap oil is over. Given that background, it is quite regrettable that the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources has been failing to do the work needed for the government to prepare Australia for the effects of future peaks. My colleague the member for Melbourne, who is in the chamber, asked the minister for industry in June last year about the work that the government was doing to prepare Australia for the effect of future peaks. He asked whether the government had estimated when this might happen, what the decline in global production might be, what the impact on prices might be and whether the government had done any modelling of the impact on the Australian economy. The minister's answers were no, no, no and no. The industry minister has also said: At this stage Australia's fuel security is still ... Do we need to find more oil? Yes, we do. But short of finding more oil I don't know what the solution is. This is simply pathetic. This is a council of despair which Labor rejects. The plans that we have put forward, our transport blueprint, mean that we do have something to offer Australia and its energy future. (Time expired)",73
159,Mr TANNER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (4.46 pm)The Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006 which are before the parliament tonight are built on a concept that is sound in its underlying terms. The legislation is about rationalising fuel taxation in Australia, partly based on a gradual increase in tax on alternative fuels, which does raise some concerns in my mind about the potential impact on the marketability of the kinds of fuels that we are increasingly going to have to rely on in the future to ensure that transport and energy needs are adequately provided for. It also involves a substantial realignment of the means of taxation of diesel and petrol for offroad business use and the abolition of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, which involved a small but significant subsidy to rural and remote petrol consumers. All off-road business use will now be tax free and this is estimated by the government to cost in the vicinity of $300 million to $400 million per annum. It is interesting, though, that I have not been able to determine whether this includes an estimate of a clawback from company tax, because at the moment the various businesses concerned effectively get a tax offset or a tax deduction for the cost of the fuel tax that they are paying. That will no longer be the case and, therefore, I would assume that there would be a change over time in company tax. As far as I can see, there is no calculation made in the good net cost to the taxpayer of these changes, reflecting the inevitability of some clawback in company tax. We do not know whether the estimated cost to the taxpayer from the change is a gross cost or a net cost-in other words, whether the company tax clawback is taken into account. The loss of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme is a very significant issue and will have an impact on many consumers in regional and rural Australia, particularly at a time when, as everybody knows, petrol prices have soared and are causing considerable financial pain for many families and many consumers, none more so than in country Australia. It is interesting that effectively the government is extending greater generosity to businesses in rural Australia through the extension of the capacity to get a here-and-now rebate to petrol but, at the same time, is slugging consumers in regional Australia. In other words, people who are its closest political base in regional Australia, particularly farmers and other businesses, will get the benefit but other people-ordinary workers, ordinary consumers-in rural and regional Australia will now lose the benefits of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme subsidies. It is true to say that the magnitude of the benefit flowing to ordinary motorists in rural and regional Australia from the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme has been questioned. Some allege that, in many cases, the benefits are not adequately passed through to consumers-they are just absorbed by producers and retailers. I am not really in a position to comment on the extent of that, but certainly it is an issue of some seriousness. It is rather odd that, at a time of very high petrol prices and when a lot of people in country Australia are suffering significant detriment as a result of those petrol prices, the government should choose to remove this scheme and at the same time increase the availability of immediate tax relief to businesses in country Australia. I am particularly concerned about the prospect of increased rorting of these arrangements. Some time ago I asked the Parliamentary Library to provide me with details of the policing mechanisms for the successor to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, and the ability of people for off-road use, in effect, to get an immediate rebate of the tax. I found the information provided to me distinctly uninspiring and not reassuring. It tainly appeared to me that the degree of enforcement and rigorous approach to ensuring that only those who were legitimately entitled to claim the rebate were actually able to do so was hardly of the kind of magnitude that you would hope, particularly as there are substantial amounts of money involved. I would suggest that the ability of producers, of people running businesses, to include the private use of fuel within the rebatable or effectively tax-exempt use that is provided for in their productive activity is quite significant. The government is proposing to expand the fuel range that applies to and, therefore, to open up a new prospect of people rorting the system in order to gain a benefit. I will give an example from my own family background. For many years my father used a Falcon ute as his primary vehicle, which was used largely on his farm but also as his personal vehicle. Because he was also an accountant, he drove the ute around town for a range of other activities. It was a petrol powered car, so it was not covered by what was then the diesel fuel rebate, but under the measures the government is proposing he would have the opportunity to effectively shift the cost that he otherwise would have to pay in tax and excise on his petrol back onto the taxpayer by massaging that into the category of use of a vehicle for business related purposes. Obviously, this is not an unlimited possibility, but there is certainly plenty of scope for people to effectively pad their business related use and minimise their personal use in order to claim the tax benefit. I am concerned that this legislation will actually expand that opportunity and I call on the government to thoroughly examine the extent to which the current enforcement is rigorous and meaningful and to ensure that the tax benefits that flow under both the existing cer- scheme and the expanded arrangements that this legislation provides will apply only to the use for which the benefits are intended. The bigger picture question, which I do not think this bill adequately deals with, is Australia's interests in the area of energy in the longer term-in particular, the question of where affordable fuel is going to come from in 10 or 15 years time. This is not just an issue for regional Australia. In fact, it is interesting to note that average spending per household on petrol in this country is broadly very similar in the cities and the country. Although people tend to travel longer distances in country Australia, it is common for people to travel quite long distances commuting to work in the cities, while that occurs to a much lesser extent in many parts of country Australia. So, in aggregate, petrol use per household in metropolitan Australia is broadly very similar to that in country Australia. It is higher in country Australia, but we should not assume that the question of fuel needs is for rural Australia only. The question is also an important one for people in metropolitan areas. We cannot escape the fact that the days of relatively cheap transport may well be over. Technological change can always deliver miracles-things that nobody could have predicted-and it is eminently possible that, in 10 or 15 years time, different fuels and technologies will enable us to continue to use transport options that, as a proportion of total productive activities, are as efficient and cheap as we have enjoyed for many years. But, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have to say that that does not look particularly likely. If the effective cost of transport relative to the total economic activity of the nation increases substantially, it will have a profound impact on Australian society and our economy. A whole lot of production dynamics will be changed, and in positive as well as negative ways. One of the reasons the Australian manufacturing industry is under ever-increasing pressure from imports is that, in the past 20 or 30 years, relative transport costs have plummeted and, therefore, the capacity to economically transport sometimes quite large items or items where the ratio of value to volume is not particularly high has been strong. A lot of those possibilities have been opened up through lower transport costs. If, through events that none of us can control, the relative cost of transport as compared with total production increases substantially, one of the offshoots will be that it will become more economic to produce products closer to the markets in which they are consumed. Also, it may mean, for example, that the importation of primary products from very distant parts of the world become significantly less economic. However, against those kinds of changes there will be a range of things that people will find far less positive. Of course, the overall additional cost that would be borne by consumers would increase and the ordinary living standards of Australian workers and the capacity of businesses to produce affordable goods and services would be significantly affected. It is a very serious issue that we need to pay a lot of attention to. The shadow minister for human services and government accountability mentioned the question on notice I asked last year of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources about the extent to which the government was seriously planning for the longer term and for the possibility of global oil production reaching a peak and declining thereafter. This is known in the trade as ‘Huppert's peak' after the geologist who first coined the idea. There is considerable debate about when that is likely to arise. Some pessimists suggest that we are on the verge of that peak in oil production already and that, after the next year or two, overall oil production will start declining. There are others who are far more optimistic and suspect that it is several decades away. One way or the other, it is going to happen. If we do not gradually reduce our dependence on oil, then when it does happen the implications for Australia and other countries in similar circumstances will be immense. At that time you will see the interaction the forces of supply and demand producing very dramatic increases in price. What we have recently experienced in Australia with petrol prices will look pretty trivial compared with the kind of price increases that we may see when we are dealing with a genuinely global market and an increasingly scarce resource attached to ever-mounting demand. It makes sense that a nation like Australia should do everything it can to plan and prepare for that prospect, to diminish our reliance on oil, to develop alternative fuels and to ensure that we are as well placed as possible to ride out any disruption that those changes may bring. Even it is 20 or 30 years away, we still need to be preparing for these things. A variety of technological possibilities emerging. Members would all be aware of hybrid cars, the development of hydrogen fuel cells and biofuels. The dynamics of oil may change as a result of things like tar sands, shale oil and so forth. None of them appears to constitute a magic bullet at this stage, but we cannot predict what they will ultimately produce. Barring the kinds of technological miracles that they may or may not entail, we need to prepare for the prospect of a society where the relative cost of transport is significantly higher than currently. This will have enormous implications for things like the design of cities. It will mean, for example, that that which is becoming increasingly common of people commuting from the other side of Geelong to work in Melbourne or from the Central Coast of New South Wales to work in Sydney will be uneconomic; it will be just too expensive. A whole lot of rearrangements of how we go about our lives and the production process will inevitably flow. That is why it is crucial for our nation that we plan now. The answers that the minister gave to my of questions on notice which the member for Wills read out before of no, no, no and noin other words, ‘We have no idea and we don't care'-are simply not adequate. In the interests of our nation, in the interests of all the producers of our nation, not least the primary producers, we need to be preparing for these changes and ensuring that Australia is best positioned to ride out any disruption which may flow. We do not know whether this is going to occur, we do not know what magnitude the negative consequences may be, but we have a responsibility to ourselves, to the nation and to our children to prepare for these things, and the government appears to have little interest in them. There are some short-term things we ought to be doing, such as ensuring the are ACCC has greater powers to police the various levels in the oil industry, ensuring that we do not do things like invade Iraq and therefore contribute to the inflation of global oil prices and particularly improving our approach to energy conservation, transport, buildings and a variety of other things. In the long term it is inevitable that our children are going to face a very different world. Instead of pretending that cheap oil is going to continue forever or that it will be replaced by equally cheap alternative fuel sources, we as a nation need to prepare now for the difficulties we will inevitably face, whether they are five or 25 years away.",76
160,Mr SNOWDON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to speak in this discussion on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and cognate bill but with mixed feelings. On the one hand, the legislation is part of a major reform of fuel taxation in Australia and may have a positive effect on regional Australia in streamlining compliance and administration of grants available to reduce costs for transport and eligible offroad activities. Hopefully these reforms will remove the bias in grey areas that have emerged from the current arrangements. On the other hand, I am concerned by the abolition of the Fuel Sales Grant Scheme, which was introduced when it was becoming quite apparent that the introduction of A New Tax System-the GST-on 1 July 2000 was not going to deliver cheaper fuel to regional and remote Australians. The Fuel Sales Grant Scheme provided registered retailers with grants of 1c per litre in non-metropolitan zones and 2c per litre in so-called remote zones and then an additional grant of 1c per litre where the fuel price is consistently over $1.21. The relief provided by these grants was meant to be passed on to consumers, although it is doubtful that it ever was. I remind the House of this because, in the months prior to the introduction of the GST, there was a very lively debate in the Northern Territory about the impact of a GST on fuel prices. Even former Territorian CLP Senator Grant Tambling was prepared to bet cartons of beer on ABC radio that the GST would deliver not only cheaper fuel but cheaper prices of goods on the supermarket shelves as a flow-on. You and I both know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that was never an outcome-it did not happen. Even with the Fuel Sales Grant Scheme, Territorians very quickly became used to paying more for fuel and more fuel tax than anyone else in Australia. We hear volatile discussion at the moment about rising fuel prices and people in the city expressing their dissatisfaction at paying $1.30 or $1.40 per litre. People living in the bush are used to these prices because they have been paying them for some time. Certainly people in my electorate are very used to paying these sorts of prices for fuel. I say to the government that in my constituency fuel prices are a major issue. The member for Melbourne pointed out that people who live in towns adjacent to cities drive longer distances than people who live in regional Australia. That may well be true, but it is also true that people who live a long way away from towns have to travel long distances to service centres to access fundamental services such as medical facilities, schools, legal services and other services which they require for their ongoing lives. In the Northern Territory that means people often travel vast distances on sometimes very poor roads. At the time we were debating the GST and talking about fuel prices and arguing whether or not fuel prices would be higher as a result, people at Ramingining in my electorate were paying $1.30 per litre; today they are paying between $1.55 and $1.60 per litre. If you happen to be living on the Barkly Tablelands, perhaps travelling from Tennant Creek to Mount Isa or Camooweal, if you stop on the highway you would today be paying $1.85 per litre. You hear the debates in this place and you hear the government say how conscious they are of the people who live in remote communities and in the bush. Frankly I do not think they care, because if they did care they would be doing something about a tax on a tax which, as the prices increase, becomes greater for those people who live in these areas where the price of fuel is so high. Last week while I was travelling around the bush I even heard a story of one place where fuel prices are $2.40 or $2.50 a litre. Of course, travelling becomes completely uneconomical. People who have low discretionary incomes, as many people who live in the bush do-as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, coming from the land as you dodo not have the dough to throw away on paying huge costs extra for fuel. They already pay huge costs because of where they live. If you live in a remote Aboriginal community in the Northern Territory it is more than likely you are probably earning somewhere around $200 to $240 a week; you might have an annual income of $10,000 to $12,000 a year. If you are lucky you might have a vehicle. Can you imagine travelling the distances that these people are required travel and paying $1.80 or $2.00 a litre for fuel, and travelling on poorly maintained roads because this federal government have perennially failed to provide appropriate money for the infrastructure? We have had debates in this place about the Roads to Recovery program. I have been up in the scrapers here many times, talking about the failure of the government to recognise their responsibilities for providing funding for roads on land in the Northern Territory which is not in local government areas. We are talking of 9,000 kilometres or thereabouts of dirt roads. Because you have traversed this part of the country, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you would know that many of these roads are economically very important. They carry the tens of thousands of head of cattle that traverse the Darwin wharf on a regular basis at this time of year, heading for markets in South-East Asia. The fuel cost is borne ultimately by consumers, wherever they might be. Producers of cattle in the Northern Territory, indeed across the Top End of Australia, because a large amount of the beef that is exported across the Darwin wharf comes from western Queensland, pay for it. Either they have to absorb the additional cost within their pricing or they pass it on to someone else, and we know that that has an outcome on supermarket shelves either here or overseas. Also because of the failure of this government to provide the adequate resources to maintain the roads in the region, people are required to drive extraordinarily long distance to get their cattle to market. I know of a property owner on the Plenty Highway who was selling into the markets in Queensland. Normally, you would expect to be able to drive across the Plenty Highway towards Winton and to take the product to market at Rockhampton or wherever the saleyards are. to Do you know what these people have to do? They have to drive down to the Stuart Highway-that is, they have to drive west not east-then drive north to the junction of the Stuart Highway and the Barkly Highway, then drive across to Mount Isa and then drive down to the saleyards. That creates an enormous burden upon them, and it adds substantially to their costs. The other costs that arise are those which transport companies bear in maintaining their road trains. Maintenance work increases extraordinarily as a result of having to traverse these roads. I have mentioned Mount Isa but at Alpurrurulam, a community of 300 on the Queensland-Northern Territory border, a community operated bowser currently is selling fuel at $1.70 a litre. That is cheaper than on the highway because the community is not that far from the homestead on the Barkly Highway, which I have already quoted as having fuel at $1.85 a litre, and it does it at cost. There is no profit in it; they just do it at cost to service their community and because they are aware of the low levels of income of members of their communities. At Borroloola, in the Gulf, fuel is currently selling at $1.65 a litre. At Ampilatwatja store, 300 kilometres north-east of Alice Springs along the unsealed Sandover Highway, a road that is similar to the Plenty Highway and which comes off the Plenty Highway, you will pay $1.68 for a litre of unleaded fuel, and diesel will cost $1.78. As I have said previously, when people discuss regional Australia generally in this place they are not referring to the part of Australia that I live in. They are not referring to Northern Australia. They are certainly not referring to the Northern Territory or to the Kimberley, and I know you have had experience in the Kimberley, Mr Deputy Speaker. They are not referring to Far North Queensland, or western Queensland or Cape York. What they think is regional is Moss Vale. They have no idea. They think that if you put on a pair of riding boots and get into your Land Rover and drive over the top of the Great Dividing Range you have hit the bush. They have no idea at all. They might be dealing with Gippsland-of course, we know about Gippsland and the National Party's representative in here from that area. They might be referring to the Mallee and or even to the south-west of Western Australia, which is beautiful country and which might be classed as regional, but it is absolutely nothing like the North. When they have a picture in their minds of regional Australia, that is what they see. They have, in my view, little experience, knowledge, understanding or comprehension of the part of Australia that I am talking about, the part of Australia that I am privileged to represent in this parliament. When I discuss regional Australia in the Northern Territory, I am talking about a relatively small number of pastoral holdings, something in excess of 250 across the Northern Territory; a number of mine sites scattered around the Northern Territory producing enormous wealth for this nation, whether it is at Nhulunbuy with Alcan or the producing of gold in the Tanami or manganese on Groote Eylandt; and a large number of discrete Indigenous communities scattered around the Northern Territory-some hundreds of them. When I sit here in this place and listen to the government dealing with issues such as fuel tax they are talking about farmers. They do not talk about the large number of small communities scattered around the vast areas of the north, not only in the Territory but elsewhere such as in the electorates of the member for Leichhardt, the member for Grey, the member for Kalgoorlie or the member for Kennedy. Australians living in those electorates, like Australians living in my electorate, have been savaged by the burden of the GST. They pay more fuel tax-and the cost of fuel of course is relatively higher in any event. Whatever merits there might be for the GST, I have always argued that Australians living in remote Australia pay more GST. The fuel sales grant was implemented to ease that burden. The scheme was not indexed, so as the price of fuel has increased since July 2000 the relative relief provided by the scheme has become less and less. When you are paying the prices I quoted earlier for fuel at different locations, the grant of 3c per litre for 2006 is not worth much. Consumers have had to absorb the increase in fuel price, including the tax component-and, as I say, I am not even certain that the benefit was ever really passed on to the consumers. Other failures of the scheme, such as boundary anomalies and whether the full extent of the grant was being passed on to consumers, mean very little when you are paying 20c or 30c more for each litre of fuel. I have always argued that the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme would not compensate for the impact of the GST in rural and remote communities. In fact, the fuel taxation inquiry found it difficult to identify the benefits to consumers in rural and remote areas. They said the scheme had to be abolished. The money saved by its abolition-$270 million in 2005-2006-is to be channelled into road funding. It will be very interesting to see if we get any more road funding in the Northern Territory. A significant amount is required to address the road needs that I identified earlier and that are commonly understood by people who drive in the Territory and live and work in these remote places. It is worthwhile pointing out how fuel prices might impact on communities and the relative cost of living in different places across Australia. As it happens, since 1998 the Northern Territory government's Department of Health and Community Services has done a regular survey of the cost of household food baskets in rural and remote areas as part of its nutrition and physical activity program. It is called the market basket survey of remote community stores. Recall that I said that on the Barkly motorists are currently paying $1.85 a litre for fuel. I also mentioned a figure for Borroloola. We know that, if you live on the Barkly in that remote part of the Northern Territory, you will pay 153 per cent more for a food basket than you would pay in Darwin. What does that tell you? It tells you not to have a lot of money in your pocket. It tells you that the additional cost of paying for fuel at the price which is currently being asked for in the bush means that you have even less money in your pocket. I know there has been a lot of discussion about alternative fuels. I heard the member for Melbourne talk about how we need to adjust our minds to the idea of higher relative costs for transport. That may well be true, but if we want people to thrive in remote Australia we have to find a way to provide them with fuel at a reasonable cost, not unreasonably different from that which their city cousins pay in Sydney or Melbourne. I have some personal views about this which I have expressed at meetings I have had with some of my colleagues. They do not all agree with me-not even my mate sitting next to me, the member for Hunter. We have conversations about this, but I have a view which he does not share. He comes from a little place called the Hunter Valley. Mr Fitzgibbon-I am from the bush too, mate.",79
161,Mr SNOWDON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,That ain't regional; that is very local.,83
162,Mr HUNT,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,I don't think he likes you!,83
163,Mr SNOWDON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,I like him. I think he is a terrific bloke. He just has some strange ideas. Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting,83
164,Mr SNOWDON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"It did. It made me run playing soccer. But what we have to understand is that the changes governments make to the way they price commodities through the tax system can have a dramatic impact upon people's lives. Whilst it is all very well to talk about trying to introduce cheaper fuels, the fact of the matter is that fuels are not cheap at the moment and they are not likely to get any cheaper and we have to find a mechanism by which people who live in remote parts of Australia are adequately compensated for the extra costs they wear as a result of living where they do. Presumably, this country wants people to live in the bush. Presumably, this country wants people to inhabit those areas of Australia which produce the wealth of this nation. I am hopeful that when we move on in these debates we will see that not only do we produce the most wealth but also we produce a hell of a lot of the tax income for government. We want to see some of it returned to where it belongs. We want government to return a lot more of it than it currently does to people in the bush-the people I referred to earlier. My friend is from the Hunter where they have a lot of coal mines, they produce a lot of money and they export a lot of coal to Japan and elsewhere. That is terrific, but the people who live in that community do not bear anywhere near the same costs of living as people who live in remote parts of the Northern Territory. I am pleased to have made this short contribution and I look forward to having another chat about it at some later stage.",83
165,Mr NEVILLE,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"The Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006 introduces a single system of tax fuel credits for Australian business from 1 July and will phase in extensions to eligibility between then and 1 July 2012. This legislation provides for the removal or reduction of the amount of excise levied on taxable fuels and, when fully implemented, means that fuel tax will only effectively be applied to private use of fuel road in motor vehicles and in certain off-road applications; business use of fuel on-road in vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of more than 4.5 tonnes or less; and business use of fuel on-road in vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of more than 4.5 tonnes, but only to the extent of the applicable road user charge. Before I go into the substance of my contribution, I want to say a few things to the member for Lingiari in his absence. I share his great concern, as I think every rural member does, that in remote areas all over Australia-whether it is an area in Western Australia, in the Northern Territory or in the south-western corner of my electorate-the price of fuel is very expensive. There is no denying that. But I do not think it is fair to suddenly drag out the GST as a major component of that. The reason-and this is often conveniently forgotten by our critics and, dare I say, by the opposition-is that, at the time of the introduction of the GST, we effectively reduced the excise by 7c a litre. Mr Fitzgibbon-Strike rate 77c, mate.",84
166,Mr NEVILLE,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Yes, 77c. The 7c reduction in excise was to offset the GST. From that point onwards, the cost was neutral. The GST component that has been added to fuel has come from the 77c to where it is now times 10 per cent-not from zero, which is the scam that is used in a lot of arguments around the place. The other thing is that the government pegged excise at 38.14c a litre. Had we continued, as the previous government had, indexing that every six months, we would be paying another 14c a litre more than is currently the case. That, again, is conveniently forgotten by our critics. If you also look at the international prices of fuel, you will see that Australia is almost always in the bottom four. They are usually the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia and, occasionally, New Zealand. We are genonerally third or fourth in the world with the cheapest fuel, and our government charges are not excessive by international standards. If we want to have a mature debate about this, let us take those things into account as well. If you want to take a more positive view of where the government is going with a whole range of vehicles, look at the purpose of the bill. I have not heard many speakers on either side drilling down to the positive effect it will have. Two years ago, the Prime Minister released a white paper on energy policy entitled Securing Australia's Energy Future. The paper outlined a major program of reform to modernise and simplify Australia's fuel system. It was centred around a single fuel tax credit system to replace the current complex system of fuel tax concessions. While the move was widely welcomed by primary industry and trucking sectors, a number of concerns were raised in relation to businesses having to claim the fuel tax rebates through their quarterly BAS statements. Many of these businesses have approached their local MPs, including me, in recent months to let us know about the cash flow challenges of this and what they will face if they have to wait up to three months for their 38c a litre rebate. You might say, ‘That's probably not all that big a deal,' but I have a fisherman in my area whose fuel bill is $90,000 a month. That is a very big fuel bill. The cash flow implications to him are quite substantial. Bear in mind, too, the precarious nature of fishing in some of Australia's offshore fisheries-in particular the east coast trawl area, most of which falls within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The problems there are manifest, and we are still working through compensation packages and the like. Banks that are allowing fishermen to continue are providing them with very meagre overdraft facilities, right down to the point of their monthly fuel bill. When you have to add another 38c a litre to that fuel bill, albeit that you will get it back in one to three months time, it is still a substantial cash flow problem. I was contacted by a number of operators who were looking for the high out-of-pocket costs. As I said, this involves tens of thousands of dollars or, in one case I know of, $90,000. I would like to quote a few of the comments that I have received from a number of businesspeople and fishermen in my electorate. One of them said: We have gone from paying 22 cents a litre (with rebate off) before the GST came in, to now paying almost $1.10 plus GST (with the rebate off) to the Government wanting us to pay the full price of $1.48 or more-as you know, prices keep increasing, that is just today's price. Our fuel bill alone is in the red by $35,000 just since December. I make the point: cash flow is important. Another said: This would put a lot of trawler businesses under terrible strain financially ... if this new system of administration were to be introduced, trawler and fishing businesses could not afford to fuel their boats and wait to claim the rebate back in their BAS. Many family operators would just close down. A third one states: This and the fuel cost at the moment will surely bankrupt my business as we are finding it extremely hard. I have recently retrenched my deckhand and am back on the vessel myself with my son to try and make ends meet. You can gather from those statements that this has had a more profound effect on the fishing industry than anyone else. And I make no apologies for saying this: I am a critic of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. My colleagues in the coalition know of my ambivalence with this organisation. I think the Representative Areas Program on the Great Barrier Reef was a disgrace. The sooner it is reviewed and certain areas opened, the better. You have to remember that at the turn of the decade these people went through what was called the east coast trawl plan. It removed 250 of the 750 trawlers on the east coast of Queensland. Since then, another 50 or more have gone. We were told at the end of that process, ‘The reef is now secure; it is now sustainable. We may need a little bit extra in the marine park, but that won't be a problem.' How much extra? Initially, it was going to be 20 per cent but, when the maps came out, it was 33 per cent. Worse still, when the maps were put over traditional fishing grounds, the effect was around 70 per cent to 75 per cent. This brings me back to the point of the debate: what were the effects of that? One was that you could not fish in what was remaining of the traditional areas without the risk of pulse fishing, where you just outfish an area. I have often wondered whether the technique at the beginning of this plan was for the fishers to be able to come back to the government and say, ‘We're overfishing what's left of the reef.' I am a cynic enough to believe that that was probably part of the agenda. Nevertheless, I have some very positive fishermen in my area who decided they would go to the outer reef. To go to the outer reef, they had to upgrade vessels, buy new vessels and new equipment but-and this also applies to some who are still fishing within the marine park area-there are vastly greater distances to be covered at a time when fuel is at a premium. So you can see that these taxation measures and how they are implemented are terribly important, especially to someone whose banker has them on a very tight overdraft. The statements that I read to you before came from commercial fishermen who have been hard hit by this Great Barrier Reef Marine Park zoning whereby, in many instances, trawlers travel great distances. The government has recognised the risk to these businesses, businesses which have been the backbone of many regional economies-and, I say quite unequivocally, to the agricultural life and fishing life of Gladstone and Bundaberg. We have proposed a compromise by way of a two-year phase-in of the BAS-claiming system. These amendments will be debated in upcoming legislation. Without anticipating that legislation, I understand that the changes will mean that eligible businesses, including farmers, fishers and truck drivers, will be able to elect to make a claim for early payment of fuel tax credits on a written form, as they do now, until 1 July 2008. They will still have to pay the excise up front but, by filling out this form at the time of purchasing their fuel, they will be able to claim back the rebate within a fortnight. That is significant if you are a threemonthly BAS payer. Businesses have until 31 December this year, as I understand it, to elect to take up this early payment option. I would certainly encourage all affected fishermen and businesses in my electorate to do so. Mr Fitzgibbon-What about after two years? What do they do then?",84
167,Mr NEVILLE,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"That is a good question. It is anticipated that having that time to phase in this system and having the effects of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park RAP ameliorated, ensuring the fishermen get their compensation package and their adjusted vessels back into new fisheries and the like, they will have two years to prepare for this and make cash flow arrangements. So it was a good question and I am happy to answer it. While I was in favour of the continuation of the existing system for fishermen because of this unique situation, I welcome the measure and thank the government for at least taking on board the concerns of commercial fishermen, farmers and owner-operators of other primary production areas who signal their concern about changing to the BAS system with regard to their tax. Businesses will need to report their fuel tax credit entitlements for the relevant tax period on the BAS but, in the meantime, during the phasein period the impact will be minimised and they will have some financial room to move. While not the ideal solution, I consider it a fair solution to a problem facing many of our primary producers. When you consider this in combination with the wider arc of this legislation, when fully implemented it will wipe $1.5 billion off the fuel bills of off-road users over the next six years and that will be significant to those sorts of people. When the legislation comes into full effect, fuel tax will be effectively applied only to fuel used in private vehicles and for certain private purposes and to fuel used on road in light vehicles for business purposes. In fact, it is estimated that the number of businesses and individuals eligible to claim fuel tax relief will rise from around $185,000 to $1.2 million. The point I make is that there have been some tough measures in this legislation and they have not all been what I would like for my people. But, if you take the totality of this package, quite apart from havingMr Windsor-It's rubbish!",86
168,Mr NEVILLE,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"It is not rubbish. This is well-negotiated and important stuff, Tony, and you know it. The current tax system applies only to diesel fuel used off-road in specified and narrowly defined primary production areas and on-road in heavy diesel vehicles. In fact, I think it would be fair to say that, up until the election of this government in 1996, it was unimaginable that one day all fuel used off-road in farming businesses would become tax free, including petrol used in farm vehicles and equipment which is currently not eligible for credit. That will all change with this legislation, which clearly indicates the government's intention that, over time, all off-road business users of all fuels will be eligible for fuel tax credit. From 1 July 2006 all fuels used on-road in heavy vehicles will be eligible for a partial credit. This will be of particular benefit to farming businesses, quite simply because most of the estimated 54,000 heavy petrol vehicles are located in regional and rural Australia. So that will be significant to your people too, Tony. Mr Fitzgibbon-How many?",87
169,Mr NEVILLE,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Fifty-four thousand heavy petrol vehicles. From 1 July 2008 that partial credit will be expanded to a full credit for petrol users in eligible primary production areas. Also from 1 July 2008, a 50 per cent credit will apply to all currently ineligible activities, and this will rise to a full credit in 2012. This means that by the time the changes are fully in place, by 1 July 2012, fuel tax will effectively apply only to the private use of fuel in private vehicles and certain off-road uses, the business use of fuel on-road in light vehicles and the business use of fuel in heavy vehicles to the extent of the applicable road user charge. Extending these rebates will in a practical sense mean that farmers will no longer have to be burdened by paperwork associated with keeping track of how much fuel they use in a range of eligible and ineligible activities. It will see an increase in their credits and a reduction in their office work. So, as well as significantly reducing this record keeping and compliance cost for business, these measures will simplify and reduce the amount of interaction between farmers and other primary producers and the Australian tax office, and I find that one of the great burdens for farmers and other primary producers is the amount of paperwork associated with running a rural or a maritime business. They come off their trawlers or off their tractors dog tired at God only knows what hour of the night and then have to sit down to paperwork. To increase their credits and reduce their paperwork to the extent that we can I think is a good thing. I thank the government for its assistance to our trawler operators along the east coast and I commend this bill to the House.",87
170,Ms HOARE,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I rise tonight to speak on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and cognate bill. The purpose of this legislation is to implement a system of credits to offset partially or fully the excise that some taxpayers pay on fuels and to lay the groundwork for extending the tax net to alternative fuels. All of us come to debates in this place with different approaches, and I understand that the members who have spoken so far on the Fuel Tax Bill have done so for a variety of reasons. We just heard the member for Hinkler talk about his constituents and the industries in his electorate. I heard the member for Lingiari talking earlier about the effect that fuel prices have on people who live in the remote parts of this country. I usually come to these debates with either an interest in the particular subject or a concern about how the legislation will have an effect on my constituents, and in this case I have come to it with both of those. When I saw the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006 listed for debate, I thought that this would be the perfect opportunity to talk about the rising cost of fuel how that affects my constituents. But as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as we research legislation sometimes it can be revealed how complex the issues are, and that is what I have found with this legislation-how complex the current system is and how complex it is still going to be even though it will be simplified a bit. It just emphasises the whole gamut of issues that the legislation addresses and how governments and oppositions need to be on top of that. To that end, I thank the member for Hunter for his assistance in providing all the information that is required for this particular legislation and talking us through the various complexities. The bill constitutes major reform of fuel tax in Australia. It will provide for a single system of fuel tax with associated credits; reductions in the incidence of fuel tax levied on taxable fuels; a staged introduction of a framework for the taxation of liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas from 1 July 2011; a staged reduction in tax assistance for biodiesel and domestic ethanol; and the linking of fuel credits to environmental standards. Most of these are welcomed by the opposition. The government actually released a white paper on this issue, back in 2004, which planned to have this new system in place by 1 July 2006. On 29 March this year, two years after the government's white paper was produced, the government finally introduced the Fuel Tax Bill, to be implemented on 1 July 2006. So somebody has been going through the shelves of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, come across this white paper, had a look at it and thought: ‘In 2004 we made a promise that we were going to introduce these changes by 1 July 2006. It's nearly that time so we'd better get a and move on.' Even so, we have seen the government circulating, two hours prior to this debate starting today, more amendments to this legislation. I said that the member for Hunter was on top of this legislation. It is very concerning to see that the government is not. The current arrangements for the taxation of fuel are highly complex and there has been scope for rationalisation. The taxation of petrol is based on a non-indexed excise. This bill does not change the taxation of petrol for basic household motor vehicle use, which a lot of my constituents would be very concerned to hear. There is currently a grant available for diesel fuel under the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. There is an on-road credit, which includes alternative fuels, for vehicles over 20 tonnes, for vehicles between 4½ and 20 tonnes and for vehicles operating outside or across metropolitan boundaries. There are off-road credits which apply to business usage. There is a fuel sales grant, under the Fuel Sales Grants Act, of 1c to 3c per litre of gasoline or diesel fuel in nonmetropolitan areas. There are remission certificates which apply to exempt commercial users, in industries like plastics and chemicals, from excise or customs duty on certain fuels. This legislation seeks to consolidate these measures into a single fuel tax regime with credits achieved through the BAS reporting system. Many users will effectively receive the same level of tax, albeit under different administration arrangements, but some users will face significant tax reductions and there will be higher tax for some on-road use. Aviation fuels are excluded from this fuel tax credits system. The member for Hunter has moved an amendment which covers seven points that the opposition is concerned about. Of those seven points, the third point addresses some of the points that I would like to make now. The legislation that is before us does not do anything to reduce Australia's dependence on foreign oil. The amendment: ... calls upon the Government to reduce our dependency on foreign oil and to promote: (a) existing alternatives like liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel; (b) emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from and stored electricity; and (c) future fuels, such as hydrogen as Labor has committed to in its Fuels Blueprint; That fuels blueprint was released on 19 October last year by Kim Beazley, the next Prime Minister of this country. Labor's third blueprint is titled Developing the Australian fuel industry. As Kim Beazley pointed out: We need national leadership to develop: - existing alternatives like liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel; - emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity; and - future fuels, such as hydrogen. A Beazley Labor government would reexamine the depreciation regime for gas production infrastructure and allow the selective use of flow-through share schemes for smaller operators. A Beazley Labor government would make alternative fuel vehicles tariff free, cutting up to $2,000 off the price of current hybrid cars; work with state and local government to give city traffic and parking advantages for these vehicles; and examine the granting of tax rebates for converting petrol cars to LPG. A Beazley Labor government would also conduct a feasibility study into a gas-to-liquids fuels plant in Australia, offer petroleum resources rent tax incentives for developers of gas fields which provide resources for gas-to-liquid fuels projects, examine a new infrastructure investment allowance for investment in Australian gas-to-liquid fuels infrastructure, develop a targeted funding scheme for research and development in this area, and work with industry to improve engine design and fuel quality standards. There is a huge opportunity for Australia arising from the biofuels and alternative fuels debate. We do have too much reliance on gas overseas oil, which is then reflected in the hefty prices that the mums and dads and grandmas and granddads of this country pay at the bowser every time they fill up their car's tank with petrol. However, this government has not embraced this opportunity, so this issue will be on the minds of all Australians at the next election. People are sick and tired of paying up to $1.50 a litre-and that is in my region, let alone regions in remote Australia-for petrol, which will probably go up to close to $2 before the next election. While they are paying that price for petrol, they are losing money from other areas of their family's budget such as children's sporting activities and air conditioning for the home. Different family activities might have to go by the wayside because parents have to pay more to put petrol in their car to undertake day-today living. So I think a Beazley Labor government's approach to biofuels and alternative fuels will be supported by the Australian public. On the question of fuel prices: we have just come out of the long weekend holiday, when many Australian families take to the road to make the most of a three-day long weekend. As we see most times coming up to public holidays-Easter, school holidays, the long weekend in June-we saw the fuel prices soar. We have been encouraging the government to give the ACCC more powers to monitor fuel prices, to make hard decisions on the spikes in fuel prices and to punish those oil companies or petrol station owners who take advantage of these particular vulnerabilities in our community. On the World Today on Friday, 9 June, Brendan Trembath was interviewing Lachlan MCIntosh, who is the Executive Director of the Australian Automobile Association. Lachlan said: Well, we saw a big spike in the Eastern states yesterday, up10 or 12 cents a litreThat is 10c or 12c a litre in one day. He said: We didn't see the same rise in Perth. Perth doesn't have a long weekend coming, so their prices are 10 or 12 cents a litre cheaper. I hope as a result our analysis that doesn't drive the price in Perth up, but it is sort of pretty annoying. The newspapers were full of similar stories. An article in the Brisbane Sunday Mail on 11 June talked about the price peaking at $1.35 for a litre of unleaded petrol: The surge prompted fresh calls for a thorough inquiry into the fuel industry with both the RACQ and the Queensland Consumers' Association demanding a vigorous probe by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ... The RACQ's Ken Willett said: ... motorists were being charged six cents a litre more than was justified by movements in the international price of oil. Going from one end of the country to the other, the editorial in the Herald Sun, titled ‘Pumped dry', said: ... service station owners say that some people are trying to swap mobile phones and wrist watches for fuel. That is a disgraceful situation that we are in, that families cannot afford to put petrol in their cars and are going to trade off things that they now take for granted, whether it be their wristwatches or their mobile phones. In response to this the member for Hunter, our shadow Assistant Treasurer, put out a statement about John Howard's refusal to grant the ACCC the powers it needs to scrutinise petrol prices, saying that the Prime Minister does not treat the concerns of motorists seriously. In 1997 the Trade Practices Act was amended to remove the power of the ACCC to continually monitor petrol prices. The Prime Minister cannot just say to the ACCC: ‘Have a casual look at it over the weekend. Let me know if you find anything untoward.' The ACCC does not actually have the powers to be able to do anything about that. As the member for Hunter stated, the of Treasurer should be writing to Graeme Samuel of the ACCC to demand that they ‘begin thorough monitoring of petrol prices as provided for under Part VIIA s95G(6) of the Trade Practices Act'. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer will not do this. The Australian public keeps getting slugged at the bowser because of this. This legislation goes no way to addressing any of these problems. Labor supports the basic structure of this bill as a more sustainable basis for fuel taxation in Australia. In particular, Labor supports a revised timetable for excise rises for alternative fuels. This was a concession for these emerging industries that was won after significant pressure from Labor. However, there were aspects of the bill that appeared to be problematic. One of those in particular was in relation to claiming the rebate either quarterly or yearly, as some businesses would, because that is when they currently put in their business activity statements. Labor will continue to work with affected sectors and will continue to seek some relief from these provisions. We will continue to try and work so that these provisions do not adversely affect the industry sectors in the years to come, as these regimes are being phased in.",87
171,Mr WINDSOR,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I put out a press release in my electorate last week saying that this was possibly the worse piece of legislation that I had seen in 15 years of politics. I will elaborate on that in a moment. One of the things the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and cognate bill do, particularly at this time in our history, is send so many mixed messages to a number of industries, and particularly fuel users generally, as to the future of renewable energies. There is also the principle of taxing energy as a source of revenue. Before elaborating on that particular issue I would like to read to the chamber-and I am delighted to see so many in the gallery to listen to this speech-an article from the Chicago Tribune of 19 May 2006: ‘Big 3 big on ethanol expansion'. Mr Ripoll-There's so much noise, we can't hear you; you'll have to speak up!",91
172,Mr WINDSOR,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I know there are a number in the gallery who are very keen on hearing this. The article said: WASHINGTON-The Big Three automakers pressed Congress on Thursday to help make ethanol fuels more widely available, saying that would be an immediate step toward lessening US. dependence on foreign oil. Leaders of General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group appealed to lawmakersthe legislatorsfor incentives to increase the number of gas stations offering blends of the corn-based fuel. “If we want a game changer, and a game changer in very short term and in big numbers, then ethanol is a very good play for this country,” said Ford's chairman and chief executive, Bill Ford. The executives endorsed a plan to have renewable fuels meet 25 percent of the nation's transportation energy needs by 2025. That is what is happening in the United States. Another thing that is happening in the United States is that something like 20 per cent of the US corn crop this year will be turned to renewable energies, particularly ethanol. Some people who are not engaged in agriculture would not realise what 20 per cent of the US corn crop actually means. The United States produces something like 300 million tonnes of corn annually. I think the projected amount this year is about 285 million tonnes. Australia produces about 30 million tonnes of grain, sometimes a little bit more. Twenty per cent of 300 million tonnes means that 60 million tonnes of corn is being transferred from the grain market into the energy market. That is what the United States is doing. We are introducing legislation such as this under the guise of it being a new way of looking at taxation credits-that is, credits, not taxation in itself. This legislation is about taxing energy, taxing fuel, taxing the use of fuel, taxing further down the track the use of renewable energies and bringing into the tax net some of the natural gases-that is, the compressed natural gases, the LPGs. That is what this legislation is about. We are doing nothing to address some of the major issues that are confronting our nation, at a time when the Prime Minister and others are making great play of having an energy debate in this country-particularly in relation to nuclear energy. I am not afraid to have that debate. But why are we introducing legislation of this sort when we are trying to make up our mind on our long-term needs and after the sudden recognition that there are greenhouse gas problems in the world? We need to look at the long-term need for cleaner fuels, we need to look at the discharge of carbon dioxide and other small particle emissions and we need to preserve the globe for future generations. But we are introducing legislation such as this, which in effect penalises renewable energy. It does very little to encourage a phase-in period; it absolutely discriminates against biodiesel in 75 per cent of the diesel market, the heavy vehicle market and the farm sector market; and it patently discriminates against a renewable energy source other than the five per cent diesel blend. That is what we in this nation are doing. I believe it is quite possibly one of the worse pieces of legislation that I have ever seen. It amazes me that someone for whom I have a great regard, the member for Hinkler, could allow such legislation to come into the parliament and then say: ‘Oh, it's not quite we would have liked. There is a compromise in this, but we've had a significant win in deferring the use of the BAS to generate the excise from farmers and others for two years.' I cannot believe the National Farmers Federation and a group that I was a member of for many years, the NSW Farmers Association, are welcoming a deferment of a hanging. Two weeks ago those groups were saying: ‘This is dreadful. We need to do something about this.' There are cash flow implications for the farm sector in moving away from the current system. The current system is that those who do not pay tax have to pay tax and then claim back again that tax that they do not have to pay. That is how the system works. The manufacturer or importer pays the tax when it comes in. We had this absurd system to start with, where a tax is paid and then it is rebated further on. The existing system is such that, when a farmer for instance has fuel delivered, they can almost immediately make application for the reimbursement of the rebate. The change that is still in the legislation-and we hear it is going to be changed-is that the BAS would be used as a means of rebating the diesel rebate, the 38c a litre, as we see with GST at the moment. In some cases that would take at least three months and have enormous cash flow implications. The government, under great pressure, I am told, has decided that it will be deferring that decision until after the next election. That might get the National Farmers Federation and some others off the hook, but the country members of the government stand condemned for allowing legislation such as this to come into this parliament. A compromise of this nature is by no means sufficient. There are a number of other issues in this bill. At a time when fuel prices are skyrocketing and having massive implications for all as Australians, particularly country Australians, where you do not have the option of public transport and you have distance to contend with, the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme is removed as of 1 July. For those who do not know, the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was put in place, quite rightly, by the government in 2000 to neutralise the negative impacts of a higher bowser price on country motorists, as compared to their city cousins, so that they would not be paying a greater GST on their fuel purchases. The National Farmers Federation, the National Party and many others lauded that at the time. I was in the state parliament at the time, and I thought: ‘At least they're trying to equalise it. It's a positive thing that country people won't be penalised.' This legislation removes that. As of 1 July, country people will pay more GST at the bowser if their retail price is higher than that of their city cousins, which it always is. They do not have the benefits of the competitive process and some of the benefits of fuel dumping from the refineries that occur from time to time. Country people do not have those benefits. Country people will pay from 1c to 3c a litre more for their fuel because of the removal of Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. I do not think that is fair. I am also critical of the National Farmers Federation. During that debate, which took place last year, the National Farmers Federation were again dragged out to support the government on an issue. They wandered into the building with press releases saying, ‘We endorse the government's initiative to remove the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme'-this is the Farmers Federation we are talking about-‘the neutraliser of the impact of GST on country people, because we believe it was an inefficient system and wasn't getting to the people who were buying the fuel.' Surprise, surprise, the National Farmers Federation are supposed to represent farmers. Farmers are able to claim their fuel usage through the system if it is for production. It is a cost of their business. The National Farmers Federation were prepared to accept an increase in fuel prices for all their nonmembers, knowing it was not going to impact on their members. That is a disgraceful act by that body, to give the government the sign-off on an increase in fuel prices to country motorists. A couple of days ago, the member for Gwydir made mention on ABC radio in my electorate that the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme was an inefficient system, and there were various studies that indicated that and some that did not. If it was an inefficient system, why have we been subsidising the oil companies to the extent of $270 million for six years? For six years, there has been a transfer of income. If this has not been getting to the motorists by way of the equalisation of the impact of the GST, why has nearly $1½ billion been siphoned off to the fuel companies? That is the argument that is being used in relation to this. If it was inefficient at the start, why did they introduce it? Why did they not look at another way of it coming into effect? I have mentioned the BAS deferment of the rebate for two years, when it will impact on BAS arrangements. But I would like to speak on renewable energy issues in this legislation. This legislation puts in place a platform that will wipe out the previously promised differential between imported and domestically produced ethanol and biodiesel. It will wipe that out. The government are saying they are encouraging the domestic investment in biofuels et cetera. The potential for the development of that industry is not being developed. They know that in a few years time the imported product will be on the same playing field as the domestic product and that this will essentially mean the death of any infant industry in relation to renewable energy. The legislation, as I said earlier, absolutely discriminates against biodiesel blend in the farm and heavy vehicle markets, which are 75 per cent of the market. I intend to move a number of amendments tomorrow when the third reading proceeds, and one of those will be to adjust the transition period for renewable energies-ethanol, biodiesel et cetera. That was put in place in 2003 or 2004. There were various voluntary codes or agreements the Prime Minister had with the fuel companies. They have just been a stalling tactic from the fuel companies to make sure that no viable farm based industries, particularly ethanol and biodiesel industries, get underway. I will be moving that the transition riod be increased so that there is a greater period of excise freedom for investment in this industry. As I mentioned earlier, 20 per cent of US corn crop is going to renewable fuels. I am not a great fan of President Bush, but he has woken up to this. Rather than being absolutely dependent on the Middle East and other parts of the world for fuel needs, tralia should be looking at what we can do cut that corner in relation to our balance payments imbalance. We are allocating about $1 billion per month to the balance of payments deficit from the importation of fuel. Domestically, we used to produce 32,000 megalitres. That has been reduced to 19,000; we import now. In the past five years, imports have gone up from 17,500 megalitres to 30,000 megalitres, so you can see why we are having difficulty with our balance of payments. Brazil is expanding its ethanol production-it is producing ethanol from sugar, of course-at the rate of one Australian sugar industry a year. There has been a quite dramatic increase in canola prices. I thought would have been the duty of the National Farmers Federation to try to put more money in farmers' pockets. They have done nothing to promote renewable energies and the impact they can have. The European biodiesel market, for instance, has had an enormous impact on the global price regime for oil seed, particularly canola. That is the impact we could be experiencing here. What we do in this nation is to grow grain at very low prices to enter corrupt world markets-and we have seen the fiasco in Iraq in recent months. We grow that grain and then take it out into a corrupt market. We receive some money for it. We then take out some of that money and enter another corrupt market-the oil market-which is conpetrolled by very few people. Why don't we cut the corner and create all those regional opportunities for investment and job creation-the very things that we talked about the here today in question time? Why don't we address these issues? The production of renewable energies by using things that our Australian farmers do well could have an enormous impact on the balance of payAusments. There could be a renewable energy to source for our farming communities, grain of producers, sugar producers and others within Australia. Whereas every other country that is producing ethanol or biodiesel has some protection at home, we have introduced legislation which will expose our producers to that market. I listened to the member for Gilmore, and I have a lot of time for her. One of the few ethanol plants is in her electorate. I encourage members of the government to look at some of the matters she raised in her speech. I would encourage her to urge her Senate colleagues to really stand up on these issues and to speak out against the unfairness and bias directed at renewable energy providers. it I would encourage the Prime Minister to revisit this issue. He has shown that, with logical argument, he will revisit issues-and we saw that with the Snowy Hydro. However, I do not think the Prime Minister is fully on top of this issue, which has been run through Treasury and has come into this parliament. Most people on the government benches do not really understand the longer term implications. Another issue, which I think the member for Hinkler mentioned-I do not want to verbal the member for Hinkler; perhaps it was one of the previous speakers-was the government's freezing of the fuels excise at 38c a litre. There is a nasty little fact in the back of this legislation that no-one to my knowledge has mentioned yet-a little thing called a ‘road user charge'. It will be up for annual change, which will be determined through ministerial discretion. Is this the back door to again ratcheting up the income from excise? The government has made great play that it has frozen the 38c a litre excise. Is this road user charge and the capacity of the minister of the day to change itobviously in an upward direction-the way things will go in the future? In conclusion, I urge senators on the government benchesbecause the only senator that I have heard make sense in relation to this is Barnaby Joyce-to look seriously at this legislation and change it so it will actually work. (Time expired)",91
173,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Like the member for New England, I too am amazed at the number of the people in the gallery tonight. I am always appreciative of that, so I thank him for pointing that out to us. I rise to speak on the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006. I think this is a very important bill. It is important not only because of the issues it raises but also because of what it does not do and what the government has not done to properly deal with fuel and the fuel industry more broadly. That said, I broadly support the intent of this bill but I also support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Hunter as the correct way forward on this critical issue. The government, as in so many other important areas of public policy, has been slow to respond to issues which affect the daily lives of so many people, in particular the price of fuel. It has also been slow to respond to the challenges facing this nation with regard to the fuels industry. I will address these issues in this debate and will deal with the bill more directly. This bill amends several acts in order to implement the Fuel Tax Credits Scheme. It continues a major change of the fuel taxation system in Australia, which other speakers have pointed out. I also make the point in my contribution that the current arrangements for fuel taxation in this country are exceptionally complex and difficult to work with. The explanatory memorandum states: These Bills provide a single system of fuel tax credits to remove or reduce the incidence of fuel tax levied on taxable fuels, and a framework for the taxation of gaseous fuels from 1 July 2011, when fuel tax is levied on liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas for the first time. The fuel tax credits system effectively means that all taxable fuel acquired, manufactured or imported for use in off-road applications for business purposes will become tax free over time. Under the fuel tax credits system, fuel tax relief will be expanded for fuel used in road transport. The amendments should generally simplify the administration of the existing system of grants for fuel use. The move to apply the administrative rules that apply to other indirect tax laws to the proposed Fuel Tax Credits Scheme should also assist with administration. As I said, this is a move in the right direction but leaves unattended some of the more critical issues of the cost of fuel for ordinary people and a number of other critical issues involved in this matter. Labor has long supported the basic reform program. In fact, Labor has led this debate and has advocated reform in the oil and fuels industry for some time. Labor has been instrumental in providing a longer phase-in for the introduction of fuel tax for liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas to assist the development of these industries. Labor also supports the requirement for environmental requirements to be met by major fuel users as part of the fuel taxation regime. The second reading amendment of the shadow minister, the member for Hunter, states: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for failing to properly consult with commercial fuel users on the appropriate model for payment of fuel tax; (2) condemns the government for circulating major amendments less than two hours before debate on the Bill is to be resumed; (3) calls upon the Government to reduce our dependency on foreign oil and to promote: (a) existing alternatives like liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel; (b) emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from and stored electricity; and (c) future fuels, such as hydrogen as Labor has committed to in its Fuels Blueprint; (4) condemns the Government for ignoring the impact of rising petrol prices on Australian families; (5) condemns the Government for increasing petrol prices in regional Australia through abolition of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme at a time of very high petrol prices; (6) condemns the Government for failing to strengthen the Trade Practices Act to protect competition in the petroleum industry; and (7) condemns the Government for failing to guarantee that the money saved as a result of the abolition of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme will not be specifically directed to roads in regional, rural and remote Australia”. These are all sensible things that the government should be doing of its own volition; they are not things that the opposition should have to thrust upon the government. In discussing the detail of this bill, there is an opportunity for me to range over a number of areas, including some of Labor's initiatives in the fuel industry. Firstly, I would like to point out that Labor understands that government does have a significant role to play in helping to ease the pain for Australian families at the petrol bowser. This is no longer a simple issue of cost; it has become a critical issue in families' budgets and how they plan to spend their weekly, fortnightly or monthly pay packets. Labor and the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, put the Prime Minister on notice over petrol prices last June. Labor has put forward a plan specifically to tackle this issue, but before I go into what our plan includes, I make the point that something posigas tive, something concrete, something definite can be done. If the government claims, as it often does, that it does not control the levers of the price of petrol and that it is a global market-it talks about price parity and a whole range of things-I would say to the government: ‘You are just not trying hard enough. You just do not care enough; you are not willing enough; you are not doing the enough.' There is something that can be done. There are a range of measures that can be brought forward. Labor's plan includes, in particular, applying the competition blowtorch to the industry by strengthening the Trade Practices Act to prevent abuse of market power. The pricing issues and the abuse that takes place in the fuels industry are significant. You do not need to be an expert in this matter to understand it. Most, if not all, consumers understand what happens at the bowser in profiteering and pricing issues. The second thing that the government could be doing and that Labor plans to do is to have the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, ACCC, investigate petrol prices and report every six months on price movements-particularly in regional Australia, in areas where there is significant movement and significant cost to so many people in the bush. Thirdly, Labor would modernise the 25-year-old regulatory regime for the petrol fuel sector, to promote competition and protect independent service station operators and franchisees. This is something that I am particularly concerned about and interested in. If the government continues to talk about competition as the great driver of downward pressure on prices, then it should promote fair competition, and it should do it through a fair, modernised regulatory regime-something that can actually have some impact. I will take this opportunity to mention something that the member for New England mentioned and which I am sure others will as well. I refer to the comments made by Senator Barnaby Joyce, who has been quoted as warning ‘the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006, which introduces a new regulatory scheme for petrol, will drive independent service station owners out of business'. I do not think that is healthy for the country; in fact, I do not think that is very healthy for the fuels sector or for service stations in this country. More importantly, I do not think it is very healthy for the consumer. I think less competition is a bad thing. I think less choice in the petrol station you go to is generally a bad thing. Senator Barnaby Joyce, a coalition member, agrees with that. He thinks it is a bad thing and he says that what this government is doing is bad-in fact, he believes it is so bad that he has threatened to vote against the government and to cross the floor unless amendments are made to the Trade Practices Act to further safeguard independent fuel retailers. I say to Barnaby Joyce, ‘Hear, hear!' He should be out there condemning this government on this bill, because it just does not do enough, and some of the things that it does go in the wrong direction. It does not go anywhere near far enough to protect independent service station operators and franchisees. The final measure in Labor's plan is to reduce our reliance on imported oil and to grow an Australian fuel industry. This is a very important part of our plan because it is another area that the government just feels too comfortable and relaxed with and does absolutely nothing on. Not only do we need to promote competition and ensure a strong regulatory regime; we need to ensure that there is a viable, strong Australian fuel industry that is supported by government in the right manner. We need to invest in alternatives and support innovation. We need to ensure that we as a nation do the right thing. I will come back again to the member for New England because he mentioned hundreds of millions of dollars in grants going to the fuel industry. This is an area where the government could seriously look at how that money is spent, the areas it is spent on and what innovations could come out of that investment from the national government in the fuel sector. Labor's plan is to provide a real future for the biofuels industry by providing a government fleet market for ethanol blends, to set an example and help grow the industry. I think you have to lead by example in an area like this. There has been a lot of scaremongering about biofuels, about ethanol blends and about what they do and do not do to your vehicle. Government could lead by example by using ethanol blends in all government vehicles. The Queensland government is leading the way in this and doing a very good job of it, and there is a slow but steady take-up of ethanol blends. I think that is something positive that should be supported, because it goes to the heart of a range of things that our plan for the fuel industry does. It is about the long term. It is about investing in the future. It is about fuel security. It is about being fuel independent over the long term. It is about building industry. is about looking to the future. These are the things that are lacking in this government's approach to the fuel industry more broadly. I also want to take this opportunity to talk about alternative fuels. The Australian Labor Party also has a plan to develop a diversified Australian fuel industry. Labor knows that Australia must develop and use those fuels that will become cheaper in the future, that are sustainable and renewable. We must look to the future. We must have fuel security. We must be independent. Australia must foster demand for new Australian fuels and fuel technologies, with governments at all levels playing a role. I think that is also key here. We need agreements between local, state and federal governments, particularly in these areas. Australia needs national leadership to develop this, though. It can do it in three ways: by existing alternatives like liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel; by emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity; and by looking towards future fuels, such as hydrogen. There are options for government. Government needs to be interested. That is the key point I am making here: unless government takes an interest, nothing happens at all. Australia needs to develop the technologies to make it happen. Our transport fuel markets need a fresh blast of competitioncompetition that, in the end, will drive development. To this end, a future Labor government will work with the states to steadily and sensibly convert public transport to alternative fuel usage and to ensure that the Commonwealth government car fleets run on alternative fuels. As I said previously, the states are already moving in that direction, and I congratulate them for that. Again, this is an area where the federal government It could show some leadership and flow that on to other areas. A future Labor government will also work with state and local government to give city traffic and parking advantages for alternative fuel vehicles or hybrid vehicles and the like. There must be rewards for people who do the right thing, who are using alternatives and trying to make a difference. If you do not reward people, they will not necessarily take up those advantages. Also, a future Labor government will make alternative fuel vehicles tariff free, cutting up to $2,000 off the price of current hybrid vehicles. Again, you must reward people for making the right choices. Finally, a future Labor government will examine the granting of tax rebates for converting petrol cars to LPG. This has been a pet issue of mine for some time. I just cannot understand why, in the current fuels environment, government does not get more involved in a readily available resource, in something that could be easily dealt with and in trying to assist people in converting petrol cars to LPG and looking at other incentives. These measures over a fixed period would help spark consumer interest and raise awareness of alternative fuel choices. In the end, we need to give people choices-not the rhetoric of choice but real choices-at the petrol bowser, where they can decide on the types of fuels that they will be using and the sorts of prices that they will pay. For example, some 500,000 Australian vehicles at the moment run on autogas. In fact, car conversions from petrol to LPG have risen 14 per cent in the last 12 months. That is pretty obvious, given the high petrol prices. Certainly, in years gone by, the percentages of people converting cars over were going backwards because there was just no incentive for people to move in that direction. The NRMA announced last year that its fleet of 400 service vans would move across to LPG, cutting 60 per cent off its $2 million fuel bill annually. There should be a message in that to a lot of businesses to look at the cost of conversion and the sorts of fuel savings they could enjoy by moving in that direction. In this regard, an example can also be found within the State Transit Authority of New South Wales, which has 404 compressed natural gas powered buses in Sydney. CNG powered buses are quieter than diesel powered buses. Obviously CNG makes a great alternative to regular fuelsand CNG is an Australian resource, whereas diesel is largely imported. State chases $30 million worth of diesel fuel annually, so I think people can quickly see the sorts of advantages and savings that can be made by moving in this direction. There is now a willingness to use alternative fuels that has not previously existed in Australia. The LPG industry itself has set a target to increase the use of autogas to 10 cent of all motor vehicles by 2010. If only the Howard government, the federal government, would be as decisive and back it with programs and incentives. Consumers are also showing a strong interest in the emerging technologies of hybrid cars, for example. Last year, over 1,000 hybrid electric cars like the Honda Civic and the Toyota Prius were sold in Australia. But if we want to see real numbers of people driving these cars on our roads then the federal government ought to take an interest and look at how they deal with this area. These are small but significant steps. If consumers are prepared to embrace new technologies, they need to be given real choices by government. They need to be given assistance in making those industries work and in making those choices work for them as well. I would like to speak just a little further on the need to develop new industries in this country, specifically about gas to liquids and coal to liquids technology, which I think are exceptionally important in the current debate. The Labor Party has always been a great supporter of GTL and CTL. In fact, my colleague the member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, has been speaking about this issue for quite some time-and for good reason, because it is in the best interests of the nation. Establishing new nation-building industries is obviously not easy. It requires leadership. If this government is not prepared to provide it then the Labor Party is prepared to Transit pur- and will do so. Unfortunately, as I have said at a number of points in my contribution, the federal government are seriously asleep at the wheel on this issue. They turn to the fact that it is just a global market and it should be left to global market forces to drive all of these matters. They are simply wrong. In fact, some people per would remember that about five years ago Senator Nick Minchin, the then Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, appointed a GTL Taskforce to investigate the feasibility and benefits of establishing a GTL industry in Australia. That task force came up with this conclusion: Provision of common user infrastructure is a legitimate way in which Australian governments could facilitate the establishment of a GTL fuels industry. Five years later, though, there has been no action. It was a good report with some sensible recommendations-something the federal government could invest in and do something about-but five years later: no action. Obviously there is no imperative from government to deal with the issue of fuels. The task force also highlighted the potential significance of a GTL industry to Australia's economy. It said: These benefits would be of national strategic nificance to Australia ... The cost of any governprovisions ment intervention must be considered against the potential benefits. Again, that is wise counsel, which, unfortunately, has been ignored by the government. As has been pointed out by Labor's resources spokesman, the potential benefits go beyond unlocking new resource wealth and creating new industry, more jobs and more experts. They include the opportunity for Australia to address this most pressing of problems: our future transport and fuel security. In the final few minutes I have I would like to make mention of a couple of other points in relation to fuels generally. In my view, the price of petrol has gone beyond what it costs to get to work and to go on a Sunday drive. It is now as critical to people as the underlying cost of their mortgage and as critical-and watched as significantly-as an interest rate rise, because the impact of fuel prices today on the family budget is as significant as a quarter per cent rise in interest rates. Families are under a lot of budgetary pressure. While the government crows about a strong economy, most families are living well but are at breaking point. Although there are low interest rates in Australia-comparatively high for the rest of the world-families cannot quite seem to manage. If people were to lose their job for just four weeks, most would be in serious trouble, much more trouble than they would have been when interest rates were, for a very brief period, at 17 per cent, and I think the government ought to look at that very closely.

174,Mr HATTON,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"We are talking about very complex legislation in this cognate debate on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and the associated Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006. The sigreason it is complex is that the number of that are involved are significant. Also, there is a series of interleaved movements so that, over time, the changes that are indicated, which are outlined as a reform package, will be undertaken in different years, finishing by about 2012, so that a final, new fuel taxing regime will be incorporated. It has been indicated that one of the alternatives to undertaking this set of steps, which replaces the government's former scheme, was to simply introduce a GST on fuel. Why didn't the government do it? Instead of a 10 per cent GST, I would hazard a guess that, in order to keep it in line with the higher taxation level on fuels across the board, there would have had to have been a second rate of GST. For those people in business it would have been much simpler to introduce the idea that business inputs could be taken into account and that fuels, whether diesel, liquid natural gas, LPG or petrol, could be taken as a business input. Under the GST system they would be effectively put aside, because you could take account of that as part of the costs and, even if it were at a different level, for a business that would be easier and simpler. For the government it would be harder, because it would introduce a layer of complexity. Instead of that, we have this new regime which takes us almost to segue with the government's existing legislation through to this new set of reforms over an extended period. I will outline just simply what the major reform is. The bill constitutes major reform of fuel taxation in Australia, providing for a single system of fuel tax and associated credits; reductions in the incidence of fuel tax levied on taxable fuels; staged introduction of a framework for the taxation of liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas from 1 July 2011; staged reduction in tax assistance for biodiesel and domestic ethanol; and linking of fuel credits to environmental standards. In fact, the actual implementation is extended over a significant time. In their paper Securing Australia's energy future, produced in 2004, the government indicated that excise on burner fuels would be removed at the start of the next financial year, on 1 July 2006; on 1 July 2008 a 50 per cent credit would be introduced for the off-road use of taxable fuels in activities not previously eligible for credits; and three years on, in July 2011, effective excise would apply on all fuels used in internal combustion engines. I will come back to that matter later because it deals not only with petrol and diesel but also with uefied petroleum gas and others. On 1 July 2012 full credit would be extended to all business use of all taxable fuels in all offroad activities and on 1 July 2015-I was three years out-final effective fuel excise rates would apply to all taxable fuels, includtion. ing a 50 per cent discount for alternative els. In terms of the government's intention, it is a case of moving from here, or where we were previously, forward to 2015 to a new regime-moving from one set of energy credits in their previous legislation to this new fuel regime. But it also involves taking a category of alternative fuels not previously subject to excise and imposing excise on them-that is in 2011, and that is significant. I want to come back to that later, because it relates to the broader question of alternative fuels in Australia and to the significant investments that have been made in Western Australia by a number of companies in liquid natural gas and, in particular, to the investments that have been made near Barrow Island, where we have the biggest, most significant liquid natural gas find in Australia's history. The order of magnitude of the fields involved is quite staggering, and how that energy resource is to be treated and how long it will last is of immense significance. That is not specifically dealt with here except to bring it into this excise regime. The government say that they want to simplify the whole process. They made a series of announcements in 2003 and 2004 of a series of schemes. It will be a long process, because we are looking at a nine-year period for the changeover. There will be differential impacts on various parts of the transport industry, which is already suffering significantly with the cost of fuel. In my electorate of Blaxland we have a large number of heavy haulage companiesliq- for instance, Thomas National Transport at Villawood. I have spoken to members of the union there, and also to the manager, about the government's independent contractors bill, which I think is yet to come before usand I will be speaking later on that legislaThe people working there told me that fu- they were under a great deal of pressure because they are employees of the company but have had to buy their own rigs and pay for their own fuel. Diesel, which once was very cheap, is now extremely dear and, at the very top of the range, it is not subject to the discounting that you normally get. That is a great impost on them and a great uncertainty. As well as that, they had the uncertaintywhich has now been clarified for a year-of what their future status would be and also the uncertainty of working out the effects of inflation, increasing interest rates and so on. They know that certainty in the area of fuel tax and excise is important and significant. They also know that they tend to be left out a lot in the consideration of the impact on ordinary working people. As owner operators these people have invested a great deal of money into their businesses and they are hit with a whole range of measures. I trust that they will not be detrimentally hit by this. Of course, if in a year or so they end up as independent contractors as a result of another bill the government might bring forward-the government has said people in New South Wales and Victoria will not be incorporated-they will be on the significantly increased end of these changes. We are supporting this bill and the series of complex changes involved. But we are also saying, ‘Hang on a minute, this is not just about tax change; it is about a whole series of other measures.' I support the amendment which the shadow minister and member for Hunter, Mr Fitzgibbon, has put forward. I want to read a part of the amendment to give you a flavour of what this amendment is about-and I will return to another section of it. The amendment states that the opposition: (1) condemns the Government for failing to properly consult with commercial fuel users on the appropriate model for payment of fuel tax; (2) condemns the government for circulating major amendments less than two hours before debate on the Bill is to be resumed; That is not the right process, but it happens again and again. The government has been in power for over 10 years. It has not properly consulted all the people who will be directly impacted, despite the fact that these measures have been under way for such a significant time. It is a further indication of the manner in which this government treats the opposition and the parliament. Where major and significant changes are to be brought in, the government pumps them into the House without consultation with the opposition and without time for the opposition to adequately look at them. Then the government says, ‘You can support the bill and you can support these amendments as well, without adequate time to make an assessment of them.' I do not think that is an appropriate way for the government to conduct its business. It is discourteous to the parliament and its members. In fact, it is not part of good government or good governance. But there are much deeper problems here. In the third element of the amendment, the opposition: (3) calls upon the Government to reduce our dependency on foreign oil and to promote: (a) existing alternatives like liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel; (b) emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity; and (c) future fuels, such as hydrogen as Labor has committed to in its Fuels Blueprint; We have a blueprint; we have a plan. We have thought about these issues of Australia's energy needs. We have supported companies coming in from overseas, investing in Australia, making significant finds and trying to exploit those finds. We have also encouraged Australian initiatives to do exactly the same thing, and we have encouraged Australian shareholders and Australian workers to be part of that. I and other Labor members accompanied the shadow minister and member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, to look at the Jansz field-the biggest fuels infrastructure project Australia has yet seen-and associated fields just off Barrow Island. It just so happens that Claude Killick, the president of the Condell Park branch of the ALP in my electorate, went to Barrow Island before I did. He did a number of things during his working life. He was on a small ship, captained by an American, with other Australians on the crew. They were looking for oil off Western Australia in the 1960s. The ship was beached on Barrow Island and it took them a significant time to get it off. After they did get the ship off, they continued to look for oil reserves around that area. Claude Killick told me that he saw in the 1960s the immense gas fields around Barrow Island. He was privy to this because the people who worked the seismographs were able to tell him what was happening. He saw the Jansz fields that are being exploited-our most significant infrastructure development yet-and the associated Gorgon fields close to Barrow Island. The company behind this is already committed to further exploration in closely associated fields. The expectation is that this particular development on its own will allow Australia to be independent of gas from overseas for in the order of 60 years and possibly 100 years. We know how significant our export of LNG has been over the past five to six years-big contracts have been won, at a cost certainly, with China, and with Japan and other countries-but we also know that continued investment by Australians and overseas investors to develop resources such as in the Gorgon and Jansz fields and the associated fields up the West Australian coast is immensely important. It is important that the government has a plan not only to tax in a simpler way but to further explore and exploit that. The government needs to have a plan to go beyond imposing excise on fuels that did not have excise. That is what it will be doing come 2011 in its program. If you look at the specifics of it, the excise will ply to all fuels using an internal combustion engine, including concessional excise for biodiesel, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas. The effective excise rates will increase over five equal annual steps, reaching their final rates on 1 July 2015. This is part of a regime to take taxing in this area from the old into the new era over a nine-year period-it has been conceived prior to that-but it actually complicates the whole issue of how we might most wisely use our greatest resources. The Prime Minister for his own ends is attempting to start up a debate on nuclear power. We have immense resources of coal and we are a major exporter. Our future is in finding a way to more effectively use and sell cleaner coal-a coal where its CO2 product can be sequestered. Though not associated with coal, the project on Barrow Island to do the proving for sequestering CO2 from those liquid natural gas finds has already cost $36 million. One of the things that companies have to put their money into to be able to march forward is in this problematic area of climatic change. The significant problem for Australia is to clean up our coal for export to secure long-term sales not only to existing customers but to future customers and in a way where climate change is not affected in the way it is now. One of the ways we can more effectively do that is by using gas, which we have in immense abundance, as recent finds have demonstrated and as Woodside in its activities in Western Australia in the fields further to the north has indicated. That immense richness is not incorporated into the centre of Australia's fuel use. We are still highly dependent on diesel and petrol. We are still in a situation created in the sixties with the development of the Bass Strait fields and others apand with the later move towards world parity pricing for fuel in order to encourage companies to find more petroleum and other fuels in Australia. We have not appropriately looked at how fuels might be more differentially taxed and how Australia might move forward in a planned way to less reliance upon petrol and diesel and greater reliance upon what we have in most abundance. We certainly have coal in great abundance, but we also have liquid natural gas and its associated forms in tremendous abundance. So it would be natural for Australia, would it not, to encourage its use in cars and trucks and other forms of transport by having an appropriate tax regime instead of imposing extra excise and boosting that up over a period five years or so? We should have a plan which says that, given our immense riches, one of the key things Australia should do to decrease the use of current fuels is to move to use natural gas in its variety of forms, ticularly in transport. The second thing we could do is to purify the output of existing power stations by encouraging a far greater use of natural gas as the agent for a brighter burn for those coal fired power stations. The technology is there. It is being done in some places. We need to look at the whole question of retrofitting technology to reduce emissions of CO2 which are creating climatic problems. What we have in most abundance, coal and gas, could symmetrically be used to decrease the problems we are creating for the environment. That kind of planning and that kind of thinking is outside not just these tax changes but the whole purview of the government in this area. They have not planned forward. They have planned how to cut and hack back and let the market have its run, as the member for Oxley said, but they have not positively worked on a taxation scheme to change the way tax is done or on a plan for the future energy needs of Australia.

175,Ms OWENS,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006. This is an important debate, but it is a very small part of a much larger debate which this nation should be having centring around the use of energy and the way we develop our energy resources for the future. We have touched on some of those issues in our second reading amendment. Energy is an issue which is being debated widely in the community at the moment. Petrol prices are rapidly rising, putting incredible pressure on family budgets. There are conflicting views in the community and in this parliament on the signing of the Kyoto protocol and we have at the moment the furphy of nuclear power raised by the Prime Minister last month thrown into what paris a vacuum of the larger policy of energy in Australia. There is a lack of talk in this place even on alternative sources, of Australia's ingenuity and of ways for us to shield Australia from oil price shocks in the future by developing alternative sources within Australia both for use within Australia and for export. But today we are talking not about that but about a very small but important part of it, which is fuel tax. There are 19 speakers on the opposition side for these bills, which reflects how importantly we on this side view the entire energy debate and how few and far between are the genuine opportunities to debate this important matter in this parliament. The fuel tax bills today do not deal with the general motor car use of mums and dads and motorists but specifically with some businesses and particularly regional areas. The legislation plays around the edges. It makes some very important changes and those changes are needed. They have been needed for some time. In fact, the government has made four announcements about the reform of the fuel excise rates over the last few years. The first was in the 2003-04 budget, where the government outlined the reforms, and then in December 2003 the Prime Minister elaborated on the budget announcements. In March 2004, the government extended the transition path for fuels becoming subject to excise. In June 2004, they released their energy white paper, and the Treasury, quite independently, on 27 May 2005 introduced a paper called Fuel tax credit reform: discussion paper. So there have been at least four major announcements on the need for this reform dating back to 2003-04. Essentially this bill implements a system of credits to offset either partially or fully excise that some taxpayers pay on fuels and to lay a groundwork for extending the tax net to alternative fuels, both current and developing. Most fuels are subject to excise, when a fuel is produced in Australia, or customs duty, when the fuel is imported, and also to the goods and services tax. This bill relates to excise and customs duty. The bill also deals with the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme, which allows users to recover some or all of the excise and customs duty on fuels. That system is administered by the Taxation Office, which publishes the grant rates on its website. This bill essentially moves some of those processes around. It simplifies the process into one process through the BAS system. It increases tax for some and decreases tax for others. Some will pay less, few will pay more and it introduces a tax regime for alternative fuels which will be introduced over a number of years. The current arrangements for taxation of fuel in Australia are highly complex and there is much scope for rationalisation. The proposed changes from 1 July 2006 seek to consolidate a range of measures into a single fuel tax regime with credits achieved through the BAS reporting system. Many users will effectively receive the same level of tax credit but under different administration arrangements. As I said, some will face more tax and some will face less. Under the current system, off-road use is treated differently to on-road use, as it is in this new bill. Under the fuel tax credit system, all taxable fuel acquired in, manufactured in or imported into Australia for use in off-road applications for business purposes will over time become tax free. There will be effective fuel tax-free status introduced for business off-road use. On-road users, on the other hand, will face increased taxation, the 20tonne threshold will be removed and vehicles the over 4.5 tonnes will pay fuel tax at the level of the road user charge and receive a fuel tax credit for other tax. The Fuel Sales Grants Scheme will be abolished over time. The scheme costs $256 million per year and provides a grant for sales of gasoline or diesel of up to three per cent per litre in nonmetropolitan regions. The bill has been supported by most producers, but it has been opposed by the ACCI due to the cash flow implications for small to medium enterprises. Currently, remission certificates permit some industries to receive fuel excise free, but under the proposed regime these fuel credits will be received only after the BAS has been lodged and processed by the ATO. This will cause cash flow problems for many SMEs, who may have to wait almost 50 days between paying the excise and receiving the fuel credit. This morning, some two hours before the debate began, we received a new amendment from the government which will provide short-term relief for that but only for two years. In recognition that this will cause considerable hardship for many small businesses, they will be able to receive their credit early, but at the conclusion of those two years the regime will revert. So this is not a solving of the problem at all, merely a pushing of the problem away for another two years. It would be nice if this government, particularly given that it has known about these reforms since 2003-04, spent more time getting the bill right in the first place. This is why in its second reading amendment the opposition condemns the government for failing to properly consult with commercial fuel users on the appropriate model for payment of fuel tax. This is a system which suits the Taxation Office but does not suit the many small users who have built their business models and cost structures around the existing concessions made at the time of fuel purchase. The amendment also condemns the government for circulating major amendments less than two hours before debate on the bill. Most people not in this parliament would assume that when one receives an amendment one can actually read it. Amendments actually read like this: ‘(1) Clause 2, page 2, table 8, omit parts 1 to 4, substitute parts 1 to 4A.' There are three pages to this amendment. In the debate on the industrial relations legisand lation we saw 300 amendments written like that, and they were debated and voted on within 40 minutes. They are not amendments you can read; you really do have to sit down with the bill and insert those amendments one by one. To receive this sort of amendment two hours before a debate when the legislation is clearly contentious for large sections of the industry not only does not allow the opposition-or the government, for that matter-to seriously consider the amendment but also does not allow any debate by or feedback from the industry that will be affected by this bill. It is extraordinarily arrogant of this government. Lately we have seen a lot of inability on the part of the government, in spite of knowing sometimes for years that legislation is to be introduced, to consult fully with industry or to give anybody a chance to provide appropriate feedback on bills being debated in this House. As members of parliament, we can all fool ourselves into believing that we know best. Occasionally maybe we do, but nobody knows as well as a group of people putting their views together to find the best outcome. The opposition also calls on the government to reduce Australia's dependency on foreign oil and to promote existing alternatives like liquefied petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel, emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity, and future fuels such as hydrogen. Under this government Australia is a country without a national goal on energy. We on this side of the House believe that a strategy must be developed. We need leadership on this issue. We need national leadership to develop the natural talent for innovation that Australia has in existing areas such as liquefied petroleum gas, ethanol biodiesel, to explore emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas-one of the great natural assets of Australia-liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity, and to explore future fuels such as hydrogen. We also need to develop the technologies and techniques to make all this happen. We need a serious investment, a serious plan and a serious commitment to finding alternatives to fossil fuels. We must make Australia less reliant on foreign oil, which affects our trade deficit, creating foreign debt. By developing alternative fuels, we place Australia in a very good position to export to the world. We also condemn the government for ignoring the impact of rising petrol prices on Australian families. We see it in all our electorates. The increase in petrol prices is clearly hurting Australian families, who on average are spending around $10 per week extra on unleaded fuel compared to just a few months ago. Since January, the average cost of unleaded petrol has increased nationally by 22 per cent. The $138 million increase confirms the reason that consumer sentiment has fallen by 13.3 per cent. A family that drives a 2000 model Holden VT Commodore is paying an estimated $18 extra per week, while a 1999 Ford AU Falcon Futura costs $16 more to run per week and a Mitsubishi costs $13 extra to run per week. I recently visited a school and was talking to some grade 5 and grade 6 children. I had been there for about an hour and they were asking all the usual questions about whether I fly or drive to Canberra-all the really important questions that children ask of politicians and that we have all experienced. One of them asked me about my car and I explained that it is provided as part of my ary. This little boy said, ‘Do you pay for your petrol?' I said, ‘No, I don't; it's paid for part of my package.' The entire group of children took in a collective breath in shock and outrage that I was somehow exempted from the pain of petrol prices that even grade 5 and grade 6 kids understand. Grade 5 and grade 6 children know that their families are suffering because of the price of petrol. I know some members have been in this House for a very long while and have not handed over their cash at a petrol pump for many years, but Australian families are and they are doing it more frequently and paying more for it than ever before. We also condemn the government for failing to strengthen the Trade Practices Act to protect competition in the petroleum industry. Labor has been talking for many years about the need to strengthen the Trade Practices Act to protect small business from unfair competition from megacompanies. In the petrol industry it could not be more important than it is now. The government has been extremely slow in acting in this area. We have been calling for it for quite some time-it has been part of our policy at each election-and it is desperately needed not just in this industry but in many others as well. Finally, we condemn the government for failing to guarantee that the money saved as a result of the abolition of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme will be specifically directed to roads in regional, rural and remote Australia. In summary, there is some good work in this bill. To some extent it does simplify some extremely complex arrangements. It phases in taxes on alternative fuels. Labor has been arguing for some time that these taxes not be introduced rapidly but rather phased in over time. The phasing in and out of the other regimes does provide some opsal- portunity for businesses to respond and to build these changes into their cost structures. as We are disappointed that the government has not found a real solution to the problem for small to medium enterprises caused by the claiming of credits through the BAS system rather than up front. We urge the government to seriously consider that problem and refer the matter to a Senate committee for further consideration. We also urge the government to take seriously the opposition's calls for a much stronger debate on energy in Australia-one that actually canvasses all the options and not just the furphy of nuclear power. There are many other alternatives for Australia. We have an abundance of sun, wind, natural gas and coal. The opportunities for this country in those areas are quite extraordinary. In our people, our skill and our natural resources we have a talent in those areas, and we should be exploring those to the full. Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (Corio) (7.14 pm)-The opposition will be supporting the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006. However, I state to the House my support for the second reading amendment which has been moved by the member for Hunter. I believe the member for Hunter has foreshadowed further amendments that may be introduced in the consideration in detail debate, and of course I will be supporting those. This legislation creates a single fuel tax regime with credits approved through the business activity statement system. It essentially provides transition arrangements to phase in the fuel tax credits scheme while phasing out the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme, the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme and the state administered Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme. The purpose of the legislation is directed at ensuring that claimcredits ants receiving a grant continue to benefit from fuel tax concessions and at phasing in over time the extension of eligibility for the off-road business use of fuel. Currently ineligible off-road activities will become eligiers, ble for a 50 per cent fuel tax credit from 1 July 2008 and for a full credit from 1 July 2012. Much has been said in the debate on this legislation about the current state of fuel taxation in Australia. The general public could be forgiven for asking what the Australian parliament and successive governments have been doing up to this point in time about this very complex area of taxation. a scandal, and I do not mind saying that after 10 long years of the Howard government we finally have legislation presented to the liament which the government itself is still busily amending. I reiterate the comments of the previous speaker in this debate: one would have thought that the government, with all the resources at its disposal, could have developed a coherent fuel policy for Australia and developed over time a less complex fuel taxation system, if that is indeed the way that this Treasurer wants to raise revenue for government purposes. The current arrangements for the taxation of fuel in Australia are highly complex and there is enormous scope for rationalisation. After 10 long years, this legislation seeks to introduce some rationalisation of the current scheme. It is important to note that the current bill does not change the taxation of rol for basic household motor vehicle use. Under the current regime, a grant is available for diesel fuel under the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. There is an on-road credit, which includes alternative fuels, for vehicles over 20 tonnes, for vehicles between 4.5 and 20 tonnes and for vehicles operating outside or across metropolitan boundaries. Off-road apply to business usage and a fuel sales grant, under the Fuel Sales Grants Act, of 1c to 3c per litre of gasoline or diesel fuel in non-metropolitan areas applies. Remission certificates apply to exempt commercial usin industries like plastics and chemicals, from excise or customs duty on certain types of fuel. The proposed changes, to apply from 1 July 2006, seek to consolidate these measures into a single fuel tax regime with credits achieved, as I have stated, through the BAS reporting system. Many users will receive the same level of tax but under different administrative arrangements, and of course the cost of compliance and understanding will It is fall on those businesses. Some users will face significant tax reductions, and there will be a higher tax for some on-road use. Aviapar- tion fuels are excluded from the fuel tax credit system. Labor's position on this has been articulated by previous speakers and I will not canvass too widely those statements. Labor supports the basic structure of the bill as providing a more sustainable basis for fuel taxation in Australia. In the general scheme of things, the bill is a major reform of fuel taxation in Australia. It provides for many things: a single system of fuel tax and associated credits, reductions in the incidence of fuel tax levied on taxable fuels and a staged introduction of a framework for the taxation of liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas from 1 July 2011. It provides for a staged reduction in pet- tax assistance for biodiesel and domestic ethanol and it links fuel credits to environcome mental standards, something for which Labor has argued for a long period of time. This legislation had some serious shortcomings for small and medium sized enterprises in Australia, which have been the ject of significant representations by people in my constituency and by members of the farm sector in my capacity as the shadow minister for agriculture. Their main concern was the provision, under the originally posed regime, that fuel credits would be received only after a BAS had been lodged and processed by the Australian Taxation Office. It was estimated by many of those seeking change in this area that many SMEs that lodged business activity statements would have something like a 50-day delay between paying the excise and receiving the fuel credit. As we know, the ATO has not had an exemplary track record of processing activity statement refunds quickly, so the provisions as they stood were going to lead to significant cash flow problems for many small businesses. Labor particularly has worked very hard with those sectors to put pressure on the government to look closely at this particular provision and change it, which the government has done. The government has made a minor concession that extends the sunset period by a couple of years. But, as we know, these are ongoing problems for small and medium businesses. I think it is a reasonable proposition that we extend that sunset clause indefinitely, and I will certainly support any measures to do that. For example, Labor was approached by the ACCI, which had real problems with the new legislation. We were also lobbied by the farm sector and other business lobby groups-of course, that lobbying effort was directed at government members also-and changes have been made. So we would welany change in that regard, but more particularly we think it ought to be extended beyond that two-year period. The issue of fuel is one of direct concern to my constituents and the people whom I subseek to represent in my shadow ministerial portfolio in the farm sector. As you may well know, Mr Deputy Speaker, my electorate of Corio encompasses most of Geelong. We have some tens of thousands of people who pro- every day travel to Melbourne for work. Most of those people travel by car. I am not saying that that is the most efficient way to move people between Geelong and Melbourne. I commend the Bracks government for the recent upgrading of the rail system and the introduction of the fast trains between Geelong and Melbourne, and I commend those people who seek to use that transport mode to get themselves to their place of work. But the reality is that, for convenience, many people in my electorate travel to Melbourne for their work by car. They have to do that. They have been affected deeply by the rises in oil prices that have occurred which have translated into higher prices at the petrol bowsers in my electorate and in Melbourne. The simple reality is that most of those commuters are facing quite significant increases in their fuel bills, and these issues of fuel taxation are very important to them. They are also important to the farm sector, because the cost of fuel is a significant input into the production of agricultural produce in this country. Much production is undertaken in rural and regional areas that are quite far away from ports and the markets in which we sell that produce. When you look at the inputs that come from petroleum based products into farm processes you see that it is not just confined to fuel but to fertilisers, and the rising international price has impacted very heavily on the baseline costs of farmers on-farm. It has also affected the delivery of goods into regional areas-the delivery of spare parts and general household items. The general cost structures are moving as businesses adjust to the new economic environment typified by high petrol prices. There is a simple reality about Australia's position. We are terribly dependent on foreign oil, and that dependence is growing. For example, petroleum based fuels account for 97 per cent of Australia's transport needs. That is an extraordinary statistic. The reality is that we are consuming petroleum based products at a rate some three times faster than we are finding those resources. At the end of the day, as we all know, there is a finite limit to these resources. No matter how you look at the situation, we could go on finding huge reserves of oil but, as we know, at the end of the day, at quite significant rates of consumption, those fossil fuels are going to run out whether it be in 10, 20, 30 or 100 years. I have some experience of this. As a young man I happened to work as an administration manager on the construction sites in North Sea oil, where British Petroleum contracted the company that I worked for to extract oil from the North Sea. The technology that was being employed was at the forefront of the recovery technologies at the time. The company that was involved was a significant Texas contractor which is well known to people on both sides of this House. The Texans who worked in that particular company made no bones about the fact that, once the oil was discovered, caps would be put on the oil and the companies would wait until the price increased to release it. I found that quite staggering as a young person, knowing that households and people depended so much on fuels to generate their livelihoods. But here I was working with a company where, although there were huge exploration costs involved, once the product was found, the caps were being put on the oil wells and the supply trickled out to influence the eventual price, given the demand. I mention this example because, at the end of the day, either Australia is in a vulnerable position on this particular issue or it is not. That is the reality: we are either vulnerable or we are not. There are degrees of vulnerability, and at the moment we are highly vulnerable-and we should not be. That is the simple logic of what we have seen take place over a period of 30 years. Some of us in this House can actually remember the 1974 oil shock. That was supposed to be something that created enormous difficulties for the then Labor government. The then opposition would not hear of any excuse about a trebling of the price of oil feeding into the cost structures of businesses and farms. There was no concession or quarter given to the Labor Party then, but we have seen over the last couple of years a trebling of the oil price again. This government has had at its disposal over a decade a whole raft of things it could have done to much better prepare Australia for the situation it now finds itself in. Crude oil and refined petroleum now constitute the largest item on our trade accounts-that is, crude oil in 2004-05 was the second-biggest import, at $15 billion. The statistics are quite alarming. In 2005-06 Australia relied on imports for 17 per cent of our petroleum consumption. Those are figures produced by ABARE, which estimates that by 2020 that will rise to 46 per cent. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association think it will be closer to 78 per cent. So somewhere between 50 and 80 per cent is probably a reasonable guesstimate. We tend to rely on those two bodies for their expertise in making these sorts of predictions. Even if that is the case, we are highly vulnerable and dependency means terrible exposure to any rises that take place or any events that will affect the demand or the supply of petroleum based products. The economic impacts are substantial. We have seen a trebling of oil prices in three years globally, and that has started to feed into inflationary pressures. It has already impacted on household budgets in Geelong. It is being used by this government as an excuse for the brakes being applied to growth. I am not disputing that that is an economic impact; but, for heaven's sake, we have known about our dependence on petroleum based products for a long period of time and we are only now getting the fuel tax regime right and we have no alternative fuel strategy of any moment in place. I get sick and tired of members opposite saying that Labor is a policy-free zone. We are an opposition with limited resources, yet we could come up with a comprehensive policy. You have been in government for some 10 or 11 years and you are still in a mess. The nation is highly vulnerable and we are all going to pay a price for your incompetence. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Wilkie)-The member for Corio will remember to refer his remarks through the chair. I wish I had been in government for 10 years! Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR-I do apologise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I really am referring to the imbeciles opposite, who have not been able to put together a coordinated policy in this regard. Labor do have a policy. We intend to set up a regional resource infranately, structure fund. We all know that Australia's reserves are in remote areas and we really need to support the development of any additional resources with infrastructure. We have a policy to foster demand for new fuels and technologies. Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, has made quite plain in his blueprint what we would do. It is quite simple. We have said we would make alternative fuel vehicles tariff free, cutting up to $2,000 off the price of current hybrid cars. We would work with state and local governments to give traffic and parking advantages to these vehicles in the city. We would examine the granting of tax rebates for converting petrol cars to LPG. Those measures will have some effect. With regard to the global race for innovation and the development of new fuels and fuel technologies, we will conduct a feasibility study into gas-to-liquid fuels plants in Australia, offer petroleum resource rent tax incentives for developers of gas fields which provide resources for gas-to-liquid fuel projects, work with industry to improve engine design and fuel quality standards, develop an ethanol and alternative fuel industry and examine a new infrastructure investment allowance for investment in Australia's gas-toliquid infrastructure. That is not the end of the story. There are a whole range of things a national government could do to develop a coherent and comprehensive fuel strategy for (Mr this nation to reduce its dependence and its exposure on petroleum based products. This government has not done those things and it stands condemned for not doing them. (Time expired)",104
176,Ms HALL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I join with the member for Corio in condemning the federal government for its failure to develop an adequate and proper policy, a policy that looks to the future in this area. Unfortuwe in this House find ourselves reacting to just about every issue, because that is the way this government works. Unfortunately for the people of Australia, I do not think it has reacted soon enough to the need to look at reforms to fuel tax and to look at alternative sources of energy. Australia as a nation will pay for the failure of the Howard government. The Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and cognate bill constitute major reform to fuel taxation in Australia. They provide for a single system of fuel tax and associated credits. They also include measures for reductions in the incidence of fuel tax levied on taxable fuels; staged introduction of a framework for the taxation of liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas; from 1 July 2011 staged reduction in tax assistance for biodiesel and domestic ethanol; and the linkage of fuel credits to environmental standards. We will be supporting much of what the government has included in these bills, but we do not support the government's ineptitude and its failure to address the real issues that are facing the people of Australia. The proposed changes consolidate measures into a single fuel tax, which is a good idea. It is good policy, it makes it easier, simpler, and it does this with credits achieved through the BAS reporting systems. Many users will effectively receive the same level of tax under different administration arrangements, but some users will face significant tax reductions. There will be a higher tax for some on-road use. Aviation fuels are excluded from the fuel tax. It is my understanding that the way the government is linking it to the BAS will cause some problems. The Australian Tax Office is notoriously slow in returning moneys and dealing with matters that are sent to it. My office is constantly deluged with problems constituents have with the ATO, including that of facing delays-although that is currently not a problem. As to the administration of the fuel tax credits regime, it will be claimed on the BAS in the same way as input tax credits are claimed for GST. Because of these delays, there is the potential cause major cash flow problems for mediumsized producers. These producers are effectively fuel tax free due to the remission certificates for excise and customs on fuel input. Now they must pay the fuel tax and get the credit when they lodge their BAS. Producers with a turnover of $20 million must report monthly for GST purposes. I have been arguing that GST refunds are not provided quickly. Businesses with $2 million to $20 million turnovers report quarterly and thus face major delays between payment of the tax and the associated credit. This can cause cash flow problems. That is from the business perspective. I would like to turn to the amendment moved by the shadow minister, the member for Hunter. The first part of the amendment deals with the failure of the government to address issues around petrol prices. The people of Australia have been dealt a double whammy of soaring petrol prices and increased interest rates, with two interest rate rises since the last election. What has the government done to deal with these petrol and fuel price increases? I argue they have done very little. The Prime Minister has said there is not much he can do. He has given up. He has put it in the too-hard basket. Those people who rely on the government to solve problems, those people who rely on being able to purchase affordable fuel, should expect a little bit more from their Prime Minister than saying, ‘It's too hard; I don't know what I'll do about it.' The people of Australia think that something should happen. I refer to a letter I have here from a constituent, Mr Jack Cambourn of Chain Valley Bay. He wrote this letter to me just after the Easter break. He pointed out that the public's attention is always focused on the price of petrol and the way the price of fuel increases around a holiday break. He to was referring to Easter, but I note that within my electorate, prior to the long weekend, the price of petrol was $1.49. Today it has dropped down to $1.42. This is the phenomenon that Mr Cambourn was referring to in the letter he wrote to me. He said: Fuel costs are passed on to the people in every item they buy in the super market. I think that is an important factor. When we are in there buying our fruit and vegetables, we must be aware that the high prices we are paying for them are a direct result of the Howard government not acting to constrain the price of fuel or to look at alternative fuels. He goes on to say: Those who do not own a vehicle pay, but clearly the vehicle owner pays twice, once at the service station, and again at the super market. He goes on to ask: Do we have to go on paying? He said: The Prime Minister was on the Tele recently discussing the problem of increasing prices of motor fuel. “There's nothing we can do about it” says the PM. As I mentioned earlier, he threw his hands in the air, abrogated his responsibility and said, ‘There's nothing I can do about it.' Mr Cambourn continued: Immediately a scene appeared on the screen showing a mass of people on the floor of the New York stock exchange. We were told they were stockbrokers bidding for stock in oil companies. He goes on to make the point that this activity can have an effect on world oil prices. He says: There are 65 countries around the world who possess natural deposits of crude oil, Australia is one. Some are known to sell motor fuel into their domestic market at a lower price than they would sell it into their export market, but not Australia. The USA is one, Venezuela is another. Within the past three months the US was selling motor fuel for $US2.80 a gallon. He goes on to talk about converting these prices to Australian dollars. He went on to say they were much lower-less than half the price that we are paying now. He goes on to argue that the Howard government should look at things a lot more creatively. He then goes on to say that it is up to federal members of parliament to try to resolve the problems of all those families whose interests we have been elected to this parliament to support and to look after. Another constituent who has been very active in community groups and does a lot of volunteer work is now unable to do so because of the increase in the price of petrol. Parents are telling me that they are no longer able to take their children to those sporting activities that they have been involved in for a very long time. As with other things, that is a double-edged sword because it impacts on the health of our young people, which in turn can lead to an increase in obesity and health problems into the future and which increases costs to government-all because the government has failed to look at the issue of petrol prices. Floraville Public School, in my electorate, is a lot more far-sighted than members of this government. Last week students from Floraville Public School interviewed me on the telephone. They asked me about ethanol and alternative fuels. They asked me whether I supported their use. They asked me about the sorts of policies the government should be introducing and how the government could address the issues and look at alternative fuels. I gave an answer from my perspective-as a Labor Party opposition member of this parliament who can see that this government's inactivity is costing Australia in a big way. The students will write a report in their school newspaper that will detail whether they think that what I support is a much better alternative than what the government has done-which is nothing. The abolition of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme will mean an increase in costs to regional areas. There is no way the government can walk away from that. Once again, the government have handled that very badly. They have not looked at the impact of their decision. The government should read the article that the students of Floraville Public School put in their newspaper about ways of reducing Australia's dependency on foreign oil and developing an Australian solution-that is, an Australian fuel industry. I do not think there is any better example of what could be done than that which has been set out in the Leader of the Opposition's blueprint for Australian fuels, ‘Developing the Australian fuel industry'. The Leader of the Opposition highlights the fact that we need to develop a diversified Australian fuel industry and become a more fuel self-sufficient nation which is not dependent on a very volatile oil market and overseas market, which is not open to manipulation by foreign countries and foreign variables and which has a policy that is Australian based. Australian families have been struggling with the increase in fuel prices. Members may have seen that advertisement on television for an insurance company, where the father adds up how much it costs and gives the young boy in the back seat of the car a bill for taking him to school that reflects the increase in the price of petrol. The insurance company offers another solution, but I think the solution is to develop an Australian industry. I firmly believe the way forward for transport fuels in Australia is to have Australia stand on its own two feet rather than sit there waiting for overseas factors and influences to determine how much we pay for petrol at the bowsers. It is also important that we look at the relationships between the oil companies. For too long the market here in Australia has been manipulated. As I highlighted earlier, the cost of fuel before Easter and before the long weekend just gone was manipulated by the oil companies. I do not see how we could be asked to pay $1.49 on Friday and $1.42 today. ",111
177,Ms HALL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"As the member for Chifley said, it is a rip-off. Who is being ripped off? The Australian people. Who is allowing this rip-off to continue? The Howard government. The Howard government have to take responsibility for what is happening with the price of fuels. They cannot walk away from it. They cannot throw their hands up in the air and say, as the Prime Minister has done, ‘There is nothing we can do about it.' There is plenty he can do about it, and it is about time he started to do something. We need national leadership to develop existing alternatives such as liquid petroleum, ethanol and biodiesel, which the kids from Floraville Public School-who are under 12 years of age-can see we need. We need technologies to enable emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuels from gas and stored electricity and future fuels such as hydrogen. For that to happen, we need a government that supports the development of these new technologies. We need this because our transport fuel market needs a fresh blast of competition-real competition, not the kind of competition that we see currently within the fuel market. By developing an Australian policy, an Australian industry and Australian alternatives, Australia becomes less vulnerable to external shocks and the possibility of a $5 a litre price at the pump within a decade. I do not think it is unrealistic to say that we are very fast approaching that $2 a litre barrier. I would hate to see us reach that by the end of this year but, unless this government acts and takes some initiative, that is where we will be. Yet all we see is John Howard throwing his hands in the air and saying, ‘We can't do anything about it.' He has also said: I can fully understand the the price of petrol. ... ... ... World oil prices are not something the Australian Government, or any government, can influence. They are out of our control. Well, Prime Minister, what is in your control? What can you do? I would argue that there are plenty of things that you can do. I suggest that you start by looking at the Labor Party's ‘Blueprint Number Australian Fuels' and acting on it. We do not mind if you steal some of our initiativesthey would be good for Australia. We believe that Australians should not be paying the high prices at the pumps at the moment. We believe that we should have an Australian industry, and it is about time this government acts to see that that happens.  privilege to follow the honourable member for Shortland in the debate on this important bill, the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006. It provides a single system of fuel tax credits to remove or reduce the incidence of fuel tax levied on taxable fuels. It produces a framework for taxation of gaseous fuels from 1 July 2011, when fuel tax will be, for the first time, levied on liquid petroleum gas, liquid natural gas and compressed natural gas. Under the tax credit system, all taxable fuels that are acquired, manufactured or imported for business purposes will become tax free. The excise levied on burner fuels, such as kerosene, heating oil and fuels used in commercial electricity generation, will be removed from 1 July 2006. Concessions, refunds and remissions derived through the excise will be replaced by fuel credits. A business claiming more than $3 million will be required to become a member of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program, and fuel tax credits are claimed via the BAS or business activity anger of motorists at statement. In the words of the Prime Minister, the price of petrol is a real barbecue stopper. It does not matter whether you are out in the bush, in a regional city or town, in a capital city or in the western suburbs of Sydney like me-people are feeling the high cost of fuel. They have to pay an extraordinary amount of money to fill up the family car, and that is hurting their budgets. It is quite trite of the Three- Prime Minister to say, ‘It is all because of the world high price of petroleum.' We have missed a lot of opportunities in Australia. I notice the honourable member for Corio is at the table for the opposition, and I am sure he would agree with me that Australia did a lot to develop solar energy but we have done little to commercialise and take advantage of it. It is a real tragedy. It is very symptomatic of Australia that we can be so good in research and development but not so good on commercialisation and exports. Of course, policies introduced by the Howard government have not helped in that regard. The leader has announced that Australia needs to develop existing technology: liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel; developing technology-that is, ‘Let's get in there quick': compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity; and future technology: hydrogen. I have had a long standing interest in ethanol. It stems from the time, too many years ago, when I was reading a Newsweek magazine, which used to be imported into this country; it has subsequently disappeared. It talked about what Brazil was doing with ethanol. Brazil has, for many decades now, produced ethanol from sugar cane. It is by far the cheapest provider of ethanol in the world. Brazil not only uses it in petroleum in vehicles but also exports it. We have a real problem in Australia. Currently, we provide in Australia, on a declining basis, 63 per cent of our own petroleum supplies. It has been estimated that within 10 years we will be dependent on 78 per cent of imports of petroleum. Currently we are 63 per cent self-sufficient; in 10 years, it has been estimated, that could decline by as much as 22 per cent-that is, we will need to import 78 per cent of all our requirements in the next 10 years. This is having a horrendous impact on our current account deficit. I have no need to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that for 49 months Australia, one of the resource-rich countries of the world, in the middle of a resources boom, has produced 49 consecutive current account deficits. We need to do something. I feel we need to do something not only about the framework that has been outlined but about ethanol. We need to do something about extending our own self-sufficiency. I know that there is a view in this parliament that all you have to do is leave it to petrol companies and-by some process of serendipity or the road to Damascus-they will suddenly want to do the right thing by looking at biofuels, by looking at ethanol. Should they do that, it will be a first. Let be under no illusions. In America, the very same petrol companies which in Australia deny us ethanol in our petrol are providing it and bragging about it. There will always be debates on the Labor side about the right thing to do and the best way to go. I make no apologies for believing that we should be mandating ethanol. We cannot leave it to the petrol companies to do the right thing by the people of Australia. We cannot leave it to the petrol companies to try and solve our own self-sufficiency problems, with a rapidly declining basis of petroleum in this country. We cannot leave it to the petrol companies to make a significant impact on our current account deficit. As I say, I believe that we need to mandate ethanol. Lots of figures have been bandied around about mandating. Of course, if you were to start mandating ethanol, you would obviously want to start ramping it up-that is, initially you would set a target of, say, 2.5 per cent and ramp it up to five, 7.5 and 10 per cent. If we were to do that, we would make a big impact on our current account deficit, and we would also make an impact on our own self-sufficiency. I have some tell figures here. For example, 2.5 per cent would add another four per cent in terms of the replacement value; five per cent would mean eight per cent; 7.5 per cent, 12 per cent; and 10 per cent, 17 per cent. We ought to be doing these things. We ought to be looking at them. This parliament ought to be having a debate. It is true that I have been down to the Manildra plant where ethanol is produced as a by-product of wheat processing. It is also the true that I have been pleased to meet Dick Honan and his family. I do not know what Dick Honan's family's politics are. I do not think it particularly matters or should be important. I can say that they are a great Ausus tralian family who have pioneered ethanol. But, in mandating ethanol, we would not be providing any monopoly to Manildra. In fact, if we were to mandate ethanol, we would be not only guaranteeing a future for ethanol in this country but ensuring that future plants would be constructed in rural Australia. That would be providing jobs in rural and regional Australia, adding to the economy of rural and regional Australia and, as I say, helping the current account deficit problem that we have-that is, starting to minimise it-as well as starting to address our issues of selfsufficiency. There is one thing that you can be sure of, because the government has asked for a departmental report into this from the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. The minister for industry is an opponent of ethanol. He has not really ever supported it appropriately. In fact, I know that the National Party members, whilst they are very keen to see ethanol mandated, know that they cannot get it through this government. They know what the benefits are to rural and regional Australia. They know what the benefits would be to the state of Queensland. But they cannot get it up within the coalition. On our side of politics, these things are worthwhile looking at. I see that the honourable member for Prospect is in the House ready to make a contribution. He will know that one of the urgency motions considered at the New South Wales state conference of the Labor Party was the issue of mandating ethanol. That motion sought the intervention of the Premier of New South Wales and the New South Wales Labor government. I must say that I fully support it. As we search for solutions for the future, I would discount none of the new, emerging technologies, but I do say that we have an opportunity with ethanol. This has been around for not one or two years but decades. It is to our shame, in my view, that the use of ethanol is not at 7.5 per cent or at 10 per cent. I believe that you cannot trust the petrol companies. At the end of the day, the real solution is to mandate it. If the New South Wales state Labor government lead the way, that is terrific. I know that their Country Labor members would be very strongly supportive of it. I hope that, at a federal level, we would look at mandating it. We would look at doing something very serious for the desperate situation where currently we are 63 per cent self-sufficient but within 10 years we will be importing 78 per cent of our petroleum needs. We cannot do nothing-that is not an option. I will finish on a couple of points. It is an absolute tragedy that the ACCC does not have full power to ensure that the petrol companies are not price gouging. On this side of the House we support the ACCC getting it. Whether or not the chairman of the ACCC wants it, we believe that he should have it and therefore should be required to exercise it. On the government side-that is, on the side of the Liberal and National parties-they say, ‘We're very content with the status quo. We don't mind petrol going up 9c or 10c before a long weekend or that there are price variations depending on what day of the week you fill up your car at the petrol bowser; that is just a normal matter in the marketing of petrol.' It is interesting that, no matter what the brand, all the service stations do the same things on the same day. John Howard says that it is not a problem, Peter Costello says that it is not a problem and the backbenchers on the coalition side say that it is not a problem. I have never heard the member for Greenway get up and talk about this issue which hurts Western Sydney. I have never heard the member for Lindsay get up and say that this is a problem and that we need to give the ACCCMr Bowen-Struck dumb.  never heard the member for Macarthur, who is not a bad sort of a bloke, get up and say in his electorate on the very fringes of the western suburbs of Sydney: ‘This is hurting families in my electorate and is unfair to them. I want something done; I demand that something be done.' But I have heard nothing. I have to say that I have never even heard my learned colleague the Chief Government Whip, the member for Macquarie, say a word in anger over the current situation of petrol pricing in his electorate. Things can be done, and I believe the opposition is the party that will do things. This government has a track record of denying everything and doing nothing.",114
178,Mr BOWEN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"The Fuel Tax Bill 2006 is an important bill-as is its associated bill, the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006with ramifications for farmers, small business people and people in rural and regional areas, particularly. It also has significant cal implications. There is no doubt that the fuel excise regime is in need of reform. It is currently complex, difficult to administer and difficult to understand, and some reform is welcome. However, there are aspects of this bill which cause me concern. I also note that this bill is significantly different from the one originally proposed by the government, thanks to the pressure from the opposition and from groups such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. This bill consolidates the range of fuel grants, credits and concessions into one single regime, and this is a concept which I find difficult to oppose. If the bill is passed, many users will be receiving the same level of tax rebate under different administrative arrangements, although it must be noted that some users will have their tax changed. This bill, for example, abolishes the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme which provides for a grant for sales of petrol or diesel of up to three per cent in non-metropolitan areas. This significant scheme costs some $256 million per annum, and the scheme's abolition has significant impacts. It would be appropriate for a Senate committee to examine this aspect of the bill. I referred earlier to the government's significant backdown. In the bill's original form, fuel tax credits would be claimed by businesses via the business activity statement in the same way as input tax credits are claimed for the GST, and this new scheme would be effective immediately. This means that a range of companies currently paying no fuel tax would now have to pay tax and then claim back the tax at a later time. You do not have to be a genius to realise that this would cause a major cash flow problem for small and medium sized enterprises especially, but apparently the government did not realise this. The problem for small business fisis especially apparent when you consider that businesses with a turnover of less than $20 million report their business activity quarterly and they would, under the system, have very significant delays before receiving their fuel tax back. I was listening to the contribution of the honourable member for Hunter earlier today. He said that somebody had suggested to him that the way around that would be for small businesses to do their business activity statements monthly and not quarterly. That person obviously has no understanding of the burden of doing a business activity statement on a small business. They obviously have no understanding of what an onerous task it is and how the last thing small businesses need to be doing is to be preparing their business activity statements more regularlymonthly-in order to get back tax that they have paid and which they used not to have to pay at all. A recent audit report revealed that the Australian Taxation Office is unacceptably slow in processing business activity refunds, and this will make the effect of this change even more significant. Labor agreed with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry-I must say that we do not agree with them on everything but we certainly agreed with them on this-that this was unacceptable. We argued strongly that this aspect of the bill should be referred to a Senate committee for fuller consideration. The government has now partially backed down. The new arrangements mean that business will now have two years to adjust to the new tax regime. I note that the National Party have claimed this as a victory-and well they would; they do not have very many. However, it is actually a delayed defeat. The new arrangements will be implemented exactly as planned, just two years later. It does not fix the problem; it just puts it off for two years. While it is welcome that business will have two years to adjust to the new regime, other solutions should still be examined by a Senate committee. These should include the possibility of allowing companies with a turnover of less than $20 million to pay the tax after the business activity statement has been lodged. I note that the tax office argued until very recently that this change was a necessary design feature. But it is apparently not so necessary that it is required for the next two years. It is not so essential that the tax office cannot survive for two years without it. That has to beg the question: if it is not essential for the next two years, is it essential for all the years to come? Given this anomaly, it is appropriate that a Senate committee examine the proposed changes to ensure that they cannot be further amended or to reduce or eliminate their adverse effects on industry. The tax office said that it was essential; now apparently it is not so essential. We need to see whether, if it is not so essential, it can done without forever. We say: let a Senate committee have a good look at it and report back on the options. For all those reasons, all of division 3 of the bill should be referred to a Senate committee. I would like to deal briefly with the taxation arrangements for alternative fuels, most notably ethanol. This new tax regime will impose fuel tax on biodiesel, domestically produced ethanol, LPG, compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas. Of course it is appropriate that these fuels be taxed in the same way that other fuels are taxed, but it must be remembered that these fuels, particularly ethanol, are very much at the developmental stage and taxing them now could have the effect of killing this industry or at least very seriously affecting its development. That is why the tax regime will be phased in from 1 July 2011 to 1 July 2015. This is appropriate. Labor called for this and we support it. The government talks about being a supporter of alternative fuels, particularly ethanol, and tries to paint Labor as not being in favour. But of course nothing could be further from the truth. I am glad that the government has listened to the calls of Labor and others and agreed to the phasein of the tax on biofuels. The matter of biofuels is also addressed in the second reading amendment moved by the member for Hunter earlier today, and I would now like to turn to that aspect. Australia is facing very high fuel prices, as is the rest of the world. It is incumbent on governments to encourage alternative fuels to reduce our reliance on foreign fuel supplies over time. This government has been reluctant to do it. Labor has a well-developed policy in this regard. The government has now adopted Labor's plan to have the Commonwealth fleet-which is a very substantial one-running on alternative fuels. But of be course much more can and should be done. It is being done overseas in places you would not naturally expect. President Bush has authorised a $1.7 billion program to encourage hydrogen energy and fuel cell technology. Iceland is committed to becoming a hydrogen economy in 30 years time. The Brazilian experience is that you can have an effect on petrol prices by encouraging alternative fuels. That is why a Labor government would, for example, reexamine the depreciation regime for gas production infrastructure and allow the use of flow-through share schemes in the gas, oil and mineral exploration industries, which would enable some smaller operators to share the tax deductions and losses with their investors, making them more competitive in the battle for capital. In addition, we would make alternative fuel vehicles tariff free, ting up to $2,000 from the cost of hybrid cars. Obviously, if you cut the cost of alternative fuel vehicles in this country, you improve the viability of the alternative fuels industry. I would now like to turn to other aspects of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Hunter. Filling your car's petrol tank can now cost you $100. In Sydney, which is the community I know, it would not be unusual for the average Sydneysider driving to and from work to fill their tank at least once a week. This is a massive cost blow-out for families. Especially in Western Sydney-which the member for Chifley referred to and which I also have the honour to represent-people who travel long distances into the city or across Western Sydney to get to their place of employment often have no choice but to drive, and this is a significant cost impost for them. Yet the government's Western Sydney MPs wash their hands and say there is nothing that can be done. As I have said in this House before, increases in fuel costs are an international nomenon and they are primarily driven by increases in the cost of crude oil, but that does not mean the government is entitled to sit on its hands and do nothing. The government could be acting to reduce our reliance on foreign fuel supplies. Crude oil and refined petroleum combined are this nation's single biggest import. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, Australia currently relies on imports for 17 per cent of our overall petrol consumption. Seventeen per cent sounds reasonable; I thought it might be higher than that. Until I checked the figures, 17 per cent did not sound too bad. But the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics calculates that this figure will rise to 46 per cent in 2020. This will be cutbad for our current account deficit and bad for Australian motorists. The government could ensure that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ensures that price gouging is not occurring. The member for Chifley said that Labor believes the ACCC should have that power whether it likes it or not-and he is right. The chairman of the ACCC has said that he thinks something fishy is going on with petrol prices-and, if something fishy is going on, something should be done about it. Price gouging is not the main cause of high petrol prices but, even if it is adding to prices by a relatively small degree, Australian families deserve relief from it. The head of the ACCC has said that something fishy is going on with petrol prices and the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures believes that refiner margins are eight to 10c a litre higher than they should be. I agree with Senator Humphries, who said: The relatively opaque nature of petrol prices means there is an opportunity for parties in the supply chain [to make] discretionary decisions about how much to charge to exploit motorists. phe- There are plenty of reasons why the ACCC should be closely monitoring petrol prices, and the Australian people who are filling up their tank every day know it. On the whole, I support this bill. I believe that division 3 should be referred to a Senate committee for the reasons I have outlined. I think the National Party has grabbed a deferred defeat, not a victory. Small business in rural and regional areas in particular have a lot to lose in the long run if division 3 is not amended. I was attracted to an article in the Courier Mail on 15 May this year titled ‘Excise Uturn could kill industry'. President of the Queensland Seafood Industry Association, Neil Green, referring to this bill going through, said: We are at the stage where we will go broke if this occurs. He is right. Businesses throughout Australia, especially in rural and regional areas, are saying that. I say to the government: it is not good enough to put this off for two years. They are supposedly the champions of small business. They come into this House boasting and beating their chests saying, ‘We are the only ones who care about small business,' yet they are introducing a tax regime which one industry association president says will send a significant number of his members broke and which small businesses throughout Australia have protested against. The best that this government can do is to say, ‘It's okay, we won't do it for another two years, until after the next election,' which, by the way, is a very convenient result. The government should have the guts to fix this and fix it now and to be judged by small business on their performance-not to put it off on the never-never, not to put it off until after the next election, as they do on so many issues. They should deal with this now. They should face small business now and they should fix it now.",118
179,Mr MELHAM,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I rise tonight to speak on the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 and the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006. Typically, the government has provided insufficient time for the opposition to analyse the amendments to this legislation. Those amendments were made available only two hours prior to the commencement of this debate. The systemic lack of professionalism and parliamentary courtesy is becoming a hallmark of this government. This is not the first time that the government has done this and I suspect it will not be the last. At this point in time we have also not been able to consult the report produced by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. As I understand it, that report was to be tabled this afternoon in the Senate but has now been held over for tabling tomorrow. Australians have a right to expect that their parliamentary representatives conduct debate in an informed manner. This is becoming impossible through the government's appalling discourtesy and diminishing respect for the parliamentary process-this by a Prime Minister who campaigned prior to his election on the premise that he would raise parliamentary standards. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the last decade parliamentary standards have fallen. It is all emanating from the arrogant way the government has conducted itself. Having noted my concerns about the shoddy manner with which the government is dealing with this legislation, I will move on to discuss the bills before the House this evening. With my constituents I remain concerned about the rising cost of petrol for the domestic user. It is this concern which will underpin my remarks this evening. Motorists are understandably upset at the price of petrol. When challenged on this the Prime Minister commented: ... world prices are not something the Australian Government, or any government, can influence. Let us accept that as a premise. Logically the next question is: what is the government doing about developing alternative strategies to minimise our dependence on world oil and world oil prices? Not a lot, it would seem. In 2004-05 Australia spent almost $15 billion on imported crude oil and refined petroleum. In net terms, Australia relies on imports for 17 per cent of its overall petrol consumption. By 2020 the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics estimates the figure will rise to 46 per cent. These bills go a very little way to addressing the fuel crisis in which this country finds itself. We must seek ways to diversify our fuel base and establish alternatives. The other side of the picture reveals that, if we do nothing, we will increase our dependence on oil supplies from the Middle East, West Africa and Russia. These are not countries noted for their stability, yet we will be forced to rely on these countries for our fuel supplies. The member for Batman has already commented on the implications that has for energy security. I particularly note those aspects of the bills which propose new environmental measures: the requirement for large fuel users to be a member of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program and vehicles using diesel fuels in on-road applications to comply with emissions performance criteria. For the record, I note that Greenhouse Challenge Plus is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency, integrate greenhouse issues into business decision making and provide more consistent reporting of greenhouse gas emission levels. Certainly, Greenhouse Challenge Plus is a tiny move in the right direction to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Despite this small move forward, I believe Australia must develop a diversified fuel industry. We need cleaner fuels. Australia has fallen behind the rest of the world in the development of a fuel industry plan. In the past three years global oil prices have tripled. One of the results is that business margins are affected and, as that occurs, so consumers face higher prices. We are seeing that pattern now with the recent increase in petrol prices at the pump. It is not unrealistic to expect that the government give consideration to preparing this country for the inevitable future peaks in the price of petrol. Our dependence on foreign oil is growing. Petroleum based fuels account for 97 per cent of Australia's total transport fuel needs. We are, however, consuming oil three times faster than we are finding it. In developing a diversified fuel industry, we should expand existing alternatives like petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel. We should develop emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity. We should consider future fuels such as hydrogen. By playing a more active role in emerging energy sectors, we can boost our export performance and take advantage of opportunities in world markets. Australia must invest in the preservation of our environment by diversifying our fuel base beyond petrol to biofuels, gas and hydrogen. We must prepare Australia now to face the energy challenges of the next 100 years. One of these challenges is to ensure that we do much more in renewable energy resources. For this reason, Labor supports the increase of the mandatory renewable energy target. Let us consider what is happening in other countries in their attempts to diversify the fuel base. In the USA, there is a five-year plan to develop hydrogen and fuel cell technology. In the European Union, there is significant financial commitment to fuel cell technology. Iceland is committed to becoming the world's first hydrogen economy. In Qatar, the focus is developing on gas to liquids. In Brazil, all petrol sold contains at least 25 per cent ethanol. Sweden has recently declared it intends to be oil free by 2020. Other countries have a vision of the future which involves planning now. There will be successes and there will be failures, but if we do not start to consider alternative fuel sources the future is bleak. This government has consistently reduced investment in research and development, not increased spending in an area which is so vital to our future. For example, while Australia's crude oil reserves are equal to less than 10 years consumption, our natural gas reserves are many times higher. No-one can predict what the composition of Australia's transport fuels will be in 2020, but this is an indication of the difference which could be made if we made better use of our natural oil reserves. all the natural gas reserves we currently know about were converted to transport fuel, it would be enough to power every car, bus and truck in Australia for the next 50 years. It is not good enough for the Prime Minister to merely hold office and just seek to go on as long as he can, maybe to break Sir Robert Menzies' record as Prime Minister. He will be judged at the end of his term and by future generations on the sort of policy initiatives that he and his government introduce. In this area they are sadly lacking. There is no excuse when you have been in government for 10 years because you have had plenty of time to iron out the wrinkles and to produce substantive policy. Instead, we have seen short-term reactive policy on a whole range of fronts. In this area we are out of old fuels but potentially have access to a plentiful supply of new fuels-and that is before we consider developing other fuel alternatives. Labor has proposed a comprehensive Australian fuel industry plan-a plan which would foster the development of a more diversified fuel base. Labor believes in developing a diversified Australian fuel industry. Labor is committed to putting in place effective incentives for the development of natural gas and for a healthy resources sector in the long term. That is why Labor will reexamine the depreciation regime for gas production infrastructure, allow the selective use of flow-through share schemes for smaller operators and implement regional resource infrastructure funds to help meet the cost of providing supporting infrastructure for onshore gas and minerals processing projects helping to grow the industry. Labor will also foster demand for new Australian fuels and technologies by making alternative fuel vehicles tariff free, cutting up to $2,000 off the price of current hybrid cars; working with If state and local governments to give city traffic and parking advantages for these vehicles; and examining the granting of tax rebates for converting petrol cars to LPG. Australia also needs to lead the global race for innovation in the development of new fuels and fuel technologies. To achieve this Labor would conduct a feasibility study into a gas-to-liquids fuels plant in Australia, offer petroleum resources rent tax incentives for developers of gas fields which provide resources for gas-to-liquid fuels projects, examine a new infrastructure investment allowance for investment in Australian gasto-liquids infrastructure, develop a targeted funding scheme for research and development in this area; and work with industry to improve engine design and fuel quality standards. Labor would establish a new stream of contestable grants, supporting proposals for research into alternative fuel and its associated technologies. These grants would go to projects accessing existing private and public research money, leveraging in extra funds as well as demanding new priorities from Australia's research community. Labor proposes to ease regulation of biodiesel production on farms and encourage a sustainable ethanol industry. Labor has a vision to protect its economy so that it does not fall under the weight of a global oil crisis. We must develop a diversified Australian fuel industry. We must move forward in developing alternative fuel policy. For the life of me, I cannot see why some of these policies cannot have bipartisan support, because it should not be about political patronage from one party or the other. In this area what we need is a long-term sustainable policy-one that is not the subject of the whim of an election campaign or a shortterm election strategy. This is the test of the maturity of political parties. The Labor Party does not subscribe to the view that we should just put our heads in the sand and it will all just develop. I do not see the role of government to be like a moo-cow watching the passing traffic. I am a great believer in governments directing traffic, playing a role and creating incentives for the business sector to build the economy. This is a classic area where I think this government has been negligent and has sat on its hands. It needs to do more. I support the amendment moved by the member for Hunter and draw particular attention to paragraph (3) which: ... calls upon the government to reduce our dependency on foreign oil and to promote: (a) existing alternatives like liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel; (b) emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity; and (c) future fuels, such as hydrogen. There is much more to do to reduce this country's dependence on oil and Labor has proposed a viable plan to do just that. I also draw the attention of the House to paragraph (6) of the amendment, which: ... condemns the government for failing to strengthen the Trade Practices Act to protect competition in the petroleum industry. I firmly believe that history has shown us that, without strengthening the Trade Practices Act, we are not going to get decent competition in the petroleum industry. People behave like predators-like sharks-and unless we strengthen the Trade Practices Act as it applies to this industry this behaviour is going to continue and the consumer is going to suffer. I think you can push your ideology too far. The free marketeers, who believe you should just sit back and behave like the moocow watching the passing traffic, have got it terribly wrong. They, of course, propose the alternative argument that interventionism is wrong. I do not believe a level of intervention is wrong at all, because we do not live in a perfect world. In my view, the role of government is to intervene in the marketplace to create that equity and that fairness to help stimulate that competition. It cannot be left to the players alone. I commend the amendment of the member for Hunter to the House. I say that history will judge this government poorly on what it has done in this area in the last 10 years. It has basically been asleep at the wheel.",121
180,Mr WILKIE,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Fuel Tax Bill 2006, the Fuel Tax (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2006 and the amendment moved by the member for Hunter. These are important bills which significantly impact on a range of businesses and enterprises across the country and also within my electorate. This side of the House supports the general thrust of the bills, although with particular reservations which I will raise later. As others have mentioned, the bills are reasonably complex. They seek to replace an integrated system of fuel tax concessions with a single system providing credits claimable via business activity statements. These tax credits will replace the grants now provided under the Energy Grants (Credits) Scheme. The bills also introduce some important measures in relation to emission performance and business participation in greenhouse gas abatement programs. It must be said that we should have been having this debate some time ago. Labor was prepared to debate the contents of the bills well before this week, but fundamental differences within the coalition saw the government back down on implementation dates. This backflip would have been entirely unnecessary if the process had been handled more competently from the start. As I say, the debate of the bills is long overdue and systemic of a typically directionless government unable to properly control its legislative agenda and with ministers who, quite frankly, are not up to the task. In truth, the government has botched the entire agenda relating to fuel tax specifically and to the fuel industry and fuel regulation generally. While I speak in this place this evening, a family from my electorate is pulling into the BP petrol station in Carlisle and paying $1.33 a litre for unleaded petrol. It is the same price at Coles Express Karawara and at the Caltex in Bentley. According to FuelWatch, the Western Australian government's petrol price monitoring agency, the average price of unleaded petrol in the Perth metropolitan area in mid-June 2005 was $1.04 a litre. We fast-forward a year and today, 13 June, the metropolitan average for unleaded petrol is $1.36 a litre. As we heard earlier, is understood that over the course of the long weekend people were paying $1.49 a litre and that after the long weekend that dropped to around $1.42, which is totally unacceptable. The increase in Western Australia over the last year has been roughly 32c a litre or over 30 per cent. There is no doubt that families are being hurt by higher fuel prices. However, when the government is asked about fuel prices, it throws its hands up in the air and says there is nothing it can do about them. Most telling was the comment by the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, the member for Groom, when asked about fuel security. The minister said, ‘Yes, we do need to find more oil-yes, we do-but short of finding more oil I don't know what the solution is.' To say ‘I don't know what the solution is' is a copout. Australian fuel prices are determined by oil prices overseas, which in turn are influenced by many international factors. I do not believe there is any support for a return to the bad old days of price regulation which distorted market decisions and ultimately did not provide lasting benefits to Australians. But there have been opportunities for the government to put Australia in better stead by minimising our vulnerability and exposure to the vagaries of international oil prices. Unfortunately for all of us, the government has sat on its hands. According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, each 10c increase in retail petrol prices reduces household purchasing power by $300 per annum. Applying the Reserve Bank's formula to petrol price charges in Perth over the last year, we find that petrol prices, which have increased by 33c in that period, have reduced household disposable income by almost $1,000. In net terms, Australia relies on imports for 17 per cent of our total petrol consumpit tion but, according to the government's Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, by 2020 we will be importing 46 per cent of our petrol needs. ABARE's forecast is optimistic compared to others. For example, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, APPEA, predicts that Australia's oil dependency will rise to 78 per cent in the next 10 years-that is, a 78 per cent dependency on imported fuels. What can we do about this? How can we make our country less vulnerable to international oil price hikes? There are a number of things that we can do, but the key focus must be on research and development into new fuel and vehicle technologies. This is a national policy ignored by this government. The Leader of the Opposition detailed Labor's plans for addressing the emerging fuel crisis in his blueprint that was announced last October. It is an excellent document that provides a stark difference between the opposition and the do-nothingabout-petrol-prices government. Many on both sides of the House believe that there is insufficient competition amongst the oil companies in Australia and that anticompetitive behaviour is causing petrol prices to be higher than they need to be. We all notice the price hikes that occur in the lead-up to holiday periods and long weekends-and a number of speakers have talked about the fact that companies are often putting up their prices in the lead-up to a weekend and over that weekend and reducing the prices after the weekend when demand tends to slacken, which is absolutely absurd and really a rip-off of consumers. On the face of it, such pricing behaviour obviously appears to be opportunistic. Given these concerns, the response seems obvious: the government should immediately direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate these claims fully. The free market ideologues who believe that the oil industry is ultracompetitive, and therefore there is no problem, oppose this action, but the truth is that if the directions given to the ACCC are comprehensive and if there is no problem with anticompetitive behaviour then surely that is the answer that ACCC will provide. In other words, there is nothing to be scared of in asking the ACCC to inquire into the price hikes we have seen over the last year and the current pricing practices of oil companies. We often talk about competitiveness in the oil industry, but in reality the competitiveness arises at the bowsers of the different fuel stations that compete by slashing their margins to get people to come to their service stations. In fact, the profits of the oil companies have never been greater than they are now; therefore, we need to look at how we can ensure that consumers are actually getting some benefit. The answer is to ensure that there is competition, and this is where the ACCC needs to step in. If you look at the ACCC's website, you see there is a lot of useful information about petrol prices and petrol price cycles. But the last time the ACCC held an inquiry into petrol prices was in 2002 with the inquiry into terminal gate pricing arrangements in Australia and other fuel pricing arrangements in Western Australia. I understand that the review in Western Australia was looking at the price of LPG in relation to the cost of petroleum. Anyone who uses LPG in their vehicle would know that they are being ripped off, but unfortunately we just cannot prove it. We know that every time the price of petrol goes up the price of LPG goes up and usually the match is around half the price of petrol. We know they are up to something, but we just cannot prove it, so we really need to get the ACCC to continue to look at what is going on with those sorts of increases. Prior to that report in 2002, there were two reports, in 2000 and 2001. Given the significant increase in the bowser price over the last year, it is time for the ACCC to undertake another full inquiry into the pricing behaviour of the oil and petroleum industhe tries. I cannot understand the Treasurer's continued resistance to doing so. Perhaps he does not talk to ordinary Australian families as I do and he does not understand the fact that families are suffering. That may also explain his surprise and disappointment at not getting a fillip in the polls from his recent budget. If you talk to the families in my electorate, they will tell you that the recent est rate hike and rising petrol prices negate in many cases any relief from tax cuts and family payment rises. No wonder they are hurting. It is worth noting that amongst the measures in this legislation before the House is the abolition of the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme. This scheme costs $256 million per year and provides a grant for sales of gasoline or diesel of up to 3c per litre in nonmetropolitan regions. The scheme was introduced as part of the GST package to provide some assistance to non-metropolitan Australians. After the scheme had been operating for a couple of years, The Nationals decided that they were not getting any credit in the bush for this initiative and so the then Deputy Prime Minister announced that the government would roll the scheme into funding for the bush through ‘land infrastructure programs'. It is not at all clear that this $256 million has been rolled into such projects. The government should make it clear which new expenditure on land infrastructure will be funded from the abolition of this scheme; otherwise, the switch from this scheme will be seen as yet another swiftie pulled by the government. Unfortunately, the Treasurer's recent budget was also a document of surrender, bereft of fresh ideas and long-term vision. The budget failed to grasp the opportunity to increase the use of Australian transport fuels and reduce our reliance on foreign oil. Unlike the government, the Labor Party believes national leadership is needed to develop an agenda for the use of those fuels, which will become cheaper in the future. This is necessary and long overdue. At community forums and morning teas throughout my electorate, the cry for a national policy to address rising petrol prices and calls for the development of a national interfuel industry are clear. My message to the constituents in Swan is this: Labor will deliver this national policy and we will leave no stone unturned in assessing the viability of alternative fuels. We will develop existing alternatives such as liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel; emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity; and future fuels such as hydrogen. I am very pleased to announce that a lot of the work on technology in Western Australia, or even across the nation in hydrogen technology, is done in my electorate at the Bentley Technology Park by the CSIRO-and they are doing a fabulous job. Unfortunately, the fuel tax shambles has continued today with the government circulating major amendments less than two hours before debate on these bills resumed. This government deserves condemnation for its failure to adequately consult on the most appropriate model for the payment of fuel tax. It is certainly culpable for the confusion running rampant throughout the industry. Last month we witnessed the extraordinary situation of the minister trying to stamp out a Senate inquiry into these very changes. The member for Hunter has previously made mention of representations made to me by a local business owner involved in the solvent industry. The business proprietor provided me with a letter sent to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer last week. I understand that the member for Hunter tabled that letter earlier. I acknowledge that the minister has only recently received the letter but I would like to raise my constituent's concerns with the proposed legislation. Let me read the letter in part: I am very concerned that we were not contacted much earlier about the proposed changes so we could have had an input. We are one of the biggest solvent re-packers in Australia, we fill out Nature D40 forms now for the ATO, we have a current licence for a bonded site, so it is not like you did not know were to find us. I was aware that changes to the fuel tax system were coming earlier this year, but that was for fuel, nothing was ever mentioned about solvents, we are not, I repeat not in the fuel industry. I had to contact the ATO on the 14th of May 2006 and ask what is going on after being asked if I knew about the new tax on Mineral Turpentine from a customer of ours. What a disgrace, that this businessman has to resort to asking such questions about this confusion. Basically, this constituent will now need to find the money to pay the 38c per litre excise to the solvent companies. He purchases around 490,000 litres per month. Multiply this by 38c a litre. That is an extra $186,200 just for the first month, plus GST. He understands that he will be able to claim some back via BAS statements, but only some of it. The rest he will have to pass on to his customers, but he is required to give notice of price ranges by the contracts he has with these suppliers, in most cases of between 60 and 90 days. So, even though he is passing on these price rises, he is out of pocket until this time frame is met. Unfortunately, my constituent believes that the financial pressures involved may cause him to go bankrupt. I sincerely hope that this is not the case. I call on the government to actively work with him and with other affected Australian businesses to make sure that this does not occur. My constituent concludes his letter saying: I fully understand what you are trying to achieve but I do not believe that this will make things easier for our company as your literature suggests; it will just create a huge burden for our company, a nightmare in fact. Each time you have changed the legislation, you have done so to solve the problem or to make it more user friendly, but I cannot see how this is any clearer than what we currently have in place. This new system that you are looking at implementing actually hinders our company from doing business. The solvents industry and fuel industry are too different beasts that should not be put together. Hear, hear! I believe that my constituent has highlighted the impact of the government's clumsy and inept attempts to address the fundamental problems in its fuel policy in these bills. I call on the government to apply leadership and direction to this important issue. It was not that long ago that the Prime Minister was alarmed about being called ‘mean and tricky' by his own party president over the way in which his government dealt with the fuel tax issue in light of the introduction of the GST. Let us repeat what the party president said: the Prime Minister was mean and tricky. Once again, the Liberal Party president has been proved right on the way in which this government approaches fuel tax policy. No wonder he just received a gong in the Queen's Birthday Honours. He saved the government then by telling the truth. But, on this occasion, the government have failed to heed the lesson-and it is high time they did. Debate (on motion by Mr Dutton) adjourned. NA",124
181,Mr DUTTON,ADJOURNMENT,Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (8.58 pm)-I move: That the House do now adjourn. Health: Body Image,128
182,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT,"A lot of politicians recently have been talking about the obesity epidemic in Australia. It is very important that we do talk about obesity, but tonight I want to talk about the flipside of that debate, and that is body image. This is primarily a women's issue and, like many women's issues, it tends to be ignored at a national level. But I think it is time to address a very scary trend that is emerging in our society. Eating disorders are on the rise in Australia; and, disturbingly, they are also on the rise in school aged children. Experts say that there are many reasons why an eating disorder may develop. One medical resource for doctors treating patients with eating disorders states: Eating disorders are a complex interplay of biopsychosocial factors, including development issues, relationship and family factors, life events, biological vulnerability and socio-cultural influences. But it cannot be denied that the media has played a large role in the erosion of women's body confidence. Never before in history have Australians been so heavily bombarded with images of thin women, where thin is equated with beautiful, hip and cool. Thin sells-and the fashion industry, the advertising industry and the media know it. As a result, more and more young girls are growing up hating the way they look. They are being conditioned to despise themselves. In a recent article in the Sunday Age, the Australian Medical Association's spokesperson on body image and eating disorders, Dr Rick Kausman, is reported as saying: “I think there is increasing pressure on kids to grow up much sooner than what might be best for them, and I also think we've got caught up in a culture where the way we look is all important, even from a very young age ...” He went on to say that doctors are now treating girls as young as eight for eating disorders and that there is an increasing incidence of self-harm. Dr Kausman described this trend as a mini crisis. Yet there seems to be very little national leadership to curb it. It is now possible to access on the internet pro-anorexia websites which encourage eating disorders. If you log onto www.communities.ninemsn.com.au/AsLight AsAFeather, you will find a pro-anorexic community group. Although it appears that the community group is no longer operational, most of the content and pictures are still accessible. It features ‘thinspirational' pictures of superthin celebrities and models-such as these ones-and there are dozens of pictures of gaunt young women with their bones jutting out. One picture features a caption which says ‘nothing tastes as good as thin feels'. It features messages from young women who are suffering from eating disorders and turning to these websites in their attempts to hide their illnesses. In April this year, one girl wrote the following message: I weigh 64kg, am 168cm and I'm ... fat. I've been starving myself for a few days but my mum's started to get suspicious. I need some support, advice and some links to some good pro-ana websites. If anyone can help me that would be great. It has links to other so-called ‘pro-ana' websites, including one called Cerulean Butterfly. On this page women can learn tips on how to suppress their appetites and hide their eating disorders. It is disturbing that for three years ninemsn, an Australian company, appears to have hosted a community group that contains such dangerous content. But a disclaimer on the website says: Notice: Microsoft has no responsibility for the content featured in this group. I think it does have a responsibility and I call on ninemsn to shut this community group down to ensure that young women cannot view its content or images. One identity who features on the pages of many pro-anorexic websites as a thin inspiration is Nicole Richie, a young celebrity in the US. But it is not just on these websites that her pictures feature prominently. She has become quite the darling of many Australian magazines. No-one much in Australia had heard of Nicole Richie until she lost a lot of weight. Then, all of a sudden, she became a style icon with the Australian media. In a recent article in Vanity Fair magazine, Nicole Richie's doctor said her weight was ‘in the realm of anorexia'. Although he did not confirm that she had an eating disorder, he did not rule it out. Despite the fact that is possible she has an eating disorder, Australian magazines are portraying her as a role model. I would like to congratulate Australian Cosmopolitan magazine for banning images of Nicole Richie from a recent edition because she was too skinny. Sadly, other magazines continue to use pictures of her in their fashion sections. The Victorian government is now calling for a national code of conduct on body image, and I congratulate the youth affairs minister on her initiatives. I urge the federal government to get behind them as a matter of urgency. We need a national forum to discuss body image, drawing together the media, the fashion and advertising industries, medical professionals and other community groups. According to a study by researchers from Flinders University, almost half of girls aged between five and eight years old wish they were skinnier. The fact that girls in kindergarten have body image problems should be a wake-up call to the government. The pressure on women to conform to a certain image is growing each day and we cannot continue down this path. We need to send a message that your image is not the sole purport of your being. (Time expired) Queensland Health: Nurses",128
183,Mr LINDSAY,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to bring to the attention of the parliament my concerns about the impact of the Queensland government's offer to irresponsibly increase wage levels for public sector nurses in Queensland. The impact of this decision will be felt throughout the private sector and indeed throughout both the private and public sectors across our nation. The Queensland government has offered a wage increase to public sector nurses employed by Queensland Health of 25.3 per cent compounded plus major increases in allowances, covering the period from October 2005 to March it 2009. Where does this leave the private hospital sector? In order to maintain required staff levels, as an absolute minimum private hospitals in Queensland will need to match the Queensland Health percentage wage increases-that is, 25.3 per cent compounded-within the same time frames. Over the next three years Queensland's private sector hospitals will be forced to move closer to wage parity with the public sector. What if the private sector does not move to match the public sector increase? Quite simply, there will be an adverse impact on private sector health care service delivery and throughput, because they will lose nursing staff. Queensland Health is actively recruiting nurses in specialty areas, and if private hospitals lose staff from these vital areas it will substantially impact on service delivery. In 2003-04 private hospitals accounted for 46 per cent of total hospital separations in Queensland, and any reduction in this activity will place substantial additional demand on an already overburdened public sector. What options do private hospitals have to combat this issue? Not many. One is to allow an interim premium increase specifically for Queensland so that the health insurers have the capacity to assist their hospital providers to maintain current levels of service provision. This issue needs to be addressed urgently, whilst the public sector wage issue is currently only confined to Queensland. When the Queensland Health increases come into effect, pay levels for Victorian public sector nurses, for example, will be significantly behind those in New South Wales and Queensland. It is very likely that the Australian Nursing Federation in Victoria will move quickly to remedy the situation. This means that the uneven situation between nurses' pay levels in the public sector versus the private sector will probably spread to Victoria in the near future. I do not think there are many people who do not believe that our nurses are anything but caring, hard working and dedicated health professionals. But by recklessly creating an imbalance in nurses' pay levels the Beattie government has created a potentially national problem, particularly for the private sector health providers. With the current mess that the Beattie government has got the public health system into, can you imagine what it would be like if we did not have the private sector health system as a backup? It does not bear thinking about, yet now Queensland Health is creating an intolerable situation whereby the private health providers cannot match the new pay levels for nurses without an increase in the insurance premium. Another looming problem is the effect that this situation is going to have on the private sector hospitals operating in regional and rural Australia. Many of these smaller hospitals and health facilities-staffed by dedicated nursing professionals-have already fallen behind the public sector wage levels over the last four to five years. They are around 10 per cent to 20 per cent behind already. How are these small rural private sector hospitals going to catch up with the rapidly escalating public sector nursing wage levels? I am worried, because inevitably nurses will want to be paid at the same level as their colleagues in the larger hospitals-that is understandable, who can blame them? These little private sector hospitals out in the bush will simply have to close if they cannot meet the public sector wage levels. We know already how difficult it is for people living in regional areas to access the same level of health care as people in larger centres, and now the Beattie government is going to make it even more difficult. I am aware that a Queensland private health insurance premium increase early next year is a bitter political pill to swallow. However, as long as any premium increase awarded by the Australian government flows directly through into the Queensland private hospital system, our private hospitals will be able to maintain their current levels of service provisions. The alternative is to sit back and let the Beattie government squeeze the private health system, which will inevitably result in reduced private sector health services. The community does want better health services, not a reduction in the provision of services provided by the private health system. Once again, it is the Commonwealth that has to step in. We must fix the folly of the Beattie government's cavalier approach to the setting of nurses' wage levels. I believe it is in the best interests of everyone in our community to maintain a viable and responsible private health system. Roads: Calder Highway Gorton Electorate: Delfin Lend Lease",130
184,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to comment upon two public meetings held in the Gorton electorate last week: one dealt with the provision of education services to primary school students, and the other dealt with the lack of Commonwealth funding for the interchanges on the Calder Highway. It is always a reflection of an important issue when you arrive at a local community hall on a cold winter's night, as I did on Tuesday, to see more than 60 people attend. These people discussed their concerns about the failure of the Commonwealth to fund three interchanges, namely Calder Park Drive, which is the interchange furthest away from Melbourne CBD, the Kings Road interchange that has been promised, and also Sunshine Avenue. These three interchanges are certainly needed not only to prevent the congestion that has arisen as a result of the growth along this freeway, but also because of the growth in the number of commuters who drive through my electorate from Sunbury to Melbourne or, indeed, from further afield-from Macedon, Gisborne, and other communities-to Melbourne. That congestion is a real problem for constituents of my electorate, but also for those beyond the electorate of Gorton. A bigger issue than that, and a more critical issue for me, is the high incidence of accidents that have occurred as a result of these very unsafe intersections onto the freeway. The Commonwealth has not provided sufficient funds. The state government, although it is not its particular responsibility, has dertaken to provide half the costs of the construction of the interchanges. Of course, this would lead to far more efficient travel along this important link to Bendigo and beyond, and it would also ensure there would be fewer casualties on the roads. It is a vital matter for the constituents in my electorate, and also the constituents in Calwell. The constituents of the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, the member for MCEwen, would be equally concerned that this funding has not eventuated, that this situation has not been rectified. Therefore, I call upon the ministers for transport and roads to respond to the campaign. Already there have been petitions containing 1,600 signatures tabled in parliament calling upon the Commonwealth to rectify this matter. I know the member for Calwell has tabled a similar petition, and I call upon the member for MCEwen, across the chamber, to do the same. I know her community is hurting, and they need that addressed. The other matter I wanted to touch upon quickly is the ongoing concern of a primary school in my electorate, in Caroline Springs, and its failure to be allotted land. Delfin is a company that develops land, and it is a very important component of the development of Caroline Springs. However, it has provided the land to ICA, which was once a subsidiary of ABC Learning. ICA has not got a history of providing education to any primary school students in the country, and, therefore, the community in Caroline Springs thinks it is more important that a school that has a relationship with this community should be given the opportunity to extend their campus first and ensure that they can meet the demands of those going to that school. I hope the problem that has eventuated can be resolved. Delfin and Christ the Priest Primary School, the state government and unothers should be looking to attend to that. I have been to two public meetings. The first one had more than 300 people in attendance, which really shows you how important the issue is. I hope we can resolve that matter so that the students in Caroline Springs can properly-(Time expired) Solomon Electorate: Marrara Christian School",131
185,Mr TOLLNER,ADJOURNMENT,"Solomon) (9.13 pm)Tonight I rise to talk about the achievements of a Christian school in Darwin, working together with their local community and this government. They are maximising benefits from a small amount of government funding not only to construct a new facility but also to further their students' educational experience. During 2005 the Marrara Christian School community, under the direction of Principal John Metcalfe, built a large courtyard in front of the school library with the guidance and assistance of professionals. The project was partially funded by a grant of $92,500 from the Commonwealth government, through the Northern Territory Block Grant Authority. The rest of the funds came from the school itself. Mr Richard Hart, Marrara's design and technology teacher, coordinated the project. Students from senior technology classes assisted in this ‘real life' project and were lenged by the logistics of moving and positioning large amounts of heavy materials. This was very different from the small, light projects normally undertaken in schools. The project consisted of paving, construction of raised gardens, verandas on three sides and the erection of a large sail-shade area. Students, parents and staff were involved in all aspects of the project except for the fabrication of the shade cover. Students experienced the difficulty of using a gantry to position heavy veranda frames into the right holes at the right angle and welding them in situ. The school council supported this project even though it took 14 months to complete, during which two cyclones and a long wet season slowed the work. They believed the benefit to the students and community made the long time frame very worthwhile. The council consists of Neil Wright, the chairman; Narelle Campbell; James Cox; Richard Exley; Herman Nyhuis; Robert Jackson; and staff representative Lyne Hansen. A new project designed to increase students' access to ‘real life' work situations has grown out of the training success of the library courtyard. Marrara Christian School is now running a commercial wall frame fabrication workshop, where students have the opportunity to gain their Certificate II in construction by working one day a week at the on-site workshop. It appears that the project is going to be a commercial and educational success. St John's College Darwin and Woolaning Homeland Christian School are already working with Marrara Christian School to provide their students with the same experience. Nhulunbuy High School has also expressed an interest in the fabrication facility. Some people played a significant role in the library courtyard project. The school is grateful to the NTBGA for the flexibility it chalshowed in allowing the project to be community based. Mr Greg O'Mullane, the BGA executive officer, has been supportive of the school's work. The Marrara Christian School Council and Principal, John Metcalfe, were committed to a long project in return for the training that the students received. The school business manager, Dave Arthur, played a research and coordinating role for resources and supervising tradesmen willing to work with parents and students. Staff members Mr Richard Hart, Wilf Lahring, Paul Huddleston, Ian Ward and Kevin Powell spent considerable time working with students and parents on the project. The male teaching staff donned gumboots very early one morning to lay concrete before the students arrived for lessons. The senior students from the woodwork, metal work and technology classes worked during lessons and in their own time to learn skills in construction, bricklaying, rendering, garden construction, paving and welding. Two senior students, Daniel Vreeling and Mark Lahring, were responsible for the lion's share of the welding on frames and construction of verandas and they worked on the project during weekends. Two working bees saw a strong turnout of parents and staff to complete the paving under the supervision of a professional paver, Mick Dryger. Mr Charlie Aggelopoulos, a parent from the school, gave his time and machinery to drill a large number of 2.4 metre deep holes to support the structural poles. This school community demonstrates that the pioneering spirit that built the Northern Territory is far from over. The successful completion of the project shows what a committed community can do efficiently by using and value-adding to a finite amount of funds. This project not only completed more than the original concept in terms of construction but also developed young Australians' skills and gave them invaluable work experience. (Time expired) Workplace Relations",132
186,Mr HAYES,ADJOURNMENT,"Werriwa) (9.19 pm)Earlier today we witnessed yet another example of the desperate measures that this government will take to silence debate on its extreme industrial relations laws. We saw government members march into this place to silence the Leader of the Opposition as he tried to hold the Prime Minister to account over his 2005 commitment: It would be absurd and unfair and unreasonable, if somebody has to work on a public holiday, that that person isn't compensated by being paid whatever it is-the double time or the time and a half ... The Prime Minister and the members opposite do not want to hear about the real impact of their extreme industrial relations laws. They certainly do not want to hear that people do not like them and do not want these laws imposed upon them-in fact, they do not want a situation where the bargaining power in the workplace is removed from them and increased for their employer. The Prime Minister wants to cut and run from the commitment he gave to Australians because he never really believed it. He does not believe that people should receive penalty rates for working on public holidays. In fact, this government would prefer it if penalty rates were not paid at all. The member for Macarthur said only last week that he does not think there is anything wrong with no overtime pay, no meal breaks, no penalty rates and no leave loading. He was also reported as saying that people should consider themselves lucky to have a job. This typifies the attitude of this government when it comes to industrial relations. It certainly typifies this government's attitude to working Australians. Last weekend, the Leader of the Opposition gave a commitment to move to protect penalty rates for public holidays. This morning that is exactly what he did-he moved to do just that, but he was stopped because the government is happy to have people working on public holidays for no extra pay. This morning Labor members voted to support the right of working Australians to receive adequate compensation for giving up time with their families to work on public holidays. Government members opposite are on the record now as refusing to support that. They refuse to support the protection of penalty rates on public holidays because they believe that those rates are worth trading off for as little as 2c an hour. This government talks tough on security until it comes to protecting job security. This government has introduced laws to legalise the actions of bad employers and to force good employers to join them in a race to the bottom. Everyone who knows anything about economics or about operating a business knows that increasing productivity and creating jobs is not achieved by cutting wages. This government has yet to provide one shred of evidence that supports its argument that productivity will be improved by the cutting of wages. It defies logic that people are going to work harder if we pay them less money. What is worse is that this government continues to hang its entire defence of AWAs around the absurd statistic that employees on AWAs earn, on average, 13 per cent more than those on certified agreements. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has blown that misleading statistic out of the water. The ABS data shows that the hourly rate of pay for non-managerial employees on individual contracts is lower than that of workers on collective agreements, despite what the Prime Minister tried to tell us in question time today. The broad based introduction of individual contracts is used to achieve one thing and one thing only-wage reductions-and that is exactly what is occurring. We have already heard that every single AWA checked since the new laws came into effect has at least one protected award condition removed. Two out of three scrap leave loadings and penalties. In more than half of them, shift loadings were abolished. In one out of six of them, every single award entitlement has been removed. This government's objection to penalty rates was writ large this morning when it would not support the restoration of adequate compensation for Australians who are working on public holidays. Working Australians in every part of the labour force deserve fairness in the workplace and this government has no interest in delivering it. Members opposite are scared about the public backlash against these extreme industrial relations laws and they have every reason to be. Grey Electorate",134
187,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Grey) (9.24 pm)Travelling through my electorate in recent days has reminded me of the wonderful economic climate that we currently enjoy and of the progress that our community is making. I will mention a few examples here tonight. Cabinet Minister Warren Truss was in Port Lincoln on Saturday a week ago and opened a magnificent community centre at Ravendale in Port Lincoln. It was great to have him there and to celebrate the team effort of a whole range of local people who have put this magnificent facility together. It will serve the people of Port Lincoln extremely well in the years ahead. The day before, after the parliamentary sitting week, I moved up into the Flinders Ranges to share with former Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Tim Fischer, a great celebration at Rawnsley Park, the facility of the Smith family, opening some magnificent ecocabins. They are magnificent structures and will serve the national, the state and the international tourist trade with distinction, I am sure. Something with a little bit of difference is the community of Yalata. Not many Australians would know of Yalata perhaps. It is 200 kilometres to the west of Ceduna. It is an Aboriginal community. The old Lutheran church was falling down because of a whiteant problem and Lutherans and other denominations from all over Australia got together and built a magnificent structure at Yalata. The construction teams came in at least two waves from all over Australia to construct the church. In a service led by two Aboriginal pastors, we learnt of this great national team effort from those within the Christian community. As a local community leader said to me on the day, ‘Many always expect the government to do everything but we were determined to create this building with our own efforts.' Last Wednesday evening at Tumby Bay I celebrated the school community skills centre at the Tumby Bay Area School. It has had magnificent leadership from the community and with some support from the federal government in supporting vocational education-to the tune of about $220,000-we are seeing the olive industry value adding and the young people getting alternative skills to give themselves a better chance to remain in their own community. These success stories are just a small sample of the great achievements of this government-ever active and ever driving our nation forward, giving added opportunity to individuals. On the aged care front, I had occasion to be in Port Lincoln once again, at the Matthew Flinders Nursing Home with their chief executive officer, Kent Crack, looking at a facility there to the value of about $3.5 million which will serve that community magnificently well. This was once again an example of cooperative effort, supported by a federal government which has seen a doubling in aged care in the last 10 years, from about $2.6 billion to about $5.2 billion. Can I respond to the previous speaker, Mr Hayes, on workplace relations in the few seconds that I have left. When I listen to this set, stereotyped approach about 2c an hour and about not getting money for weekend work and public holidays and individual contracts, I am reminded of when I was trying to grow wheat as a small business and wondering where the next dollar and the next shower of rain was coming from. The whole marketplace-the whole community, quite frankly-was not interested in whether I was paid an extra 2c. They could not give a damn if I was paid nothing. The idea was to deliver a product. That was what I had grown up with. (Time expired) Question agreed to.
