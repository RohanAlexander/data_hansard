SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 17th September area (vide page 4754), on motion by Mr . That this Bill be now read a second time.",21
22,Mr MACKAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Lilley) [ 3 . 1 3 ] - I welcome this amendment of the War Service 398 Homes Act, because it is intended to make useful legislation still more generous. Senator E . D . Mille n may well be con1,040 gratulated on the results of his adminis. tration of the Repatriation Department, and I feel that this branch of its opera94 tions is going to yield very excellent results indeed The War Service Homes Act is serving a double purpose. Whilst it makes provision for suitable homes for 13 returned soldiers and soldiers' de1,545 pendants, it is also very materially assisting in solving the housing problem in acmany of the large centres of the Commonwealth. 52 I am very pleased that the Bill now 13 before us proposes to increase the advance .. 13 made available to returned soldiers for Total .. . . 5S1 this purpose from £700 to £800 in all towns and cities. But I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation the circumstances of the soldier land settlers, for the all sufficient reason that men who settle on the lands in the various Statesare deserving of treatment at least as generous as that accorded to their comradeswho settle; in towns and cities. The point I wish to make* is that soldier land settlers, have to clear and plant, theu land, to purchase implements, vehicles) and live stock, and provide a home for a less amount than is available to returned soldiers who settle in towns and cities. On the 25th August last I asked the following question: Whether it is proposed to increase the loan from the Commonwealth to the States for soldiers' land settlements from £625 to £1,000? If. so, as the amount of £625 isgenerally regarded as being insufficient, will the Minister endeavour to> make aportion of the additional sum also available to the soldier settler? The reply whioh I received to that ques the Minister for Repatriation, was as follows :The agreement provides that the Commonwealth shall advance to the States thesum of £625 per settler (on. the average-) as-working capital, and that a further sum equal to £375 per settler, will be made availablein nexion with soldier settlements for works, &c, approved by the Commonwealth. It is not proposed to further increase the loan of £625 persettler now made available, whichamount was. incseasedi from £500 early iii 1.919. I understand that this arrangement was decided upon-at the-Premiers' Conference quite recently held in Melbourne. It is truethat land, in Queensland is much cheaper than in any of the other States of the Commonwealth, hut it is equally true that the sum of £625 is insufficient to meet all requirements of the soldier settlers. I think that honourable members will agree with me that it is better that we should settle one man under conditions which will afford him a reasonable chance of success than that we shouldstart two men, under conditions which will-, render theirefforts liable tofailure. At Beerburuumj. in my electorate^, theQueensland. Government have settled some 40.0. returned soldiers who are engaged in growing pineapples. Ife might, appear at first glance that the terms offeredl tp-these-men are very reasonable.. It is possible in this, class ofland settlement for a mantoiget alongvery well indeed on. an area of from 20 to 40acres. Mr Mackay. I wish to informhonorable members as to the terms which the settlers at Beerburrumi are asked to. fulfil with, the object, of showing that the WarServiceHomes Department must certainly come to their rescue, if they are to make a success of ; their settlement. As I have said, the area givem to these men. is from 20to40' acp.es; the tenure of the land is a perpetual lease, and the annual rent charged is l £ 1 per cent, of the capital value of the land', which averages 20s. per acre. No rent, or survey-fee is asked fbr during the ficst three years. The survey-fee then, becomes payable, and the payment is spread over ten years. At the end of the first, fifteen years the areas are re-assessed by the Land Court. Queensland has immense areas of Crown lands; and. in the circumstances the Government can well afford to give soldier settlers even more liberal conditions than those I have mentioned. I know the land at Beerburrum, on which the returned soldiers are settled very well, and fbr many years it. was open toany man whocame alongand cared to select it at 2s. 6d. per acre, payableover con- fiye years, at the end of which period the selector secured the freehold ofhis selection. I submit that in view of the very liberal terms at which this land was open to selection in previous years,, the price which the soldier settlers, are asked to pay for it isaltogether too great'. As the title which they are givenis aperpetual lease, and there is provision fbr a. re-assessment in fifteen years, this means that at the end of that period the man who has made most improvements on his farm will be called upon to pay a higher rental for the future thantheman who has been more neglectful of his opportunities. I . have discussed this matter on many occasions - with, the men,, and cannot recall an instance in. which oneof them has preferred the perpetual lease system. They would rather pay more for their land and get the freehold at the end of afixed period. It is certainly correct that a mancan succeedvery well at growing pineapples on - a small area of 5 - acres; but,, in. order to show that further .assistance should be given to these men, through the Repatriation scheme or under the: War Service HomesAct,. Mr Alston, the - secretary of the Beerburrum Fruit-growers Association, ihas supplied me with the following particulars :Thp foregoing are the actual figures of the principal items of my own aeeount. There however, other things that settlers have have that I brought with me, or have bought myself, and I give herewith, as near possible, the present-day cost of establishing the settler with 5 acres of pines; suckers cost £4 per 1,000:Clearing 5 acres, at £27 10s. . . Ploughing twice and harrowing, at £3 acre Running roots .. Bonedust .. Planting and drilling .. Suckers, at £4 jaer 1,000 -30,00 0 .. ..

But it is from the housing point of view that I approach this question. hou3e on these blocks is about 24 feet by 20 feet over all, and is built of hardwood, but, as the timber comes fresh from the mills, it shrinks rapidly. contains four rooms, and there is no lining. Therefore, it will be readily seen how inexpensive these dwellings are. able I hope to be able to induce the Comthe monwealth .Government to come to the rescue of these soldier settlers, if they are to be successful, must be comfortably settled on their hold1,101 ings. I want the Minister to take these facts into consideration, so that the Commissioner may be induced to provide better homes for these men. It is quite evident from the figures I have assistance given that the advance of £625 is not l a sufficient to cover the planting of the M in ground and the purchase of .the necessary w implements, the cost of which exceeds the advance by £42.",21
23,Mr EODGEBS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Advance s under the War Service Homes Act for the building are, of ihouses are quite distinct from any to arrangement made between the Commonwealth and the States, under which adas vances are made for the building of now homes on a broad acres proposition.",23
24,Mr MACKAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I understand peri s. d. fectly well that the £625 is advanced by 137 10 0 the Commonwealth to the States, and 30 0 0 that thereafter the States are responsible 6 0 0 for it ; but I am 'anxious to see an altera14 0 0 tion brought about. We propose to allow 16 5 0 an advance of £800 to be made to a returned .soldier living in a town or a city, 120 0 0 to enable him to secure a home for him323 15 0 self, but, at the same time, we expect a 250 0 0 man settled on the land, not only to ac13 0 0 quire the ground and buy his implements 20 0 and other articles, but also to erect a 15 0 house-the value of a standard cottage 15 being £250-ou t of a total advance of 5 £625. I hold that the returned soldier in S a country district should be placed on the same footing as the man in a town. 667 15 0 In Queensland, I regret to say, the State Government are not nearly as symthe pathetic to returned soldiers as are a pineGovernments in other States.",23
25,Mr ATKINSON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Accordin g to the Afterhonorable member for West Sydney (Mr, one Ryan), the Queensland Government have done more than any other Government in the matter of settling returned soldiers Each on the land.",23
26,Mr MACKAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am aware that the Queensland Government have repeatedly Each house claimed that they have settled more men on the land than any other State Government have succeeded in doing; but in answer to a question put by the honormember for Flinders (Mr Bruce) other day, the Minister told us that 5,470 men had been settled in Victoria, who, 4.210 in New South Wales, 2,819 in Western Australia, 1,867 in Queensland, in South' Australia, and 1,430 in Tasmania, making a total of 16,897. Another class of returned soldier in Queensland is the one who cannot obtain to purchase or i m p r o v e f r e e h o l d n d , and as I know that the H o n o r a r y is t e r (' Mr Rodgers) is in s y m o at h t y it h the m a n w h o settles on w h a the has m a n y times t e r m e d the "" b r o a d acres,"" I look to him to endeavour to find some solution of their difficulty. It is well known .that the Queensland State Government are opposed to the freehold tenure system, and the present position is that unless a Queensland soldier is prepared to accept a perpetual lease, he is not entitled to any assistance, either from the Commonwealth or from the State. I think the Commonwealth Government ought to endeavour to get the State Government to make an exception in his case. In my electorate there are quite a number of returned men who hold freeholds-man y of them have been given their land by their parents-and all they want now is some assistance to enable them to improve them, and probably build homes on them. I would like the Minister to look into their case, and see whether some assistance could not be rendered to them under the provision of the War Service Homes Act.",23
27,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"This matter has up very often, and ought to be solved at once, but if Commonwealth money is used for effecting improvements on State holds, the trouble is that if there is any surrender from failure to comply with the conditions attaching to the leasehold, those improvements revert to the State.",24
28,Mr MACKAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The Honorary M in ister is somewhat anticipating my remarks. For the moment I am referring to freeter. hold land, and I say that in regard to such land the Commonwealth Government have no possible excuse for withholding assistance under the War Service Homes Act.",24
29,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I thought that the orable member was referring to leaseholds.,24
30,Mr MACKAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"No . I am referring to the fact that the Queensland State vernment refuse to give assistance to the and 1917. owners of freehold land to effect improve1914 ments upon it , or purchase stock. The land to which the Honorary Minister was referring is held under mining tenure, is the case with all the land built on such large places as Gympie, Charters Towers, Mount Morgan, and Gladstone. Under the Wa r Service Homes Act the returned soldier can get no assistance wards having a house built on land held also. under mining tenure. Banks and private individuals have no hesitation in accepteffecting ing this title and lending money on i I know the Commonwealth Government has no control over this matter, but ask them to endeavour to induce the State Government, either by agreement or even by legislation, to extend such protection to mining tenure titles as will give the returned soldiers who hold them the benefits of the War Service Homes Act. They are of two kinds-the residence area title and the gold-fields homestead title. The first is, I admit, rather a trumpery sort of title, because it is held fro m year to year. The man pays 5s. a year to the Warden's Office and gets his t it l e in that way. The homestead title is much sounder. The holder pays 5s. a year, and in thirty years gets the title endorsed as having all rents paid up. I admit that the Government must have some protection in seeing that the conditions of the Act are observed, but I am sure that the difficulty can be easily got over by some arrangement with the State Government.",24
31,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,It is a matter that the State Government can speedily fix cropped up by passing a short Bill .,24
32,Mr MACKAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Have the Commonwealth Government done anything to in leaseduce the State Government to do so?,24
33,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I can promise the honourable member that if on inquiry I find it is necessary, I will make representations to the State Government.",24
34,Mr MACKAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am glad to have that assurance from the Assistant MinisAnother question which requires attention is the position of the munition workers who went away early in 1914. Quite a number of these men, to their credit, left Australia quite early when hon the Empire called them, and have as good, if not a better, claim to assistance under this Act than the men who went Goaway under agreement as late as 1916 Those who went away in and remained t ill the conclusion of the war certainly made greater sacrifices than those who went just before the war as ended. I am not prepared to say that in the munition workers should be included at all. but if those who went under agreement with the Commonwealth are to be brought in , then those who went away tomuch earlier should certainly be included I quite approve of the Commissioner his own insurance on the buildt . ings that are being erected. He is in a very fortunate position, inasmuch as I he needs no capital, and for that reason can compete on very favourable terms with private insurance companies. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) quoted the State Insurance Department of Queensland as an example to this Government. Strange as it may appear, I am with the honourable member there. The one State industrial Department of Queensland which has justified itself has been the In surance Department. Bates were very high for many years in that State, and it was time that the insurance people had a lesson. I appreciate the fact that the Commissioner is to be enabled to insure the houses on such very good terms. I shall not say much about the timber deal. I know the conditions of Queensland, and the great scarcity of timber that exists there. The price, of timber has been largely increased by the action of the State Government. When they went into power in 1915 the royalty on timber in that State was as low as Is. 6d. per 100 super, feet. It has been creased to 15s., so that to a large extent the present State Government are responsible for the price at which timber is sold in Queensland today. I hope this timber deal will turn out all that the Government desire, but before it was concluded, the Department might well have referred it either to the Public Works Committee or to the Public Accounts Committee. It would not have been an expensive inquiry, nor would much delay have taken pla'ce; and honourable members would have had all the information at their disposal, and would have been in a better position to judge whether the decision to make such a large purchase was justified or not. I hope the Mini<ter will look into the matters I have mentioned, and that a? a result an improvement in the working of the Act will take place, and that many of the men who are harshly kept out of ' its benefits will become entitled to them.",24
35,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"South Sydney) [3.36] I have pleasure in supporting the Bill to the extent to which it goes in increasing the amount that may be advanced for returned soldiers' homes. same time the Commissioner could have carried on even without the increase if he had used a little more common sense in the erection of houses. All through the United States and Europe the folding bed or press-bed system has been adopted. That is a device which can be folded up during the day and let down at night, so that the same room can be used for a sitting-room, or dining-room, or bedroom. By adopting this system, at least one room in each house could be saved. I have seen the beds made in the factory, and have seen demonstrations of their usefulness in large buildings. If the Commissioner had decided to install them in the War Service Homes- I believe they cost about £25-h e could have saved at Ieaet £150 on each cottage, because a room cannot be built today under £ 1 5 0 . The bed is a beautiful piece of furniture on the one side, and when required it can be revolved and let down for sleeping purposes. It is very comfortable and clean. It is being used in all the large up-to-date hotels throughout Europe, and is being installed in the big flats in Sydney. I wish the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) would take the opportunity to inspect the article, and insist on the Commission utilizing to the full every economic imi n - provement possible in house building. Another advantage is that the bed is made in Australia. Newland Brothers have bought the patent ' rights from America, and employ Australian workmen. If the Minister would look into it , I am sure he would recognise the great advantage that the soldier would get from the adoption of the system. I trust he will not overlook it .",25
36,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I have carefully noted it , and called it "" the combination room.""",25
37,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"That is a good description. I assure honourable members that the bed is a beautiful improvement in the home. I shall say nothing about the way in which the timber areas and mills were recently purchased by the Government in Queensland, nor about the value of the mills, or the negotiations that were entered into to take them over. But I do say that it is in the interests of the soldiers and of the country that the Government should not be in the hands of any Timber Combine. I welcome the principle of the Government purchasing and controlling timber mills in order to secure At the their own supplies. I am familiar with some of the large timber firms in 'New South Wales. Certain honourable members opposite have remarked that they have known many timber millers to become insolvent. I have had no such experience, but I know of a large number who have made fortunes out of the business. What has been the result of the Government becoming huse competitors for timber ? The price of material has steadily gone up and upu n t i l , today, it is nearly 1Q0 per cent, higher than it she-Id. be. We have been told that one of the reasons why timber costs so much is that there has been such a shortage shipping. In New South Wales there is quite a leet of small vessels trading up cheap homes. and down the rivers, bringing supplies of hardwood to Sydney, and, notwithstandnot ing the fact that there has been no disextensively ? locationof this trade owing to any shortage of river shipping, the price of New South Wales hardwood has gone up step by step in general keeping with the cost, other directions. of all timber supplies. The result is t h our soldiers., today, have to pav 100 cent, more for their timber than should be asked of them.",25
38,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Are there any State timber mills in New South Wales?,26
39,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Not that I am aware although there are State joinery works, and the like.",26
40,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"There are State mills Queensland and Western Australia, but they have not had much effect in the matter of reduction of prices.",26
41,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"That may be so,. New South Wales we have State brick for works, but they have notdone much tion. towards keeping down the. price, of bricks. The. reason is. that their management has beencarriedon in such a way as to merely keepthe. price a shilling or two below the Combine) prices.",26
42,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Thei r managers are torn betweentwo desires-the one to make aprofit, and the other to supply bricks at a fairprice to the community.",26
43,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"At any rate, they made such profits as to have been able pay off the cost of their machinery and their works, generally; and they do not sell their bricks much below the Combine price. The Brick Combines throughout the Commonwealth are deriving huge the profits from the great demand for bricks; and if the Commonwealth Government, Sydney in view of their own house-building repeople quirements, desired to put an end to the. profiteering activities of the Combines, they should investigate and go in for new designofconcrete buil'ding. Government could put up concrete homes at an average of about 50 per cent, less cost than in the case of brick structures. Two labourers and a carpenter are suffiHe cient to erect the whole of the. walls of cottage built of ashes and cement. Mr Fenton. - That is not concrete.",26
44,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"It makes a good stout home, and by the use of this method of of construction, our returned men, and the public generally, could be provided with Mr RiCHARD; FOSTER - Then why do the Government go in for the system",26
45,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I do not know why the Commissioner has not launched out in The small number of at homes so far erected is a matter of little per credit to himself and the Government.,26

It has been said by way of. excuse that the Comof, missioner ' has been hampered by the activities of the Combines; but anyman who had the influence and the money in of the Government behind him should 1I have got over these difficulties long ago, and should have buil t infinitely more homes in the same time.

48,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,That branch was running splendidly before.,27
49,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"It was; and at about half the expense. With regard to the proposition that soldiers' homes should be built of concrete, I would remind the Government that in the Home and Territories Department 'there is a report Slaving to do with the ^manufacture of cement. The P.arliamewtary Works Committee reported, some ""time ago, on cement manufacture at ""Barry Meadows. The Government have the land at that spot, and 'they have the 'best marble stone ""in the country with which to manufacture .cement. :The Government :are .the biggest consumers <of 'Cement in .Australia; they icannot secure enough for the Murray River works salone. The time is ripe when they should institute their own cement works. The price is still ^steadily rising, and ""fife Government - are requiring more and more - of the commodity.

Why do mot the Government import cement, ;so long as there is a shortage in Australia, thus/assisting to secure their own requirements ;and relieve the general .market? MT. FENTON - We ought 'to be making our own cement",27
51,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"But , while we are not doing so, surely we might as well be utilizing our Commonwealth steamers for the importation of supplies. With regard to our blinded and disabled soldiers, I hope the Government will be as generous as possible. The Eederal Parliament, I know, will endorse any action which the Government may take to render lighter the burden of incapacitated men. We have not been as generous as we should have been. We should take steps to treat them more generously, and then to make it an offence for maimed and blinded men to be standing at the street corners begging in association with bands. It is not good to see .maimed men hopping about, shaking - boxes for contributions from the public. - It is a reflection - on the whole - community. We cannot blame the men,, if they have not got enough to keep themselves,; but the Government should see to it that there is no need for them to be begging. It is a reflection upon Parliament and the country that we are not providing sufficient money to save those men from begging in the streets. In regard to the recent purchase of saw-mills and timber land in Queensland, I stand for the principle of - the Government supplying their own timber, anil keeping vout of the hands »f .the Combine. If the Government do that, they will be - rendering a .service to the country. MT.. CAMERON (Brisbane) '[3 -5aj|.I add my ""congratulations to the Government on the samendments to the existing r law - which this B*ill iseeks to effect. 'The increase in ithe - amount to be advanced firom £7-00 .to £800 is <a redemption of a ipromise made some time ago., and is, <ob'viously, necessary on account - of the in creased '-cost of labour and material. With .regard to the 'extension >of benefits under the Act, I ;am glad that those 3nen wih® senitiered camp ibut were 'discharged 'before leaving Australia-mostly , I believe, :men who were in - camp when - the - Armistice was signed--ar e to be in-chided. No doubt they broke up their homes in order to enlist, 'and - they should be entitled, to participate in the advantages whioh the War Service Homes Act offers. I welcome the inclusion, also, of the seamen and the wireless - personnel employed in the war zone, and I am glad that the wives of men mentally afflicted will be given the right to apply for homes. Honourable members on all sides of the House have urged that the benefits should be extended also to munition workers and war workers generally. Under the existing law, those munition and war workers who went abroad under arrangement with the Defence Department are included, but the Government are now urged to include those workers who went to Great Britain independently of the departmental scheme. This opens up a very big question. There are many sad cases amongst the dependants of munition workers who returned to Australia suffering from some disability contracted on the other side of the world. They are not entitled to any benefits under the War Service Homes Act, or even under the Invalid Pensions Act, because the affliction was contracted outside tralia. I have no objection to the inclusion of all the munition and war workers provided that the Government can, with due regard to the financial obligations of the country, see their way to adopt that policy. However, the applications of those who were included under the original Act should receive priority, so that they may get their homes first. It is very difficult for a vocational trainee to secure a WST Service Home. The_ regulations provide, rightly no doubt, .that a man must prove that his financial position is such as will enable him to meet his obligations in regard to a home. That bears very hardly upon a trainee who is a married man with a family. Many of these men, owing to some disability caused by the war, have been unable to Teturn to their pre-war occupations, and are now being trained for a new position in civilian life. They must live somewhere, and I maintain that the rent they must now pay would, in most cases, exceed their weekly obligations under the War Service Homes Act. I trust that the Minister will look into this matter, and do something to assist the vocational trainees, particularly the married men. The Minister for Mr Cameron. Repatriation (Senator Millen) stated in another place that of the total amount of £116,144 due by soldier occupants under this scheme, up to 30th June last, all but £2,447 has been repaid. This is a splendid record; the Australian soldier in 'his efforts to re-establish himself in civilian life, and to meet his obligations, is working out a splendid sequel to the story of his achievements in France and the other theatres of war.",27
52,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Hunter) [3.55] This is a measure which must be dealt with chiefly in Committee. There does not appear to be any very big principle involved, except in regard to the increase of the amount of advance from £700 to £800. The time has arrived when we very must be very careful of what we do in this regard. I know that at the present juncture it is absolutely necessary to increase the amount, in order that the soldier may get what may be termed a respectable home. But, in the interests of the soldiers themselves, we should have been more guarded in the past than we Aus- have been. We have permitted costs in connection with these homes to increase at the same fate as the prices of commodities generally, with the result that the soldier will find himself saddled with a heavy burden of debt. It must not be forgotten that the money which the Commonwealth advances for the purpose of establishing these homes must be repaid to the Treasury by the soldiers. Therefore, we ought to be careful to see that .the homes are built as cheaply as possible. At the initiation of this scheme, I urged that steps should be taken to provide Commonwealth-controlled brickworks and sawmills in the'different States; and I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr Riley) that some arrangement ought to have been made for insuring supplies of cement at a reasonable price. Had that policy been adopted, probably the Government would not have been asking Parliament today' to increase, by £100, the amount to be advanced to each' applicant, and the soldier would have been able to get as good a home for less than £700. I know that recently steps have been taken by the Department to secure saw-mills and timber lands in Queensland. With the principle of that purchase I am in agreement. I know nothing of the merits of the transaction itself, and, therefore, I will not commit myself to any criticism, beyond saying that the Government seem to have paid an enormous amount for the properties they have 'acquired.",28
53,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,It is stated that Lahey's property was offered to the Queensland Government four years ago at half the price paid by the Commonwealth Government.,29
54,Mr CHAELTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Have the late owners been cutting on the property in the meantime?,29
55,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"They .have .been cutting at the rate of 8,000,000 feet per annum during the last four years; and of the 10,000 acres, there is only about 3,000 acres of timber left. .",29
56,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"If that statement is correct, the Government seem to have paid an excessive amount for the property. At any rate, there is room for a searching inquiry into the transaction.",29
57,Mr BAYLEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"On the figures that have been supplied to us, that statement is not correct.",29
58,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The mills are in five different places, and will require five different managers.",29
59,Mr CHAELTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The . Government have paid a large amount for the sawmills, and any doubt as to the transaction should be cleared up. I know that sawmills could have been acquired for less than the amount which the Commonwealth has paid in Queensland. In my own district there are mills which could have been purchased very much cheaper. The Government might also have obtained the requisite authority to cut supplies of timber in the State forest in the North Coast district. They would thus have obtained much cheaper supplies than they are getting at But these steps should have been taken at the inception of the War Service Homes scheme. We are in duty bound to protect the men who fought for the Empire overseas, and we are not protecting them' when we allow prices for the supply of the requisite materials for these homes to continually increase, thereby compelling each soldier to pay more for his home. We have not adopted sufficient precautions to insure that he shall get his home as cheaply as possible. It is pleasing to learn that, so far, the Department been able to erect homes by day labour for considerably less than they have been able to erect them by contract. From a statement made by the Minister for Eepatriation (Senator Millen) I gather that more than £ 1 0 0 per cottage has been saved by the adoption of the day labour system, as compared with the contract system. That is a considerable sum to the soldier, and a saving which will justify the Government in erecting more of these homes by means of day labour. I am somewhat disappointed to know that the best land upon which to erect these homes has not been selected. I am speaking more particularly of land in the Newcastle district. I have not one word to say against the homes themselves, but I submit that the land upon which they are being erected is very unsuitable for the purpose. In the Newcastle district a large number of homes are being built upon the flattest land to be found there.",29
60,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Is it well drained ?,29
61,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"There is a drain which was put through it by the State Government some years ago for the purpose of carrying the water away from it . But it is a cold spot in the winter, and the fogs hang there throughout the greater portion of the day..",29
62,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Was any protest made against the purchase of the land at the time of its acquisition t,29
63,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Not so far as I am aware. I have been a resident of the Newcastle district for many years, and I claim to know the land well. I would not myself live in a house in - that situation. Plenty of elevated and cheaper land could have present. been. obtained in that district-lan d which would have been much more suitable for the erection of soldiers' homes. When we put these homes upon low-lying lands we are not doing the best that is possible for our returned men from a health stand-point. W it h in half a mile, or a mile, of this particular site suitable land at a cheaper cost could have been obtained. Upon the other side of the railway, a man recently purchased a large area, which he has subdivided and sold at a good profit. As there are quite a number of soldiers' homes to be has erected in this district, I hope that the Minister will recommend - to the Commisthe sioner that in the - future he - should chase 'only such land as is well suited for the purpose.",29
64,Mr GEEGOEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Dampier) [4.5] - A examination of this Bil l would lead to believe, with the exception of a small amendment which is set out in proposed new section 14A, that the desire of the Government is to give the Commissioner even far greater powers than he already possesses.

Prices have been rising, and it has been almost impossible to obtain the requisite supplies of material. But in the report which was submitted, to this Parliament no mention was made of the fact that the Commissioner had recently entered into a three years' contract to purchase 6,0.0.0,000 feet of Queensland pine per annum at 32s. per 100 feet at the m ill , representing 35s. at Brisbane. The Commissioner has estimated timber costs at 56s. A r e we to assume that, he is buying some timber at 35s. in Brisbane and estimating 56s. for the timber from his own mills?",31
67,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The honourable member knows, surely, that when differing rates apply it is the practice to average the cost,",31
68,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes ; but what will happen in two or three years' time when we are beginning to get supplies of red and white pine direct from the Baltic, and prices are coming down to nearer pre-war levels ?",31
69,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The difficulties of present are sufficient without anticipating what may happen three ye'as hence.,31
70,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"But will the! Minism-u-nitio-n ter give us an assurance that this, puron. chase will be referred to, the Public counts Committee?",31

72,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"As chairman of that Committee, I would hardly care to ask this definitionthat. I should prefer an investigation to be made by the Public Accounts Comtlie mittee, and if members of that body are in satisfied that a good deal has been made, I am sure that the House will be satisthe fied also. This course ought to be taken. When the Bill reaches Committee I in tend to move in the direction of compelThere ling the Commissioner to f u r n i sh Parliawould ment with a half-yearly return showing the results of the m ill operations. I not know whether the Minister is aware of' the fact, or whether I am making a mistake, but from a casual perusal o Act I believe the Commissioner is not quired to provide returns at all.",31
73,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,- I think I was responI recog- sible for the insertion in the. main Rer patriation Ball of the provision requiring annual returns. *,31
74,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"But that provision does not appear in the Act. I was not present when it w.ent through, so I exoneratemyself from any blame in connection with the matter. I happened thento be in Western Australia. So far as I can see, with the exception of money borrowed' from the SavingsBank, the Commissioner is not obliged to make returns at all, but he may make appointments or spend' money how and when he likes. The Go1 vernment, in effect, have given him power to spend £500,000 in the purchase of these trading concerns without being required to furnish annual returns to Parliament showing the results of their operations. This is not right. I know of no other Department insuch a unique position, and I certainly will do what I can to amend the Bill m the directionindicated. There is anotherfeature of the measure to which I might direct attention. How many of us know anything about theCommissioner's ability to determine eligibilit y under the Act. In the Act we had a fairly reasonable definition of an "" eligible person,"" but this definition has the beenremoved from the Bill , and we are toldthat ""eligible person"" means any personwho is an Australian soldier, a worker, or war worker, and soThat is to say, if the Commissioner is Acsatisfied withregardto anapplication by any person claiming to be a war worker^ he may be allowed the privileges of this Bill . If we are going to allow the Comthe. missioner to erect houses for every personin the community, why not say so? In the amending Bill of i 9'18' there appears ! "" War worker "" means a person who,, during continuance of the war which commenced', the year One thousand nine hundred and fourteen, entered' into an agreement with the Commonwealth to proceed to Great Britain for : purpose of engaging in work as a labourer, fettler, or navvy, for the Imperial Government, - or otherwise, and engaged' in such work. . . . is something definite. I for one be glad to enable any man who hasmade sacrifices for his country to get asdo sistance to build his house, but in future the Commissioner himself will be empowered to define who is meant by a ""' war f the worker."" I could claim to be a warreworker because of what I did duringthewar, and a lady working inconnexionw it h the Red Cross at Government House might similarly be included under the provisions of this measure. I hope the Minister will explain the position when he is replying.",31
75,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I shall certainly answer your construction of the definition.,32
76,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Why has the definition been taken out of the amending Act and discretion placed absolutely in the hands of the Commissioner?,32
77,Mr MCGRATH,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Because those who went abroad comprised three classes, namely, members of the Australian Imperial Force, munition workers, and war workers.",32
78,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"But the amending War Service Homes Act contains a complete definition, and now, under this Bill, it will be possible for men who made shells in Australia in the early days of the war, and who made absolutely no sacrifices, to claim its privileges.",32
79,Mr MCGRATH,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,It would do no harm to allow them to get homes. - Mr GREGORY - But where shall we end?,32
80,Mr MCGRATH,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,We do not want to end.,32
81,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,They will all have to pay for all they get under this Bill.,32
82,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"That is not the question at all. If we are to provide homes for everybody, why not indicate that this is a measure to provide homes, not for soldiers, but for the Australian people?",32
83,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I would have no objection sociation to that.,32
84,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"No doubt, but it is questionable whether we have money to do that. The Act is primarily intended to provide facilities for the erection of homes for Australian soldiers and for those who made sacrifices during the war, and I do not think the Commissioner should have power to be able to say that any person who did not go. out of Australia and who made no sacrifices should enjoy the same privileges. If the Bill is passed in its present form, we shall be allowing the Commissioner to say who is a war or munition worker, and some who did not make any sacrifice whatever might benefit.",32
85,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Is there a new definition ?,32
86,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"There seems to be, and extraordinary power is to be placed in the hands of the Commissioner. At the outbreak of war, there were many Australians in Canada and the United States of America who rushed to Great Britain and joined up with the Imperial Forces. These men had to accept a lower rate of pay, and when they returned to Australia were not allowed to come under the provisions of the War Service Homes Act.",32
87,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,They are allowed to participate.,32
88,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Every person who can come under the provisions of this Bill is specifically mentioned.,32
89,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Where ?,32
90,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The principal Act covers every person who served in the Naval or Military Forces of any part of the King's Dominions.,32
91,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Does not the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) realise that that definition has been taken out?,32
92,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,That is not so.,32
93,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The definition of "" war worker "" still stands.",32
94,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,No .,32
95,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The memorandum appears to be clear enough, and the only words deleted are "" and was employed on active service outside Australia.""",32
96,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The definition of "" eligible person "" in the amending Act is a person who.was an Australian soldier, a munition worker, a war worker, a member of the Young Men's Christian As",32
97,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,All those definitions will stand.,32
98,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,It is not my intention to reply to the honourable member at this stage; but I ask him to accept my assurance that every person who can benefit is specifically mentioned. It does not rest with the Commissioner to say who is eligible and who is not. This is an attempt to consolidate the law; but it does not abrogate the provision in the principal Act.,32
99,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"If I have made a mistake I am prepared to apologize; but it appears to me that the provision in the principal Act has been amended, and that the Commissioner now has full power to say who is an ""eligible person.""",32
100,Mr RYAIT,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The honourable member was making out a very good case when he was interrupted.,32
101,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"If the basis of my contention is wrong, the sooner I get away from it the better, as I do not wish to misrepresent the case. It appears to me, however, fhat the definition has been so altered as to leave it entirely in the hands of the Commissioner to say who was and who was not a war worker. I am not at all clear on the point.",32
102,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I have already given the honourable member an assurance; ^ut he declines to accept it , and is looking in other quarters for a verification.",33
103,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Perhaps it would be better for me to leave this aspect of the question for the present; but I shall make sure of the position when we reach the Committee stage. There is another matter which I would like the Government to carefully consider. I am particularly anxious that maimed soldiers shall be given more generous treatment than they, claim to have been receiving. Under section 47 of the principal Act, the Commissioner may, if required to do so by any prescribed authority of the Department of Repatriation, provide a dwelling-house for the use of any totally and permanently incapacitated Australian soldier. If that is the law, I cannot understand' why I should receive a letter from au organization asking for certain concessions. have a communication which reads:We have in the New 'South Wales association two members- Mr L I shall not give the namesand Mr T , who have had each two legs and an arm amputated. These men should be given a home of their own. Mr. L mother and wife told this associapress tion that at present L - and his wife have one room at his mother's residence. To get about from room to room he rolls along the floor, as invalid chairs are too big to get through the doorways. This shows the necessity of building a house to suit such terrible cases. The house need not be big, but the doors could be made wider, and other little conveniences introduced to make their lot at any rate a little easier than it is now. We should not be receiving letters of this description if the Minister or the Repatriation Department had endeavoured under section 47 of the principal Act to carry out the decision of Parliament. Under that section we gave the Department full power to build homes for these people, I merely quote this letter for what it is worth; but coming from such an organization I should think it would be correct. It would certainly appear [197] from it either that the persons concerned did not apply to the proper quarter, or that if they did, they failed to secure that sympathetic consideration which I am sure the Parliament would like to be given in all such cases.",33
104,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,This matter was first raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) when the honourable member was probably temporarily absent from the chamber. I then made a promise as to which I shall make a full statement when replying to the debate.,33
105,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Will the honourable gentleman endeavour to incorporate in the Bill some of the desires of these people?,33
106,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I cannot anticipate my statement; but I think that my honourable friend will be satisfied with it .,33
107,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am not reflecting on the Minister in any shape or form . The Act gives the Commissioner very wide powers, and the Minister should see that his desires are actually embodied in this Bill . In connection with the Income Tax Bill , the ex-Treasurer (Mr W at t ) made distinct and specific promises, which we were able to quote from Hansard; but they were not incorporated in the Bill , and the Commissioner, when his attention was drawn to them, naturally I said , "" I can be guided only by the wording of the Act itself."" We might have the same experience in connection with the handling of this scheme. Knowing the Minister as I do, and the work that he carried out in connection with Repatriation, I am convinced of his earnestness in this matter. I would, therefore, imupon him the desirableness of embodying in the Bill itself anything that he desires to do for those who have made sacrifices for their country. .I ask him to endeavour to insert a clause providing that the Commissioner shall furnish an annual report to Parliament. Such a provision was omitted, unintentionally, no doubt, from the principal Act . We are justified in expecting to receive every year from the Commissioner a report setting out fully what he is doing.",33
108,Mr WEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I thought it was part of the duty of the Commissioner to furnish an annual report.,33
109,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"No doubt he will do so; but the furnishing of an annual report should be made compulsory. I am also going to move, in Committee, an amendment providing for the presentation of a half-yearly report to Parliament showing the operations of the timber mills which have beenacquired by the War Service Homes Commissioner.",33
110,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"If the honourable member's first suggestion be adopted, no doubt the Commissioner's annual report will in clude a report regarding the timber mills.",34
111,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Not necessarily. What I _desire is a special report in regard to the mills and the timber areas acquired. We shall be dealing with a continually diminishing asset, and it is well that we should have presented every six months a report showing the superficial feet of pine, hardwood, and other timbers cut at each m ill ; the cost of 6ame - includin g working costs, expenses of administration, interest, capital expenditure, and depreciation-and'the price at which the timber is made available for the erection of soldiers' homes. We should have a proper profit anil loss account. In regard to machinery, it would probably be necessary to allow 8 per cent, or 10 per cent, for depreciation. I do not suggest, however, what rate should be fixed. We may leave that to the Commissioner, and when his report is presented, it will be open to us to decide whether the rate allowed is too high or too low. The greater the publicity given to State trading concerns the better. If any of them are shown to be a failure, then those who believe in the principle will be all the more anxious to make them a success. Lack of control often breeds neglect. It is only by careful watching and supervision that we can make these concerns a success. If they can be made a success, as honourable members opposite believe, then all the better for the community. I feel, however, that it is impossible to get ordinary public officials to deal with these matters as they would do if they were their own property. Political interference is i troduced, and in many cases destroys the efforts being made by the State. the interests of, not only those who believe in State-owned enterprises, but of tbose who are opposed to the principle, we should have these returns submitted to the Parliament, so that we may determine whether or not the operations are successful.",34
112,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Darling ) [ 4 . 3 8 ] favour State undertakings, and am particularly anxious that they should not fail because of lack of sympathetic administration. Erom what I can learn of the purchase of certain saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland by the War Service Homes Commissioner, it would appear, to say the least of it , that the venture will do no good to State undertakings throughout Australia. I desire to put before the House certain information which has been supplied to me. I have been told by one of those who held an option over Lahey's properties in Queensland, that the property purchased from that firm by the Commissioner was offered four years ago to the Queensland Government for £150,000.",34
113,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Does the honourable member say that that offer covered the whole of the properties purchased by the Commissioner ?,34
114,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"It covered the whole of the property purchased from Laheys L t d . A f t e r a careful survey extending over something like three days, the persons holding the option decided not to .avail themselves of it . They took the view that nothing less than trained eagles or commercial, aeroplanes could get the"" timber out of some parts of the country. Since then some timber has been cut out of the more accessible portions of the estate. The property offered to the Queensland Government four years ago for £150,000 has been sold to the Commonwealth Government for .£245,000. Meantime, something like 8,000,000 feet of timber had been removed per year for four years from the more accessible portions of the area. I am informed that a total of 32,000,000 feet of timber has been taken out during the four years, whereas £95,000 has gone on to the purchase price. The appreciation of timber during that period would probably be equivalent to the value of the n - quantity that has been taken ofi the area, but 32,000,000 feet having been cut out, In the property could not be worth more than £150,000 today,",34
115,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Does the lionorable member know the person who made that estimate for the Queensland Government four years ago!,34
116,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I do not, but I - I know that the Queensland Government refused to buy the property for £150,000.",34
117,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Was it exactly the Bame proposition?,34
118,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"So I am informed. I aim.' told that the gentleman who in spected these properties on behalf of the Commonwealth is only an accountant. If that is so, I cannot conceive that the Commissioner acted only on his recommendation. The Minister (Mr Rodgers) may be able to tell us later on who in spected the properties acquired, and what were their qualifications. It is to be hoped that the inspection was made by somebody knowing more about timber than might reasonably be expected of an accountant.",35
119,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Would the honourable member object to state the source of his information ? I am very anxious to ascertain the source of a lot of information that has' been given.,35
120,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I shall tell the honourable gentleman privately the name of my informant. The chief consideration is whether the information is correct-whethe r Lahey's property was offered to the Queensland Government four years ago for £150,000, whether that offer was refused, and whether, since then, something like 32,000,000 feet of timber has been taken off it . are facts-and my informant is one of those who held the option and turned it down because of the difficulty of getting out the timber-the position is very serious. I understand that the several areas purchased comprise five different blocks, separated in some cases by a distance of over 10Q miles. If that be so, each area will need a manager, and a general manager will be required to supervise the whole of the five areas. tion of management should have been taken int o consideration when the properties were purchased by the War Service Homes Commissioner. just one other matter with which I in tend to deal. Only yesterday in Sydney I was in conversation with a master builder, with whom I was discussing the War Service Homes. I have in the past referred to Mr Kirkpatrick and the big "" rake off "" which his firm secured by drawing up plans and specifications, which they stereoed and turned out until further orders at a very fair profit. But notwithstanding the faults of the plans and specifications provided by Messrs. Kirkpatrick and Sons, under which' it was possible for a builder to do prac[197]- 2 tically anything he pleased in the way of using inferior material, I was assured by the builder to whom I spoke that the Commissioner's plans and specifications are infinitely worse. He went so far as to say that the Commissioner's plans and specifications which he had seen could be complied with for a two-roomed house or a ten-roomed house.",35
121,Mr FOWLER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,They must be very elastic.,35
122,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes , most elastic. This builder informed me that in company with other builders he went over a group of buildings at Belmore, iust outside Sydney. They had witli them the plans and specifications of the buildings, and they found many departures fro m them, but one that wag outstanding. In one case the plans and specifications provided for a tiled verandah, and it was found that the material used was wood, and in so rough a condition that it did not have a nosing on it . The fact that the homes can be passed with such a flagrant departure from the plans and specifications indicates a very serious lack of proper supervision. At this particular group a lady was in If these terviewed and waa asked the cost of a home. The reason why the question was asked was because several sets of laundry tubs were seen to be broken, and the builders were anxious to .know who was going to stand the loss. They tried to elicit some information from the occupier of one of the homes, but when she was asked what was the cost of her home, she said that she did not know, and would not know u n t i l the group of buildings had been finished, and then the cost of the whole of the buildings would be averaged The ques- and she would be told what the cost of her home was. This lady was in actual occupation of a home and did not know what it was going to cost her. There is This information was given me by a builder whjO has carried out contracts himself. I am told that many contractors are doing quite well, but the average contractor is not prepared to do dishonest things, because ultimately there will be a reaction, and those who have put in ferior material into buildings and have put up the cost of a building by breakages or by substituting one material for another, will lose credit and be given a bad name. In the circumstances, the majority of contractors are'not satisfied to work for this Department under existing conditions.",35
123,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Is not the Service Homes Commissioner building most of the houses by day labour ?,36
124,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Not in the case of the particular group to which I have referred. The houses in the group to which I refer are being erected by builders. The matters upon which I have touched are of sufficient importance to warrant an investigation by the Government.,36
125,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,O r an answering statement.,36
126,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I do not think that it is possible for the Honorary M ister to make a statement offhand with regard to the matters with which I have dealt. If the honourable gentleman can satisfactorily explain the refusal of the Queensland Government to pay £150,000 for a property which the War Service Homes Department has purchased for some £90,000 in excess of that amount, well and good, but personally I do not think that he can do so without an investigation into the matter. I doubt whether without an investigation he is in a position to satisfactorily explain the substitution of rough boards for tiles in the case of one of the buildings in the Belmore group, or the faulty plans and specifications supplied by the Department. I think that these are all matters which require investigation by the Government.",36
127,Mr HAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,New England) [4.51] - The observations which I have to make in connection with this Bill will be very brief. It has struck me that in the absence of definite information on the subject most of the time taken up by previous speakers in discussing the question' of the purchase of certain timber lands in Queensland has been wasted.,36
128,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The amount involved in the purchase must be added to the capital cost of the buildings.,36
129,Mr HAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"That is all right i purchaseis a good one. Most honourable members appear to regard it as a doubtful purchase, but as a matte"" of fact, no evidence on the matter which can be regarded as definite has been submitted by those who have addressed themselves to that question. Several statements have been made, but they have all been qualified by the words, "" If what I am told is true. "" In view of the business which is before this Parliament, honourable members must realise that it is a waste of War time to discuss questions about which they have no definite information. I say at once on this point as the Scripture says, "" If any one can give the show away, let him do it now or for ever hold his peace."" I can almost hear my honourable friend the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan) saying, "" I can, but I w o n ' t . "" I am not going to say anything on a question about which I have no in formation, and until definite evidence can be submitted concerning the matter, it had better be left alone. There are one or two phases of the subi n - ject under discussion to which I might briefly refer. One is with regard to a matter that has already been explained by the Assistant Minister for Defence. It has. reference to the position of those venturesome young men who enlisted, though under the prescribed age. The honourable gentleman told us that discrimination was necessary in order that those who had gone by wav of some conspiracy should be separated from those who went into the actual firing line to do their duty. I hope that when that discriminationis made no one will be deprived of what he is justly entitled to. I know of one particular case of a friend of mine who had two sons who went to the war. One of them, unhappily, was killed, and the other received very high honours. He had a third son. who was only fifteen years of age, and was still at school. This lad disappeared fro m school,, and his father, knowing his desire, knew where to find him. Three or four days after his disappearance he went to the Liverpool Camn and there he discovered his lad of fifteen years of age drilling a squad of volunteers.",36
130,Mr BELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,What age were they?,36
131,Mr HAY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Some were about the age of the honourable member probably, and some were very awkward, but this lad had gone through training as a cadet. If the hope that when the position of these young men is being considered discrimination will be properly exercised and no one will be deprived of what he is entitled to. There is another section of returned men for whom our hearts bleed. I refer to the maimed. As the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) said, they are practically prisoners all their lives, because of their physical infirmities. The outlook for those who are disabled and unfitted to follow the ordinary avocations of men must also be a source of great mental affliction to them. We must treat such men in the most liberal way possible. It would be appalling to think that those who have done such valuable .service for their country, and suffered physically and mentally by doing so, should be deprived of the comforts which a generous Government could give them. I am certain that honourable members, rather than see such men deprived of that to which they are reasonably entitled would forfei t a great deal personally. I believe they would be prepared, for the length of this Parliament at any rate, to forfeit their in creased parliamentary allowance in order that it might be offered for the benefit of these men. We must all congratulate the Government of this country, and particularly the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E . D . Millen) on the magnificent work which has been done in repatriating and settling our returned soldiers. If we look back to a period eighteen months ago, the magnitude of the task then confronting us of repatriating some 260,000 soldiers was almost terrifying, but the work that has been done is herculean. The undertaking was one which neither the people nor the Government had ever previously been associated with, and it is perfectly marvellous that this stupendous work has been done in the wav, and in the time, in which it has been performed. Mistakes were inseparable from the performance of such a task. It is of no use to say now what might have been done, but I believe that the country, the returned soldiers and the people, are to be congratulated upon what has been accomplished.",36
132,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Wakefield) [4.59] - I agree with the concluding remarks of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. A very great deal has been done that deserves the highest praise, but that does not preclude reasonable and proper criticism of the work in hand. Honourable members know that I do not approach the discussion of this question in any spirit of carping criticism. I regret very much indeed that we have not the fullest information on the particular matter ' about which most of the discussion on this Bill has taken place. I understand that some papers which the Minister requires before he makes his reply have not yet come to hand. It would have been infinitely better had the Government held over the discussion cm the second reading of this Bill u n t i l those papers had arrived, because honourable members on both sides want a full , and complete statement fro m the Minister, which we have not yet had. In the absence of such a statement, I for one will want the provision in this Bill relating to the almost unlimited authority of the Commissioner considerably tightened up. Indeed, even apart from a complete statement from the Minister, I should imagine honourable members generally would see the necessity for doing this. When the War Service Homes Bill was before the House on the last occasion I assented with a good deal of mental reservation to the granting of these enormous powers - to the Commissioner; and, if my memory serves me right, I fancy that the Honorary M in ister (Mr Rodgers), the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), and others were with me, but in the meantime I am prepared-indeed , I am obliged to do so-to allow the matter to stand over u n t i l we get a full and complete statement in regard to the acquisition of the Queensland saw-mills and timber areas. I want now to refer to the competition of the War Service Homes Commissioner with State activities in the matter of providing houses for returned soldiers. In some instances it is absolutely unjustifiable. When the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) was visiting the various States feeling his way and arranging for this gigantic work, to which he has given such an enormous amount of energy and thought, as he has generally in regard to all repatriation matters, I advised him to look at the work which had been done for the past eight or nine years by the State Bank of South Australia on behalf of the State Government in the direction of providing homes for civilians-wor k which I have not seen equalled anywhere, and which compares more than favourably with what has been done by the War Service Homes Commissioner, more particularly in Victoria. The more I have looked into this question, of the competition of Government activities since it was first raised in this House by South Australian members, the more I have become convinced that the State Bank of South Australia was providing homes at £10 0 per house less than the cost of similar homes built in any other State.",37
133,Dr MALONEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Unde r the Workers' Homes Act of Western Australia houses are provided at from £150 to £200 less than the cost of similar houses in Victoria,",37
134,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Where such excellent work was being done, why should the War Service Homes Commissioner be so anxious to come in with his Department and interfere with it ? A little while ago honourable members had the opportunity of seeing samples of the work done in South - Australia, and many private contractors in Melbourne came into Queen's Hall to examine the designs. Several of them said to me that they did not know how the houses could have been built for what they cost. Yet in spite this, and in spite of our protests against the War Service Homes Commissioner extending his operations to South Australia and competing against the excellent work that was being done by the State Bank under the authority of the State Government, which found the money, he is still determined to do so.",38
135,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"When the honourable member claims that the State Government finds the money, I hope that he remembers that it was the Commonwealth Government which lent it to them.",38
136,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The honourable member is not quite correct, because the South Australian Government found the money, and was responsible for the building of these homes long before any Commonwealth Act was passed or even before the Department of Repatriation was established, and its terms in respect to interest and the period of repayment were even more liberal than those contained in the War Service Homes Act.",38
137,Mr BELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Is the South Australian Government willing to continue this work without help ?,38
138,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I shall come to that matter in a moment. When the Minister set out to defend the position taken up by the Commissioner- I had a strong feeling at the time that he was not expressing his own views, but those of the Commissioner-h e retaliated that the South Australian Government were not providing homes for soldiers whose earnings amounted to more than £350 a year. 'The .South Australian Government immediately replied that they would also take in hand the matter of providing homes for soldiers whose salaries exceeded £350 a year if the Federal Government would find the money, and that they would carry out this additional work at the cost of only l i per cent., to cover supervision, plans, agreements, and everything.",38
139,Mr WEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,-What ! On a house costing £600 the 'State Bank's charge would be only £9 for all that work?,38
140,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes. The State Bank had been doing this work for seven or eight years for civilians before they undertook to provide also homes for soldiers. It is not in the interests of the men that this competition should take place. When the War 'Service Homes Commissioner began to compete against of all the work of the State Government in the matter of .buying and building homes in South Australia, the natural result was an immediate rise in prices to the tune of pretty nearly £100 a house. The cost of all materials rose at once. I hope honourable members will bear this fact in mind when we get into Committee, because we ought to be in a position to know, whether this sort of competition has benefited either the returned soldier or the country.",38
141,Mr JOWETT,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,It has not. It is but another deplorable instance of the clashing of Commonwealth and State activities.,38
142,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"It is a deplorable instance of overlapping, and it ought not to exist. iSurely the War Service Homes Commissioner had work of sufficient magnitude in other parts of Australia to restrain him from entering into a competition in South' Australia which has resulted in the State Government pulling out of the business of building soldiers' homes? Mr .TUDOR - Does the honourable member advocate that the 'Commonwealth Government should pull out of the business ?",38
143,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I claim that the Commonwealth Government should never have gone into it in .South Australia. The Commissioner could have devoted his energies to the State of New South Wales, leaving alone a Government which was doing better work than he could do. The action of the Minister for Repatriation-because , in the last analysis, he is responsible, through competition forcing up ' prices-ha s made the burden too big for the State Government to carry on, and so it has pulled out. It would have paid the War Service Homes Commissioner to .have allowed the State Government to continue its work, even if the Commonwealth had been obliged to find the money; which, even now, it must do for the building of houses for soldiers with an income of over £350 a year. At any rate, the result of the disastrous competition instituted Iby the War Service Homes Commissioner is that building materials are practically unobtainable in Adelaide today. Last week 1 went to every establishment in that city to try to buy cement, and could not secure a single cask. It is the same with all classes of building material. Thus the action of one Government in competing against another not only affects both Governments, but also has a very bad reflex influence on the erection of homes for civilians, which are BO badly needed in this country. I hope that honourable members will look into this question in a rational way, and determine in no uncertain manner that the form of competition to which I have drawn attention is decidedly injurious to every one concerned.",38
144,Dr MALONEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Melbourne) [5.14] I endorse the remarks made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster). He has clearly shown the advantages which the South Australian Government possess in the matter of - building houses, and I regret that the Commonwealth Government, when setting out on this class of undertaking, did not at once utilize existing State activi- tralia.' ties. Let me point out the instance of the houses built at Narrogin, in Western Australia, under the provisions of the Workers' Homes Act in force in that State. If honourable members saw the standardized plans issued in booklet form by the Western Australian Government, they would admit that the homes provided are very comfortable indeed - At a minimum of cost and at a minimum of rental, workmen can get absolute ownership. Large blocks are allowed at Narrogin of which the rental is 10s. per six months. If a worker leaves his occupation there he is able to sell to the man who takes his place on the railway, and the Government so arrange things that there is absolute equity in the transfer. I am sure,"" from knowledge which I have gained from one who made a specialty of going round and seeing the buildings spoken of by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster), that those places in Adelaide are really equal to anything of the kind in any of the States, and good enough for any one to live in.",39
145,Mr JOWETT,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Why should the Commonwealth interfere with that?,39
146,Dr MALONEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The honourable member knows the trouble that occurred in this House about a certain architect who, I believe, is related to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, and who has all these dainty tit-bits put into his lap against the whole of the architects of Australia. Why should not the work of the Camm onwealth Bank be open to competition by every architect in the Commonwealth? But no, forsooth, one is favoured who is a relative of the lately titled gentleman who rules the Commonwealth'Bank, and who is the boss, of all around. Any architect will agree that, in building the soldiers' homes, if diversity is wanted, only about fifty standardized plans would be sufficient for the whole of Australia, with variations for certain States. For instance, in the far north of Queensland, a house is needed that will give coolness and shade; whereas, in what I have heard honourable members call the desperate climate of Melbourne, we want something that will assure more warmth than in the more genial climates. There are worse climates in the world than that of Melbourne, but I must admit that there are many far better in AusI welcome the determination of the Government to secure their own timber supplies. So long as they are not charged an unfair sum the transaction will be a lesson for future Governments to follow. I wish that the late Sir Thomas Bent were now Premier of Victoria, because then we should not be crying out for timber, bricks, and cement in this State. If the Commonwealth Government have not the power, it should seek power from the. House to seize any brickworks that are closed down by monopolies, because such works should not be allowed to remain in the hands of those who are essentially exploiters of the commuuity. Sir Thomas Bent, as Premier .of Victoria, set brickworks going, and reduced the price of bricks all round. He thus saved the State of Victoria many thousands of pounds. I mention this as an example for the Commonwealth Government to follow in regard to its building needs. I should like to see it take over also timber works and cement works. I had on my desk today a letter from one of the big merchants here, stating not only that he could not supply cement at the present moment, but that he did not know when he would be in a position to do so. That is a terrible state of - affairs, with the population in creasing, and a growing demand for homes, and the unfair raising of rents that is going on. As the honourable member for ""Wakefield justly said, the first duty of the Government is to those who offered their lives at the Eront; but their next duty is to the citizens of Australia, who require proper accommodation in which to live and bring up that best of all immigrants, the Australian baby. I was very pleased to hear the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) ask the Prime Minister whether the Governmeut would favourably consider the question of issuing Canberra bonds, to those issued by the Island of Guernsey, and thus afford the people of Australia an opportunity to invest money in the building of necessary administrative and parliamentary Canberra. The Prime Minister's was that an opportunity for these matters would be afforded in connection with the Estimates. This Bill. I submit, affords an even more opportunity for suggesting the by the Commonwealth of what has proved to be one of the finest financial experiments the world has ever seen. description is given by Mr J. Theodore Harris, B.A., in his book, An Example of Communal Currency, published in 1911, a copy of which can be read in a couple of hours in the Parliamentary In the early part of last century it was very difficult for municipal bodies to borrow money on the London market. Napoleonic wars were then in and advances were not as easily made in those days as they were just prior to the late horrible war. In the little island of Guernsey, which was never conquered by England, but which came to England by marriage-and some of the islanders claim that it was they who invaded and conquered England with the Normans--there was a very narrow street,"" about 10 feet wide, which was lumbered up'with stalls for the sale of meat, fish, and produce, to such an extent that sometimes as many as twenty carts would have to stop at one boundary of the tov/n beDr Maloney. fore another string of carts had passed through. The bailiff was a man of wonderful ability, named Daniel De Lisle Brock. He asked, "" Have you any bricklayers, stonemasons, or carpenters among you?"" When the townspeople said "" Yes,"" he replied, *' Well, why don't you build your market yourselves?"" He put forward the great idea of issuing currency notes for that one purpose, and his suggestion bore f r u it . Shortly put., these are the facts of that historical incident: In the early years of 1800, three men, Daniel De Lisle Brock, Nicholas Maingy, and Jean Lukis, carried into execution the idea formulated by Brock. Currency notes of the value of £ 1 were issued. It was agreed by a meeting of citizens to take them in payment, and the contractors and shopkeepers also agreed. The municipality had the land, the market was erected, and every stall was let. The narrow streets were cleared of all the old similar stallholders. Then on certain appointed days as many notes as had been received in payment of the rents of the market their stalls were burnt, and, in addition, an amount of the market notes, equal to any offices at sum of money that the municipality could answer contribute, was also burnt. Thus at the discussing end of ten years the whole of the issue of notes was destroyed, and a rent-producing property was owned by the municisuitable pality for ever. A copy of the accounts, adoption given at page 19 of Mr Harris' book, shows the following : Market accounts for 1820A full Notes to bearer of f l destroyed-82n d March, 1820, £400; 7th November, 1826, £420; 1st March, 1827, £122; total, £942. Total of notes issued for the market, Library. £11,296; total of notes destroyed for the market, £3,626; leaving in circulation, £7,670. The No wonder the inhabitants made a festive progress, day on the occasion on which the currency notes were destroyed, because every note burnt brought the day nearer when the community would own for all time a property not only debt free but also rentproducing. Guernsey To give an example on a much larger scale, in the Victorian House of Assembly sitting in this very chamber, Mr H i ggins, now Mr Justice Higgins, moved for the production of a return showing the debts of Victoria. The information disclosed that Victoria had borrowed approximately £50,000,000, had paid altogether, in interest and capital for conversion at less interest, about £52,000,000, but still owed, after some fifty years, £50,000,000. If Victoria bad issued currency notes backed by the security of the railways and rolling-stock and guaranteed by its own Government, and if on an appointed day each year thereafter an amount of the notes corresponding to the amount of interest paid had been burnt, the debt would have been wiped out, and Victoria would have built her railways and other revenue-producing works absolutely free of cost. I am very glad of the success of the late loan, but it would have been as well for the Commonwealth Government, .in the name of Australia, to ask the wealth of Australia to advance free of interest the sum required to build these homes for the soldiers. This would have been justified in view of the fact that 70 per. cent, of the manhood of Australia offered their services at the Front. 43 per cent, were accented, and over 37 per cent, actually left the shores of Australia for the Front, and in view of the further fact that, whereas the wealth of Australia was estimated by Mr Knibbs at the commencement of the war to be worth £1,200,000,000, strange to say, its value increased during the war by £400,000,000. If those who own Australia's wealth had responded freely to such a request from the Government, it would have been a great and meritorious action on their part. There are wealthy men in Australia who, I believe, if appealed to in that direction would readily respond. The Government could then have followed the example of the Guernsey Island market note experiment, destroying the bonds as they were able to redeem them. The return from every house built for soldiers, fro m every far m on which soldiers were settled, and from all works undertaken to conserve the water which falls from the heavens, could have been ear-marked for the purpose of redeeming the bonds, and the Governmentcould have charged the soldiers much less per annum for the War Service Homes than they are charging now. The amounts which the returned soldiers have to pay for their houses every year are very large. Certainly, in jihirty years the homes will belong to them or their descendants, but if we had followed the Guernsey example they would have been cleared of debt at the end of, say, thirty-three or fifty years, and the whole transaction would not have cost the Government one penny pieoe. There would be no interest to pay; but there is one thing definite about this system. The notes in connection with each reproductive work-o n which similar notes would be issued-mus t be earmarked to the special work for which they were issued; and, at certain dates, certain amounts should be destroyed; otherwise, of course, great loss would occur. With, respect to the future of Australia, the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors, and, we hope, of many more sturdv representatives of our Allies, is a problem not only of continental interest, but one of I m perial significance. Mr Deakin asked us to think continentally. Others have urged us to think imperially. We have to consider both continentally and imperially when called upon to settle 300,000 men on the land, and-connecte d with their various industries-carr y out our promises. Consequently, I approach this question in its broadest aspect. The model in the Library shows the physical features of Australia and emphasizes the fact that two-thirds of the continent are waterless, from the-surface point of view. While we talk of land settlement it can only be accomplished in a comprehensive and effective manner after studying the physical aspect, the lack of surface water, and the necessity for conserving every drop that falls in the catchment areas, and of utilizing it for the purposes of settlement. The late Lord Forrest, by a statesmanlike act, guided by the genius of the hydraulic engineer, O'Connor, with splendid courage, pumped water to Kalgoorlie, reticulated many sqxiare miles of country, and made it possible for the Western Australian gold-fields centres to be permanently inhabited. The same principles are applicable right through Australia. So far as land settlement is concerned, I believe the true policy to be found in the employment upon developmental work of returned soldiers, who wish to settle on the land. They should spend half their time on developmental work, and the other half on their farms or orchards. This seems to me to be a policy eminently befitting the requirements of brave men who dared anydanger on the battlefield and who. as pioneers, are built of the right material to reclaim vast areas in the interior, and to bring them within the zone of usefulness and productivity; in other words, to make Australia one of the granaries of the world. I cannot here do better than quote the following extract from Gilbreth's Motion StudyProfessor N. S. Shaler astounded the world when he called attention to the tremendous waste caused by the rain washing the fertile soil of the ploughed ground to the brooks, to the rivers, and to the seas, there to be lost for ever. While the waste from the soil washing to the sea is a slow but sure national calamity, it is negligible compared with the loss each year due to wasteful motions made by the workers of our country. In fact, if the workers of this country were taught the possible economics of motion study, there would be a saving in labour beside which the cost of building and operating tremendous settling basins, and the transporting of this fertile soil back to the land from whence it came, would he insignificant. Besides, there would still be a surplus of labour more than large enough to develop every water power in the country, and build and maintain enough wind engines to supply the .heat, light, and .power wants of mankind. It has often been remarked how, when water has been added to an arid land, wonderful crops are the result. A great American scientist has found that the potash salts, which are generally washed away where rainfall is too heavy, are retained in arid land and collected from year to year; so that, when water is scientifically applied to such soil, the more marvellously fertile it becomes. Egypt will be found vivid examples. As a traveller goes through that land he will note, on the one hand, the whole countryside in a state of abundant f e r t i l it y - for there, the life-giving water has been supplied; while, on the other hand there is death-for there, the science of irrigation has not been applied. I hope the Government will see to it, in all their dealings, that there shall be no further robberies of the people such as occurred in respect of the wheat operations, wherein millions of bushels disappeared. I commend the Government for their action in respect of the Queensland timber mills, and I' trust that they will extend operations in the matter of securing necessary supplies of cement and bricks. God knows that I have had to hold up to scorn and loathing various of the regulations issued under the War Precaution's Act. But why should not the Government now issue one more regulation, which would put an effective stop ti profiteering in bricks and cement, and in respect of every line of material TeDr Moloney. quisite for the building of soldiers' homes ? I recognise that, in view of the opinions held by many of their supporters outside this Parliament, the Government have .taken a big and bold step in respect of the timber deals; but now they should go straight ahead and similarly secure all requisite supplies for the establishment of Australia's soldier men in their own homes.",39
147,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Wentworth) |""5.41] One of the outstanding remarks which I noted during this afternoon's debate had to do with the Government's timber project, in Queensland. I do not profess to know anything about timber, but one statement of the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) was so serious that it deserves closest consideration and investigation. I refer to the remarks of the honourable member in which he indicated that he had had a conversation with one of those who had held an option over a property which the Government have just obtained, and who had said, in effect, that the Government had paid £100,000 more for it than the figure at which these gentlemen had turned it down. Until I heard that statement, I had intended to say that I had, personally, the very greatest admiration for the Minister for In Repatriation (Senator M ill e n ) , and for what he has done. I still hold that opinion of him. And I am sure, even now, that the Minister could not have been a party to the Queensland proposition u n t il and unless he had made himself familiar with all there was to know. I certainly hope that, now that the project has gone so far, it will turn out successf u l l y, and will expedite the building of homes for soldiers. There have not been many bouquets thrown at the Minister for Repatriation during this debate; but if one studies the facts and figures which have been made public regarding War Service Homes, one can only say that a most creditable position has been revealed. The statistics were summarized in .he + course of the Budget speech, delivered last week. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) stated that, to the 30th June last, the total expenditure in connection with - this phase of repatriation work amounted .to £4,961,000. This represented administrative charges, £120,000; and expenditure upon loan funds, £4,841,000. That latter amount is recoverable from successful applicants for homes. This is the remarkable feature:The cost of administration from the 6th March, 1919, was 2.4 per cent., and for the financial year 1910-20, 2.3 per cent. That shows a wonderfully low cost of administration of activities involving gigantic amounts. U p to the 30th June, 1920, 24,992 applications had been received and 11,373 approved, representing an expenditure of £6,678,000. Senator Millen, in his very able speech in another place, pointed out that no other country in the world could show a better record' in regard to the repatriation of soldiers than could Australia. I quite agree with him, but notwithstanding that excellence, honourable members receive a number of complaints. This afternoon I have been turning over in my own mind the sixty or seventy cases that have been put through my hands, and the complaints, boiled down, amount to irritation on account of the delay in respect of each man's application. For this Senator Millen cannot be blamed. One digger had written six letters to the Department and had not received any acknowledgment. He had also visited the office of the War Service Homes Commission and had been practically kicked out. I sent his letter on to Senator Millen, and in three days I received a reply admitting that the digger had some ground for complaint and that the services of the officer concerned had been dispensed with . That proves that if the Department knows of any delay wilfully - caused, the officer responsible will be punished. And rightly so, for every - digger naturally thinks that his case is the most important. My experience has been that when complaints are brought under the notice of the Department, the soldier gets a fair deal. I should like the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) to inform me whether deposits are asked for in every case. The Bill says that the Commissioner may ask for a deposit, but I think the wish of the House, when the principal Act was under consideration, was that deposits should not be insisted upon. In several casee that have come under my notice during the last few days, deposits have been asked for.",42
148,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"As a matter of general policy, the deposits are not required.",43
149,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am glad to hear that, because the demand for a deposit causes a certain amount of irritation. W i U Minister tell me also whether a valuation fee is collected in every case? I was informed yesterday that three different houses for which one soldier had applied had been rejected by the Department, but the valuation fee of £ 1 Is. was charged in respect of each. That is a charge that might very well be waived, because the Department can surely employ a number of valuators to do this work at small cost, and thus relieve the digger of an additional expense.",43
150,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,No fee is charged for valuations by departmental officers.,43
151,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"My next complaint is important. A soldier attending a hospital as an out-patient is not discharged and i6 still wearing his u n i for m ; yet he cannot apply for a war service home until he is discharged. That seems a great hardship. I have in mind the instance of a returned soldier who is an out-patient at Randwick Hospital, where he is being treated for gassing. He is living in a house which he is afraid he will lose, and has made application to the War Service Homes Department for assistance. He has been informed that his application cannot be dealt with-until he receives his discharge. I ask the Assistant Minister to look into that matter.",43
152,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,There was a very clear understanding as to when the Defence Department's obligation ceased and the Repatriation Department's obligation commenced. It would be difficult to admit some cases and refuse others.,43
153,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I admit that, but these hospital cases are not numerous. I again ask for the sympathy of the House for the members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade. I endeavoured, without success, to persuade Parliament to extend the war gratuity to those men. Now they are excluded fro m the Wa r Servioe Homes Act. When the war broke out the members of the Brigade were liable under the Defence Act to be sent on foreign service; indeed, a very large percentage of them asked to be sent abroad, but they were all retained for home service on the ground that they were indispensable. On a former occasion the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) informed me, by interjection, that any man who had been engaged in mine-sweeping or patrol work would receive the gratuity. Under this Bill it appears that members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade, unless they were the engaged on a ship of war, cannot acquire a war service home. I do nob know who will interpret the words "" ship of war."". Generally, a ship of war is one that flies the white ensign, although it may not have a gun or even a revolver on board. I , personally, was scouting for submarines in the North Sea with a little vessel that was absolutely unarmed except for four revolvers and six rifles; and yet she was considered a ship of war. Fortunately for me the bluff came off. The members of the Naval Brigade in many * cases worked outside the three mile l i m it in patrolling and sweeping the approaches to Melbourne and Sydney Heads and on examination duties. Perhaps they were not in as much danger as were men who went abroad, but mines were found in Australian waters, and the German raider Wolf was on the coast. They were in actual dancer, but they did not get the war gra'iiiity,. and now they are not to be allowed to get a war service home; they get nothing. I do not think that is fair treatment, and I ask the Government to reconsider the matter.",43
154,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I have taken a very careful note of the honourable member's remarks, but I think the members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery are in exactly the same position.",44
155,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"They are; I admit that my request is widening the field of assistance, and in these days of financial stringency it is hard for the Government to acquiesce. But munition workers, war workers, and nurses, rightly so, are being included in the benefits of the War Service Homes Act. The only persons excluded are those men who did magnificent service with the Naval Brigade.",44
156,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Whils t they were not actually in the danger zone, yet if a raider had got through they would have been in very real danger.",44
157,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The raider Wolf was actually in Australian waters, and - laid the mines which these men subsequently swept up. I am delighted that the amount to be advanced is to be increased from £700 to £800 . For some months I have pressed the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen), the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), and the Assistant Minister for Defence (Sir Granville Rvrie) to have the amount increased, and I have urged that expedition 'was necessary, because manv applications were being blocked through the lack of the extra £ 1 0 0. Houses are becoming increasingly scarce, and the additional £ 1 0 0 will be a godsend to many soldiers. I do not know to what extent the increase will be retrospective. The Bill refers to houses in course of erection. I do not know whether the increase will apply also to cases in which the "" digger "" has had to provide from his own pocket more money than he could afford in order to get a home.",44
158,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,It will not apply to any transaction that appears in the books of the Department as having been completed.,44
159,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I again pay a warm tribute to the Department, and particularly to Senator Millen, for the enormous amount of work that has been achieved, and the excellent way in which it has been done. The activities of the Department have given great satisfaction to the majority of returned soldiers. The only complaints have been in regard to the delays in dealing with individual cases. I have pointed out to the men that it is impossible to handle thousands of cases as quickly as the men themselves may wish, but the Department attempts to give a fair deal in every instance. I know that the Assistant Minister (Mr . Rodgers) will give consideration to the cases of hospital out-patients, and the claims of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade. I assure him that the latter feel their position keenly; notwithstanding their magnificent work they receive no benefits whatever. One man pointed out to me in Melbourne recently that the old Protector went on what was practically a yachting cruise to Cocos Island to have a look at the Emden. wreck, and because the members of the crew were on "" a ship of war ' ' they got the benefits under this Act , and under the War Gratuity Act . They were in no more danger when travelling to Cocos Island at that period than were the men who were working off Sydney and Port Phillip Heads. These little differentiations between branches of the service are causing intense dissatisfaction, and I am glad to have the Assistant Minister's assurance that they will receive consideration.",44
160,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"West Sydney) [ 5 . 5 9 ] - I am sure that all honourable members realise the importance of the housing problem, which has been accentuated by the return of so many soldiers from overseas, and the prospect of many immigrants coming to Australia at an early date. Honourable members will give cor.dial support to any measure that will tend to relieve the present shortage of houses or liberalize the terms upon which financial assistance may be given to those who desire to establish homes for themselves. I aim glad that the amount of the advance for a soldier's home has been in creased from £700 to £800. desire to direct the attention of the Assistant Minister (Mr Rodgers) to'one or two matters which have been placed before me. The first is that several soldiers who desired to obtain homes for themselves-home s which were already erected and which had to be purchased from the existing owners-alleg e that they were compelled to put up a deposit of 10 per oent. of the total amount of the purchase money. Perhaps the Assistant Minister will be good enough to tell me by way of interjection whether that is so.",44
161,Mr BODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Before giving a reply I would require to see the specific proposition.,45
162,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The case to which I refer is that of a soldier who selected a home near Sydney. was £ 7 0 0 , and before he selected i the was given to understand that the full amount of the purchase money would be advanced to him by the Department. But when he came to complete the contract he was told by the departmental officials that he was required to lodge a deposit of £ 7 0 .",45
163,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"It is very difficult to deal with specific cases upon meagre details. If the applicant were prepared to bring his purchase under the War Service Homes scheme in every respect, the full amount would be paid by the Department. But if he desired to get conditions, which would enable him to become the owner of a house, and execute a mortgage over it , he would be required to lodge a deposit of 10 per oent.",45
164,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am quite satisfied that the applicant of whom I am speaking would have been very glad to acquire a home under the conditions first mentioned by the Assistant Minister. It was very hard for him to be obliged to let the deal lapse. I made a telephone inquiry in regard to it from the departmental officers in Sydney, and I was assured by them that a deposit of 10 per cent, was necessary, because of the heavy drain upon the Treasury consequent upon the large number of applications for these homes.",45
165,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,That is certainly not the policy of the Government.,45
166,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I am very glad to hear it.,45
167,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,If the honourable member will give me the details of the case I B ut I now will inquire into it .,45
168,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"As a matter of fact, I did communicate with the Department in regard to it , but, so far - I admit that I have not gone through the whole of my correspondence for today- I have received no reply indicating that a deposit of 10 per cent, was not required. I shall support the protest which has been made by some honourable members in regard to the policy of the Government in declining to make advances for War Service Homes to persons who enlisted when under age. I shall not delay the House by elaborating the reasons for my action, because these have been so well put by honourable members who have preceded me. I shall content myself with voicing my support of the arguments which they advanced",45
169,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Many of which are not Its purchase price well founded.,45
170,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I do not say that. I would like to understand the meaning of the statement which has been made by the Assistant Minister. It has been asserted that soldiers who enlisted under age are to be denied the benefits of this measure. That is the charge. Is it true or not?,45
171,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The honourable member supports the charge; but the charge does not lie. There is nothing in the principal Act to prevent persons who enlisted when under age from obtaining the benefits of that measure.,45
172,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"But the fact remains that, in the administration of the Act, those who enlisted under age are denied its advantages. . Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE - Not all of , them. Perhaps the honourable member did not hear my explanation of the matter the other afternoon.",45
173,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I did not.,45
174,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Every member of the Australian Imperial Eorce, subject to the tests prescribed by the Act, is eligible to participate in this housing scheme.",45
175,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Then is there nothing in the suggestion that certain soldiers have been refused the benefits conferred by the Act, on the ground that they were under age when they enlisted?",45
176,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,There is nothing either not the case. in the suggestion or in the definite statements which have been made.,46
177,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I can assure the honorpresent able gentleman that a soldier made that definite statement to me in Sydney.,46
178,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"There was something i it, but there is not now.",46
179,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Then the evil did exist, hut has been removed?",46
180,Mr MABKS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I understand that the position.,46
181,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am very glad of honourable member's interjection, because it has enabled me to understand the posiment tion much better than did that of the Minister.",46
182,Mr MAKKS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"If the position is not as approve of the actual transaction. I have stated it , I.ask the Assistant M ister to correct me.",46
183,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I also support the marks of the honourable member for NewParliament. castle (Mr Watkins) in regard to the need for widening the clause which deals with the definition of "" eligibles."" He referred to the fact that representatives of the Young Men's Christian Association &c. are entitled to the benefits which will conferred by this Bill . I entirely of their inclusion in it . I think that rendered splendid service overseas. B when I was upon the other side of water I also observed that splendid vice was rendered by the Salvation Army at Barcaldine in 1915. and other similar bodies. I think that same advantages should be extended them as are being extended to the Young Men's Christian Association.",46
184,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Le t me answer the honwe were returned to power. orable member by saying that anybody whose services were accepted in the danwe ger zone is eligible to participate in advantages which will be conferred by Bill , whether they be members of the vation A r m y or of the Young Men's Christian Association.",46
185,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Then what is the purpose of narrowing the definition of "" eligible"" ?",46
186,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I will explain matter more full y at a later stage.,46
187,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"It appears to me that the Government have singled out Young Men's Christian Association for . people. special treatment, and have excluded from the provisions of the Bill other bodies who certainly did excellent work.",46
188,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I can assure the honourable member very definitely that that is,46
189,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"That is the way in which it appears to honourable members at the time. If an amendment be necessary to widen the definition of ""eligibles,"" so as to make it include members of the Salvation Army and similar bodies, In shall have very much pleasure in supporting it . ' A good deal has been said during this debate concerning the purchase by the that is Government of saw-mills and timber lands in Queensland. I agree with those the honourable members who have contended that not only is it desirable that Parliashould approve of the policy of such a purchase, but that when such a large sum of money is involved, it should also It in - has been suggested that the Queensland Government embarked upon the business reof saw-milling without having consulted The Queensland Government, which was returned to power in 1915, did embark upon State enterprises, such as State cattle stations, State meat shops, State saw-mills, State coal mines, But they embarked upon that be policy after having been returned by the approve people of that State, and after that they policy had been submitted to the electors. u t It was part of the programme of the the Government of which I was the headsera programme which was outlined by me It was then the specifically laid down that we stood for to a policy of State enterprise, and we enumerated the character of the enterprises that we intended to undertake, if Having thus received a mandate from the people, gave effect to it , and when any purthe chase took place the amount of such purthis chase was put upon the Estimates and Salwas voted by Parliament. In regard to the recent purchase by the Commonwealth Government of saw-mills and timber lands in Queensland, I entirely agree with the policy'which has been adopted. Thus far I am with the Government. At that the same time. I quite recognise the cogency of the arguments of those who contend that even that policy should be the approved by Parliament or by the But, in this specific case, it appears that there are surrounding circumstances which make it desirable that the transaction should be further investigated. I make a definite charge against the Government. I charge them with having made this purchase for a large sum of money, approximating £500,000, without making the agreement in relation to it. subject to the approval of Parliament. The Minister will plead guilty to that charge, I presume. I contend that in a transaction of this kind, without having any mandate from the people of Australia, and without having a more thorough investigation into the matter, the Government may be very properly charged with a dereliction of duty. They made an agreement recently with regard to an advance to certain primary producers in Western Australia. But that agreement was made subject to the approval of Parliament, although no more money was involved in it than is involved in this transaction. Further, very serious allegations have been made by responsible members of this House, whose word we cannot doubt. They could make much more definite statements than they have made, but their own sense of scrupulousness has prevented them doing so.",46
190,Mr BAYLEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,They have not done so because of their lack of knowledge.,47
191,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I am particularly referring to the statements of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page).,47
192,Mr BAYLEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,My remark applies to him also.,47
193,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am expressing my own opinion of that honourable member. In view of the allegation which he madean allegation conveying as much as it did ---the matter is one which should be f u r ther investigated. The suggestion that this purchase should be referred to the Public Accounts Committee, or to a Special Committee, or to the Public Works Committee is a very reasonable one. If the deal is a good one, and one which is entirely above board, it will be able to withstand the fierce light which would then be thrown upon it .",47
194,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Does the member scruple to make a charge ? If he knows of any particular reason why this transaction should be condemned, why does not he indict the Government specifically in respect of it?",47
195,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am basing my opinion upon the statements which have been made in this Chamber and upon the papers which have been placed before us. I occupied the position of Premier of Queensland for a period of four and a half years, during which, it has been suggested, this property was offered to the Government of that State. I do not remember whether that is a fact or not. But the information can easily be ascertained. I am approaching this matter without using any inside knowledge which was obtained by me whilst I was Premier of Queensland. I am basing my remarks upon the information which has been placed before honourable members and upon the speeches which have been delivered from both sides of the Chamber, and I say deliberately, on all the facts, that the Government would be well advised to agree to an investigation by some independent committee.",47
196,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Can the honourable gentleman say, of his own personal knowledge of the facts, that this is a bad bargain for the Commonwealth Government ?",47
197,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Not from my own personal knowledge. I am not making any such charge.,47
198,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Or from the point of view of a State enterprise?,47
199,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Before I pass any opinion upon the transaction as a deal, I would want to know exactly what timber lands were included, what mills, what kind of mills^ and so on. I would require, expert advice. I do not pretend to be an expert upon these matters, but I do claim that I have the average amount of intelligence, and can form an opinion of the transaction upon statements made in this House by one of its responsible members.",47
200,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"If the statement made by the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) be correct, would not a proposition like that, if submitted to the Queensland Government, have been brought under your personal notice?",47
201,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Not necessarily.,47
202,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"But , surely, it would have been brought under your notice as Premier before being turned down ? honourable Mr Ryan - It might or might not have been. It would depend upon whether the responsible Minister thought such a proposition worthy to be entertained, aiid consequently to be submitted to me as Premier. Very often proposals submitted to individual Ministers are so absurd that they have no hesitation in turning them down independently of other members of Cabinet. Of course, if a purchase had been made, the matter would probably have been one for Cabinet consideration. I have no doubt many propositions, as in this case, to Ministers, never reach the Prime M in ister.",47
203,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"But do you think that, ant. as a matter of Ministerial practice, a transaction involving £150,000 for a State enterprise would be turned down without reference to the Leader of the GovernI ment?",48
204,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"It would entirely depend upon the circumstances. may have been before the Cabinet. do not carry in my head details of the hundreds of transactions of the Government of Queensland, extending over a period of fou r and a half years. The mere fact that I am from my own personal knowledge, making any charge, is evidence that I have an open min d upon this matter indeed be sorry, withoult sufficient evidence, to make any suggestion against Government that would damage them, or the damaging to the vendors. But I say that sufficient has been said in House to j u s t if y a full inquiry .transaction. ""We have been told that a certain letter is missing.",48
205,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"And the honourable be. member has been told that it is not missing. I specifically deny the charge of ,the honourable member for Cowper (D r Earle Page) that any letter or document is missing from the departmental file.",48
206,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"We l l , I am orable member for Cowper would not make a statement like that without ample iWarrant. He is not that type of man. [Unless he had some sound reason for lieving that a certain letter was in tence and was not now on the file, he would not have made a statement.",48
207,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Probably , like honourable members, the honourable memborough iber for Cowper has been misinformed outsiders.",48
208,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,All this goes to show necessity for an investigation. The honsell orable member for Cowper also said that i Mr Brett was appointed to value M (Lahey's property.,48
209,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"On behalf of the Department I ""deny absolutely that the purformed chase of Lahey's property was made Brett's valuation.",48
210,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,But he did value it .,48

215,Sir ROBERT BEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"We all want a lot of information, and are waiting for The matter it . I Mr Ryan - Q u it e so, and I am pointing out the reasonableness of a request to have this transaction referred to the Public Accounts Committee for investigation.

216,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,But first we will hear the what the Minister has to say.,48

218,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"At present I see no reason why it should be, and the honourable member has not shown why it should",48
219,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am endeavouring to point out that, concerning this transac. tion, there are certain circumstances that justify the fullest investigation.",48

223,Mr BAYLEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,If honourable members had investigated the circumstances of the transaction they would not have made such rash statements.,49
224,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Then ^ by all means let us have an investigation. When a definite challenge was made against the Queensland Government-the honourable member will recollect the incident-wit h regard to the purchase of the Wando Vale Station, I immediately acceded to the request for a Royal Commission. An investigation was made, and, as a result, it was found there was no foundation for certain allegations that had been made.",49
225,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Coul d not that have been shown without the appointment of a Royal Commission?,49
226,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes . I could have stated the facts, but I wanted to show that we, as a Government, were prepared for an inquiry by a Royal Commission. The public have a righ t to expect that light shall be thrown upon some Government transactions, and, in this case, I hope the Government will accede to the request. If they do not, then it may become necessary for Parliament to consider taking action to deal effectively with all such matters. I will do all I can to assist any honourable member to have done what we think ought to be done.",49
227,Sir JOSEPH COOK,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,That is quite an necessary statement to make.,49
228,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Will , it may be well to remind the r i g h t honourable Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) that I prepared to support anv move in the d i rection of making the will of Parliament supreme. I am glad to know that the insurance business carried on by the Commissioner will be much more reasonable- I like the word "" reasonable "" rather than "" cheap"" - for the owners of houses than private insurance. In this respect I wish to point deal. out that the Queensland State insurance business- I refer to it because it was tioned by the honourable member for Wide Bay-ha s been most satisfactory in every respect. Insurance and banking are esanother sentially businesses that may be underits taken by the State.",49
229,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The Treasurer has promised to introduce a Commonwealth Insurance Bill this session.,49
230,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The honourable member will find that the Treasurer is not likely to introduce anything that will clash with the interests of his supporters outside. When we established an insurance scheme in connection with workers' compensation legislation m Queensland, we increased the advantages to injured workers by 75 per cent., without any addition to premiums, the weekly payments to injured workers being advanced from £ 1 to £ 2 per week, the amount payable at death from £400 to £600, and for total incapacity from £400 to £750, while the amount of compensation paid to those suffering from industrial diseases, such as miners' phthisis, was fixed at £ 1 per week with medical comforts, and, at death, £400 . We honoured these claims whether the premiums were paid or not, and on our. first year's transactions, showeda profit of £52,000, or exactly £1,000 per week. Since then, the insurance business has been even more successful. The Queensland Government have been, able to pay bonuses to their premium payers, and to relieve them of the payment of insurance for a certain period inconnexion with domestic service. I give these facts to show how desirable it is that the Government should, as far as possible, extend State enterprise in the direction of insurance. I ani glad to hear the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) admit that the Queensland State insurance scheme has been so successful, and worthy unof commendation, and I remind hi m and others that although .they now make this just as admission, no measure passed by the the Queensland Government was received wiEh am greater opposition from the big capi- talistic interests and insurance companies than the Bill providing for State insurance in Queensland.",49
231,Unknown,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Sitting suspended from 6.SO to 8 p.m.,49
232,Mr WEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"East Sydney) [ 8 . 0 ] - I look upon this measure as one of the most important with which Parliament can It has been introduced in an endeavour to relieve conditions which menexist not only in the Commonwealth, but throughout the whole world. If there is one question of more importance than to which a Parliament can devote attention, it is that of providing homes for the people. I am not one of those honourable members who are likely to find fault with the Government for launching out in a proposal of this character, as I believe it will be the means not only of alleviating discontent, but of making the conditions of the Australian people better than they are today. From time to time various schemes have been suggested by philanthropists and others for relieving this burning question, and attempts have been made to meet the situation by accommodating families in flats. A witness g i v : ing evidence in New South Wales said that flats were ""the creation of the devil "" because they were unsuitable for accommodating a man with a wife and family. I have heard honourable members on the other side almost lose their common sense, and go beyond the realm of reason, in advocating a policy of immigration; but whatever may be said in favour of such a policy, we have to remember that at the present time it is impossible to house the people we have here. It is, therefore, the duty of. the Government to utilize every means at their disposal for increasing the number of houses in the Commonwealth. The present position has arisen largely in consequence of the enormous increases that have occurred in the price of land and building material. We know that many honourable members on the other side are not only landlords, but they also have large sums out on mortgage, and naturally feel that an increase in the number of houses will be the means of depreciating values. At present there is land within a few miles of Melbourne and Sydney that has never been occupied, and it is time it was compulsorily acquired, at, say, 10 per cent, above the price at which it is valued for taxation purposes. It is ridiculous for*an allotment, say, 30 feet by 80 feet to be sold at £ 1 0 a foot, because when the land is built on it is practically impossible for the person building to ever become the owner of the property. Power is given in this Bill to enable an applicant to receive an advance of £800 instead of £ 7 0 0 , as is provided in the original measure, and the proposal is one that should commend itself to honourable members. Recently I had an opportunity inspecting some of the buildings by the War Service Homes Commissioner, and I have no hesitation in saying that some of them should not given a clean bill of health, as many of the cottages are not sufficiently high to Mr West. enable them to be properly ventilated; but when it is remembered that every additional foot in height adds £ 4 0 or £ 4 5 to the cost, it is easy to see why the height is being restricted. The domestic portions of the dwellings are not sufficiently large to enable the work to be done in comfort, and a little additional expenditure would not only provide more conveniences and greater comfort, but would be the means of increasing the value of the property, and making it a much better asset. In many cases, the properties now held by returned soldiers will not be sufficiently large in four or five years' time, when their families increase and the holders will be compelled to sell and purchase more commodious dwellings. In view of these circumstances it is very necessary that the asset should be a good one, and the Department should erect dwellings to meet the requirements of occupiers for some years to come. On the general question of social reform, reference is frequently made to prohibition, and I am prepared to assert that if certain people were to devote their energies to providing better accommodation for the people, they would be conferring a benefit on the present and future generation, and could afford to leave the drink question entirely alone. I know that whatever I have to say Will not influence the Government to any extent, but they should endeavour to see' that every house constructed is not only a valuable asset to the purchaser, but that the payments are such that the expenses incurred will not be a tax on the community. During the debate certain statements have been made that are calculated to create suspicion in the minds of honourable members ; but that is. generally the case when an attempt is made to deal with important questions in a business-like way. Derogatory statements were made some time ago when a Commission was inquiring into certain land purchases, and during the l if e of Liberal Governments there has also been trouble in connection with the wheat and coal contracts. I am not accusing the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) of any of irregularities; but I think that those erected associated with him are responsible for some of ' the trouble. It is pleasing to those who are at present on this side of be the House to realise that during the three years a Labour Government was in office they carried out their work in a business-like manner, and left office with a clean sheet. I hope i be shown that, so far as the purchase of saw-mills and timber areas in Queensland is concerned, nothing worse than a mistake has been made by the Ministry. They are led into mistakes by their friends. The Liberal party, when in office, work like Trojans for their friends. I do not know whether it is because of monetary assistance which they have received at their hands, or merely due to personal considerations, but they certainly do all they can for them. I do not wish to learn their secrets, but, having resided in Sydney for forty-seven years, I am acquainted with most business people tliere. and, knowing how keen they are, I oan pretty well guess what has happened.",49
233,Mr SPEAKER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH," Order ! ""Will the honourable member connect his remarks with the question before the Chair.",51
234,Mr WEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"My observations have to do with the supply of timber for building War Service Homes. I hope that the Government will not be parsimonious in dealing with applications for War Service Homes. I know of men who, on volunteering, were advised to present themselves at the Navy Office, since, as certificated engineers, they would be able to do more valuable service in the Navy than they could render in the A r m y. They adopted this suggestion, and served for two years on "" t r a m p s "" which were running a blockade. The ships were commandeered, and they were put on the ships' 'articles, and ultimately received their discharge as marine engineers. They did not pass through the Navy Department, and that being so, they are told that they do not come within the provisions of the War Service Homes Act. are some hundreds of such men.",51
235,Mr MARB,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I think they are covered by this Bill .,51
236,Mr WEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"As a Ministerial supporter the honourable member may have opDortunities that I do not secure. My friends are suffering, and I must bring their case before the House. Provision should be made for such cases. The Government cannot go wrong in providing homes for the masses of the people. If I were the Minister in charge of this Department I would resume land within a few miles of Melbourne and Sydney and proceed to erect houses on a very large scale. 'Travelling between Melbourne and Sydney, I see, within 10 miles of each city, large areas of unoccupied t will land on which homes might well be erected. Owing to the lack of housing accommodation many people are practically stranded. Where two families are crowded into a four-roomed house it is impossible for children to be reared under reasonably healthy and moral conditions. If the Labour party came into power it would bring about a change of affairs in this regard, and push ahead with the building of homes in a way that would astound the people of Australia. I desire to bring the Government to a sense of their responsibility in regard to the housing of the people. Many people offer as much as £ 1 0 for the key of a house to let. In the electorate of Parkes, quite recently, an agent stood on a box outside an empty house and invited bids for the key. The bids ran from £ 1 to £ 6 , at which price the key was handed over to a man who, something like three weeks later, got notice to quit because the agent knew that he would be able again to sell the key for £ 6 or more. That sort of thing is occurring in all our big cities. The scope of this Bill should be so enlarged as to enable us to relieve the congestion, and so remove a serious cause of. discontent. Ministerial supporters, I am sure, sympathize with such a proposal, but will do nothing to carry it into effect. I defy them to show that I am not voicing a most serious abuse. While I believe that there is room for more people in Australia, I think that the Government, before encouraging i m m igration, should make some attempt to properly house our present population. If the Bill were broadened on the lines I have suggested, it would meet some thouThere sands of cases for which provision has not been made. It would include wireless operators, men who were on service on our own coast during the war, as well as officers and seamen of our mercantile marine. The latter class discharged duties quite as necessary as those carried out by the men who served our guns. They carried food supplies and munitions of war, and their claims for recognition under this Bill ought to be endorsed. The Honorary Minister (Mr Eodgers) is new to his job, and has a chance to make him self a hero in his own country by materially broadening the scope of this measure. If I were in hi3 position I should insist upon the Cabinet adopting a wide housing scheme policy, failing which I would denounce my colleagues. The time has come when the men on the Government benches must assert themselves. hope that this Bill will be so amended that it may be truly called a Housing Bill. I shall offer no opposition to it , but when we go into Committee I shall submit amendments designed to make it of some real use to the citizens of Australia.",51
237,Mr BLUNDELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Adelaide) [S.26] Before the Honorary Minister (Mr Rodgers) replies to the debate I desire to direct his attention to one or two matters of very great importance. In the place, I call attention to the unsatisfactory situation in South Australia in regard to the building of ""War Service Homes. Honourable members will recollect that some time ago I brought before the House the overlapping of State and Commonwealth functions in connection with this work in South Australia. The Commonwealth today has practically ceased building operations there. It is not building any homes except those for which contracts have been entered into. The State authorities also decided recently not to carry on the functions for which the State Act provides, and they have ceased building. Owing to an unfortunate difference of opinion between the Commonwealth and State Governments, the building of soldiers' homes in South Australia has practically ceased. It should be possible to overcome the difficulty in a way satisfactory to both the Commonwealth and the State instead of allowing our returned soldiers to suffer. Let me give a case in point. I recently brought under the notice of the Department the case of a returned man who some months ago made application to the Commonwealth War Service Homes Commissioner to erect a house for him. He arranged to get the land, and there was a mortgage on it in the name of the War Service Homes Department. The Department, however, will not build a house for him, nor can he obtain permission from it to have a house built for him on this land by some outside person. Adelaide branch of the Department informed me that it was doing nothing in the matter. This man's case is one of many, and while the Commonwealth and State Governments are quarrelling as to who shall carry on these functions, the unfortunate man cannot get a home for himself. I Mr Riley - Has he got the land?",52
238,Mr BLUNDELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes ; and the War Service Homes Department has a mortgage over it. The Department refuses to lift the mortgage, and'this man is in the unhappy position that he can get nothing done by either the State or the Commonwealth Government. This difficulty also affects the case of many blind soldiers who have been expecting that houses would be built for first them. They find that there is nothing doing. The officials of the War Service Homes Department in South Australia say that they can do nothing for them until they get instructions from Melbourne to go ahead with the work. Such an unsatisfactory state ""of affairs should be brought to a - termination as quickly as possible. I ask the Minister to give his particular attention to this difficulty. If the State Government of South Australia are going out of this business, then the Commonwealth should take it up. Let me say that if .the State Government go out of the business the returned soldier who is applying for a War Service Home today will be placed at a very great disadvantage, because the terms offered by the State Government have been far 1 more liberal than those offered by the Commonwealth. Under the State Act a soldier is free of all rates and taxes for five years.",52
239,Mr WEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Would he not have to pay municipal rates?,52
240,Mr BLUNDELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"He is called upon to pay neither municipal nor water rates. Men who came back early from the Eront, and got in their applications before the unfortunate dispute between the Governments took place, had an advantage over men making their applications today, because they secured homes built by the State Government on the more liberal terms offered under the State Act. There is another matter to which I The should like to draw attention. A returned man taking one of the War Service Homes today is charged a minimum rental of about 17s. 6d. per week, in addition to which, of course, he has to pay rates and taxes. Under the State Department the returned soldier pays only 13s. 6d., and secures freedom from the payment of rates and taxes for five years. It is true that under the Commonwealth Act the soldier can redeem his liability sooner than he can do so under the State Act I wish to impress upon the Minister the desirability of extending the time for payment under the Commonwealth Act, .and permitting the returned soldier to secure a - home on a smaller weekly payment. members must know that a married man with an average family must regard a weekly payment of 17s. 6d. as a considerable drag upon his income.",52
241,Mr RILEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,That is a moderate rent in New South Wales.,53
242,Mr BLUNDELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"It is a moderate rent in comparison to the rents wihich have to be paid by men who have not the advantage of the terms offered to returned soldiers; hut I suggest that the terms .might he made still easier for the returned soldiers, hy enabling them to pay. smaller weekly payments over an extended period. That would be a very great advantage to men having large families, and it would be greatly appreciated by them. Honourable members have urged the Minister to extend the scope of the Act to include men who are today excluded from its operation. I wish to add one more to the list of persons to whom it is suggested that the Act shall apply. make an appeal to the Minister for the inclusion amongst those eligible to benefits under the Act of men who, during the war, were taken into camp after, medical examination, gave their services, but were rejected at the final medical examination prior to Every honourable member of the House probably knows of hundreds of men who were in this position, and failed to pass the final medical test before embarkation. A considerable percentage of such men lost their employment because at first they were accepted for service, and went into camp. MT. MAXWELL - Did not enlist?",53
243,Mr BLUNDELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes , they enlisted.",53
244,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Then they are provided for by the new definition of "" Australian soldier "" in the Bill now before the House.",53
245,Mr BLUNDELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"They offered-their services, were accepted, and spent some time in camp; but were finally rejected on a medical examination.",53
246,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Unde r the definition of ' ' Australian soldier "" as proposed to be amended by this Bill , in paragraph a of clause 2 there will be included any member of the Naval or Militar y Forces of Australia "" enlisted or appointed for "" Honourable or employed on active service.",53
247,Mr BLUNDELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I hope the honourable member is right ; but I ask the M in ister in charge of the B i ll to make quite sure on the point. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is a lawyer, and I am prepared to accept his interpretation of the effect of clause 2. It did not appear to me that provision was made by this Bill for the inclusion of the men to whom I have referred, and if they are included under it I must apologize to the House for having overlooked the matter. J"" recognise that the Bill is one that can be best considered in Committee; but before resuming my seat I wish to impress again upon the Minister in charge of the measure the absolute necessity of putting an end to the chaotic state of affairs existing at present in South Australia. It is not fair to the returned - soldiers that they should be prevented from obtaining homes because of differences existing between the State and Commonwealth GoI vernments.",53
248,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Wannon-Honorar y Minister) [8.39] - This Bill may be regarded as a further instalment in discharge of the Nation's obligations to its Fighting Forces. I personally appreciate the spirit in which honourable members embarkation. have addressed themselves to the principles of the measure and to the general administration of the War Service Homes Department. Whatever shade of political thought we may adopt in normal times, we have all to recognise that this is a State obligation, and in so far as the Government are charged with the fulfilment of a definite, solemn, and binding obligation, we can all afford to put aside our those men predilections of peace-time politics in order to marshal the resources of the State in the discharge of its obligations. That is the spirit in which Australia faced her war obligations, and it must be the spirit in which she shall face the discharge of her obligations to her defenders. Whilst in time of peace, in dealing with the relations of citizens to one another, one might hesitate to employ the resources of the State in the normal conduct of trade, commerce, and production, and the affairs of the people, where it is a question of the discharge of the obligations of the State to its soldiers I am prepared to use the resources of the State, if need be, to their limit . Reference has been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) and by many honourable members who sit with him, to the advantages to be gained by State insurance as applied to a scheme of this kind. I admit those advantages, because the asset in connection with which the State undertakes insurance is its own. It does not need to set aside capital that will not be earning anything. It does not need to employ a staff to get business, collect premiums, issue policies of insurance, and, generally, to engage in the competition associated with ordinary commercial insurance. In so far as it is a proposal for protecting the State's own property, the principle of State insurance - has a great deal to commend it . I take even a wider view of the necessities of the present situation. It is that view which is responsible for the Government embarking upon a venture which has been very much discussed during the debate on this Bill, namely, the purchase of timber areas and sawmills in Queensland. My feeling personally is that the State Governments, when they joined in consultation with the Commonwealth Government to consider the best means by which to discharge their obligations the matter of land settlement and housing schemes for the benefit of returned soldiers, should have placed at the disposal of the Commonwealth their great reserves of timber supplies. It is, in my a rather lamentable condition of affairs when we find a State Government raising the royalties against returned soldiers until they reach a maximum of 25s. per 100 super, feet for soft woods. that is the spirit in which they are to approach the settlement of a business of this description, I say that, in this respect, whatever may be necessary order to insure that sound homes of good commercial value may be built for our returned soldiers, I am prepared, with my colleagues' in the Ministry, fully share all the responsibility of seeing that the whole material necessary for the Mr Rodgers. erection of those homes shall be secured on a reasonable basis. When the contract which has been referred to was entered into, what was the position? The Commonwealth, in its attempt to build homes for returned soldiers, was daily in competition with the general public for building material on a colossal scale. We were competing in a sensitive market and were raising prices against ourselves and against the general community, whilst we were lessening the supplies available. We had, under the original Act, limited the cost of a home to £ 7 0 0 , but there was no l i m it to the ' rising values of the materials required. Whilst it is their prerogative to discuss and debate the bona fides of the Government in entering into a transaction of this description, it is at the same time the bounden duty of honourable members to face the question of repatriation in a reasonable spirit and with a proper 'recognition of their obligation to the House, the country, and the returned soldier. Honourable members must face the facts as they existed at the time the deal was made. To me the position is quite different from an ordinary transaction which has been entered into without the cognisance of Parliament. We definitely decided in this House to undertake the building of homes for soldiers, passed the necessary measure, and appointed a Commissioner to administer it , so that there might be no political consideration either in the erection of houses or in the acquisition of material for the purpose. We charged the Commissioner with defiin nite duties, and, beyond limiting his authority to expend money in certain - directions to £5,000, told him to go ahead and build homes for the soldiers.",53
249,Sir ROBERT BEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"What was the objudgment, ject of limiting his authority?",54
250,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Hi s authority was actually limited in regard to the acquisition of land. If Sir ROBERT BEST - But what was the real purpose of that limitation?,54
251,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Possibl y so that every transaction should come under the in cognisance of the Minister.,54
252,Sir ROBERT BEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Hear , hear! along Mr Rodgers - But that does not to necessitate the Minister having to bring every proposition involving over £5,00 0 to the House for approval. At what point is Ministerial responsibility to begin or end? At £5,000, £10,000, £50,000, or £500,000 ?",54
253,Sir ROBERT REST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"O r £5,000,000?",55
254,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I do not say that i might not have been more prudent when the House was sitting for the Minister to have come before it and asked for its approval of the proposition.,55
255,Mr STEWART,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,You admit that the action of the Government was wrong ?,55
256,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"On e moment. I think I have been Fairly patient, and honourable members have had . their opportunity speak. I ask men of sound commercial under which millions judgment what owner of a proposition would give an option which meant the material for the building of houses. disclosure of the whole of his business, and all the necessary details of it , to this House to be torn about in a wrangling debate of this description, and possibly have it turned down? I do not that would be a business-like procedure.",55
257,Sir ROBERT BEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,It is done every day. Contracts have been made subject to confirmation. Mr Rodgers' - Can the honourable mendation of Mr Brett. member tell me one that has been treated in that way in this House?,55
258,Sir ROBERT BEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Yes ; there was recent agreement with the Western tralian Co-operative Company.,55
259,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The Western Ausareas tralian Company came forward with a reforth . quest for an advance for the building silos-quite a different matter from posal to sell silos to the Government. Leaving that question, I will deal now with the Queensland purchase in the of the charges, if they may so be termed, made against the Government in this House. I defy any honourable member to say where a definite charge has been made, either that the price paid was exthe cessive or that the timber is not accessible, or that the Government did not take reasonable measures to inform themselves with regard to the magnitude of the chase or as to what they were getting, that they did not adopt ordinary business methods and inquire into the venture. I any charge has been made against the position to Mr Brett. Government it has come, at a very late hour in the debate, from the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), who says that, because a purchase of great magnitude has been entered into without the sanction of Parliament, it is a dereliccause tion of duty on the part of the Governhigher. ment. The question of whether the Government have exceeded their duty in entering into this contract must be governed by the wording of the authority given in the principal Act. Honourable members may t hold different opinions, but there is a distinction between this transaction and a contract, the authority to make which has never been given by Parliament. I might cite cases where Parliament has had no cognisance of contracts entered . into, and for which no authority has been given, but in this case there was a clear direction given by the House to to the War Service Homes Commissioner, had already been expended in the purchase of I am somewhat at a disadvantage in dealing with this matter, as the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E . D . Millen), who has been personally administering the think Department, has conducted these negotiations, but I am authorized by, hi m to give an emphatic denial to the statement that any part of the purchase of Lahey's property was made on the sole recomAs honourable members know, there were two propositions in Queensland-on e owned by Mr . the Lahey and one owned by Mr Brett. AusThe Lahey property comprised 10,000 acres of freehold land and two small occupied by the mill , office, and so It was a going concern with its of railway sidings, tramways, locomotives, a prorolling-stock, bullock teams, waggons, and so forth , and the Minister took the necessary steps to have it inquired into light by appointing Mr MCDaniel, a keen business man and an expert attached to the Queensland Pine Company, to make a complete estimate of the timber upon the area, its accessibility, the output of mills, and the rolling-stock and plant. The Department's own officer, Mr Bradshaw, afterwards proceeded to the property to overhaul Mr MCDaniel's repurport, but in addition the Minister also or thought it advisable to get what might be termed a check valuation, and theref fore made a general reference of the proHonorable members have suggested, of course, that Mr . Brett's valuation, because he also had a proposition to sell, would be higher than that of Mr MCDaniel's, bu t actually the reverse has proved to be the case, be Mr MCDaniel's valuation is the The Brett property comprised 10,057 acres of freehold, and the timber rights over another 7,380 acres, as well as three saw-milling plants. Again estimates were made of its timber bearing capabilities by Mr A . G. S. Lawrence, a timber expert from the firm of Macintosh Brothers, and he was supported and assisted by Mr Twine, the District Forestry Officer. Mr Bradshaw also overhauled this proposition. In both cases the price paid was considerably less than the vendors' offers. The Minister adopted the ordinary business methods. He looked around for the shrewdest and best business men he could find, and also specially sent up his own officer to check the reports and estimates of both valuers. The statement of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) the other night, that Lahey's proposition was bought on the valuation of Mr Brett, while withholding the fact that the purchase was made on the valuation of Mr MCDaniel, is not the sort of» criticism one would expect from a gentleman who ought to be assisting the House to a thorough understanding of a situation. orable member also stated that a material document was missing. I deny it . There is no letter or document missing. The complete file of the negotiations for the purchase of those properties are on record and at the disposal of honourable members.",55
260,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Is there any foundation for the statement that there is a missing document?,56
261,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I know of none whatever, nor have I been able to detect anything that would give colour to or justification for such a statement. I invite honourable members to inspect the file which I shall place at their disposal.",56
262,Sir ROBERT BEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,A r e the valuations in excess of the price paid.,56
263,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes , substantially. Time alone can prove whether the price paid is the actual intrinsic value of what has been purchased. This afternoon the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) made the astonishing statement that Mr Lahey's property had been submitted to the Queensland Government four years ago at a price of £150,000, and that all the available timber had been cut out of it at the rate of 8,000,000 super feet per annum, and that the balance would be of no use to the soldiers or the Government, or any one, as an aeroplane would be required to get at it . All I can say in reply to th* honourable member's statement is that the Repatriation Department have no knowledge of any such offer having been made to or rejected by the Queensland Government. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Ryan) was speaking, I put the question to him as to whether, when he was Premier of Queensland, he knew anything about a £150,000 proposition having been submitted to him, but he knew nothing of it .",56
264,Mr MCGRATH,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,He said that the offer might have been made.,56
265,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"If the honourable member had had a £150,000 proposition submitted to him it would not have gone so quickly from his mind, when, on a debate of this description, he had a chance of doing what he so often has desired to do, namely, to outflank the Ministry. Perhaps the best answer to the statement of the honourable member for Darling is that, whether the purchase be good or not, the mills are being run today temporarily by one of the best experts in Queensland, who guarantees to The hon- the War Service Homes Commissioner that out of this very "" inaccessible "" timber, the purchase of which is said to be such a bad deal for this country, he will supply hardwood at 32s. per 100 super, feet, whereas the present Brisbane price from the mills is 39s., and weatherboard at 30s. per 100 super, feet as against the market value of 42s.",56
266,Sir ROBERT BEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Is that an estimate or a guarantee?,56
267,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,It is an actual guarantee. These are the prices agreed upon.,56
268,Sir ROBERT BEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,B y whom ?,56
269,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"B y Mr Brett, who is running the mills today.",56
270,Sir ROBERT BEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,But that is no guarantee.,56
271,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Surely Mr Brett's reputation in Queensland can be taken as being a little more than a mere byword ? At any rate, what he guarantees to.do counters the view that the honourable member for Darling has put forward, that these timbers are so far distant that they cannot be reached except by the use of aeroplanes, and although these figures may not be subject to a guarantee running over a number of years they afford some proof that this is not a wild cat proposition.",56
272,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The guarantee is no part of the contract.,56
273,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"It is not, but the mills are being operated. I assure the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) that I am giving the facts, as I know them, to the House for what they-are worth. The honourable member is putting his own construction on Mr. Brett's undertaking.",57
274,Mr CORSER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Mr Brett has had a lifelong experience of timber.,57
275,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Of course, and he is a man of high standing in the timber world. It has been suggested here that, on the mere ipse dixit of a member or two, who have thrown some doubt or suspicion on this contract, but who can make no definite charge whatever in regard to it, the Government ought to hasten to appoint a Royal Commission or some similar body. I invite any honourable member who has first-hand knowledge, or who can get it, in connection with this proposition, to bring it to the House or to me personally. I will undertake to give it the most searching investigation, and the House will be made aware of any facts that can be brought to light. The way is open for honourable members to take that course, but it must not be expected that on mere rambling and doubtful statements, making no definite charge, and in no respect showing that the Government is responsible for an error of judgment, we should hasten to appoint a Royal Commission, or submit this matter to some other body.",57
276,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Can the Minister tell the House the estimated value of that purchase as against the open market price?,57
277,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"No , I have not taken it out in the aggregate on today's market prices, but that is easily reckoned up from the ruling rates. I have available a schedule showing the whole of the rates ruling today for hardwood, iron, lime, cement, and all other materials necessary for the building of soldiers' homes. ""While the contract insures the Government a supply for a number of years, and the Government anticipates being able to get out for the first eighteen months at the rate of about 12,000,000 super, feet of pine and 6,000,000 super, feet of hardwood, the output of'the mills can afterwards be increased to 1S,000,000 super, feet of pine. In order that the House may be better able to appreciate the difficulties that confront the Government in carrying through the War Service Homes problem, I may state that up to the 6 th September there were 1,332 homes built, and 2,735 in course of construction; contracts were let for 261, and tenders were under consideration for 79, or a total of 4,407 proposals dealt with. The applications received up to the 31st July totalled 27,000. With 4,407 only dealt with up to date, there remains a gigantic problem still to be faced and dealt with so far as material is concerned. That is no light matter. If today we find the market so much against the soldier, while Parliament limits the Commission and the Minister to a definite expenditure for homes, how are the Government and the Minister reasonably to face the position if their hands arc to be tied in every respect? I have been one who claimed very stoutly for this Parliament the control of the public purse. Mr 'STEWART - You are not doing it now.",57
278,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"But I have also to recognise that Parliament, including the honourable member, deliberately said, ""Here is a grant of millions, appropriated in the Estimates and passed. Let the Commission go ahead and build homes; we will not always be sitting, and there may be many months of the year in which you cannot refer to us directly."" Honourable members on both sides of the House know that soldiers' claims and requests for the building of homes are pressing and incessant. I am not going to say that it is a wise policy to give to individual Ministers or to the Commission the right to spend ad libitum. If Parliament happened to be sitting, and the proposition faced me, I should be delighted to have Parliament's opinion on it ; but this is a matter in respect of which I ask .the House to believe that the Minister acted in good faith, in the very best interests of the soldiers, after taking what I claim to be reasonable precautions to have the proposition overhauled before he finalized the deal.",57
279,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Is there any reason to believe that it is not a sound business proposition ?,57
280,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Fro m the investigations 1I have made, I 'have no reason whatever to believe so. On the contrary, land. Parliament by this measure is enlarging the scope of the War Service Homes scheme, and bringing in many new benewhole ficiaries. The problem of getting gated actuarially. material, therefore, becomes more acute every day. Prices have gone up, and expressed each of the State Governments concause trolling forest areas has raised the royalty. Their method, instead of directly raising it themselves, is to concessions for competition from time time, and up goes the royalty. We find ourselves in daily competition for limited supplies. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) says that that state of things is not confined to timber alone, and I have some sympathy with that statement. The grave responsibility faces this House of deciding to what exfore, tent it will allow its obligations to the soldiers to be discharged in this highly competitive market, where partial supthe plies alone are available. I regret that it has not been my personal province to have a closer association with these negosure tiations, for I should then have been in better position to inform honourable memto bers of the true merits of the case. hope they will remember that at about two minutes' notice it fell to my lot take charge of this measure. Within .the time at my disposal I have endeavoured, for the benefit of honourable members, get together such information as I thought necessary to enable them to form a sound judgment upon the proposition.",58
281,Mr LAIRD SMITH,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,You might mention the provision that has been made for a sinking fund.,58
282,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"- The honourable quantities, member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) inofficer dicated that in this proposition the vernment had altogether overlooked - the question of interest on the capifor tal involved, although in the costing system of timber that was always taken into account. If any Go the output? vernment, or Government officials, were responsible for such an oversight, their authority should be very quickly leshave sened, but I assure honourable members that full and complete provision for interest on the capital in the sinking fund itself.",58
283,Mr WEST,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,When you take the timber off the land it shrinks the value of the,58
284,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Provisio n has been made for that in the sinking fund. The matter has been carefully investiHonorable members on this side have objection to the transaction, bei t means another - State enterprise and a new Socialistic scheme. That is - not so. This is a purchase made for the offer fulfilment of the obligations in conto ' nexion with War Service Homes. When these needs are met, the Government will have in its hands the residuum in the shape of the timber left on the areas, plant and rolling-stock, which will be liquidated in the ordinary way, and also the land, and the whole thing will be closed up. The proposition* will, therenot form the subject of a new State enterprise. After all, there is not such a tremendous difference, as the Minister pointed out, between buying timber in round, or in logs, or sawn, and buying standing timber and the tools with which to cut it down and saw it up, thus making that the price will not rise against a the soldier and the Government from time time. Honourable members on this side I need have very little concern about the undertaking, viewed from the stand-point to of State Socialism. As the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) says, there is not much need to fear it as a to Socialistic enterprise.",58
285,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Hav e you had the quantities, as estimated by timber experts, checked by a public actuary ?",58
286,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes , the whole thing has been actuarially investigated. In addition to having experts estimating the we have had the Departmental up there checking their calculations Goand examining the whole proposition.",58
287,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Is there any warrant the suggestion of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), that the Department will not be able to keep up",58
288,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I think not. It may be that as we bite into the forest we shall to extend our tram-lines and other utilities to get at the timber which is not is made so readily accessible.,58
289,Mr CORSER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Senato r E. D. Millen told me that they did not reckon the land as an asset when purchasing, but looked on it as a reserve.",58
290,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I thought the whole proposition had been taken into account; but the Minister may consider the deal as so satisfactory from the point of view of the timber alone that he regards the land as a sort of bargain to the Commonwealth. Honourable members have treated this measure very much as if it were in the Committee stage. Each of them has outlined what he considers the shortcomings of the existing Act, and has given detailed criticisms of the Bill , with suggestions for alterations or additions to it . I propose briefly to deal with the points raised in this way, in order to shorten the subsequent debate in Committee. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) was good enough to hand me specific proposals by the limbless and permanently incapacitated returned soldiers for inclusion in the measure. If I gather its temper aright, the whole House seems to be in sympathy with the honourable member's suggestion. I believe that, without any further alteration of the Act , machinery is available for giving effect to what I take to be the genera] wish of the House, because section 47 of the principal Act providesTlic Commissioner may, if requested so to do by anj' prescribed authority of the Department of .Repatriation, provide a dwelling-house for the use of any totally and permanently incapacitated Australian soldier. Recently the provision made for that class of unfortunate sufferer from the war was reviewed, .and the allowance increased from about £ 2 to £ 4 per week, with 18s. 6d. for the wife, 10s. for the first child, 76. 6d. for the second, and 5s. for the third. The War Service Homes Commissioner is given very definite instructions in the Bill as to whom he can help, and how he can help them. He may have a somewhat wide individual discretion with regard to the purchase of material; but the beneficiaries under the Act are specifically enumerated,- and the amount of the benefits receivable by them is fixed. I propose, however, to suggest to the M in ister and the Repatriation Commissioner that the cases under review may be dealt with by the Commissioner under section 47 of the Act. It may involve a reduction of the increased advance so as to put it on a sound business footing. This is the business branch of repatriation. The building of homes is inseparable fro m the maintenance of the national asset at an unvarying mark. It is competent for the Repatriation Commissioners to approach the Housing Commissioner, and to say, "" In lieu of the increased provision recently made for the totally incapacitated and the limbless, we desire that the present pension allowance be slightly reduced and that, to balance the reduction, you shall provide a permanent home for these men."" The test to which the Commissioner has to submit the ordinary applicant consists in that he must be satisfied that the latter has reasonable prospects of paying his in stalments and wiping off his debt, and, up to the present, the experience of the Commissioner has been very satisfactory. At the earliest opportunity I shall consult the Minister (Senator E . D . Millen) and the members of the Commission, with a view to making provision whereby a totally incapacitated man may secure a home if he is prepared to abate, to some slight degree, the sum of his pension. W it h respect to the question of deposits being required, neither the Act nor this amending measure requires any applicant to make any deposit. Those who are eligible to make application comprise every member of the Australian I m perial Force, together with those persons additionally referred to in the Bill. So, in the case of youths who had enlisted for service abroad, and who had served in whatever capacity, they are, subject to the tests ordinarily imposed, eligible to benefit under the scheme. The tests consist of such questions as, "" Are you married?"" "" Are you about to be married?"" "" Have you reasonable prospects of being able to carry through your obligation in respect of securing a home?"" and "" Is your employment, or your position, or your temperament of such a character that one may reasonably expect you to stand up to your obligations?"" The matter of the eligibility of vocational trainees raises a business difiSculty. A young man is turning his hand to a new trade or .calling. He is in the initial stages of his training ; and, even though he may be making good headway, he may, within a month or two, have lost all inclination to continue. Off he goe9, neither f u l ly equipped to follow that avocation nor feeling inclined to do so. If he were to make application for a home at that stage, it could scarcely be said that he had reasonable prospects. However, as a trainee approaches the stages of his course-and having, perhaps, the promise of securing a lucrative t i o n - I think that the Commissioners might be induced to say that such a is eligible to come within the scope of War Service Homes legislation.",59
291,Mr CAMERON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,What about the case of a married trainee?,60
292,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"On e cannot very well take into account that condition, irrespective of the position as I have stated it . The test concerning whether or not a trainee has prospects of carrying out his home-purchasing obligation not necessarily influenced by the fact of his being married. If a trainee is married, he is not eligible to come within the scope of this legislation unless, course, he can comply with the tests have just mentioned. Some honourable members have raised the matter of building homes in country parts, and have critically compared rate of progress with that in metroand politan areas. I certainly think there room for speeding up so far as construccost tion in . the country is concerned; I would like to see many more homes built in the country districts. It must not be forgotten, however, difference himself. that there is a distinct advantage in building on large areas in cities, the matter of the Commissioner being able to make comparatively large conister's tracts for the supply of material at tically the one site, and with respect concentration of labour. However, I shall do all I can to speed up country construction. As for the matter of private purchase cf homes already erected, there is provision in the Act, and transactions spect of such homes are subject to the same l i m it as ordinarily. If the missioner is not satisfied that an equivation lent value for the amount of his advance is contained in the house he is quite to refrain from making the full amount of advance; or again, if the value of house is in excess of the l i m it of vance, the applicant is free to personally provide the difference. Regarding the - latter point, some honourable members appear to have become confused with the idea that this represents the a deposit. Ordinarily, homes are built on the rent instalment purchase system. If , however, an applicant desires to down, say, a total of 10 per cent., the final Government are prepared to advance the remaining 90 per cent., so allowing the posiapplicant to become the registered proprietor of his home-the Department man taking out a mortgage for the amount of the the 90 per cent, advance. If , after an applicant has paid up 15 per cent, of the purchase money., by instalments, he desires to become the registered proprietor, the Department will agree to the conversion of the contract at that stage, and just - will accept the position of mortgagee. This class of transaction, again, may have given rise to the erroneous belief is that a deposit is required. I have been asked by the honourable not member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell) to state the position in the event of an apof plicant choosing a design for his house, I and it being discovered that the structure will cost more than the estimated value. If the Department were to estimate that the house would cost not more the than £800-whic h sum was advancedi t were found that, as a result of is fluctuating prices, the home eventually £ 8 2 5 , the applicant would be at an advantage compared with others; that 1 is, unless he were brought down to within the £800 l i m it and required to find the",60
293,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The experience in in Western Australia, under the Workers' Homes Board, is the opposite of the M in argument. And after all , if he prachas the value in the house itself, what to does it matter to the Commissioner ?",60
294,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The honourable member is confusing Western Australia's State housing scheme with this measure, which provides a l i m it up to £ 8 0 0 .",60
295,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"W it h respect to the in reother scheme, there is-also a limit .",60
296,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,In Western AusComtralia there must have been some discreallowed the responsible Minister.,60
297,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"And there should be free some discretion allowed the Commissioner here. Of course, if an applicant asked the for certain extras he should pay for them; the adbut if the estimate of the Department's officers were at fault, and the eventual cost of the house were heavier than the estimate, the Department should be prepared to help the applicant, and not ask payment of him to pay the difference.",60
298,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The honourable member is assuming that if there is any excess pay over the estimate the fault will be due to miscalculation on the part of officers of the Department. I cannot accept that view. However, I have carefully noted the objection; but, within the scope this measure, I cannot offer any redress. It will be a matter for further considerament tion. This Bill proposes to widen the scope Army ? of our War Service Homes legislation. The honourable member for served Wentworth (Mr Marks) raised the question of who should have preAct. ference. The policy of the Department is to give first preference to members the Australian ImperialPorce, or to Christian widows of fallen soldiers. A f t e r there might be other persons eligible benefit, for whom theCommissioner would be placed under no disadvantage if he were to agree to provide homes, while at the same time carrying out contracts elseme where. But, subject to that consideraable tion, the policy of preference is precisely as I have indicated. The honourable member for Yarra Tudor) mentioned a matter of considerable interest to the general community, but which is not relevant to the question of who shall benefit under this measure. He referred to the ferocity of the rapabuilding cious landlord, and so for t h . This B should go a long way towards relieving that condition of affairs by providing tens of thousands of homes for men who prefore viously depended upon the landlords.",60
299,Dr MALONEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Some of the landlords should be in gaol.,61
300,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Like the honourable member, I am a keen advocate of every man owning his own home, if possible. The home is the first institution in life. If we have plenty of homes we shall have plenty of Australian families: the excesthe sive growth of flat life will not be for benefit of our race. I assure honourable members that I shall do everything within my power to hasten the construction of homes. To those honourable members who have expressed a desire to widen the scope of the measure in order to include many other classes of persons who rendered great, service in the war, I reply that we should first try to make greater headway with the provision of homes for the men iof the fightMackay), ing Eorces. As I have already shown, 27,000 applications have been received, and many more may be expected. If honminers' orable members insist upon the inclusion of new classes of beneficiaries they will only increase the difficulties of the Government and lessen the chance of members of the active fighting Forces getting their of homes within a reasonable time.",61
301,Mr MCGRATH,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Why did the Governinclude the Young Men's Christian Association and leave out the Salvation,61
302,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Every person who in the war zone is eligible for the . benefits under the War Service Homes Members of the Salvation A r m y who were accepted for service as chapof lains and members of the Young Men's Association accepted for service that, witli the Australian Imperial Force, are to alike eligible under the Act. The many honourable members who 6poke during this debate have stressed numerous phases of the housing problem. It is impossible for to answer the remarks of every honormember, and I invite those who have raised important questions to which I have not replied to address a direct interroga(Mr tion to me on the subject. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr . Mackay) referred to the discrimination in the legal provisions for housing under the War Service Homes scheme, - and the of houses on broad acres under ill the land settlement soheme. The construction of houses on broad - acres does not come within the.purview of the scheme now be the House. The Department has no obligations in that respect; but the matter is none the less important, for while the House is asked to give authority for the construction of homes up to a maximum cost of £800 in the metropolitan area, this Parliament and the State Parliaments together have decided that a sum of £625 is sufficient for the building of a home on land, and the acquiring of stock, imthe plements, equipment, fodder, and all that is necessary for the settlement of a soldier upon the land. Tliere is a wide discrimination, I admit, but the matter does not come within the province of the Housing Commissioner. It is a matter that particularly concerns the States, which control the land settlement policy; the Commonwealth has merely found the money to give effect to that policy. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr . and the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) referred to the position of leaseholders and holders of rights. At the present time those persons are not eligible, as a matter of administration, for an advance under the War Service (Homes Act. The Government have determined that they will erect homes only on freehold land in respect of which there can be no doubt as to the validity of the title and the reversionary rights of the Commonwealth. Miners' rights exist in only two States, Victoria and Queensland. The Commissioner has approached the Governments of both States, and an arrangement has been made with the Government of Victoria under which the Commonwealth may, without any objection being raised by the State authorities, compulsorily acquire any area covered by a miner's right for the purpose of building a soldier's home. The Queensland Government, however, has declined, even if compulsion be resorted to, to issue a freehold in respect of a miner's right. I am sorry that this matter could not have been arranged in a friendly spirit between the Commonwealth and all the States, so that a short measure might be passed in each State Parliament to convert the tenure of these lands, in order 'that the whole scheme of housing might be based on a uniform system of freehold. Many members claim that a perpetual lease and a miner's right offer a fair security to the Commonwealth, but what we are aiming at is the complete ownership by the soldier of his own home. We desire that when the soldier has paid off his obligations to the Department we may be able to issue to him a grant of the unencumbered freehold of his home, as his reward for the service he rendered. I shall endeavour to see if we cannot yet make this arrangement with the States by mutual consent. In regard to housing operations South Australia, the honourable for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) and the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Blundell) have on many occasions called attention to the overlapping and duplication in that State. South has a very commendable record, housing scheme having been well conducted by the State Government on very favourable terms. The State however, was inaugurated at a time when the price of money was lower, and the demand for housing accommodation less acute than it is today. ' During the most critical years of war tliere was almost a stoppage of building operations. With the return of the soldiers, the demand for houses increased, and under the Mr Rodgers. conditions which exist today, it has not been possible for the' Commonwealth to offer terms as advantageous to the soldiers as those which the South Australian Government offered. I would like to have seen an arrangement made under which the State Government, which had done so much and so well in regard to housing, could have been given control of the building of homes for the Commonwealth under conditions approved by this Parliament. Of course, we could not take the risk of handing over to the State complete charge of the scheme for building homes for soldiers. Such an arrangement has not been possible; the South Australian Government has pulled out of the work, and the obligations now rest wholly upon the Commonwealth. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - The State authorities set a standard which the Commonwealth will never reach.",61
303,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I have been endeavouring to commend the work done by the State Government, and I am now staging the position as it is today. Mr . Laffer, the Minister for Repatriation in South Australia, has made a statement in which he places upon the Commonwealth Repatriation Department the full responsibility of the present position of affairs. All I can do at this stage is to read to the House Senator E . D . M i l ieu's answer. He said"" I am very surprised,"" said Senator Millen, ""to see the statement of Mr Laffer, in which he says that the action of the South Australian Government in deciding to discontinue its housing operations for soldiers is - due to the Commonwealth extending to South Australia the operations of the War Service Homes Act. in "" The facts are that upon the Housing Commember missioner taking the initial steps to commence his operations in that State, it was represented to the Commonwealth Government that as South Australia was already dealing with soldier housing it was a duplication for the Commonwealth to undertake the same responsiAustralia bility. its "" Instructions were therefore given to cease operations under the War Service Homes Act in South Australia pending a promised communication from the Government of that. State. system, No communication was ever received, but' at the recent Premiers' Conference, as the result of a discussion with Mr Laffer, that gentlewas man undertook, after conference with his colleagues, to submit a proposal under which ths work would be left entirely to the State. ""No communication was received, however, until a reminder had been forwarded. After this Mr Laffer wrote stating that his Government had decided to cease operations. "" l t will thus be seen that, whilst the Commonwealth held its hand with a view to cooperation with the State Government, the latter has decided to withdraw, leaving the Commonwealth no alternative but to proceed with the work of war service homes building in that State."" Many other questions of a detailed nature were raised during the debate, and if further information upon them is desired I shall endeavour to furnish it in Committee.",62
304,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Did the Minister during my absence deal specifically with the case of limbless and blind soldiers?,63
305,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes ; and I repeat that I think we can give effect to the wish expressed by the honourable member under section 47, which provides that the Housing Commissioner may build homes for such persons at the Repatriation Commissioners' request. It becomes now a question of policy for the Government, the Housing Commissioner, and the Repatriation Commissioners to agree that, in lieu of certain increased pension provision, homes may be provided.",63

It seems to me that, under the clause we are now considering, they will be entitled f o the benefits which will be conferred by this measure. I do not object to persons who enlisted during the later stages of the war, but who did not go abroad owing to the termination of the struggle, receiving all the benefits which will accrue to them under the Bill .

If the definition of "" Australian soldier "" be altered, we shall injure a number of men who enlisted for service abroad, but who were retained here for special service. It was not their f a u that the y did not leave Australia. The definition as it stands is a very fair one, which will overcome some of the difficulties from which our soldiers are suffering today.",64
320,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Fawkner) [ 9 . 5 6 ] should like the opinion of the Honorary Minister (Mr Rodgers) the scope of paragraph a of this clause. I desire to know whether it will cover a certain class of men- I refer to those whose case was advocated this afternoon by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks)-the staff and men of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade. I know certain members of that staff who were as keen as mustard in their war enthusiasm, and who volunteered for service abroad, but who were notified that they were required at home. Had these men been kept here simply for home service I should have nothing to say upon the matter. But certain of them were sent out upon special service. They were sent outside the territorial waters of Australia upon examination duty. I know one member of the staff, especially, who was thus engaged for several months. was employed upon this examination work, for weeks he had not his clothes off night or day, he was scarcely ever dry, and he was certainly in the danger zone, because there was always a possibility of his encountering German warships or of striking a mine. I should' like to know whether his case is covered by the definition of "" Australian soldier."" That definition sets out that "" Australian soldier "" means a person who, during the continuance of the war, was a member of the Naval Forces of Australia employed on active service outside Australia. My reading of that provision' is that a member of the Naval Forces who was sent beyond our territorial waters into the danger zone was upon active servioe outside Australia.",64
321,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I understand that all members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade, when called up at the outbreak of war, were regarded as being on active duty, whether they were on duty ashore of afloat. M . MAXWELL - The r e for e , the only thing required to bring the man whose case I have cited within the definition of "" Australian soldier "" as set out in paragraph 6 was that he should be sent outside Australia. He was sent outside our territorial waters. I should like to know whether in the opinion of the Minisl t ter this case is covered by this definition. Clearly such a man should be elegible to receive the benefits which will be conferred by the Bill .",64
322,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Wannon-Honorar y Minister) [10.0] - I regret to say - I that in the past the ruling of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E . D . upon Millen) has been to the effect that members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade are excluded from participating in the advantages conferred by the principal Act. Two classes in particular are not provided for at present, namely, the Royal Australian Naval Brigade and the Royal Garrison Artillery , but in respect of them. I am making a recommendation, which I hope vcill be accepted, as they were practically mobilized at the outbreak of war and stood at attention waiting for instructions. Had any German raider escaped from the patrol of the seas and attacked Australia, these were the men who would have been called upon to meet the enemy. I ask the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) not to pres3, at this stage, for the inclusion of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade. I hope He to make an announcement on the subject before the Bill is finalized.",64
323,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Dampier) [ 1 0 . 1 ] move That paragraph (a) be left out. My desire is to get a clear indication from the Committee upon the point I raised as to whether the advantages of the Act should be extended only to those who enlisted and were engaged on active service.,65
324,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Y a r r a ) [ 1 0 . 3 ] the Committee will not agree to the amendment. If this were a Gratuity Bill there would, no doubt, be much to recommend it , because it might then be argued that we were extending the liability of the Commonwealth. But with respect to this measure the Minister has assured us that only a very small percentage of the liability is outstanding at the present Jiime. V "" Mr MCGRATH - A b o u t £1,500.",65
325,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I understand nearly £200,00 0 has been repaid by per-sons who have received advances, and that less than £2,00 0 is overdue.",65
326,Mr BLAKELEY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,And for which security is held by the Commonwealth.,65
327,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"That is so. The advance is not a g if t . The Government are merely lending the money to eligible persons who rendered some servioe to the Commonwealth during the war. I am not in favour of limiting the advantages of the Act . My desire is to extend them if possible. I have in mind the case of a man who was living at Mildura, and who had served in the South Africa n War. He enlisted, but was turned down. Then he went to Kerang, enlisted again, and was once more rejected. Next he went to Bendigo, had the same experience there, and finally, in Melbourne, was accepted for home service. This"" man enlisted seventeen times, and he was very anxious to get away. Another man, an officer of the Citizen Forces, enlisted at the outbreak of the war, but the authorities said that his services as an instructor for the men in camp and as a "" coach "" for officers were so valuable that he could not be spared for service overseas. He signed on in the Australian Imperial Force, and actually got on board a transport, but was withdrawn and kept in Australia. Senator E . D . Millen told me that he thought this man should have the advantages of the Act, because probably his services to the Commonwealth were as valuable as were the services of many [198] - I men who went to the Front. I shall vote against the amendment. Amendment negatived.",65
328,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Hunter ) [10.6] During the second-reading debate the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Ryan), referring to the definition clause, mentioned that there did not - I hope appear to be provision for organizations similar to the Young Men's Christian Association, which is specially included; and he instanced the case of the Salvation A r m y . The Honorary Minister (Mr Rodgers), in reply, said the definition provided for the Salvation A r m y , but I see no reference to that organization, and I think that if the Young Men's Christian Association is"" included, the Salvation Army, or any other religious or charitable association which rendered that similar service, should also be proxided' for. Mir. MAXWELL - Otherwise "" an invidious distinction will be made.",65
329,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Yes ; we shall have laid at our door the charge that, in this Bill , we provided only for a certain section, whilst others, who did equally good work, received no recognition. I ask the Minister, in view of his statements, to be good enough to in for m the Committee in what way the Salvation Army, or any other religious bodies, are-, provided for.",65
330,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Wannon-Honorar y Minister) [10.8] - Every member of a denomination who served in the danger zone, or who was accepted for service, is included in the scope of the measure. "" Accepted for service"" is the governing term. In the case of the Salvation Army, all chaplains are eligible, as are all chaplains of other religious denominations; but members of the Young Men's Christian Association, who were not chaplains but who were "" accepted for service "" within the danger zone are now put on the same footing as chaplains.",65
331,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,-What about members of the Young Men's Christian Association - who were not chaplains but performed similar work?,65
332,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"They will not be included - I hope the honourable member will not press for the inclusion of others, such as Red Cross workers and Comforts Fund workers, while members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade and members of the Royal Garrison A r t ill e r y are excluded.",65
333,Mr CHARLTON,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,But will not this definition include the whole of the members of the Young Men's Christian Association who were doing any work at all?,66
334,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I do not think this definition will apply to more than fifty persons. It is a special provision, in serted to put Young Men's Christian Association ofncials on the same footing as those 'chaplains I have enumerated, and who, having heen "" accepted for service,"" are included. I assure the honourable member that chaplains in the Salvation A r m y , "" accepted for service,"" are included, and that the definition does not include every member of the Young Men's Christian Association. ' It would not be feasible or wise for the Commonwealth to undertake so wide an obligation as to make housing provision for all those who rendered service behind the lines.",66
335,Mr MARR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Parkes) [10.10] understand it is now . the intention of the Honorary Minister (Mr Rodgers) to make provision for the inclusion of members of the Royal Australian Naval B r i gade and members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery, and if such is the case, I should like to know why others who are in the same category are to be excluded. If the members of the units mentioned are to come under the provisions of this Bill , why are not the members of the Royal Australian Engineers and the members of the Wireless Staff, who enlisted and who were liable to be sent abroad, to be overlooked? If we in clude some, we must include them all , and there cloes not appear to be any justification for separating them in this' way. The engineers were in attendance throughout the day and night for the whole period of the war, and surely they are entitled to some consideration. have recently been in consultation with the Repatriation Department, and have received a ruling to the effect that men 'who enlisted as doctors and dentists and who were engaged in home service work are not to receive any benefits at all.",66
336,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,This is to cover men who enlisted.,66
337,Mr MARR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I had a distinct ruling from the Repatriation Department today.,66
338,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,But this Bill is to cover men who actually enlisted.,66
339,Mr MARR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"But I am referring to those who are included in the Repatriation Act , and am contending that , if we include the members of the Royal Australian Naval Brigade and Royal Australian Garrison Artillery, we should also include the members of other units. I understand that the measure applies only to those munition andwar workers who were employed in connection w""ith the Government scheme, but it must be remembered that the Government had supervision of the men only during the latter period. There were many war workers who went away at their own expense, and although they were working side by side with men who were under Govern-' ment supervision, they found on their return that they were not to participate in the benefits provided under such measures as this. I trust the Minister will carefully consider this matter, and see that if munition and war workers are to - I benefit, others in the same category are also included.",66
340,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Dampier) [10.15] I am in accord with the views expressed by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), Although representatives of the Young Men's Christian Association rendered satisfactory service, I know, from letters I received from the . Front, that the representatives of the Salvation A r m y were more in touch with the soldiers, who seemed to appreciate the work of that organization more than they did that of the Young Men's Christian Association. I cannot understand why representatives of the latter organization should be included when the representatives of the Salvation A r m y are not. This clause makes it clear that any member of the Young Men's Christian Association accepted for s e r v i c e ",66
341,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"That is the whole I point, "" accepted for service.""",66
342,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Surely some members of the Salvation A r m y were in a similar position.,66
343,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The chaplains of the Salvation A r m y are eligible, but the great body of men behind them are not included. On the other hand, certain representatives of the Young Men's Christian Association who were in the danger zone are specifically mentioned, but the members of the Young Men's Christian Association behind them are not included. It is merely putting the officers of the Young Men's Christian Association in the same position as chaplains of other denominations.",66
344,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Then this provision will not bring in the general body of the Young Men's Christian Association workers.,67
345,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Certainl y not.,67
346,Mr MCGRATH,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Ballarat) [10.16] I do not know why special mention should be made of Young Men's Christian Association workers. If they were accepted for service they are entitled to all the benefits. If a man joined the Australian Imperial Force and went to Great Britain, France, or Gallipoli, he would be entitled to the benefits to be conferred by this Bill . I realise that the were riot. measure is not to apply to the general body of Salvation A r m y workers. I do not know of any one other than chaplains who went in a similar capacity to the representatives of the Young Men's Christian Association. Most of the representatives of the Young Men's Christian Association supervised sports and entertainments on troopships, and took charge of football matches in England and in France and did very good work. There were no representatives of the Salvation A r m y who went abroad in a similar capacity, as they either enlisted in the A r m y as chaplains and were attached to infantry or artillery units. As regards the work performed by the two organizations in the base camps, that of the Salvation Arm y stands by itself. I have know instances where the representatives of the Young Men's Christian Association di d not do good work, but tliere are others where they performed very satisfactory service. It all depended on the official in charge. I trust the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton"") will not move an amendment on the lines he has indicated, because, if such an amendment were carried, it would not benefit one officer of the Salvation Army who we are not already providing for. ' Mr BELL (Darwin) [10.19] - I am somewhat in sympathy with the views expressed by the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH), because I do not know why there should be a distinction between the representatives of the Young Men's Christian Association and the Salvation A r m y . I did not come in contact with many representatives of the Salvation A r m y , but that is not saying that they did not do excellent work. In Gallipoli and Palestine we had quite a number of Young Men's Christian Association men, but they were all in charge of canteens or supervising sports, and were well behind the lines. It would be difficult for the Department to decide as to what work was done within the danger zone. I do not know that there are any records to show whether a Young Men's Christian Association official remained all through in camp at, say, Monastir, or whether he went up to Jerusalem. No records would be kept of their movements.",67
347,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Some were accepted for service as members of the Young Men's Christian Association, and others",67
348,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The applicant would have to satisfy us as to the character of his work.,67
349,Mr BELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,A Young Men's Christian Association official might not have been within 500 or 600 miles of the danger zone. I am opposed to enlarging the scope of the Bill in order to bring these gentlemen under it at the present time.,67
350,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,This definition is designed only to make clear what was a doubtful point. I hope the honourable member will accept my assurance that it is by no means certain that it involves any enlargement of the scope of the Act.,67
351,Mr BELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"My opinion is that subparagraph d of paragraph c will only create difficulties for the Department. I am satisfied in my own mind that it will not be possible to show what members of the Young Men's Christian Association who l e ft Australia for service abroad were within the danger zone. According to the Minister's statement, any member of the Young Men's Christian Association who was accepted for service will come within the scope of the Bill so long as he served outside Australia.",67
352,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The Department has gone into this matter. The sub-paragraph to which the honourable member refers will not bring in at the outside more than forty or fifty of these special officials who were accepted for service.,67
353,Mr BELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Then why should not the remainder be brought within the Bill ?,68
354,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Because they were not accepted for service.,68
355,Mr BELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I fai l to see any distinction between those members of the Association who were accepted for service and other members who were not, but did exactly the same work. I am afraid that we can make no headway in this matter; but I firmly believe that it will not be possible to obtain any records to show the Department whab members of the Association served within the war zone.",68
356,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Y a r r a ) [10.24] - I am in favour of members of the Young Men's Christian Association who were accepted for service being brought within the scope of this Bill . When another measure was under discussion I spoke of the desirableness of taking this action, and two returned soldier members of the Ministerial party asserted that the work done by the Young Men's Christian Association with our oversea Forces was not to be compared with that done by the Salvation Army. . The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell), and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming) would not admit that the Young Men's Christian Association officials had done anything that would compare with the work achieved by the Salvation Army.",68
357,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I think that the honourable member's memory is at fault.,68
358,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Not at all. I have a very good recollection of the statement made by the honourable member.,68
359,Mr BURCHELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I believe that the Salvation Army did better work than the Young Men's Christian Association.,68
360,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,That is what the honourable member said on the occasion to which I refer. I then stated that in my opinion both the Young Men's Christian Association and the Salvation Army had done magnificent work. We now find the Government differentiating between the two organizations. Members of the Young Men's Christian Association are specifically brought within the scope of the Bill .,68
361,Mr LISTER,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,We are told that the vation Army officers are alreadv provided for.,68
362,Mr MARRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Chaplai n Colonel MCKenzie is provided for.,68
363,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Because he is a chaplain. All chaplains come within the scope of the Bill . , <",68
364,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The Salvation_Army is a "" denomination,"" whereas the"" Young Men's Christian Association is not.",68
365,Mr TUDOR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Is the honourable member sure of that? Everything will depend upon, the interpretation placed upon the words "" eligible persons "" and "" acceptedfor service . . . as a representative of that association."" If the Honorary Minister (Mr Rodgers) will assure me that there is no differentiation to the disadvantage of the Salvation A r m y or other denominations or associations, I shall be satisfied.",68
366,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I assure the honourable member that the Salvation Army chaplains are not shut out.,68
367,Mr MARR,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Parkes) [10.27] - I should like to have from the Minister (Mr Rodgers) a statement as to whether it is the intention of the Government to bring war workers, including munition workers, within the scope of the Bill .",68
368,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Wannon-Honorar y Minister) [10.28] - In order to remove any doubt, and so as not to leave the question entirely to the discretion of the Commissioner, the Bill clearly sets out the definition of "" eligible person,"" and munition workers are brought within the Bill . The definition of "" munition worker,"" as accepted by the Department, is "" one who went abroad under arrangement with the Defence Department."" It does not in clude those who of their own volition went abroad as munition workers, or to do something else which might have been of great value to the Allied cause. The honourable member will recognise the difficulty of following up such cases, and ascertaining the nature of the work actually done. We have a direct record of the munition workers who went away under arrangement with the Defence Department. There is a connecting link between the Department here and the authorities at Home which enables us to ascertain the terms of their engagement. On the other hand, we have no record of those who, from patriotic motives, went away as war workers apart from, any arrangement with Salthe Department, and to include them would be to open the door altogether too wide. Clause agreed to. Clause 3After section 14 of the principal Act the following section is inserted:"" 14A. Before exercising any power under this Act in connection with the acquisition of land or building material or with any contracts incidental thereto, the Commissioner shall, if the exercise of the power involves the expenditure of more than Five thousand pounds, submit his proposal for the approval of the Minister.""",68
369,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Dampier) [10.30] This is the clause under which the Government recognise that the Commissioner should not have power to spend more than £5,000 without the approval of the Minister. A recent purchase of timber areas and saw-mills has been extensively discussed during the debate on this Bill , and I ask the Minister in charge of the measure whether the Government are prepared to instruct the Public Accounts Committee to inquire into and report to Parliament in connection with that purchase. Every honourable member who realizes his responsibility must recognise that when the original Act was passed it was never intended for a single moment that a transaction of that magnitude should be entered into without consulting Parliament. It may be that it was within the legal definition of the powers given to the Minister for Repatriation and the Commissioner under the Act, but as Parliament was sitting the Government should have reported the transaction to it. Will the Government agree to refer the transaction to the Public Accounts Committee, and ask them to inquire into it and report?",69
370,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Wannon-Honorar y Minister) [10.32] - The object of the amendment proposed by clause 3 is to bring the action of the Commissioner in respect to any purchase, whether of land or material, exceeding £5,000 within the purview of the Minister. Under the existing Act the approval of the Minister was required only when such an expenditure was involved in the purchase of land. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr . Gregory) asked me whether I am prepared to .refer the recent purchase of timber and saw-mills in Queensland to the Public Accounts Committee. I am sorry to say that I cannot undertake to do that, but I remind the honourable member that assurances have been given, by both the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E . D . Millen), that any future transactions in volving the expenditure' of large sums of money will be brought before Parliament.",69
371,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"""West Sydney) [10.34] I understood the Honorary Minister (Mr Rodgers) to say that he was not [199]' agreeable to the suggestion of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) to have the Queensland transaction referred to the Public Accounts Committee. I think the honourable member's request was a very proper one to make.",69
372,Mr BELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,We might just as reasonably ask for an inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee into every purchase of timber.,69
373,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I am prepared to extend the suggestion to the purchase of all timber. The honourable member for Dampier is very modest when he asks that only this particular transaction shall be referred to the Committee. I hope that he will press his request by seeing that some suitable amendment is submitted which will enable that transaction to be reviewed.,69
374,Mr GREGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I cannot, by an amendment of this Bill, deal with a transaction which has already taken place.",69
375,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,Why not?,69
376,Mr GBEGORY,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,How could it be done ?,69
377,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"The honourable member can do it very simply. If all that he requires is the drafting of an amendment for the purpose, I can suggest how it might be done. We might add to the clause the wordsAnd, moreover, any agreement which has already been made for the purpose of saw-milling and timber lands in Queensland involving an amount of about £500,000 shall be subject to the approval of Parliament. That would .cover what the honourable member desires.",69
378,Mr ROBGBRS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"""Where would it leave the unfortunate vendor who has given up possession ?",69
379,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"That would be merely a matter for compensation. If the position is as Ministers have assured us, the inquiry suggested would prove that the transaction is entirely above board, and one which should have been entered into. The request of the honourable member for Dampier might he given effect to, if not by an amendment of this clause, by the insertion of a new clause. I hope that the honourable member will press his suggestion, as there is the germ of a sound idea in it . The particular transaction to which he has referred should be reviewed. I am interested in it to this extent: That I am .vitally concerned in the success of State enterprises. I hope to see them successful, and for that reason I trust that no transaction entered into as a State enterprise will be undertaken under conditions, or a purchase made under terms, which might lead to that State enterprise being a failure.",69
380,Mr MAXWELL,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,The honourable member hopes that the transaction which has been referred to will be a great success.,70
381,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I do, indeed. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) will, I am sure, give me credit for being sufficiently patriotic not to hope that the country would lose by it. I hope that it will be successful, because I helieve in the policy of State enterprise in such matters. The honourable member for Dampier knows that certain suggestions have been made with regard to the soundness of the Queensland transaction, apart from the policy involved.",70
382,Mr GBEOORT,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I do not want to prejudge it ; that is why I should like to have an inquiry.,70
383,Mr OHAKLTOIT,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,I have given notice of an amendment to olause 5 which will cover the ground.,70
384,Mr RYAN,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"I am glad to hear that, and therefore I will not press the matter further at this' stage. Olause agreed to. Clause 4 agreed to. Clause 5After section 17 of the principal Act the following Bection is inserted:"" 17A.

It will save time if the Minister in charge of the Bill will say whether he is prepared to accept that amendment. If he is no.t prepared to accept it, considerable time may be taken up in discussing it.",70
386,Mr RODGERS,BUILDING OPERATIONS IN SOUTH,"Wannon-Honorar y Minister) [10.39]- - The honourable member's amendment opens up the whole field of State enterprise. As I mentioned in some earlier remarks, that is a matter upon which honourable members hold very fixed views. My object in rising now is to remind the Committee that many new beneficiaries are awaiting the passage of this measure. Their applications are already in, some under the assumption that they were already included. I hope that honourable members opposite will be prepared to put the amendment now moved to a test as early as possible, so as - ot to delay the passage of the measure. Progress reported.
