3,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I know nothing of the circumstances, but shall have inquiries made. Manifestly, the' Commonwealth Shipping Line will take every step neces-' sary to facilitate the shipping of goods from Hobart.  that the Commonwealth Bank, with its world-wide ramifications, is able to publish its yearly accounts about two months after the close of the financial year, and seeing that the accounts of the Commonwealth Shipping Line for the year ended 30th June, 1921, will not be available until, the Budget statement is delivered next month, will the Minister representing the Prime Minister see that the balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Line, of steamers for the financial' year ended 30th June, 1922, is available within a reasonable time?",13

7,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT," I regret the necessity of having to use the House as a vehicle for the publication of the statement. I propose to make; but, in view of the attacks that have been made in this Chamber, under cover of privilege, by the honourable' member for Cook (Mr Oatts), in which he has impugned the character.of certain men outside, it is only fair that the denial which these men give to such allegations should he afforded the publicity usually given to utterances in the House, and be recorded in Hansard.

It s consideration by the Parthe liament of New South Wales was intera rupted by the closing of the session. I am assured, however, by the Premier of New South Wales; that he will bring i before the Parliament of that State the earliest opportunity. I am that the feeling in favour of the measure in the New South Wales Parliament is almost unanimous. It is not a Bill , and we hope it will be passed shortly. BAS EMETALINDUSTRY . WILLIAM A. GIBUS.

13,Mr BURCHELL,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"H as the Minister for Trade and Customs read a cablegram in the press to the effect that Spain has imposed export duties on base metals sent from that country to Germany owing to the decline in the value of the mark giving Germany a decided advantage in smelting?

16,Mr BRUCE,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"I do not think that a discussion in this House could influence the decision which has been arrived at.

As the accounts closed on the 30th June, and they have been submitted to the Auditor General for a special audit, I do not think the honourable member will have cause to complain of unreasonable delay if he gets the particulars next Wednesday. POWER ALCOHOL.",16
25,Mr HIGGS,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether, with a view to the production of power alcohol at a commercial price, he will permit the denaturing of alcohol for power purposes by the addition of not less than 10 per cent, of coal tar benzol as an effective denaturant? 2. Will he give for public information the reasons for the new order for denaturing spirit? 3. How many millions of gallons of petrol and kerosene were imported into the Commonwealth during the year ended 30th June, 1922 ?",16
26,Mr RODGERS,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:- 1. Nb. 2. It is not clear as to' what ""Order"" the question refers. If it be to Statutory Rules 1922, No. 51, dated 1st June, 1922, the reason is that in the interests of the revenue it was considered desirable to revert .to the standard for industrial spirit in force prior to the recent war, which standard had. to be departed from during that period owing to the scarcity of some of the denaturants. The Regulation cited actually allows a wider choice of denaturants than did the regulation which was - in force prior to the war. So far ns alcohol fuel is concerned it is not proposed to require the use of more than 1 per cent of wood naphtha in addition to the other denaturants.

27,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,MURRAY RIVER WATERS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow: . 1. As the statistics of pensions granted by the Department are not arranged according to rank, the information asked for by the honourable member could only be obtained after an examination of all pensions granted to ex-members of the Forces. 2. and 3. It is not considered desirable that such personal information regarding pensioners should be made public. MILITARYMEDICAL OUTFITS.",16

32,Mr RODGERS,SHIPBUILDING AT,"The information is being obtained. AERIALMAIL SERVICES. Dr EARLE PAGE asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. What is the amount paid as Government subsidy for aerial mail services? 2. In view of the size of that subsidy, is there any obligation on the proprietors of those services to use, other things being equal, Australian-made aeroplanes? 3. If not, will he consider the advisability future contracts containing such a clause?",17
33,Mr MASSYGREENE,SHIPBUILDING AT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:_ 1. At the present time; there is only sidized aerial service in operation, viz., that between Geraldton and Derby, Western Australia (1,195 miles). A contract was let to Messrs. Western Australian Airways Limited, for a period of twelve months, from Sth December, 1921, for the operation of a regular [20 ] weekly (return) service over this reute. The subsidy payable for maintenance of the service for the period of the contract is £25,000. The following additional contracts have been let for a period of twelve months, but service has not yet commenced:(o) Brisbane-Sydney (550 miles) - Sub sidy, £11,500. (6) Sydney-Adelaide (760 miles) - Sub sidy, £17,500. (c) Charleville-Cloncurry (575 miles) Subsidy, £12,000. 2. No. At the time tenders were received for the Western Australian service, there' were no Australian-made aeroplanes available for the efficient operation of this service. At the time tenders were called for the maintenance of the other services, Australian manufacturers were not in a position to produce in requisite numbers and in reasonable time machines suitable in design and performance for the economical operation of the service. 3.

What action, if any, has been taken by the company to carry out the terms of the agreement? 3. What ore the names and addresses of the representatives of the Commonwealth Government on the directorate of such company?",17
35,Mr GROOM,SHIPBUILDING AT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. The only contribution by the Commonwealth under the agreement with the Anglo Persian Oil Company, approved by the Oil Agreement Act 1920, is the amount paid by the Commonwealth on its 250,001 shares in the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. The amount so paid up to date is £100,000 8s. 2. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has complied with its obligations under the agreement to form and register a company, which is proceeding with the erection of an oil refinery. of The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has also erected three large bunkering tanks for fuel oil at Fremantle, Melbourne, and Sydney, and is supplying fuel oil at those places. 3.

FORGED TELEGRAM.  ber for Barrier (Mr Considine) asked a question yesterday regarding certain official papers. I have looked into this matter, and find that the honourable member has already seen the papers, and that my predecessor declined to lay them on the table of the House. In view of advice I have received from the Crown Law officers, I am unable to comply with the honourable member's request. NA LINE OF STEAMERS. BALANCE-SHEET : FBEIGHTS.",17
36,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"On the 13th July the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Pratten) inquired when the balance-sheet for the Commonwealth Government Line of steamers for the year ended 30th June, 1921, would be presented. I desire to inform the honourable member that, in accordance with the usual practice, the balance-sheet will be presented in the Budget papers. On the 12th July, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) asked if the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Line of steamers was aware that the managers of the line are charging higher freights from British ports to Australia than they are charging from Antwerp to Australia. In reply, I beg to state that the rate of freight from Antwerp to Australia is the same as from the United Kingdom to Australia. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE. Motion (hy Mr RICHARD FOSTER) agreed to That the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works have leave, so far as members of the House of Representatives are concerned, to sit in Adelaide during the sittings of the House.

37,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Batman) [11.25] Last night, when at a late hour the Leader of the House by an act of unusual mercy, agreed to the adjournment of the debate, I was discussing what is known as the wireless agreement made between the Commonwealth and. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and I had pointed out that that agreement now executed between the Commonwealth and the company was the result of investigation by a Committee, following upon a motion moved in this House; also that in many radical particulars it was a departure from the agreement which the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) wished the House to adopt, and that it was still, in my view at all events, open to very severe criticism on the ground that the Government should not have given away its paramount rights by associating itself with a subordinate company of this kind. We may console ourselves, however, with the knowledge that the position is not as bad as it might have been; unquestionably it is not so bad aa it would have been but for the timely protest made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton). The Commonwealth Government have pledged this country to the expenditure of £500,000 in the first place, and I have sufficient knowledge of the developments incidental to undertakings of this kind to feel sure that our financial commitment is not likely to be limited to that amount. The agreement as it stands, as I have said, is much better than it was, but it is still open to criticism, and I say this with a full knowledge and admission that as a member of that Committee I had some little part in making suggestions as to how the agreement might be improved. I did not pretend to draft in detail a water-tight agreement between the Commonwealth and the company. That, I should have supposed, was a matter for very careful deliberation on the part of the Commonwealth Crown Law officers. The agreement now before us was hastily drafted by representatives of the'Crown Law Department, but the fact that its details are still open to very serious question hears out in a very striking way our contention that it should not have been ratified without the consent of Parliament, and that, as the Leader of the Opposition contended when the matter was first before us, we should have provided that the report of that Committee should come back to this House for further and fuller consideration. But for some reason which I am quite at a loss to understand, the Prime Minister was so eager to commit the Government to this agreement, so eager to commit the Commonwealth to this expenditure, and was so extraordinarily friendly to this corporation, that he would not brook any further delay-n o delay at all if he could have helped it-and succeeded in getting the House to consent that there should be no delay beyond what was necessary for the Committee to consider the agreement; he would not postpone the final adjustment until the House had an opportunity >- of discussing the Committee's report. I am sorry to say that the majority of the Committee have furnished a very sparse report. I quoted last night from the evidence, which is of a highly illuminating character. But the report of the Committee itself, I repeat, is meagre - I reported at somewhat greater length. I , however, was in a minority. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has said that, because I furnished my report upon the eve of the meeting of Parliament, my action was necessarily a mere party political move. The reason why I presented my report so close upon the inauguration of the session was that it appeared to me that its earlier presentation could serve no good purpose. It could not be considered until Parliament had met, and was, therefore, in a position to do to. Also I was influenced by the fact that, whether I disagreed or agreed, the contract would be accepted by the Government, and would bind the Commonwealth. A very startling and ominous piece of information is made known this morning. I refer to the answers to a series of questions put in the Senate Chamber yesterday by Senator J . D. Millen, a member of the Committee. It will be recalled by honourable members that the original draft agreement provided for .the preponderating influence in the company to be that of Amalgamated Wireless, in respect of the directorate, as against that of the - Commonwealth. The Opposition in this chamber attacked that proposition; and the Committee accepted its view, as against that defended by the Government. As a result, in the present agreement there has been inserted «. clause to the effect that the directorate shall consist of an equal number of representatives of Amalgamated Wireless and of the Commonwealth, three on eachside, and that the chairman shall be selected by this joint directorate.",18
38,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And that, in the event of disagreement 1",19
39,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; I was about to add that in that event the matter of his selection was to be submitted to an arbitrator. The chairman-this seventh member of the directorate-ha s been so selected. There was a disagreement between thegentlemen representing the Government and those representative of Amalgamated! Wireless. At all events, there was & nominal disagreement, for the outcome has been that, following upon the appointment of an arbitrator, there haa been selected and appointed--as an independent chairman, be it marked-the Chairman of Amalgamated Wireless itself, namely Sir Thomas Hughes.",19
40,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is the hottest thing I have eiver heard !,19
41,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It is so.,19
42,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The significance of the selection appeals to honourable members.,19
43,Mr BOWDEN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It was the arbitrator who appointed Sir Thomas Hughes.,19
44,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The representatives on the Board, having disagreed over the selection of a chairman, appointed an arbitrator, who has selected as an independent chairman of the Board the Chairman of Amalgamated Wireless.",19
45,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The people will find the money and the company will run the show. Mr^ MAXWELL - The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) will see that this does not affect the agreement.,19
46,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It explains to me, absolutely, why Amalgamated Wireless jumped at every alteration which we made in the agreement. It reveals to me most clearly why, step by step, we drove them back, and why everything they said at first that they could not accept, they did accept. It was, of course, for the simple reason that Amalgamated Wireless realized that they would have the last say. The whole business is not only open to criticism, but to suspicion. These representatives of Amalgamated Wireless, I shrewdly suspect, are representatives of the Commonwealth; and these representatives of the Commonwealth, I am bound to believe, are largely representatives of Amalgamated Wireless. I shall proceed now to deal in detail with the questions of Senator J . D . Millen, and with the answers furnished thereto. The honourable senator first asked1. What are the names of the directors appointed to the Board of the Amalgamated Wireless Company (new company)? The answer furnished was1. Sir Wm. Vicars, George Mason Allard, and John Stinson, representing the Commonwealth ",19
47,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,He is one of the best men in New South Wales.,20
48,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"P r o b a b l y one of the best friends of the honourable member and his party. The answer proceeds to state .that those representing the shareholders  and Captain Langley Webb. Senator J . D . Millen next asked2. Is it a fact that four of these directors were on the directorate of the Amalgamated Wireless Company (old company) ? ' 3. If it is a fact, is he (the Minister) aware whether such an arrangement is absolutely opposed to the intention of the Wireless Parliamentary Committee, whether such a state of control was viewed with great misgiving, and any agreement only consented to on the understanding that the seventh director should be independent of either interest? Those are the questions which were asked by a. Nationalist member of this Parliament.",20
49,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And best men in the Senate. . Mr BRENNAN - Probably , so f I know; and, certainly, one of the best informed men on the Committee. So much I must say for the honourable senator.",20
50,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What was the answer to that last question ? No answer was coming to No. 2.,20
51,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The answers are as follow: 2 and 3. The agreement provided for the selection of the seventh director by the three Government representatives and the three pany representatives. If they failed to the agreement further provided for pointment of an arbitrator, whose decision was to be final. No agreement was reached, and Committee ? an arbitrator was appointed by the six directors. The decision of the hearing both the company's and the Government's nominees, was for Sir Thomas Hughes. The appointment of the seventh director was in strict accord with the agreement approved by the Wireless Committee, the directors acting upon that agreement, and advising the Government what had been done.",20
52,Mr WISE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,There was no answer vouchsafed to that portion of Senator J . D . Millen's inquiry as to whether fou r of those directors were on the directorate of the old Amalgamated Wireless Company.,20
53,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"As a matter of fact, they were.",20
54,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I thank the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) for the greater measure of frankness which he has now shown than was to he found in the answers furnished, by his Ministerial colleague in another place. I suggest to the Treasurer-wh o was a member of the Committee-that it would be very courageous on his part, and highly proper, if , as a member of the Government, he were to tell the House that that arrangement, if it had been foreseen by members of the Parliamentary Wireless Committee would never have been made, and that the Committee never would have agreed to such a proposal, but would have advised unanimously against it . I can safely say that the Treasurer knows perfectly well that such is the fact.",20
55,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Is Sir Thomas Hughes connected with Amalgamated Wireless now?,20
56,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Yes .,20
57,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Then how can he be one of the said to be an independent chairman? His appointment constitutes a violation a r as of the terms of the agreement.,20
58,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Undoubtedly . I leave that aspect of the matter. I do not know that we have heard the last of it . I will turn now to this agreement which has been ratified by the Commonwealth, for t hthis agreement which embodies vital alterations of the original proposals submitted to us, this agreement which, nevertheless, should neveT, in my view, have been executed.",20

60,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was laid on the arbitrator, after table of the House.",20

62,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,J t - ought to be printed. It has been made available to' honourable members. I have a copy of the agreement before me.,21
63,Mr LISTEB,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What was the name of the arbitrator? That individual has not been mentioned this morning.,21
64,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The arbitrator was Mr. Consett Stephen. Mr BRENNAN' - I understand that that is correct. I ask the patience of honourable bers now while I examine some features of the clauses of the agreement which, this stage, and upon that fuller deliberaTrust tion which the agreement certainly serves, present themselves to my mind. do not wish to reflect on any member sat with me on the Committee, or, dentally, to reflect on myself. I merely say that this whole business should have been held up until Parliament had been afforded a fuller opportunity for confriends sideration. Clause 3 states:The Company shall forthwith take all necessary steps to alter its memorandum and/or articles of association, so as to provide(vii.) that no action or question cision relating to or affecting(l ) the policy of the Commonwealth connection with naval or military or external affairs shall be taken, determined or made out the consent of the Commonwealth expressed through its representatives the Board of Directors. That is a purely negative provision, howwhile ever. The agreement provides, in effect, that no such thing shall be done by the Company without the consent of the Comno monwealth ; but it does not say wnat it them. ought to have said affirmatively, namely, that the Commonwealth shall have a hand to do what it deems right and best for the preservation of the interests of the wealth? naval and military and external affairs of the Commonwealth. The agreement provides that the Company shall not do certain things without the consent of Commonwealth; but it does not say that the Commonwealth may do an unlimited number of other things for its own precarried servation in respect'of naval and military and external affairs. And that, I submit, is an important distinction. I turn now to sub-clause viii. of the same clause, which states:That the Company shall not enter into or be a party to any commercial trust or combine, but shall always be and remain an independent British business. Honourable members may know that the Amalgamated Wireless Company has been most assiduous in endeavouring to convince this Parliament,' and, especially the members of the Wireless Committee, that it really is a true blue Australian business. As a fact, it is merely a joint in the tail of the Marconi Trust. And so the Commonwealth, by this agreement, membecomes-to use the same sufficientlydescriptive phrase- a joint in the tail at of the Marconi Trust.' And the Marconi consists of the Marconi Company de- (English), the Radio Communication^ I Company (United States of America), who the French Wireless Company, and the inciTelefunken (German) Company. At this late date I take no exception to any company on the mere ground of its - country of origin, but I suggest that my who do take a great deal of notice of that kind of thing should not endeavour to persuade themselves that the Amalgamated Wireless Limited is a simple, modest Australian company. All these concerns are bound together by or demutual agreement. They are inter-dependent. But the important feature is that, in while this large Trust is much interested in these very expensive experiwithments which the Commonwealth proposes as to make in regard to long-distance wireon less, of a kind which has never been tested out in any other part of the worldthey may he very much interested as outside observers and dividend makers, they have taken all sorts of care to incur financial responsibility in regard to",21
65,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What experiments free does the honourable member suggest as likely to be undertaken by the Common,21
66,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Commonwealth is making a most hazardous experiment in proposing to spend £500,000 in setting the up commercial wireless communication over 12,000 miles, when it has not been .proved that such communication can be on satisfactorily over a distance of 4,500 miles or thereabouts, and then not' for such a service as that for which we have contracted. W2 Governor-GeneraVs Speech: [REPRESENTATIVES.]",21
67,Mr MARR,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It is working every day at 12,000 miles.",22
68,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is what the Prime Minister told us. He said that communication with Great Britain was already an accomplished fact, and was beyond the experimental stage. The Committee of this Parliament called a dozen expert witnesses, and every one said, ""Yes, it does work every day, or some parts of some days."" But as a commercial system which will give us what we have pledged ourselves to get, it has never yet been proven in any part of the world.",22
69,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,That is exactly reason why we introduced the clause in the agreement to the effect that the contract for the erection of the power-station should contain an absolute guarantee of its efficiency.,22
70,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is only partly so. ' It was one of the features missing from the agreement which the Common- wealth Government endeavoured to get us to sign, but is now embodied in the agreement in a form, the weakness of which I shall proceed to show, improved though it may be. The clause reads as follows: The company shall, within six months after the date of this agreement, or within such extended time as the representatives of monwealth on the Board may approve, enter into an agreement providing for the erection and operation of the stations mentioned in paragraphs (/) and (g) of clause 5 of this agreement. The agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature, and to such an amount, as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors, for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the stations in the United Kingdom and Canada. Then a definition of ""commercial wireless"" is given as follows:For the purpose of this agreement the Commercial Wireless Service means a service capable, a« regards plant, apparatus, and nel, of maintaining communication throughout 300 days of every year, on the minimum basis of twenty words per minute each way for twelve hours per day. As the honourable member for Eawkner has interjected, that guarantee, for what it is worth, was placed in the agreement by the Committee of this Parliament against the will of Amalgamated Wireless Limited, but because the Committee thought that it was some measure of protection for the Commonwealth. Address-in-Reply.",22
71,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Hear , hear!",22
72,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I ask my friend as a lawyer to note.the language of this agreement, because these words were drawn for the most part by Amalgamated Wireless Limited.",22
73,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,And settled by the honourable member himself.,22
74,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member for Batman was one of the legal members of the Committee who drafted the agreement. ' .,22
75,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I am absolutely candid about the whole matter. We took the the draft agreement, and with the limited opportunities at our disposal made it as good as we could, and I was one of the sub-Committee which dealt with it at one stage only,, with Senator Drake-Brockman.",22
76,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member was one of the sub-Committee which interviewed Sir Robert Garran, the Solicitor General, to finalize the matter. He was chosen as a legal'member of the Committee for that purpose.",22
77,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member is wrong. I did not interview Sir Robert Garran. .,22
78,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If the honourable memthe Com- ber says that he was not a member of the sub-Committee I must accept - his word, but I was under the impression that he was one of those who were deputed to finally draft the clauses embodied in the recommendations of the Committee.",22
79,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Onl y so far as I have stated, but if it will be any consolation to the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Gibson), I am prepared to say that I wentthrough the agreement, that T swatted over it , and that I did my best with it at short notice, and now, as might person- have been expected, that it has come before the House, I see many faults in it, and, apart from myfundamental objection, realise that I was quite right when I said that it should not have been approved until it was brought here, and until the Crown Law officers had been consulted and had had an opportunity of dealing with it properly.",22
80,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Quite right.,22
81,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Now I shall proceed to point out the weakness of this guarantee. Let us see how it is proposed to guarantee the maintenance of a commercial wireless service. We enter into an agreement with Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and they enter into an agreement with one of those numerous branches of the Marconi Trust, in order to give this guarantee that they will supply a commercial wireless service, which means a service capable as regards plant, apparatus, and personnel of performing certain things. I can quite understand the reason for the use of these words, "" Yes,"" they will say, "" the plant we have, the people we have, and the apparatus we have; we have done all you have asked us to do, but, unfortunately, owing to the condition of that mysterious thing known as atmospherics, and owing to fading wave lengths, and other causes over which God only has control, we cannot give you a service over 300 days of the year each way at the rate of twenty words per - minute for twelve hours per day as agreed.",22
82,Sir RODEBT BEST,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Did the company represent at any time that they could - do so?,23
83,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The Prime Minister represented that he could do so. It was quite a simple matter to him.,23
84,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,But did the company make representations .to that effect to the Committee?,23
85,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Certainly , every one did; both Radio Communications and Amalgamated Wireless Limited said that it could be done, and would be done.",23
86,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes , they were all rushing to get an agreement with the Commonwealth, and they all said, ""We can do it , "" but the Committee, in the familiar language - of my party, put the acid on them. We asked, "" How do you know you can do it when no one else has ever done it ; what are the obstacles in tihe way of doing it ? "" The witnesses we called were unanimous in saying that there were tremendous difficulties which had never been overcome. We were told that there were a different patents, in force with the object of overcoming the mysterious difficulty of atmospherics, but that none of them had yet been tried out. Furthermore, we were told that no system, such - as that to which the Commonwealth was committed, had been put into operation effectively' in any part of the world. Of course, the Prime Minister said, "" Yes, you can go down to Koo-wee-rup to Amalgamated Wireless Limited there, and pick up messages from Leafield, in England, from New York, or from Bordeaux."" Because occasionally some stray, wandering messages are picked up from across the world-God only knows how they came or whether they will be likely to come again-the Prime Minister says, ""Yes, we can enter into this contract with Amalgamated Wirelessi Limited with perfect confidence."" I do not know what is going to happen. All that I know is that we are committed to this costly experiment, that the indemnity or guarantee clause, when carefully read, is a very poor protection indeed, and I suspect that the time is not very far distant when we shall hear that there has been secretly appointed an Arbitrator, something like the Arbitrator in reference to the KidmanMayoh contract, to decide between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Commonwealth as to what is to be done about the service which cannot be given to Australia. When these things happen we shall probably be told that in order to avoid the expense of litigation-becaus e we have already had expensive litigation with Marconi-and , incidentally, to avoid the publicity attaching to this question, the matter should be submitted to an arbitrator, and, if possible, one with his passage booked to New York, so that his finding may come back to us from America later in the year., I do not wish to labour the matter unduly. I feel inclined to leave it at this stage. Perhaps the Treasurer will favour us with his views upon the question. Perhaps the honourable member for Fawkner will give us the benefit of his opinion.",23
87,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The Amalgamated Wireless Limited have made certain representations. What are the rights of the Commonwealth if those representations are not correct?,23
88,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Amalgamated Wireless Limited have pledged themdozen selves to enter into a further agreement with some 'company or body which 'will give guarantees to be accepted by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board that they can give services which will be effective so far as"" personnel, apparatus, and plant are concerned, but they do notpropose to give ns an indemnity if they fail to carry out their proposition on the ground that what they offer cannot be done. They do not say. "" we cannot do this thing we will put right financially.""",23
89,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"If they fail, how their apparatus be effective)",24
90,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"They will claim that their apparatus is effective. They will say, "" We have the apparatus, oan talk to New York, we can take sages and send them; it is a first-class paratus.""",24
91,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Buf c there must be effective servioe.,24
92,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"But they will that their apparatus is not giving tive service because of the act' of God. They will say that it is defective, not because of any fault in the apparatus itself, but because of conditions over which they have no control. I ask, for a conditional, but for a real indemnity true. - a n indemnity to ""deliver the goods"" or pay the money.",24
93,Mr GIBSON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The guarantees have to be of such a nature as will be approved by the Commonwealth. Mr BRENNAN"" - They have to be approved by the Commonwealth reprehave sentatives as being sufficient only for purpose.",24
94,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It seems to me that this is going to be a worse job than last wireless affair proved to be.,24
95,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"During the course delighted of my speech I have had some friendly interjections from honourable members the Country party. Let me tell them. I propose to move an amendment to the Address-in-Reply. It is not to be a censure amendment, but one designed only to the Commonwealth at least £500,000. have not been able always to join with our honourable friends of the Country party when they have been wanting to crease economize, as they call it, but they help us to save some public money by supto porting the amendment I intend to move.  the Corner party, when we proceed vote, will be found, as usual, supporting the Government.",24
96,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I well remember that, at the latter end of last year ever the Government was in danger, Ministerial Whip went round rapidly Australian and counted heads. If he found that he had the numbers the Prime Minister to do would come in and say to the House, If "" The Government is inflexibly deteryou mined, at all costs, to carry this proposal."" If it turned out, however, that can the numbers were against the Government the right honourable gentleman would hasten in and assure us that the matter was entirely in the hands of the House, we and that he would accept our decision meswhatever it might be. The honourable  often paid me the compliment of referan ring to my expressions of opinion and votes in this Chamber. I appeal to him say to support me in this amendment. He effecis an earnest honourable member. Let him have the courage of his convictions. He has said, in solemn terms, some dreadf u l things about the Government, and all that I can say in justification of those not statements is that most of them were We want to help honourable members of the. Corner party. Their Leader (Dr Earle Page) says that criticism in some way seems to focus upon them. I have been pained by the bitter exchanges which taken place between, not the opposthat ing parties across the Chamber, but the two wings of the same party by whom we are left entirely out in the cold. We the are not ambitious for power or office. I absolutely disclaim any ambition in that direction-for the present. I should be to assist the Country party, at all events, until the country itself had of time, a few months later, to express its that own deliberate judgment upon the Government. I should be well inclined to support the Country party if they would save only support some of the amendmentsWe which we move. But they will not. They have not seen their way, for instance, to., help us to induce the Government to in the pensions of the aged and themay invalid. They have not seen their way join with us in our spirited protestagainst the flooding of the industrial marvkets of Australia with cheap German, to a goods. They would not vote for the amendments to the proposed Address-inReply which we submitted in respect of' those two subjects. Nor could they whensee their way last night to stand' the - by us in the maintenance of greatestablishments such - as the Commonwealth Woollen which the Government, with their approval, are now going to barter away. Here, however, we have a purely non-party matter, relating to wireless, and we should be able with some confidence to count on their votes and support. But I am almost hopeless. The honourable member for Swan is very sincere and earnest, and very whole-hearted in his condemnation of the Government. But, alas, he looks at us, and the Prime Minister comes in and says, "" It is all very well for the honourable member for Swan to complain that we have taxed dead cows, and calves which were never born-it is all very well for the honourable member to say that! But let him look on the ranks of Labour on the other side, and tell me what is to become of the great fabric of the British Empire if this motion to take off the taxation on dead cows and calves that are equally dead is. agreed to."" And so, I am sorry to say, we get no support, in the last resort, from honourable members of the Country party. honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) goes to a meeting of his lady friends at Kooyong and attacks the Prime Minister hip and thigh. Then he comes back, enters the party room upstairs, and when he comes into the House, we find that he is a chastened spirit, determined to stand against Labour and for the British Empire and the Prime Minister of Australia at all costs. The Empire in this matter is not challenged. It is, as usual, quite safe. Honourable members of the Country party look at my Leader (Mr Charlton), and say, "" It would be safe enough to vote for this amendment so far'as the Leader of the Labour party is concerned, He is a good man. He is an honest man. But look at the company he keeps. He is a Christian among cut-throats. How can we support him in the circumstances?"" No doubt they will vote against us once again; but in the solemn hope that they may not, and that they may have even now an eleventh-hour repentance, I propose, with great modesty and faltering confidenceThat the following words be added to the proposed Address :- "" but we desire to advise His Excellency that the agreement mentioned in clause 12 of the contract made between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Commonwealth should, before acceptance by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors, be agreed to by this House."" Mills Mr Bruce (Flinders-Treasurer) [12.10] - When the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) commenced his speech last night I thought he was going to deal seriously with the agreement that had been entered into between the Commonwealth and the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I imagined that he was going to throw some light on his attitude, and give the House some information as to why he took the view that the agreement should not have been entered into. But, although I paid the honourable member the compliment of listening very carefully to his speech, and was proposing to take notes of the points made by him in order that I might deal with them, since I was Chairman of the Committee that considered the agreement, I found, to my amazement, that he had really nothing to say. It became more and more obvious with every word he .uttered that this was merely another attempt on behalf of the Labour party to flog the Government with anything on which they The could lay their hands. Honourable members opposite, however, in this case, have chosen a most unhappy means of condemning the Government. I propose to deal at some length with this matter, because I believe the House desires to obtain full information as to the exact terms of the agreement which was recommended by the mixed Committee appointed to consider it. Before doing so, however, I should like to < refer briefly to the attitude of the honourable member for Batman with regard to the whole subject, and particularly to his attitude towards the Committee, of which he was a member. He told us last night that his signature appeared, without his sanction, on the Teport of the Committee. That is correct. Let me explain the position. The Committee sat for some time, and considered the whole question thoroughly giving attention to .even the most minute details. Some honourable members of the Committee to whom I have spoken say that they have some recollection, as I have, that at the outset of the proceedings the honourable member for Batman said some. thing to the effect that it might be necessary for him to put in a minority report. That statement was made at the very beginning of the proceedings. Some members of the Committee have no recollection of the statement, but I remember it and several others do. With ""that one small indication of what his attitude might be, he sat and worked with the Committee right through. He was one of a sub-Committee of three, who finally went through the draft and recommended it to the Committee as satisfactory.",24
97,Mr MAHONY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What is wrong with that attitude on the part of the honourable member?,26
98,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There would be nothing at all wrong with it if the honourable iber had only maintained it. On the final day of meeting we considered and dealt with our draft report. It was a very short one for the reason that our views were expressed in the modification of the agreement as recommended by us. As it was very late in the evening the suggestion was made that I , as Chairman, should sign the report on' behalf of the whole Committee. It did not occur to any one of the. other eight members of the Committee that it was not to be a unanimous report. The possibility of any lack of unanimity with regard to the report did not once cross our minds. It was decided, however, that the suggestion I have just mentioned should not be adopted for the reason that one member expressed the opinion that the report would be a most historic document, and he desired, therefore, to attach his signature to. it. - Sir ROBERT BEST - Was the honourable member for Batman present on that occasion. Mr BRUiCE - I understand that he was hot. The point I wish to emphasize is that it did not occur to any one member of the Committee on which the honourable member for Batman had worked throughout, that the report was not going to be a unanimous report. And all of us were amazed when we saw the honourable member's statement after the report had been submitted. I have stated the f acts, and I leave honourable members to form their own opinion as to the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Batman.",26
99,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The honourable member will remember my speaking to a proposal made by Senator J. D. Millen for controlling this scheme by Commissioners, and that I said I was much more favourably disposed to that than to the agreement.",26
100,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"So was Senator .J. D. Millen, but he signed the report. There is another side to this question. We have heard this morning i certain criticisms of the agreement, which .1 suggest were very futile and small, but we heard none of those objections when the honourable member for Batman was pretending to give the Committee his earnest assistance and co-operation in order to make the agreement as good as possible. I think the mem- word "" pretending "" very much represents the honourable member's attitude, if after having given us information and assistance in amending the agreement he now declares that he ought to have told us all these other things when we were considering the document. The honourable member was a member of the Committee, attended nearly every meeting we held, and went through the agreement in detail with us, and I think every other member of the Committee will agree that it never occurred to any of us that he would not sign the report. He did not raise the points then that he has mentioned today after the agreement has been signed. I come now to the actual detailed objections which the honourable member has raised. He said that Commonwealth money is being thrown away, that it has not been proved that direct wireless communication over a distance from 10,000 to 12,000 miles is practicable, and I should imagine from his remarks this morning that he is totally opposed to the whole project of direct wireless communication with Great Britain. That is news to me. That the practicability of direct wireless communication with Great Britain is not yet established is undeniable. No man can say whether or iiot this can be done with certainty, and that was a consideration which more than anything else impressed the Committee. All of us were seized of the wonderful value to Australia which direct wireless communication with Europe would be, but we were not prepared' to risk a great sum of Commonwealth money in such an undertaking on the evidence at present available. The experts examined by the Committee are confident that wireless communication with Britain can be established on the basis of a commercial service for 300 days in the year, twelve hours per day, and twenty words per minute. The experts said that such, a service was possible if we erected the necessary stations. We asked them to adduce evidence in support of their theory, and all they could tell us were the results obtained by what is called ""listening in "" with their own instruments in Australia. A study of the summarized evidence will show that the experts have obtained very considerable results in that way over periods of weeks and for many hours per day. With the very inefficient receiving installations at present in existence they have been able to pick up wireless messages from Bordeaux, Leafield, and other stations in. Europe. The Committee were not satisfied, however, that that evidence was sufficient to warrant the Commonwealth spending a great sum of money, and we pointed out that the only basis upon which we could agree to recommend the purchase was that we should have some guarantee of the service which the Commonwealth would get in return for the money expended. It is very possible, and some people will say probable, that when a station for the purpose of giving direct communication with Great Britain is completed in Australia, it will not function to the extent that is expected. At first sight it would seem difficult to arrive at - any measure of compensation for the Government in the event of that happening, but the problem is not so difficult as it appears on the surface. The station to be erected in Australia will be one of the largest in the world, and even if it should not tion over a distance of 10,000 or 12,000 miles, it will undoubtedlv function for distances of 5,000 or 6,000 miles, giving us, for example, direct communication with America, and, probably, India. That provides a basis for entering into a contract which will provide proper safeguards for the Commonwealth. Suppose that a contract were made for the erection at a cost of £500,000 of a station to give direct communication with Britain for 300 days in the year, twelve hours per day, and twenty words per minute, and it should fail to do that, but should provide a commercial service t'o America and to other countries within a radius of 5,000 miles, it would be possible to reduce the Commonwealth expenditure from £500,000 to, say, £400,000 or £300,000 as the case might be. Upon that principle the Committee acted. We were not prepared to risk the Commonwealth money until we had a guarantee that we. would get good value for it , and the contract is so framed that there is no limitation in regard to the contractor to whom the work may be given. There have been suggestions that the contract must be given to the Marconi Company, but if there is any other firm that can give a better service at a cheaper price there is nothing in the agreement to prevent such a firm getting the contraot.",26
101,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Who will determine that?,27
102,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The directors of the company.' That is a safeguard which the Committee inserted, and I desire to make it clear to the House before I deal in detail with the agreement, because that is the whole basis of the arrangement into which we have entered, and it is a feature of the agreement which the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) in the earlier part of his speech, at any rate, did not mention to the House.",27
103,Sir ROBERT BEST,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The Commonwealth commitment will be on a sliding scale according to the measure of efficiency.,27
104,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That probably will be the basis which will be adopted. The honourable member for Batman said that he did not pretend to draft a watertight agreement that could be open to no objection. I resent that statement. He was one of the four lawyers wiho were members of the Committee, and he was one of the sub-Committee of three who funcconsidered the agreement, and reported to the main Committee that it was a proper document which the Committee could recommend to the Government. The honourable member has suggested that, there was not time for the agreement to be properly considered by the Law officers; if there were any doubts or uncertainties in his mind as to the agreement being water-tight, surely he, as a lawyer, should have warned the Committee of the danger into which they were walking. But he did not give us one indication that we would be unwise to accept the draft which had been prepared by the Solicitor-General and the Crown Law officers. The agreement came back to the main Committee from three legal members of the sub-Committee, and not one word did the honourable member say to indicate that the agreement was not water-tight, and that the Committee was running a risk by recommending it .",27
105,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Did the Committee take notes of evidence and of the deliberations ?,28
106,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We took notes of evidence only. Senator J. D. Millen was appointed secretary of the pommittee, and made notes of the evidence taken, and I am sure I may say on behalf of the whole Committee that we are very much indebted to him .for the invaluable assistance he gave us. Another point made by the honourable member for Batman was that the majority report was very sparse. There was no necessity for a long report ; such a report would probably have confused the issue. We embodied in the agreement all the recommendations, which the Committee had to make, and I think that was the most valuable report we could have made. The minority report, made by the honourable member for Batman, has now come to hand after a very long delay. I , "" arbitrator. and I have no doubt other members of the Committee, have read it through, and I do not think there is the slightest neces- Chairman? sity for me to deal with its contents. It raises no points that are not met by the agreement, and it represents a'statement totally different from anything the honourable member ever said while the Committee were considering the matter. As this minority report throws no new light upon the subject, I do not propose to waste the time of the House in discussing it in detail. What I shall do to assist the House is to go through the agreement and give a very brief outline of its main provisions. Amalgamated Wireless Limited, as it exists today, is a very small pany, with a capital of about £200,000. The agreement provides that the capital shall be increased to £1,000,000, divided into £1 shares, of which the Commonwealth shall take 500,001, and other subscribers 499,999.",28
107,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Did the honourable memmatter ber see the list of shareholders company?,28
108,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Yes.,28
109,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The whole list?,28
110,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes . Clause 3 provides man ? that the Commonwealth shall be entitled, in respect of its share of the capital, have three representatives on the direcpointment. torate; that the company shall have directors, and that there shall be one other, to be appointed by the first six, if they can agree, and, if not, by an 'arbitrator*. We have heard today that the 'six directors could not agree, and Mr Consett Stephen, of Stephen, Jaques, and Stephen, solicitors, Sydney, has been appointed arbitrator. He is president of the Law In stitute in Sydney, and I do not think that the selection could have been placed in better hands. With Tespect to the information given to the arbitrator when called upon to make his selection, I have no particulars; but, as a member of the Parliamentary Wireless Committee, I will say that it was not our intention, a when the clause under discussion was framed, that a person who had been previously associated with the company should be chosen as the independent seventh director.

115,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"So far as I know, Sir to Thomas Hughes, has accepted his apBut the matter has nothing three to do with the Government. Mr MCWILLIAMS,-The Government never take any responsibility.",28
116,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is the sort of interjection which the honourable member generally makes. On this occasion there is no solid ground whatever for his comment. Any honourable member possessing an impartial mind will say that, if a seventh person has to be added to a directorate on which there are already three representatives of each side, the fairest method of selection is to employ the services, of an independent arbitrator. In this instance, seeing that the arbitrator is a gentleman of considerable standing, the president of the Law Institute in Sydney, and that the selection of Sir Thomas Hughes was a matter for the arbitrator solely, how^ can any fair-minded member hold the Government responsible? The next point with which I wish to deal is embodied in clause 5 of the agreement :(a) To construct,.maintain, and .operate Australia the necessary stations for a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the United Kingdom; (6) to provide and operate a system of feeder stations for wireless connection between the main high-power stations and the capital cities of all the States; (c) to equip and organize the feeder stations, BO us to provide communication with merchant ships round the coast of Australia; (e) to arrange for the operation of suitable corresponding stations in the United Kingdom; (/) to provide the main trunk stations in Australia and the United Kingdom within two years from the date of this agreement; (</) to arrange within two years from the date of this agreement for the erection and operation of a station in Canada capable of commercial communication with the high power station in Australia, and so equipped as to afford facilities for distributing traffic throughout North America; (h) to take over; within one month after signing this agreement, the existing Commonwealth radio stations, excepting those wholly under the control of the Department of Defence, but including the stations in Papua, Territory of New Guinea, and Flinders and King Islands, and also, if required by the Minister for Home and Territories, the station at Willis Islets, and to operate and re-organize the service provided by those stations in such a way as to provide a service at least equivalent to that now being supplied by the Commonwealth radio service. The company is to take over the existing radio stations throughout Australia. These are to be operated and re-organized so as to provide a service at least the equal of that now being furnished by the Commonwealth. The next clause covers the basis on which the stations are to be taken over. That is to be at a valuation to be made by a committee, ""including two representatives of the company and two of the Commonwealth, with an independent chairman, to be agreed upon by the other four representatives and, in default of agreement, to be determined by arbitration."" Also, the whole of the personnel of our existing stations are to be taken over, and are to carry with them all their present rights respecting pay, and all their accrued rights regard-* ing pensions and the like. With respect to pensions, the Commonwealth is to be responsible in conjunction with the company, according to the periods of service given by the employees with the two separate entities. That is to say, the Commonwealth are to be responsible covering the period in which it has employed the men concerned, while the company is to be similarly responsible for the term in in which the operators shall have been workand equipment ing as its employees. Clause 7 provides that, during the period of construction and re-organization, or for three years from the date of the agreement-excep t in the case of the existing radio stations in New Guinea, in respect of which the period is seven years-the Commonwealth shall pay to the company all amounts expended in carrying on existing radio stations. Thus it would appear that the Commonwealth is to bear any losses which may be occasioned during that term. At first sight honourable members may be inclined to think that here is furnished an opportunity for the company to lose as much as it may care, while the Commonwealth will be unable to protest, but must merely bear the loss. Upon a further analysis of the agreement, however, it will be found that nothing of the sort can happen. The stations are at present in the hands of the Commonwealth. After the expiration of the periods set out in the agreement they are to be taken over and operated by the company, and any losses that may thereafter accrue will fall upon the shoulders of the company. It would be absurd then to suggest that in view of those facts, the company would be careless whether losses were occasioned during the intervening period, seeing that they would subsequently have to carry on those mismanaged stations, and would be themselves responsible for all losses. Obviously, it would be in the best interests of the company to make the stations as efficient as possible, as early as possible. ""With respect to the existing radio stations in New Guinea, the Commonwealth undertakes to bear possible losses, as I have already pointed out, for a longer period, namely, seven years from the date of the agreement. The reasons for conceding an extended term, in the case of those distant territorial radio statious will be obvious. ' Alterations in the rates for traffic in respect of wireless are to be subject to the directors nominated by the Government, and not to the majority of the Board. I have already dealt with the question of the guarantee; that matter is covered in clause 12. There is no reason why a contract cannot be drafted so that the rights and interests of the Commonwealth shall be abundantly safeguarded. We expect to be in a position whereby we shall be assured that for whatever money we may spend we shall be given Ian adequate . return. do not wish to leave in the minds of honourable members the impression .that it is absolutely certain, that the main station, when erected, will function for 12,000 miles. It is not certain; but there will be a reduction in the cost of the service if it does not so funcweight tion. That it will function for a very considerable distance is a practical certainty. Mr BUBCHEI/L - Will it reach Egypt and link up with the big radio station there?",29
117,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It may not; but it will link up with India, and thus with the Norman chain, which has a station in that country. There is further provision in the agreement that the whole system shall be handed over to the Government in case of war or of public daggerAnd, further, it is provided that the wireentitled less installations shall not compete with the land lines already established in the Commonwealth. Such provision is necessary, of course, to safeguard Commonwealth revenue. With respect to places which are not served by a telegraph line in distant parts of the Commonwealth, there is nothing contained in the agreement to prevent their being served by wireless, and continuing to be so served. Special provision is inserted in the agreement by which nothing contained thereinshall be construed to prejudice or limit in any way any right or power of the Commonwealth to acquire on just terms, compulsorily or otherwise^ any share or interest of any person in the company. Some honourable members may fear that we are handing over to a monopoly for all time the control of wireless in Australia. Such, is not the case. If the company should become a monopoly there is nothing in the agreement, or elsewhere, to prevent the Government from taking steps to acquire the whole concern on just terms. The last provision of the agreement is to the effect that the shares which are to be subscribed by others than the Commonwealth must be so subscribed within six months, or within such extended time as may be mutually agreed upon; otherwise, the Commonwealth can refuse to go on with the whole matter.",30
118,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"-Is it possible, even now, to I secure the election of an independent chairman ?",30
119,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There would be considerable difficulties in the way. An independent arbitrator hae been chosen, a gentleman of irreproachable character, who has come to the conclusion, upon the of all the evidence before him, that the best man whom he can appoint is Sir Thomas Hughes.",30
120,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I wonder why the word "" independent"" was left out in respect of the chairman of the Board. The last paragraph of clause 12 gives the Commonwealth the leverage, if the Government desired to make use of it.",30
121,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Some leverage might be exercised on the basis of the paragraph in question, namely:If no such agreement is entered into within six months after the date of this agreement . . . . the Commonwealth shall be to give notice to the company of the cancellation of this agreement. But I think that I have made the position perfectly clear. It was never the intention of the Committee that such a situation should arise. It was not within the minds of that body that there should be selected a person who had been associated with Amalgamated Wireless before accepting the office of what the Committee reckoned would be an independent chairman. I can confidently say that the Government would not desire that such a selection of a seventh member of the Board should be made.",30
122,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It will relieve the situation considerably if the Treasurer can consider that phase of the matter.,31
123,Mr BBTJCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I quite agree.,31
124,Sir BOBEET BEST,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What is the term for which Sir Thomas Hughes has been appointed ?,31
125,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It was provided that there should be a definite period, either of five or seven years. I have forgotten the exact term. Another point with which I desire to deal has to do with the interjection of the honourable member for Eremantle (Mr. Burchell). He asked whether these stations would link up with the Norman chain. Unquestionably, even if the station erected in Australia failed lamentably it should pick up Singapore, and it would he surprising if it could not pick up the next stage in India, while it would be extremely probable that it would also pick up the station in Egypt. It all depends upon the extent to which the Australian station will function. As the Norman scheme has been mentioned, one should, I think, say a word or two about it , because it was considered very carefully by the Committee of this Parliament. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) has said something with regard to the Norman report, and has indicated that it declared that commercial wireless over a range of more than 2,000 miles was an impracticable proposition, It was not a fair statement from the honourable member with his knowledge of the position. The Norman report has been the subject of most unpleasant discussions. I put it no stronger than that. It has had surrounding it an atmosphere altogether undesirable. In fact, suggestions have been made that it really is the cable interests working against wireless. Many other suggestions have been put forward, but I do not wish to laibour the point, except to say that the Committee of this Parliament took a good deal of evidence about the Norman report, and all matters connected with it. Therefore, it is surprising to find any member of that Committee quoting that report as though he believed it to be the last and final word in regard to the subject. I know of no other points made by the honourable member for Batman. In fact, as I listened to him I was surprised to find that he proposed to bring under the notice of the* House nothing more than he had said in order to show why he had taken such a very extraordinary attitude towards the Wireless Committee, and all matters connected with it . I have no hesitation in telling the House that the agreement, as it is now drafted, has been very carefully considered. The Committee tried to close up every avenue through which the Commonwealth Government could be involved in financial liability, and obtain no result. A .Committee composed of members of all parties in this Parliament is extraordinarily valuable, and the work done by this Committee was exceedingly well done-and having regard to the magnitude of the task, expeditiously done. The attention and time devoted by the members of the Committee to the work with which they were intrusted justify me in telling honourable members that they may quite safely rely upon the interests of the Commonwealth having been safeguarded as far as it was possible to do so. Having heard all that the honourable member for Batman has had to say today I do not for a second imagine that his attack has been directed towards the findings of the Wireless Committee. It has been directed solely against the Government. It was an attempt on the honourable member's part to delay the business of the House, and throw another stone at the Government. He has not succeeded. I do not think his effort has achieved more than have the other efforts of his party during the last few days.  taken over from the Commonwealth by the Amalgamated Wireless Limited?",31
126,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I have not the figures with me at the present moment, but I think they are valued at £150,000.",31
127,Mr BRENNAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Originall y the Government proposed to give them away. Mr Wise.'-No ; the company did not want them. Mr .BRUiCE - The amendment submitted by the honourable member for Batman is nothing more than a repetition of what we have had from honourable members opposite within the last few days. I have been sitting here listening to nearly everything that has been said. Since I have been in ofiice I have seen certain things in the press in regard to matters in respect of which it was alleged the Government had fallen short, and I thought that, perhaps, the discussion on the motion for the adoption of the Address-inEeply would crystallize some of those complaints and enable me to discover the hideous faults, if there are any, with which the Government might be charged. I have listened, but I have not heard of any, and I have come to the conclusion that the present Ministry must be almost as satisfactory as I thought it to be. We had one amendment submitted by the Leader' of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) dealing with probably the most serious problem we have in Australia today, namely, the industrial position, but the best the honourable member could do in order to thrust the blame for this grave and important situation on the Government was to say that it was all due to the fact that we had not properly administered the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act. However, that charge did no good.",31
128,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It did good outside.,32
129,Mr BEUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I do not propose to answer the charge now. I am merely endeavouring to indicate a few of the matters that have come under attention during the last few days. There is a welter of argument pointing to the fact that the industrial situation here is entirely due to an economic factor felt all the world over. The only thing apparent was the purpose of the Leader, of the Opposition, who now interjects with delightful frankness that the debate has done an enormous amount of good outside. Every one knows the purpose the honourable member had in view when he submitted his amendment and advanced the argument to which I have just referred. He also touched upon immigration, but I could see nothing in what he said of the slightest value. The Government have indicated their immigration policy, namely, that it is a matter for the States, and that we are willing to cooperate with the S.tates. I have gone through all the suggestions offered, and nothing has come to light of the slightest use in combating the policy of the Government. The matter of old-age pensions has been introduced at a time when no benefit could be achieved by the old-age pensioners, even if the amendment submitted opposite had been carried. When the Budget is under consideration will be the proper time for considering that question. I do not wish to speak on lines on which I might be supposed to be defending the Government. The Government needs no defence.",32
130,Mr CONSIDINE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What about Flinderalane?,32
131,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I could say a lot about Flinders-lane, but I am hardly the person to do so, because some people may think that I am still interested in Flinders-lane. As a matter of fact I am not. I have given up my position there. Nevertheless, having been there, I do not propose to deal with a matter which already has been effectively dealt with by the Leader of the House (Mr Greene) in that well-balanced and well-reasoned speech he delivered last night. Every other question raised had been already answered by him in a very admirable fighting speech delivered by him on the previous night. However, there is one little matter to which I do wish to refer. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), speaking on the question of finance yesterday, indicated that in his opinion, in view of the figures I placed before the House the other day, I was actually going down the hill, and becoming like any other old politician. I do not wish to refer to this matter at length, but the source from which the comment comes naturally gives me grave alarm. I can assure the honourable member that his criticisms are a little premature. I have not quite sunk into the position he suggests. It might be of help to honourable members if I said a word or two about the honourable member's statement that he disagreed with something I had said in Brisbane-that we had very little more than £4,500,000 of our expenditure in which we could effect necessary and possible economy. As there are many honourable members who are looking forward to the Budget, and possibly preparing Budgets for me, I will give them some assistance by indicating how I arrived at that figure. In regard to ""War Services,"" we are committed to actual payments amounting to £32,000,000. Last year the figure was £31,361,000. The principal item, of course, is interest and sinking fund, which amounted to £21,083,000 last year, and will be more this year, because we have still further obligations to meet. The next important item under this heading of "" War Services "" is £7,028,000 for war pensions. Other items of expenditure in this direction are for repatriation and other war activities. The latter have practically gone or, at any rate, I hope they will be gone this year, but we have still an obligation to meet in regard to the repatriation pf our soldiers. I do not think that we shall be able to reduce the expenditure on war services below £32.000,000. Upon ""Additions, New Works and Buildings"" we spent £2,584,000 last year. We shall probably be able to reduce the expenditure in this direction this year to £1,500,000. The expenditure on "" Special Appropriations "" amounts to £14,972,000. Of this amount £7,035,000 is absorbed by payments to the States, and_ £5,295,000 by invalid and old-age pensions, and the payment of the maternity allowance. Expenditure under this heading is controlled by Acts of Parliament, and I am afraid that this year it must inevitably amount to nearly £15.000,000. . This expenditure added to the £32,000,000 for "" War Services "" and £1,000,000 for ""Additions, New Works and Buildings,"" not including defence, makes a total of £48,000,000. we have an irreducible expenditure upon ""Defence."" It is the task of any Government to properly defend its citizens. We have already announced a reduction of the Defence expenditure by something like £1,800,000, but we can go no further in this direction without a deliberate breach of the trust placed on our shoulders. Our expenditure on ""Defence"" will be, at least, £4,700,000, bringing the total expenditure to £52,700,000.",32
132,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,33
133,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"When we adjourned for lunch I was dealing with a statement. I had made, and which had been challenged by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), as to the amount in respect to which economies [21] could be effected in the expenditures of the Commonwealth. I had given figures 1 for war services, new works and buildings, special appropriations, and defence, which total £52,700,000. There is one other item that falls within the ordinary departmental votes, and that relates to the Department of the Postmaster-General. During last year that Department spent £7,758,000. Allowing * for the greatest reduction conceivable, that expenditure could not be brought down to less than £7,500,000, seeing that the servioe is producing a revenue of over £9,300,000 per annum.. If we add that total to the figure I have given, we have a grand total of £60,200,000. Our total expenditure last year was £65,118,265. I think, therefore, that my honourable friend will agree with me that I had at ' least some basis for the statement. I made. I have given these figures at this stage because I think they will enable honourable members to form their own views as to Ihe possibilities of bhis very much discussed question of the reduction of the governmental expenditures of the Commonwealth today. I have looked very closely into the matter, and without foreshadowing in any way what I propose to say. or do when I present the Budget, I point ont that the Government in this regard is in very much the same position as that of every private trading concern in Australiaat the present time. Owing to the war and the causes which followed from it, the expenses of every business in Australia today have been Then enormously increased. I am safe in saying that there is scarcely a business which, after it has made every possible reduction in its outgoings, could show a profit at all if it had to rely on its pre-war basis of turnover. The-position of the Commonwealth is very much the same, and we are not helping the people of Australia by trying to indicate that our financial salvation can be brought about simply by a reduction of governmental expenditure. The only solution is to be found in an increase in OUT national turnover, a greater prosperity throughout the country, and a broadening of the basis on which the necessary taxatiou has to be collected. The only other point with which I should like to deal is that which was raised by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Wienholt) respecting the meat subsidy which the Government has undertaken to pay. With tihe attitude taken up by the honourable member .the broad, general question I am entirely - in sympathy. The circumstances of this case, however, are very different. While I agree with the views he expressed .to what is necessary for the prosperity of this great industry, I haveonly say that* it cannot be brought about the moment - The meat industry was faced with a very great crisis. It possible that the industry, which is great benefitto the whole Commonwealth, might be wiped out, not. by the exercise of the'true law that ought to determine these things-the law of supply and demitted. mand-bu t in consequence of a fight that was going on between the great trusts which control this particular trade throughout the world. In view circumstance the Government came to assistance. It has to be remembered, however, that the Government come to its. assistance for the benefit of individuals or in the interests of trade alone. We came to its assistance Government. in the interests .of Australia as a whole. I agree entirely with the honourable ber, and probably have stronger views than he has with regard to the use of money of one section of the community to assist another section which, as a rethem. 'sult of the operation of the ordinary law of supply and demand, is in momenshould tary trouble. Such a thing the affair of the industry concerned, and those involved must solve their own problems. The information which the honourable member has given should be of question. great value to the industry of which he spoke; but I repeat that the circumin stances in this case were entirely different. It waa. for a national purpose, and for the benefit of anv class of the comthat munity, that the Government took action. The Government has afforded industry temporary relief, but it lies the hands of the industry itself, now it has been given this opportunity of thinking out ways and means, to find permanent solution of the great problem with which it is faced. I make this statebreach ment because I recognise very clearly great sincerity of the honourable member for Moreton '(Mr Weihholt) and the earnestness of his views with regard thisspecific matter. I am afraid I have detained honourable members at much greater length than I Afr. Bruce. had intended to do. I rose only to deal with the subject-matter of the amendon ment. So far as that is concerned, I have put the position as it was and as it appeared to the Committee that was appointed to consider the agreement. That as Committee did a very great service to this country, and there is now a fine opto portunity to establish a wireless system at that will be in the future of incalculable benefit to Australia. I recommend to was honourable members the decision of the of Committee as being the true solution of a difficult problem, and I am certain that the House will not for one moment accept the amendment which has been sub",33
134,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Richmond-Minister for Defence and Health) [2.22] - I rise only to make one or two observations with of this regard to the subject-matter of the its amendment, and more particularly with regard to the appointment of the seventh did not director of the company.",34

137,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"There is one thing that be explained, and that is why the is word "" independent"" was omitted from the clause in - question.",34
138,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The honourable member had better ask the sub-committee that,34
139,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The Government was no way responsible for the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes. He was apnot pointed in the terms of the agreement had been definitely entered into, and which this Government completed in the the terms of the resolution passed by this in House. While the appointment of Sir that Thomas Hughes as the seventh director may be in accordance with the strict legal a interpretation of the agreement, the Government considers it to be - an entire of the spirit of the agreement. I the have nothing, nor have the Government as a whole, anything against Sir Thomas Hughes personally.' We entertain for to him the highest regard; but no one oan forget for a moment that he was chairman of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, that he resigned that position, and that he was promptly nominated by his company for a position in the new company. To the Government that appears to be a distinct and definite breach of the spirit of the agreement into which we entered. It was the intention of the Government, as it was that of the Committee, and, I believe, of the agreement itself, that the seventh director should not be a man either associated directly with the Government, or associated directly with the company, but a man taken from the community as a whole, who could be regarded as an entirely independent person. I may say that the making of this appointment came with as great a shock to the Government as it came to the House. We learned of it only quite recently. The Government, however, is giving notice to the company that in no circumstances whatever can it consent to the nomination of Sir Thomas Hughes. With that, for the time being, I leave the matter. Honourable members will appreciate the significance of what I have said. While there is no doubt that, according to a strict legal interpretation of the agreement, Sir Thomas Hughes has been legally appointed, we say quite definitely that we cannot accept his nomination.",34
140,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Hunter) [2.27] The subject-matter of the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) is highly important, and the honourable member is to be commended for bringing it before the House. He has been subjected to severe criticism, but I venture to say that the verdict of the public will be that he has done a work of much importance to the community. The luncheon adjournment today seems to have come most opportunely from the point of view of the Government. Before we adjourned the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) was put up to reply on behalf of the Government to the honourable member for Batman. During the discussion of the very important point with which the Acting Leader of the House (Mr Greene) has just dealt, I asked the Treasurer, by way of interjection, what it was proposed to do in regard to Sir Thomas Hughes' appointment. I received no answer. We were practically allowed to believe that the view of the Government was that the appointment had been made in accordance with the agreement, and, consequently, had to stand. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) subsequently renewed the attack. He put two or three very pertinent questions to the Treasurer, but did not elicit any satisfactory answer. Evidently, during the adjournment for lunch the Government, recognising the position in which they had been placed, decided that their Acting Leader should make a speech as soon as the House resumed, explaining their attitude. It is most unusual for two Ministers to follow each other in a debate of this kind. That, however, is what occurred this afternoon, and the object was apparently to - cover up the true position. It is a new system.'",35
141,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"A new system"" - tea m work.",35
142,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes . We have had the Minister who is temporarily leading the Government in this House following another member of the Government, and saying that they were unaware of this appointment of a seventh director until it was brought out today.",35
143,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,No ; what he said was that the Government had only learned of it quite recently.,35
144,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Then why did they not take the House into their confidence, and state at once what they were going to do? Why did they wait until a member of another place had addressed a question to a member of the Government, and had elicited this information? Why did they wait until the matter was debated in this House before they admitted the importance of this point? Honourable members will recollect that when this matter was brought before the House' on a previous occasion, we on this side took exception to the proposal. The Prime Minister brought the agreement to the House, and moved that it be accepted. He and his Government were prepared to enter into that arrangement with Amalgamated Wireless Limited for a system of direct wireless communication with Great Britain, the Commonwealth to find £500,000. The agreement provided also-and this is a point I par' ticularly desire to stress-that the company should have four-sevenths of the representation on the directorate. I pointed out that and other defects, notably that no provision was being made for the taking over of the Commonwealth's existing wireless property. . I moved an amendment to the effect that the matter be submitted to a Committee of the House for inquiry, such Committee to report back to this House. The Prime Minister was against that course, but, when the debate had proceeded for some time, he moved an addendum to his former, motion to provide that a Committee 3hould be appointed from both Houses to inquire into the agreement, and report back to the Government, which should have power to act on the finding of the Committee. We, on this side, opposed that proposal.",35
145,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Other s also opnominated posed it.,36
146,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Yes ; but it was carried by thirty-four votes to eight. We strenuously resisted the Go Mr Watt - He is. vernment proposal as being unbusinesslike.

It is because proposal of the Prime Minister was dorsed by the House that we are in such his competence. an unfortunate position today.

147,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Can the honourable member explain how a capable man like the arbitrator, Mr Stephen, with a knowing ledge of all the circumstances, could such a nomination ?",36
148,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I cannot. The honourable member has anticipated the question I intended to ask. Evidently his thoughts are running in the. same channel as my own. The Committee recommended that the company and the Commonwealth each should have three representatives on the directorate, and that a seventh director should be appointed by them, if they could agree, and if they could not, that the matter be referred to an arbitrator. Mr Stephen, who was as arbitrator, is spoken of very highly by honourable members opposite, and I have nothing to. say against him; twentyhe may be avery competent man. was Mr Charlton - How could he, in the face of that agreement, if it is to be interpreted as Ministers and the members of the Committee say-namely , that the havChairman is to be an independent perbeson-recommen d the appointment of Sir of Thomas Hughes, who is chairman of .the the company that is a party to the agreement? s in Mr Scullin - That makes one doubt ^ -*:",36
149,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It does. It is. unthat we have not had a chance to peruse the agreement. In fact it?was until I asked a question that it was the laid upon the table of the House.,36
150,Mr MOWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Why have we not which the had copies of the papers?,36
151,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The agreement is nomiuot printed, and the original was laid number upon the table only in response to my question. It is regrettable that honourable threemembers have not had a chance to make by and themselves conversant with the recomthe mendations of the Committee. We are to expected to discuss an important matter like this without having before us either the findings of the Committee or the eviComdence that was adduced at the inquiry. after all, this House, by agreeing to the Prime Minister's proposal to allow the The Government to put the finding of the into operation without further consulting Parliament, is responsible for",36
152,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Hear , hear!",36
153,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We cannot avoid that aspect. Notwithstanding the warngiven by honourable members on this make side of the House, Parliament gave the Government that power, as. a result of which, we find ourselves in the present deplorable position. Everybody knew that the Prime Minister would enter into the agreement, no matter what its terms were. I do not mean anything offensive by that. But he had brought before the House a draft agreement which the Committee found was loosely drawn and unsatisfactory and did not safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth. Now, after the Committee have reported and recommended an improved agreement, the Government have entered into a contract with the company. I desire to know the reason for all this haste. The Government, were, for some reason, very anxious to ratify the agreement, and we were told by the honourable member for Batman today that Amalgamated Wireless Limited is 'linked up with other companies. We had not that information before, and I believe that if the House had known that other companies were involved it would not, by a majority, of six votes, have resolved that the Government should have power to act on the finding of the Committee without reference to Parliament.",36
154,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The House knew at that time that the Prime Minister had brought this project hack from London. . Mr CHAELTON - The House knew that, and also that the Prime Minister was pushing very hard to get the agreement through in the last hours of the session. What satisfaction is it to the House to find now, after the exposure by the honourable member for Batman, that Sir Thomas Hughes, the former chairman of the company, has been appointed the seventh director, s6 that, whilst the Commonwealth finds £500,000 of the total capital of £1,000,000 for the purpose of what Ministers have admitted to be merely an experiment in wireless telegraphy, the company have been given the majority of representation on the directorate for which they asked in the first place? The Acting Leader of the House has said that He will challenge the appointment that has been made. That is the very thing that I wish to suggest to the House. What have the Government done in regard to this matter?  say that there were almost insuperable difficulties in the way of getting an pendent chairman?",37
155,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"He led the House to believe that that was so. But probably during the lunch hour the Government held a Cabinet meeting; they saw the weakness of the position, and how the Commonwealth has been committed in respect of a liability of £500,000, and finding themselves in a tight corner, they resolved to tell the House that they would probe the whole matter. The country has a right to be thankful for one result from the amendment moved' by the honourable member for Batman, and it is that' the Government are at last stirred into activity, and will do something to safeguard the financial interests of the Commonwealth.",37
156,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I assume that the statement of the Leader of the House means the cancellation of the agreement.,37
157,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I want to know if it does; the House should have a definite statement upon that point. I doubt whether the Leader of the House dare go so far as that in the absence of the Prime Minister. This matter is worthy of the closest consideration. The Treasurer (Mr. Bruce) implied that the' Government were powerless in .this matter, inasmuch as the company had acted within the terms of the agreement that had emanated from the Committee, and which the House had empowered the Government to accept. If that is so, there is only one thing for the Government to do. If the company have acted within the terms of the agreement, the Government should repudiate it , and say that they find they have been "" taken in,"" and that the 'interests of the Commonwealth are not safeguarded. I ask the Minister in charge of the House whether he will give an 'assurance that the Government will cancel this agreement if Sir Thomas' Hughes is not removed from the position of chairman 1",37
158,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Does not the honourable member think that this debate should be adjourned until Wednesday next?,37
159,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It should be adjourned beyond Wednesday so that honourable members may have an opportunity of perusing printed copies of the whole of the evidence and reports. This is a serious business, but the House was forewarned of it . The Government, seeing what has happened, are endeavouring to escape their responsibility. So far as I know, the Minister's promise of investiindegation is merely a smoke screen in order bo smother criticism. The Acting Leader of the House said to me that he wanted the Address-in-Reply adopted today, and the Treasurer remarked that the debate was a waste of time. If ever good work has been done in this country, it has been in the discussion of the matters that have been brought before the House within the last few weeks. The Treasurer said that the people outside will notice what is happening. They will; if the majority of honourable members will not take notice, at any rate the people outaide will get information that they did not possess formerly as to the way in which the affairs of the country are being conducted at the present time. Mr ""WATT - This matter should be postponed.",37
160,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"It should. There is no justification for the Government endeavouring to bring the debate to a conclusion today. The issues are too serious. As I cannot move that the debate be adjourned, I ask leave to continue my remarks on Wednesday next, or that the Government will agree to an adjournment.",38
161,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,No .,38
162,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"We - have brought this matter forward in the public interest, and it has been disclosed beyond all shadow of doubt that there is a danger to the finances of the Commonwealth. However, I have not succeeded in my request that the debate be adjourned. - Mr Watt - Why was the honourable member refused?",38
163,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I only know that I did not succeed, and that, in view of the refusal of the Government, honourable members should be prepared to take a firm stand. Are they going to permit this agreement to be ratified without demanding further information? It is useless for honourable members on the other side to shelter themselves behind the Government. A mistake has been made, and one which may piove very serious and costly. Honourable members are the custodians of the publio weal. I ask them if they are going to be browbeaten and suppressed upon this vital question 1 Is this a matter to be glossed,over or rushed through?",38
164,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,It will not be rushed through; the honourable member may be quite sure of that!,38
165,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I trust that a majority of honourable members are of the same view.,38
166,Mr WATT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Hear , hear!",38
167,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"The importance of the subject cannot be too urgently emphasized - The country is about to be involved in an expenditure of £500,000 at a time when honourable members.are pointing to financial stress, and urging the need for greater economy than ever. Here is a semi-private concern, an enterprise as to which there is grave doubt whether it will pay. If it were certainly a paying proposition the Government would not be invited-indeed , they would nob be given a chance-to put up half-amillion of public money. Private interests would see to it that they ran the whole ""show"" themselves and retained all the profits. The Government have asked Parliament to ratify this outlay of £500,000. If the project proves a success the publio will reap the benefit; but, if it turns out a failure, the Commonwealth, which cannot afford to lose money, will not only lose but will have the added bitter knowledge that the sum has been thrown away;in a semi-private venture. The Treasurer has admitted that the whole scheme is in the nature of an experiment. There is nothing assured or successfully demonstrated in the proposition for wireless connection with the outside world. Wireless is in its infancy. The money of the people will be employed in experimental development. The Government are averse from the continuation or establishment of State enterprises, however profitable they may be. On the one hand they are now proposing to dispose of the Commonwealth Woollen Cloth Factory at Geelong; and, on the other, they are prepared, to put £500,000 of the people's money into a risky semi-public enterprise, the control of which, however, the Government may actually agree to place in the hands of the representatives of private interests upon the directorate. If honourable members are going to be content with the Government repudiation of the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes they will still be blameworthy; they will not have done their duty in the direction of safeguarding the public interest. The debate should be adjourned till next week; and, meanwhile, the Government should equip themselves with complete particulars, and should be ready to make an ample statement of their intentions. An adjournment would afford an opportunity for the Government to see that the whole business is placed on a better footing. I would not be surprised if the outcome of the present unfortunate state of affairs' were heavy and costly litigation, involving the Commonwealth, and probably - adding thousands of pounds to the liability of the people in respect of the wireless project. It is time honourable members let the country know that they are ready and willing to stand up for their responsilearn bilities. The question now for honourable members opposite is not of keeping the Government in power, but of doing the right thing by the people. The Government will not listen to counsels of delay. They say, "" This business musb go through."" Are honourable members going to be "" bull-dozed""? Are members behind the Government about to show themselves once more to be so docile that, no matter what may be the merits of the case, they will fall into line at the crack of the whip? The Parliamentary - Wireless Committee did good work, no doubt. Its members sought earnestly to protect the interests of the Commonwealth. But the private interests outside have found a way whereby to secure just whab they have sought all, along, and they have got it under agreement. The Government have just announced that they will repudiate the appointment of the seventh member of the directorate; but honourable members should not be satisfied with such a declaration. They should demand to be assured whether, under the agreement, the Government have the power to repudiate the selection of Sir Thomas Hughes.",38
168,Mr WIENHOLT,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"A very bad beginning has been made, anyhow.",39
169,Mr CHARLTON,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"That is so; and, if we allow matters to proceed from such a bad beginning, the country will suffer heavy losses. I say emphatically that if the Government will not grant an adjournment of the debate, this House should take a drastic course of action in order to protect the rights of the people:",39
170,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Cowper) [2.57]. - The declaration of the Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) has placed the question under debate in a different category from that which it occupied before; and, in the circumstances, I ask that the Government agree to an adjournment. There may be far-reaching consequences if the agreement is hastily ratified. The Government have announced that they will not stand for the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes as seventh director of this hybrid company.",39
171,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,What I said was that the Government were notifying the directors that they would not accept the nomination of Sir Thomas Hughes.,39
172,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,I am anxious to what is the responsibility of the Commonwealth in the light of events which may follow upon the repudiation of the selection by the arbitrator. We do not know that we may not be let in for costly litigation.,39
173,Mr MAXWELL,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,The company may snap its fingers at the Government.,39
174,Dr EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"For that reason, and in the light of all the circumstances, the Government should agree to an adjournment of the debate. Very few honourable members have had an opportunity of perusing the typewritten agreement. Even members of the Committee appointed by Parliament cannot' say that they are familiar with its terms. The Government would be showing its appreciation of the importance of the subject if they acceded to the evident desire of the the majority of honourable members. I ask leave to continue my remarks.",39
175,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Ver y well, I will agree to that course.",39
176,Mr RILEY,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Will the Government supply honourable members with copies of the agreement, and of the evidence?",39

180,Mr FLEMING,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Bobertson) [3.3] The Government have lately been talking about reducing the amount of expenditure allowed for the reporting of meteorological conditions. I ask the Ministry to stay their hand in this direction until whole question has been thoroughly inand quired into. These meteorological reports are not only of great advantage to growers of raw material; they are also sometimes a matter of life or death to those who travel up and down the north coast of New South Wales. It is portant that people who live in the tralia, valley of the Hunter Eiver should know what is happening in regard to the raininformation fall ancl flood waters. I am sure the ment. Minister for Defence (Mr Greene) recognises this, and I would like him promise that the Government will not coastal shipping. curtail expenditure on the despatch of meteorological reports until the whole question has been thoroughly inquired into. Even at a time when it is highly desirable to cut down expenditure as ns possible, I . am sure there is every justification for spending money upon these reports, because we ought not t i talk of economizing at the exHowever, pense of people whose lives may actually in danger. Not only is there loss of produce and live-stock through flood waters, hut in some cases on the northern rivers there is actual danger to human life. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) will bear out what I say.",40

188,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"In the aggregate, the cost of transmitting weather reports is considerable, but, as the honourable member knows, the aggregate figures we publish do not represent real expenditure, because there is a considerable amount of inter-departmental expenditure, which, for the purpose of bookkeeping, has to be shown in the national balance-sheet, swelling it very materially every year. t",41
