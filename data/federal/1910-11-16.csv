3,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Some time ago the Attorney-General repeated a promise made by his predecessor that when Bills involving extensive amendments of Acts were printed, he would have the sections which were to be amended printed separately, and attached to the measures. The Customs Bill makes a large number of amendments in an Act passed nine years ago, but the sections which are to be amended have not been reprinted.",14

8,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"A limited supply is now available, and.others will be ready within a day or two. Some little difficulty has been experienced' in connection with the framing of regulations, as only one section of the original Act deals with the granting of invalid pensions. The regulations are now almost complete, and it is hopedthat within a day or two they will be ready to send to the registrars in the various States, together with application forms, so that the magistrates may immediately consider and give decisions in regard to the LOSS OF THE WARATAH.",14

10,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"When the third reading of the Constitution Alteration (Monopolies) Bill was being discussed, the honourable member for Illawarra quoted from a speech made by me at Kiama, and published in the Kiama Independent of i2tfa October last. He saidAccording to this honourable member, the object of the Labour party is to nationalize all industries. The quotation was made to prove that statement, and to prove that I had said that it would be decided in caucus money necessary for the nationalizing of industries was to be got. I have sent Kiama for a copy of the newspaper in which the speech was reported, because knew that my remarks were not to that effect. The report is a very condensed one, only half a column being given to a speech with extended over an hour and - half. The passage which the honourable - member quoted was preceded by another which puts upon it a construction totally different from his, and is as follows: The Labour party had no desire to take any revolutionary steps that would throw our indus-. trial and commercial fabrics out of gear. It might be asked how they were going to get the full results of industry. They believed in State control. They asked the electors' authority to take so many steps, and were prepared not to go any further. Then if that proved satisfactory, come back every four years and .ask for further authority. tt should read ""three years."" They wanted to take control of monopolies - when they were dealing unfairly with the workers and exploiting the public. He - referred to the sugar monopoly, and stated white-grown sugar in Australia could be purchased £d. per pound cheaper in South Africa than it was being sold here for. The growers of the cane .complained of their treatment at the hands of the manufacturers, there being no competition in the market; the employees complained also, and the public as well. Therefore when the Government could not regulate monopolies the only other thing to do was to take over control, and surely if they can run their railways and tramways so satisfactorily they can industries of lesser importance. Then followed a portion quoted by the honourable member for Illawarra. As to where the money required for the nationalization of industries would come from, questions were asked at the end of my address by the Hon. W. Robson, a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. The word "" caucus "" was not used throughout my speech as reported in the quotation by the honourable member for Illawarra. When asked where the money would come from I saidWe expect to get a little from the Federal land tax, but there are other ways-a n income tax, for instance. Then you intend to get the money by taxing the people? Mr Catts said he was not there to say how they'd get it ; that was a matter that would be decided in Council. i What I said was that the party, as a whole,; would consult together, and the money would be found by the means which appealed to the majority, as mqst expedient.. where the GOVERNMENT OFFICE CLEANERS.",14

NA DESTROYERS.",15
13,Mr BRUCE SMITH,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"In the correspondence which has been circulated today regarding the refitting of the Commonwealth torpedo boat destroyers, Captain Creswell is stated to have reported that there is no Government or naval, yard in Victoria in which they could undergo the necessary refit-ting, and to have advised that fhey. should be sent to Brisbane, where the only Commonwealth naval depot exists. I ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether the Admiralty authorities, who have a complete ship-yard and refitting establishment at Sydney, have :been .asked to allow our torpedo destroyers to be refitted there, instead of being semi to Williamstown Pier, a great distance away from any engineering establishment?",15
14,Mr FRAZER,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I do not know whether the Minister has preferred any special request to the Admiralty, and should like notice of the question asked by the honourable member on that head. As to the refitting of the torpedo, destroyers, the matter has been exhaustively considered, and it is the opinion of .the Minister that the only two places at which the work can 1 be carried out are those in which the Commonwealth is in possession of men and material of its own. Anywhere else, it would have to ask for the assistance of State officials, or employ private workmen. The Minister has'decided that, in view of all the circumstances, Williamstown, where . we have our own establishment, and should have the co-pperation of the State Government, is the most suitable place.",15
15,Mr MATHEWS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Does the Minister representing the Minister of Defence think that he will ever be able to convince the representatives of the people of Sydney that there are other "" pebbles on the beach "" besides those to be seen there?",16

INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS. . Dr MALONEY - I desire to ask the Acting Treasurer whether the number of .questions to be answered by applicants for old-age pensions has been reduced, and, if so, when the papers will be circulated? . Mr Frazer - The list of questions to be submitted to applicants for old-age pensions has been revised. The questions have been reduced to a minimum, and I hope that in the course of a day or two the new forms, with the regulations and forms of application for invalid pensions, will be available for transmission to the different registrars.

17,Sir JOHN FORREST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I desire to ask the Acting Treasurer whether the new regulations, which, of course, I have not seen, in regard to old-age pensions, and also the regulations in regard to invalid pensions, especially the former, are in accord with the recommendation of the Treasury officials, whether in fact they have been recommended for approval by those officials as sufficiently protective of the revenue?",16
18,Mr FRAZER,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The administration of the Treasury Department is carried out in such a way that the Minister is responsible. He will be responsible for the regulations referred to when they are issued from the Department, and every possible consideration has been given, not only to the necessities of applicants for old-age pensions, but also to the interests of the Commonwealth.",16
19,Mr BAMFORD,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"In reply to the honourable member for Melbourne, the Acting Treasurer said that the list of questions to be answered by an applicant for an old age pension has been reduced to a minimum Am I to understand that all the questions which have been described here often as unnecessary will be struck out of the form? I also desire to know whether the revised list.is to apply, not only to the applicants for old-age pensions, but also to applicants for invalid pensions?",16
20,Mr FRAZER,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The number of questions in the forms is considered absolutely necessary in order to safeguard the public revenue, ]and ,to obtain the information which is required to enable a correct decision to be given. As soon as the new forms are issued to the registrars they will supersede the old forms.",16
21,Mr BAMFORD,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Will the list of questions apply all round?,16
22,Mr FRAZER,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Yes .,16
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I should like to again ask the simple question which I put to the Acting Treasurer a few moments ago. I only want to know- I have no personal knowledge on the subject-whe ther the Treasury officials consider that the new list of questions will sufficiently protect the revenue, whether, in fact, they recommended them?",16
24,Mr SPENCE,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Who is running the show ?,16

If so, what steps does he propose put an end to this anomaly and to remove the injustice inflicted on the Department?",17
35,Mr THOMAS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. The Postmaster-General is aware that there are in Sydney subscribers owning lines purchased prior to Federation who are at present receiving an unlimited service at approximately the rate mentioned. 2. The rights of the subscribers in question. are preserved to them by the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901, and the lines can only be resumed with the consent of Parliament. Legislation would, therefore, be necessary to place these subscribers on the same footing as other subscribers to telephone exchanges, and the matter is under consideration.",17
36,Mr JOHN THOMSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"for Mr HARPER), asked the Postmaster-General, ufon notice I. Has his attention been directed to the ments published in the public press regarding the methods that were followed in connection with the allotment of increments to class omcers in his Department? 2. Does he agree that the returns which have been furnished to this House disclose that the Public Service Commissioner's policy is to grant promotion in alternate years to officers in the. 3rd and 4th classes, and that the knowledge that such a policy is in operation must make the officers feel that merit cannot receive proper consideration ? 3. Is it the intention of the Government that the Government shall determine the amount to be made available each year to grant sub-divisional promotion to deserving officers?",17
37,Mr THOMAS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. No. The Public Service Commissioner has TELE- reported that no such policy is in operation. Of 453 officers provided for on the Estimates this year, 123 officers, or 27 per cent., also received increments last year. 3. No. There is at present no limitation as to funds, and every officer entitled to increment receives it. The determination of a fixed amount to be made available for increments each year might result in injustice to officers who are deserving of advancement, or, on the other hand, in increases being allotted where"" the circumstances would not justify it.",17
38,Mr FINLAYSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"the Postmaster-General, ufon notice I. Whether the Government have arrived at an agreement with the Canadian Government in regard to the question of "" route"" under the new contract for the Vancouver Mail Service? 2. As the inclusion of Auckland as a port of call will act prejudically to the interests and legitimate claims of both Melbourne and Brisbane as regular ports of call, in a subsidized Pacific Mail Service, will the Minister give the House an assurance that the interests of these ports will be protected under the new contract?",17
39,Mr THOMAS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The answers to the taking to honourable member's questions are1. No; the present position is that a cablegram has been received from Canada asking concurrence in the acceptance of a tender for a service from Vancouver to Sydney, vid Auckland, and a reply has been sent stating the Commonwealth Government cannot agree to the proposal. 2. The Government will see that, in any arrangement to which they are a party, the interests of Australia will be duly protected. EMIGRATION BILL. Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment.

Clause 13:Section 125 of the principal amended  clause provides for the amendment of section 125 of the principal Act, which specifies the persons who are liable to be trained, and I shall propose an important amendment relating to the length of time that a person shall have been resident in the Commonwealth before being liable to undergo training. Section 125 of the principal Act provides that persons who have resided in the Commonwealth for six months shall be liable to service; but to my mind the period should be extended to two years. We are making strenuous efforts to induce people to come to Australia. All the States, are operating in that direction, and a very - considerable influx of immigrants, which I hope, will be largely increased, is now taking, place. It would be a distinct deterrent to compel persons to submit to military training practically as soon as they put foot upon Australian soil, and I therefore move That the following paragraph be inserted :"" (aa) by omitting the words 'six months' and inserting in their stead the words ' two years.'"" Mr Bruce SMITH £11.10] - I do not think that the Committee is quite clear as to what the honourable' member has moved. I understand that he objects to the words "" six months "" in section 125 of the principal Act, and proposes to substitute for them the words "" two years."" The reason for this proposed amendment is that an immigrant should have more than six months to make arrangements to settle here before he is called upon to undergo military training. I should like the Attorney-General to say, because I think it might clear up a doubt, whether the section would apply to any arrivals in Australia who were over eighteen years of age. I am under the impression that it would not; that only persons who had not reached the age of eighteen years of age would .be liable to serve. The objection of the honourable member for Echuca is that immigrants would have their time fully occupied for the first six months after their arrival in determining where they would settle, and that it would be rather too early to call upon them, whilst they were busily occupied in determining the character and locality of the business in which they should engage, and in what State they should reside, to undergo military training. If the provision applies only to Act is boys under the age of eighteen years the argument is not so strong. But, if it would apply to fathers of families who had just arrived in the country, and would compel them to devote a certain number of days to military training whilst they were in the midst of their preparations to settle in the country, then-1 think it would be, as the honourable member for Echuca has said, a distinct deterrent to people coming here. I do not think we are so hard up for men in the Commonwealth that we cannot afford to allow new arrivals in this country a little more than six. months as breathing time in which to settle down before calling upon them to undergo compulsory military training. Consequently, I should like the Acting Prime Minister to inform the Committee whether the provision will apply to any person over eighteen years of age.",18
48,Mr SAMPSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Wimmera) [11.16] I intend to support the amendment. A very large proportion of the irmnigrants who come to Australia will be placed upon the land, and, undoubtedly, some little respite from military training ought to be granted to them in view of the difficulties which they must encounter in establishing (Parkes) homes for themselves. It is presumed that most of the persons who will be called upon to undergo compulsory training will be engaged in settled occupations. \They will thus be able to enter into an arrangement with their employers to serve for the necessary period. But it would be unfair to apply such a provision to new arrivals in the country, who, within a period of six months, will scarcely have had sufficient time to enable them to choose a home for themselves. As a matter of fact, if they wish to establish farms in new districts they will require to devote themselves exclusively to the task for at least two years before they can hope to make their lands productive. I hope, that the Acting Prime Minister will accept the amendment.",19
49,Mr RILEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"South Sydney) [11.18] I trust that the Acting Prime Minister will agree to the amendment, which is not vital to the Bill. During the first six months after their arrival in Australia many immigrants may be searching for steady employment, and it would be unfair to require them to undergo military training within that period. It will take them quite that time to get settled down. A man with a family, for instance, cannot pitch upon a home immediately.",19
50,Mr SCULLIN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,A man with a family will not be affected. . Mr Riley - Perhaps the Acting Prime Minister will explain whether the clause will affect adults.,20
51,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.19] - The section of the principal Act is quite clear. It provides for the training in our Citizen Forces of persons over the age of eighteen years. It has been suggested that the clause of the Bill which we are now considering will apply to all persons who have been in the country for a period of six months, and who are not exempt from its provisions. The honourable member for Echuca proposes that an exemption should be extended to persons who have not been resident in Australia for a period of two years and upwards. Then the honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Wimmera have suggested that the clause will operate with undue harshness in the case of immigrants. I fail to see that it will. Why should an immigrant be treated any better than our own people will be treated? As a matter of fact, compulsory training is less likely to inflict hardship upon an immigrant, who has no settled avocation, than it is upon a native-born Australian. During the time that he is undergoing instruction, the immigrant will be maintained, and he will also receive a little money for his service. I would have been glad to get such a job when I came to Australia, instead of floating idly around. If that is the only trouble awaiting immigrants it is a jolly good trouble. If six months after his arrival a man who comes here from England, Scotland, ireland, or Wales cannot do what is necessary in the matter of undergoing a military training-in other words, if he cannot do what any other citizen has to do - it is about time that he went back again. Section 131 of the principal Act provides that that measure shall not apply to persons of eighteen years of age before this part of the Act becomes operative. Therefore they will not be liable to military service until this part of the Act is proclaimed. Of course, it is possible that some immigrants between the age of eighteen and twenty-six years may be married. Under such circumstances we shall witness the spectacle of a man being torn from his home to undergo eight days' training in camp, during which period he will be fed and paid for his services. But even then he will not be subjected to worse treatment than our own citizens. To my mind every person ought to be treated alike, and that is what the Bill proposes.",20
52,Mr AGAR WYNNE,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Balaclava) [11.23]. - It seems to me that six months is rather a short period after their arrival in Australia within which to require immigrants to undergo military training. It will take a newcomer some little time to decide in which State he intends to settle. I would, therefore, suggest, that the Acting Prime Minister should consent to make the period twelve months, except in case of emergency, of which the Department will be the judge. That would overcome the difficulty.",20
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Parramatta) "" [11.24] - The Acting Prime Minister appears to be labouring under a misapprehension. He imagines, and so does the honourable member for South Sydney, that the fathers of families from abroad will be required to undergo military training. That is not the intention of the Department. As a matter of fact, no persons above twenty years of age will be obliged to undergo any training during the next three years. In reality this Bill is unnecessary for a period of three years. All that it does is to settle the lines upon which military training will operate three years hence. Everything else is provided for in my measure which was passed last year. It is not intended that any men who have passed the age of eighteen years shall be subjected to compulsory military training. I shall have something to say upon that aspect of the question on the motion for the third reading of the Bill. The clause will not apply to the adult portion of the immigrants who come to Australia. They will not be subjected to compulsory military training. It is only their boys who will have to undergo it. It would be an advantage to oversea immigrants, who have to spend a good portion of their time immediately following their arrival in Australia in selecting a place in which to settle, if the period were fixed at twelve months instead of two years. I would suggest to the Acting Prime Minister that he should adopt my suggestion which represents a fair thing in the case of youths from oversea.",20
54,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Wentworth) [12.29] - The Acting Prime Minister has spoken as if every Australian will be subjected to compulsory military training. As a matter of fact only a small proportion of our people will be obliged to undergo that training. Conthat sequently I see no reason why an exemption should not be extended to immigrants for twelve months after their arrival in Commonwealth.,20
55,Mr WEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,How will the clause affect the children of immigrants who are going to school; will they be exempt ?,21
56,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"If an immigrant's family be settled in a particular place I should prefer to see its male members subjected cadet training in the ordinary way. The Acting Prime Minister .might, I think, .consider the desirableness of action years; in the direction which has been sugthe gested by several honourable members. In administering the Act, undoubtedly large number of persons will be exempted from military service. It will satisfy me if these cases are dealt with by regula- [11.35] - I tion, but if the Committee desire to see provision in the Bill, one might be inserted.",21
57,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Adelaide) [11.30] - I hope honourable members will not be then misled by the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta to the effect that cerned. this Bill applies only to boys or youths under eighteen years of age. When this in that view. part of the Bill is proclaimed, it will apply to men over that age.",21
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,To immigrants over eighteen ?,21
59,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Yes . If , on the day the Bill is proclaimed, there is a boy in trained ? England seventeen years of age, and he does not arrive in Australia until two years later, when he is nineteen, he will be liable to training until he reaches the age of not be liable. twenty-six.",21
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"As that youth, when he reached the age of eighteen, not a citizen of Australia, the Bill will not be in force so far as he is concerned.",21
61,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The provisions apply to all male inhabitants of Australia have resided here for six months; a youth arrives here at any time before reaches the age of twenty-six he will be liable to training for the balance period. For all I care the period of exemption may be made twelve months; and though the point I have raised is not a very amendment) - put. important one, I do not desire honourable divided. members to be misled. A man .may arrive here at the age of twenty-two or twentythree, and, of course, he may have two or three small children; but it appears to me no great hardship will be involved if six months are allowed for him to look round. As I say, there is no objection to the the period of exemption being twelve months, but it must not be long enough to practically enable men to escape training.  There appears to be a consensus of opinion in favour of an exemption period of twelve months, and I shall, therefore, ask leave to to amend my amendment accordingly.

70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The Minister in charge of the Bill made a similar observaget tion. I hope, however, that honourable members do not imagine for one moment that these are Lord Kitchener's proposals. That officer suggested six compulsory drill for those over the age of twenty years. The Government now propose sixteen days of compulsory training per annum for those between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. That is ten days per annum more than Lord Kitchener required. He declared six days to be sufficient to turn out an adequate force for the defence of Australia. Lord civil Kitchener was emphatic on the point. Why have the Government proposed ten days day AYES. more per annum than Lord Kitchener de^clared to be necessary?",22
71,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [11.46] - Of course, what the honourable member for Parramatta has said is quite right as far as Lord Kitchener's black-and-white recommendations are concerned, but I think, the honourable member overlooked, for the moment, the important fact that the GoNOES. vernment are not making arrangements for' the home training that Lord Kitchener required. The whole basis of Lord Kitchener s scheme was that the hometraining was to be carried on under efficient officers, and that the efficiency of the home' training was to be tested in yearly camps of instruction. Yet the Attorney-General confessed to us to-night that the hometraining is going to be carried on in future - at any rate, for five or ten years-by men who will not be the highly-qualified officerswhom Lord Kitchener expected to be apPAIRS. pointed as the result of his recommendations ! For that reason I personally support the proposed increase in the duration of training. Lord Kitchener's scheme is valuable, as he himself emphasizes, only aslong as the home training is perfect. The moment your home training ceases to beperfect, the period of annual instruction in camps becomes altogether too short for the purpose. Now that the Government have overlooked the urgency of efficient training by consenting to a sort of makeshift training for the next ten years,. think that until we are prepared to make training efficient we ought to keep men in camp for a longer period in order to provide a moderately efficient force",22
72,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Parramatta)' such [11.49] - The honourable member for Wentworth has no doubt made his point very well, but what he has said does not away from the fact that Lord Kitchener laid it down distinctly that for those over twenty years of age six whole days in .camp was a sufficient period. He says, on page days' 6 of his reportSoldiers to be efficient should be exercised in camp annually, otherwise the men lose the incentive to home training, the habit of working of in units, of moving and living in numbers, and ready obedience to orders. For this reason I advise that camp training in time of peace should be extended, and I consider that having regard to the natural military aptitude of the Australian, favoured by the conditions of his life, the training should consist of six clear days annually, i.e., irom a Monday to a Saturinclusive, in addition to all home training. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the home training was to be voluntary, and not compulsory.",22
73,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"But under efficient - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Lord Kitchener went onI am of opinion that, if f thoroughly efficient officers, this training will meet requirements up to the twenty-fifth year. In the twenty-fifth-twenty-sixt h year a muster parade would suffice.

Howare the trainees to get their battalion drill inside the educational establishments unless special school battalions are to be formed ? I think it means that in some cases the Government will have to bring cadets a hundred miles or more in order that they may get their battalion drill. That is the difficulty that I see. Otherwise the object is. a desirable one.",24
83,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Wentworth) [11.59] - I do not quite understand what is meant by this amendment. Does it refer to private schools of any kind or character? The compulsory training will apply to all boys of certain ages.,24

85,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Any boy going to a school will be expected to undergo training?,24
86,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Certainly.,24
87,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I can see that some difficulty will be involved under the amendment.,24
88,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The gist of the amendment is that it permits youths over eighteen years of age, if they still remain at school, to be members of the senior cadets, instead of forcing them into the regular military forces.",24
89,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"There are other possibilities in k. For instance, there might be in Australia a sect with small establishments all over the country, each establishment so small that in itself it could not form a company of cadets. Under this proposal, all those different half companies might be organized into one battalion, although the battalion, as a whole, would never be drilled.",24
90,Mr WEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"They would come under different area officers. . Mr KELLY"" - I do not think the area officer has anything to do with the cadets. An effort was made by Sir Thomas Ewing three or four years ago to do something of the same kind. In that particular case I think the Marist Brothers' scliools were in' terested. That society has schools all over the country, and with a natural anxiety to maintain the general control over their "" boys, they wanted them, wherever situated, to be organized into units together. was pointed out at that time, this would meant. have meant having one commanding officer for a battalion of boys scattered all over Victoria, and they could never have been drilled together. The Government would do well to consider first the general interests of the Defence Department, and afterwards the interests of private scliools and other educational establishments. The suggestion may, perhaps, arise merely from the amour propre of those institutions, which are desirous of training their boys by themselves. I do not see that the proposal is of any value at present, while it might be dangerous, and the Minister would do well to reconsider its exact terms.",24
91,Mr CHARLTON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Hunter) [12.2] - I am glad the Attorney-General has introduced this amendment, because I regard it as necessary. It applies not only to private, but to public, schools. In New South Wales lads who desire to become teachers go into college to prepare themselves for their examinations. While there they, have to be very studious, and have not the time for drill that other boys have. Consequently, an arrangement such as this is advisable to enable them, after attaining the age of eighteen, and until they are through with their education, to do their drilling where they are carrying on their studies, and have then nights to themselves. I know a number of lads now at the different High Schools in New South Wales, some of them over the age of eighteen, and every night they have to do homework up to 10 o'clock. Unless special provision for their training is made, I am afraid an injustice will be done to them. There may be some little difficulty about battalion drill, but I think the officers will be able to overcome it by arranging for these lads to go through it during their holidays. In any case they are not likely to be at school after the age of twenty-one, and in the following five years they will surely get sufficient battalion drill for all purposes. The amendment is a goocl one in the interests of the public as well as private schools, and I hope the Committee will adopt it.",24
92,Mr GLYNN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Angas) [12.5] - I am pleased that the Attorney-General has introduced this provision. When the Defence Bill of last year was under consideration the heads of St. Peter's and Prince Alfred, ' the two leading Adelaide colleges, saw me about the matter, and told me that the head As of the Military Department in South Australia highly praised the drill given by the colleges. It has a fine effect upon the esprit de corps of the boys. I was also told that they had battalion drill in connection with Christian Brothers College, although I have not seen any one connected with that College on the subject. I was, however, told by the Principals of the two others that they had their regular battalion drill, and after inspection by the Military Department passed the very highest tests of efficiency. I am glad the amendment has been introduced, because we ought to tone down, as far as possible, the beginnings of this system of conscription, which I do not welcome, by recognising the excellent work done by the schools on voluntary lines.",24
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Parramatta) [12.6] - I have in my mind the position as it appears in Sydney today. large private schools all have cadet units, and have what is called a public school battalion, consisting of units from the large scliools. In order to make up that battalion one of the units has to come from Bathurst to Sydney, about 140 miles, and another from Armidale or Tamworth, 200 or 300 miles. That is the difficulty.. I am in thorough agreement with all the .work of the units in the schools, so far as that goes. It is advisable to do it within the schools as far as possible at such hours as may be convenient, but the Bill requires that there shall be efficient battalion for the senior cadets. I do not see how that is to be obtained with this grouping, except at great inconvenience.",25
94,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [12.8] - The clauseaims at disturbing as little as possible the educational course of students. I do not knew what arrangements have been made with regard to battalion drills, but it has been the practice to fix them as far as possible for public holidays - In any case, in a big area, such, as that of which the honourable member for Parramatta has just spoken, where the units have to be brought from all over the place; the same difficulty would occur, in spite of this clause. The clause does not accentuate it, but rather tends to relieve it, because you have your unit in the school, and all the units are brought down to form a battalion. Under another system you would have to bring individuals down. school there may be thirty or forty to form a half-unit. If any of them are over the age of eighteen, instead of going into the [220]- 2 citizen force, they can remain attached to the school unit, so long as they are students there, but they must do the amount of drill required for the citizen force. That is a great convenience to a young man going through a school or university course. Surely it is a great advantage if a young man can do eight of his sixteen days' training, and all his detached drills, in his university or school ? So long as he does the drill there, and satisfies the authorities that he does it, why should he have to go out? The clause is a very valuable one.",25
95,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Capricornia) [12.10] - I am very much concerned about this proposal. If it includes State schools, well and good, but if it affects only private schools The Mr Charlton - It is for State schools also.",25
96,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"That does not appear from the speeches that have been delivered. Australia is, I hope, a Democracy, and we must not encourage the creation of a caste in this community. According to the Minister, if a cadet remains at school after eighteen, he is to be permitted to avoid the eight days' training, so long as he can carry out eight days' training in his school. What State school is attended by boys that will come under this provision ?",25
97,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The State High Schools drill will come under 'it.,25
98,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I am speaking about the lower schools.,25
99,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,No person is concerned until he reaches the age of eighteen; and then only if he wishes to stop at school.,25
100,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"That is not how the provision strikes me. Its object appears to be to provide that the students at the Church of England Grammar School, the Wesley - College, or the Roman Catholic Institution shall be permitted to carry out their military training in their own school yards. I have no objection to that if the children attending State schools are allowed the same privilege.",25
101,Mr SCULLIN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,They are.,25
102,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I do not think so. If boys attending the colleges I have mentioned are to be allowed to escape the night drills, the children attending the primary State schools should be allowed In a to escape them also.'",25
103,Mr CHARLTON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,U p to the age of fourteen the boys in the State schools are drilled in the day-time.,25
104,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I may be very obtuse, but it seems to me that an attempt is being made to allow the children of people who can afford' to send them to expensive schools to escape the eight days' training.",26
105,Mr CHARLTON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Hundred s of boys are going to those schools at the expense of the State.,26
106,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"There are a great number of parents in Australia able to afford to send their children to the large public schools, but the average parent cannot afford the expense, and must send his children to the State school. If there is one institution in Australia which more than another contributes to the growth of the spirit of Democracy, it is tire State school, <n which all children, no matter of what religion, or what the financial position of their parents may be, are educated together. I was educated for a time in a State school, but my parents moving to another part of the town, it was too far for me to continue to attend the State school, and more convenient that I should attend a Roman Catholic school. Being an Anglican, I Wad to remain outside while the Roman Catholic children were being given their religious instruction. Prior to-attending - his school, I thought that Roman Catholic boys were of an entirely different type from boys of other religions. It was not an infrequent thing for boys of the school to which I went to sally forth in the afternoon and pelt stones at the boys who attended the Roman Catholic school. I 'dare say that some honourable members remember the taunts which used to be used on such occasions. "" Protestant, Protestant, ring the bell Catholic, Catholic, go to The boys attending the Roman Catholic schools, of course, put the verse the other way about.",26
107,Mr MAHON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I have known the same thing to occur with boys attending the same school - One lot would go one way, and another lot another way, and when they met in the afternoon there would be a fight.",26
108,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"It was only when I attended a Roman Catholic school that I found that Roman Catholic boys were just like other boys, and some of my most intimate friends were the friends I made in that school. If this system is to be permitted to lead in any way to the disparagement of the State schools, and encourage divis on amongst our people, it must be ; strongly deprecated. If parents find that by sending their children to such private schools as I'have mentioned, they will be able to avoid drill or the eight days' continuous trainingj they will try to muster up all the funds they can in order to send their children to these schools. So little are the families of Australia prepared for this rigid compulsory system that we are proposing to introduce, that I am satisfied that parents will do their level best to enable their children to escape it - I sincerely hope that all schools in the Commonwealth will be included under the operation of this prevision. To show that I am right in my contention, I remind the Committee that the honourable member for Parramatta instanced the case of an ""Armidale school, and said that the boys attending it would have to join with those attending another. The honourable member for Angas mentioned the case of a Protestant denominational school whose boys are trained with boys attending a Christian Brothers' school. What objection can there be to the boys attending a private school at Armidale being-instructed by the same military instructors with the boys attending a State school ?",26
109,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I shall explain the provision if the honourable member will allow me, but we must get on.",26
110,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"We must get on,' of course ; but I wish to avoid errors in this Bill, which is the most important measure ever submitted to this House.",26
111,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Attor- . ney-General) [12.20] - The proposal is a very simple one, and the best explanation of it is that it means exactly what it says. I defy any honourable member who looks at it fairly to say that it is proposed that ."" one school shall be treated differently from another. The. honourable member for Capricornia sees in every bush a highwayman, and in the most peaceful and secluded surroundings a perfect battalion of horrors. The Minister has supplied me with the regulation under which this provision will be operated should the Bill pass. Educational institutions, having as students thereat not less than sixty senior cadets, may be allowed to have separate half companies or detachments organized for their training, provided and so long as not less than one oflicer of each company or detachment is a teacher in the institution. Such senior cadets may be registered in the area in which such institutions are situated, and may be trained therein, notwithstanding they reside in some other area; but to be entitled to this privilege they must also notify the officer in charge of the trainingarea in which they reside. On ceasing to be a student at such institution a senior cadet shall be transferred to the train-ing area in which he resides, or, in the case of becoming a student at another institution may be transferred to the area in - which it is situated. It is not a question of whether the school is a private or a public school, but whether the boy is of such an age as to be a student as distinguished from a schoolboy. VVe all. know that the State primary schools are not, as a rule, attended by boys of eighteen years of age. It is not a question of class or caste, but the grade of education really determines the ages of the pupils at any school. We think that when lads cease to be schoolboys and become student's we should not interfere with their studies where it is not absolutely necessary to do so. So we provide that wherever possible the training shall be given to-students within the institutions which they attend. This will apply to lads over and under the age of eighteen years, and though lads over that age will be ordinary citizen soldiers, they will get the same training as citizen soldiers inside the institution. Why should they not, provided that they are trained? Our concern is that they should get the necessary training. The Minister informs me that these students will be trained by the same officers as those who will impart the instruction to persons outside. Every one will be treated exactly alike, and whether the parents of a lad have an income of ,£10,000, or he has entered a High school on a State bursary, or whether, as we hope to see later on, our High schools and secondary schools are open to the poorest boy in the community, if it is proposed to make a scholar of him, he will be allowed to acquire his training under this Bill in such a way that his study will not be intruded upon unnecessarily.",26
112,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Capricornia) [12.25] Will the Minister accept an amendment to provide for the exemption from training of the children of parents who have a conscientious objection to their children being trained in the use of arms ? The honourable gentleman has said that boys of the senior cadet age are very seldom found attending State primary schools, but there are many boys offifteenor sixteen years of age attending these schools, and are they not to be permitted to mix with the boys attending-a Grammar school ?",27
113,Mr SCULLIN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,They will be trained in their own schools - I think that the honourable member for,27
114,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I assure honourable members that I have no wish to raise any captious objection to this Bill, but I do want to put down caste in Australia. I know as a matter of fact that there is a number of silly people connected with some of the private schools who instruct the' pupils attending them not to speak to the boys attending the State schools. That is an extraordinary thing in an Australian community, but I can assure honourable members that it has occurred.",27
115,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,How would the honourable member propose to legislate against that?,27
116,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I should do what I could to prevent that kind of thing by refusing to.set up class distinctions as, I am afraid, is proposed here. If our Australian youth are to be trained there should be no objection to their being trained together.",27
117,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member will never be able to prevent amother thinking that her boys are better than other boys.,27
118,Mr FINLAYSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"It would be a pity if we could. - Mr HIGGS - I do hot say that a mother should be asked to refrain from thinking so, but the law of the land in a democracy like this should not provide that the children attending private and High, schools should be kept away from the common or garden variety of State school boys. I would ask what is to become of apprentices who are from fourteen to eighteen years of age? Are we to understand that boys attending grammar and High schools are not to be allowed to associate with apprentices who are at work at their various trades during the day and attend technical schools in the evening? I hope that the time will come when we shall find quite a different attitude adopted towards boys and men who are seen in our streets with grime on their clothes and hands. But that time will not . come if we are, by our legislation, to afford facilities for the creation of class distinction. I am with honourable members who are desirous that students for the ministry, who are to be engaged in a peaceful calling, entirely different from that of the man of arms, shall be exempt from this drill. I am of the opinion that every person in the community who has a conscientious objection to militarism should be exempt from compulsory training.",27
119,Mr SCULLIN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Corangamite) [12.27]. Capricornia has entirely missed the point. He argued that we are making a distinction between the scholars attending the different schools, but, as a matter of fact, we are making provision that the scholars attending each school may be given their training within the institution. The honourable member states that boys attending the State schools are to be treated differently from boys attending private and High schools. That contention is ridiculous. This provision is intended to meet the case of lads who have reached eighteen years of age and are still at school, and I do not see that they can ma^e the slightest objection to it. The honourable member asks whether they are not to be allowed to associate with apprentices. But I would ask him where, apprentices are to be drilled. They cannot be drilled at their factories, and must get their training at night in the drill halls. The provision will accomplish two things: it will relieve the strain upon the drill halls, and it will establish compulsory training with a minimum of inconvenience to every one. We, on this side, are all opposed to the creation of class distinctions, but compulsory training, although necessary, is inconvenient, and we wish to minimise the inconvenience. To allow boys to drill at the schools which they attend will be a sensible thing, and will notcreate class distinctions. The amendment speaks of "". students at educational establishments,"" including, of course, public schools. The Government are to be congratulated on their courage in providing for universal training, with a minimum of inconvenience to those - concerned.",27
120,Mr FINLAYSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Brisbane) [12.33]. - There is a much more serious objection to the amendment than has been touched on. . It is provided that the training of units shall be of the same character, - and of the same annual duration, as ih the citizen forces, but in lieu of that prescribed 1:1 paragraph c of section 127. That means that those trained at schools will not be compelled to undergo the eight days' continuous training for which the Act makes provision. The rest of the citizen forces will have to attend sixteen whole-day drills, or their equivalent, of which not less than eight shall be in camps of continuous training. The continuous training will be escaped by the students of educational establishments. Thus we shall set up two distinct kinds of training. I contend that continuous training is essential to efficiency, and necessary to create the feeling that our citizens must act together for the defence of the country.",28
121,Mr SCULLIN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Would the honourable member bring all the men in Australia into one camp?,28
122,Mr FINLAYSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Of course, that would be impossible. At the present time men are brought together at various strategic points in the different States, and that practice will be continued. In time of war no distinction can be made, and, therefore, it is inadvisable to set up distinctions in the matter of training.

131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"And to something still more useful. It will beget a rivalry which will tend to efficiency. I do not see why there should not be the same rivalry in connection with the preparations for the defence of the country as there is now in connection with the football and cricket matches which proceed so merrily in their respective seasons. Such rivalry will, above all other things, make for efficiency, and the more we do to develop it the better. I thought at first that the proposed arrangement would interfere with battalion drill, but if there are sufficient numbers to prevent that I see no reason to object to the training provided for. It will be more convenient to train boys in the schools, and the school corps can be linked together in battalions. Lord Kitchener mentions the need for esfrit de corps. He says that we should preserve territorial and other distinctions as much as possible. Who can say how much the feeling that inspired men who have belonged to the Black Watch, the Guards, or some other noted regiment, has contributed to the efficiency of the British Army, and made it the best in the world ?",28
132,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,That is mere boasting. How does the honourable member know that it is the best in the world?,29

140,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member conjured up dire possibilities, which attach a stigma to many honourable members, unless an attempt be made to clear them up. If I thought that this clause - was open to any of the possibilities suggested, by the honourable member, I should foe found supporting him, even to the death, wherever he might lead. But I fail to see that it is. Nor do I see the slightest necessity for dragging in the subject of battalion drill: Battalions are talked about and handled by many honourable members who scarcely know them from a squad of recruits. I would point out to the honourable member for Capricornia and the honourable member for Brisbane tiiat this measure does not touch the subject of battalion drill.",29
141,Mr RILEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member for Parramatta raised that issue.,29
142,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Yes ; but the question of continuous camps and working together was also raised.,29
143,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Will the honourable member deal with the question of the eight days' camp?,29
144,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The clause does not touch that subject. It is a matter for regulation and organization. It is for the officers to decide how they shall work in that direction. The amendment does not interfere with battalion drill, nor does it drag in the subject of class distinction or touch the question of sectarianism-of one school against another, or one religion against another. It makes no distinction between a public school and a private institution. A proposal which is. simply designed to assist certain youths who are pursuing an educational career seems to have conjured up in the minds of honourable members possibilities of a most diiSl character, and interference with bat? talion drill. The Bill provides that youths on attaining the age of eighteen years shall pass out of the senior cadets into the Citi-i ze'n Forces for a different class of drill, and of a longer duration. There are certain youths who remain in educational establishments, both public and private, after they have reached the age of I eighteen years. Ordinarily speaking, and without this amendment, they would, notwithstanding their continuance in the educational establishments, have to pass into the Citizen Forces, which might materially interfere with their educational career, or their effort to attain a certain standard. The amendment means that youths who, after reaching the age of eighteen years, remain at an educational establishment, either public or private, may be trained with the senior cadets, as they had been trained during the previous four yeafs, instead of being put into the Citizen Forces, where the drill is different and longer than in ordinary circumstances.",29

147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Then the able member has not read it.,30
148,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Of course, it is possible that, under the regulations, the Minister may prescribe that such youths may be taken out of the senior cadets, and drilled as special units, but I venture suggest that their number - will not be suffiaccept cient to permit of that being done, and will have to adopt the alternative of lowing them to ' remain in the senior cadets.",30

154,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"That is wholly the irood reason for the amendment as I understand it, and its purport. It does not interfere ought not to stand in the way. with class distinctions or with battalion drill, but it gives a little extra privilege those who are attempting to attain a higher educational standard than it was possible for them to procure prior to reaching age of eighteen years. In these circumh stances it ought, I think, to meet with approval of every honourable member on this side. I hope that it will be approved. I see none of the dire possibilities suggested amendment were adopted. by the honourable member for Capricornia, nor can I see that in any circumstances will interfere with the so-called battalion drill.",30

It is perfectly that the number of conscientious which might be developed and hatched out would be so portentous as to judgpractically reduce the army to a shadow. We know what sort of conscientious scruples Comunscrupulous parents had to the education of their children until it was made compulNo scruples should be allowed to stand in the wav.

Surely he will admit that that training must leave a boy better than it found him.",30
158,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Capricornia) [12.59] - I shall content myself with emphasizing my opinion. I realise that no one is more fitted than is the Attorney-General to reduce a position to an absurdity. He can make a great deal of capital out of conscientious objections. But the Bill already provides for the exemption of adults on that ground in - time of war. I refer to new section 61, which exempts persons who satisfy the prescribed authority that their conscientious beliefs do not allow them to bear arms. Why did not. the Attorney General rise in his place and ridicule that provision ? He was only too glad to have it in the Bill, because he knows that there are such persons in the community. History is filled with instances where persons have been willing to go to the stake to be sacrificed rather than to waive their conscientious objections.",31

An honourable member interjects that if such desire to go out and shoot some.one. a provision were adopted every one would secure exemptions. I would point out, in reply, that if the Governor General in Council considered that any applicant for exemption was not sincere in his profession of conscientious objections to training the use of arms, his application would refused. The Minister will have in his service officers who will be able to make such inquiries as will satisfy him that the parents making application have consciensions tious objections to their children being trained in the use of arms. It will be think, correct. observed that I do not propose that boys up to eighteen years of age shall be exempt from phvsical drill. It is well that Australian should have a certain amount of phvsical drill, but I do not know that it is wise to commence physical training at so early an age as fourteen years. A'great deal of harm can be done to a boy of that age by subjecting him to injudicious physibe cal exercise. Even the use of light dumb- - purpose of becoming graduates. bells, with certain extended gestures, may cause considerable strain on the vital organs of a boy, ancl induce heart trouble. There can be no doubt, however, that judicious physical training is good for all youths. A number of persons have conscientious objections to their children cultivating what they call the military spirit. Let us not seek to avoid the fact that as soon as we produce this system-as soon as we establish our Military College-w e shall cause a number of our youths to dive into the biographies of great military men. They will read of Napoleon, the Caesars, Charlemagne, Alexander, and others, and will no doubt acquire a military spirit to such an extent that a life of peace will not be agreeable to them. They will look over the world for some means of entering into war, and will consider that the time has arrived when they should make a name for themselves. They might possibly entertain the idea of creating an Empire of their own, with a view to their being selected as dictators. I fear that the tide of militarism is becoming too strong.",31

The interpretation that I place on the clause is, I Taken by itself, it will not prevent any individual from obtaining a commission or from becoming a graduate every of the Military College, and so being eligible for appointment as an officer of our Permanent Forces. I understand, however, that the Minister intends to issue a regulation providing that only persons between the ages of fifteen and nineteen.years shall allowed to enter the College for the If that regulation is issued, then this clause, read in conjunction with ft, will have precisely the effect that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports suggested yesterday. It will have the effect of preventing from ever becoming an officer. In the Act of 1909, as well as in the Bill now before us, we have declared that persons lege. who have served a certain period in the Citizen Forces shall have preference selected to go there. for commission rank, and it seems to me that that is a very fair proof vision. The tendency all over the regulations. world is to permit those who have pass held non-commissioned rank to obtain comthe missions. That is fostered in the Amerimeet can Army, is permitted in the German Army, and certainly is not specifically barred in the British Army, although mit that in practice the social element a good deal to do with promotions, and that the ranker who does obtain a commanent mission is not given too happy a time, withstanding that he may have sufficient finances to allow him to enter into all social life open to the average run cers. It would be a stigma on Australia if we, either by Act or regulation, declared that certain persons who had served a term in the Forces, either as privates or nondebarred. commissioned offiers, should be debarred men, because we shall in the future have for all time from holding a commission the Permanent Forces. At the present time, some who hold commissions have at the age of nineteen-so-as to enable him ' risen from the ranks, and have proved themselves exceptionally brilliant. under this clause, read in conjunction the regulation which I understand it proposed to issue, no person, unless entered the College between the ages fifteen and nineteen years, can hope to a commission in the Permanent Forces. shall thus establish in the Permanent officers a small military class who will hold selves aloof from others, who will look with disdain upon the officer of the ranks, and who will know that only a select few of their own particular type can hope to hold commissions alongside them. We shall make close preserves of such posiscribed tions. 1 know that we are making a disofficers tinct advance on other military college tems by proposing to open our Military College to all persons, and in making provibe sion for their maintenance whilethey main in the College. We are throwing open the doors of our Military College to larger sections than are the Military Colleges either America or England; but the vidual must haye.decided between the of fifteen and nineteen years that he going to adopt a military career; otherwise there can be no hope for him.

There are several hundreds notof non-commissioned and instructional men more fitted for commission rank than are the some who hold commissions, not merely beof officause of their special knowledge and adaptability, but because of their general education and other qualifications; and yet, after a period of five years, they will be And these are not the only in others offering in precisely the same walk of life.

He may be specially themgifted, but, notwithstanding that he has served for many years in the Cadets and citizen the Citizen Forces, and proved himself worthy, this regulation, coupled with.the ever clause, will debar him from any opportunity of showing that he can pass the preexamination. It is quite right that in the permanent service should atsystain a certain standard of education and military knowledge, and that they should graduates of the College; but a greatreinjustice will be done if we decide that . others, who may be specially gifted, shall not have an opportunity of demonstrating . of that they can become graduate's. If honindiorable members are prepared for such a ages step, I have misunderstood the tendency is on both sides of the Chamber. Under the circumstances, I should like to know whether the Government are prepared to accept an amendment. What I suggest is that the following proviso should be added to clause *9Provided further that persons who have served three years in the force may at any before they attain the age of twenty-seven enter the Military College for the purpose becoming graduates therein.",32

172,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Actin g the Prime Minister and Attorney-General) at [ -55J--The proposal to which honourable 2 promembers take objection, is,. I am .inclined to think, in its wording somewhat misleadscope being very much narrower is imagined. First of all, the Deforce-th Force of Australia is to be a citizen e people who are going to fight battles of Australia will be citizen The men who are going to command the citizen soldiers-non-commis officers, commissioned officers, and regimental, brigade, general, and staff officers-wil l all, without exception, distinbe men to whom preference is given,- as and having passed through the ranks! With regard to the forces alluded' to in the proposed section 148, they are instructional forces pure and simple, and not fighting Bill forces. We are engaged in creating a staff of instructors, and they must be highly skilled and trained men, who have gone through the curriculum from beginning to end. We are going to pour those an men into a mould which has received the imprimatur of this Parthe liament, and of Lord Kitchener, who the has laid down the model here followed. all, it is as difficult to make a highly soldier as to make a highly trained Notwithstanding the fact that are graduates in the learned professions- I may not speak of the legal prorisfession with that freedom of criticism open others-whos e prodigious incapacityis the general practice and desire is to put down quackery; and, consequently, we demand that each graduate shall "" go through the mill."" I do not deny that outside the learned professions there are men whom we should like to see within them, and there ought to be no unnecessary embargo. With the contention of the honourable member for Adelaide, who speaks from personal experience not open to most of us, I am perfectly in accord ; but, obviously, it can apply only in the rarest cases. We have to consider the whole effect of a system; and if we open a door or crevice, however small, the result may be that the system will break down, and there will be more exceptions than observances of the rule. The proposed regulations contemplate that for the first examination a candidate's sixteenth birthday must fall on or before the rst March, 1911; and his nineteenth birthday after that date. With regard to the training, the idea is to get the students at or about a certain age, keep them a prescribed time, and turn them out according to a prescribed pattern. I admit that that system is open to the objection urged by my honourable friend, but I understand that he himself is not at all desirous that any person should be. appointed who has not passed the examination of the College. All he wants is an opportunity for persons rarely and highly gifted to qualify. As to that, the recommendation of Lord Kitchener isI have shown that 350 officers are required for the 'Staff Corps, and I shall now discuss the organization of a Military College to maintain that corps. Taking twenty years as the average service of an officer, it appears that after the Staff Corps is up to establishment the yearly output required from the college will be about eighteen cadets. The minimum length of course required to efficiently ground a cadet in his profession is three years. As has already been pointed out, strict selection should be enforced from the. moment a boy becomes a cadet The age of entry should not be less than seventeen nor more than nineteen. We have closely followed the recommendations of the Field Marshal. The matter will be dealt with by regulation, and I have had an opportunity of consulting with the Minister of Defence, who, while not pledging himself to do as the honourable member suggests, says that he is not adverse to meeting the honourable member in a reasonable way. He thinks there should be established a general rule, which should obtain in all but the rarest cases. If the honourable member will take my assurance Mr Hughes. that the Minister has authorized me to say that he is willing to favourably consider the suggestion that opportunity should be afforded by the regulations in certain cases for persons over the age now mentioned",33
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I am afraid it cannot be done by regulation if it is not done first in the Act.,34
174,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"This Bill does not prevent it being done. All that the Bill says is that the person must be a graduate of the College. It does not say at what age he must enter the College. The whole point of the argument of the honourable memher for Adelaide is not that officers should not be graduates of the College, but that no one should be stopped from being a graduate of the College by reason of his being over the age of nineteen. The question of the age being a matter for regulation, the honourable member's objection can be got over. The Minister, without binding himself in any way, declares that he is prepared to favourably consider a suggestion to enable the age limit to be waived in rare cases, where that may be reasonably asked for. Beyond that, I do not think we ought to be asked to go. We must remember the very heavy and grave responsibility that rests upon the Defence Department and the Minister, of turning out the new force in the most approved form, and that everything depends upon the-personnelof the instructional staff. This, in its turn, must depend upon the process to which it has been subjected, and in the circumstances I think the Government might reasonably be clothed with the power for which they are asking in this clause.",34
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Parramatta) [3.5] - The difficulty that I see arises'from section 22 of the principal Act when read with this clause. There seems to be a clear conflict between the two. Section 22 of the Act says that the Governor General may appoint any person to be an officer without his passing the prescribed examination, while this clause provides that no person who is not a graduate of the Military College, as prescribed, shall be appointed an officer of the Permanent Forces.",34
176,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member for Adelaide is not asking for that to be altered.,34
177,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,But that is the point with which the honourable member will be met wheu he begins to try to do what - the honourable member for Adelaide suggests. Clearly section 22 of the Act must be amended.,34
178,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.6] - There is no conflict between the two provisions. Section 22 of the Act can have no relation to section 148 as contained in this Bill, because this clause does not refer to a prescribed examination at all. It rektes to the Military College. Section 22 deals with officers in general, and this clause deals only with officers of the Permanent Forces. The effect of the clause is simply to take away from the Governor General the right to make any person an officer ot the Permanent'Forces. It does not away from him the right to appoint any person an officer of the Citizen Forces, promote an officer for distinguished service, irrespective of whether - he is or is not a graduate of the Military College. Section 22 is not in conflict with this clause, except in one particular, and only doubtfully in that.",35
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The term "" officer,""' in section 22, unless defined, must include all officers.",35
180,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I think it is defined, and I am not sure whether section 22 has not been touched by the amending Bill. The net effect of new section 148 will simply be to take away from the Governor General, at the most, the power under section 22 to promote a person to be an officer of the Permanent Forces-no t the Citizen Forces. That is, it will only prevent him making a man an officer of the instructional staff. A man may be the Bravest in the world, but be totally unequipped to teach the scientific side of artillery or engineering. Another man may be very nearly a poltroon, and yet a very good mathematician. The idea of the Military College is to turn out persons thoroughly versed in the science and art of war as we know it today.",35
181,Mr FENTON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Maribyrnong) [3.10] I hope the Attorney-General will accede to the request of the honourable member for Adelaide. We ought not to exclude men over the age of nineteen from entering the Colljege, because it is very Irarely that young men before that age start to think for themselves. A young man may be exceptionally qualified, and may, at the age of twenty, decide to take up a military career. It would be a distinct disadvantage to debar him from entering the College and qualifying as an officer of the manent Force simply because he was over nineteen. We may be able to place every reliance on the present Minister of Defence, but a time may come when another Minister may do all planner of things by regulation. We should emphatically state our intentions and wishes in this Bill. This is one of the most important aspects of the defence question, because we are trying to arrange to have men well trained to instruct our Forces, although, with the honourable member for Capricornia, I hope the day is notfar distant when men will become so educated and civilized as to be able to do without warlike preparations. We have, however-, in the present circumstances, to arm as other nations are arming. I do not betake lieve in clothing even a Minister of the greatest integrity with power to do by or to regulation what we ought to do by Act of Parliament. I should like to see the age of entry into the College increased, say, to twenty-five years. If the Minister cannot accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Adelaide at once, will he promise to consider it, and bring up, on recommittal, a clause giving.effect to it? If he does, I am sure that course will meet with the unanimous approval of honourable members.",35
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Swan) [3.13] This is not a new question - It has been, I suppose, under the consideration of every Minister of Defence since the establishment of the Constitution. We are proposing now to go back to where we were in 1901. When I became Minister of Defence. I found that commissions in the Permanent Forces were reserved solely for those who entered at an early age, and qualified themselves in the service, whereas those who had served faithfully and well in the Citizen Forces, and had made a special study of military tactics, were altogether debarred from obtaining any of the plums of the service. There was a good deal of dissatisfaction about it at the time, because a great many who had entered into the military life in the militia or the volunteers had' developed a great liking for it, and wished to qualify themselves for appointments, of which there are a good many in the service, such as all the staff appointments in the different States up to the position of commandant. From all of these positions citizen officers were debarred. Our defence system is different from that of the Mother Country and most other countries, in that we depend Per- wholly on the Citizen Force. Our aim must therefore be to make the men and officers active ancl zealous, and eager to qualify for the highest positions. If we deprive them of the opportunity to win the prize of high promotion, they will, ""naturally, have less incentive to improve themselves in the knowledge and art of war. The question assumed a practical shape when I was Minister of Defence in 1903, and I was not long in coming to the conclusion that we must do everything possible to encourage the citizen soldiers. Therefore, just before transferring to another Department, I wrote a minute directing that a regulation should be made which would allow citizen officers to obtain promotion where they were qualified, without being debarred by age conditions.' On 15th October, 1908, the honourable member for Laanecoorie moved this motionThat, in order to obtain the full realization of the benefits of the citizen defence system, this House is of opinion that the Defence and Regulations framed thereunder should provide opportunity for the promotion of ber of the Commonwealth Defence Forces to any position which, by reason of adequate fications, he is competent to fill. That was carried. In speaking on said that I was surprised that it should necessary, but on making inquiries I found that the regulation framed on my minute of 8th August, 1903, had been repealed on ist October, 1905. The minute was be repeated. as follows:Having f u l ly considered this matter, prove of all officers of the Militia and Volunteer Forces being equally eligible for transfer to the General and Instructional Staff as already permanently employed, provided that in knapsack. other respects they satisfy the conditions than that of age of entry and comply with the regulations as to examination. It would grossly unfair to debar officers of the Militia and Volunteer Forces from being eligible appointments to the Permanent Force on account of age. Prior to the writing of that minute, men who were qualified for promotion were often debarred, because they were beyond the age. I have nothing to say against - what the Attorney-General advanced as to the need for qualified officers. VVe have officers who are competent, not to teach, but also to lead j it is awful think of incompetent officers being in charge of men on the field of battle. But I do not wish to build up a military class whose members would consider themselves superior to the members of the citizen soldiers, whom we must mainly depend', for our fence. The Attorney-General has referred - to the positions which we are discussing .coming under the head of educational and Sir John Forrest. instructional, but there are many of them, such as those of commandants and staff officers, which do not come wholly under that head. There is on record a resolution of the House to the effect that no military force shall be created in this country other than that required for instructional and similar services, and, of course, the great bulk of our force will consist of ordinary citizens. While I do not wish to do anything to lessen the standard of efficiency among officers, I do not wish to prevent those who have performed their duty faithfully and well, and, perhaps, have fought in the battles of their country, from being promoted to the highest positions if qualified for them. If the majority of our forces were composed almost wholly of permanent men the position would be different ; but seeing that we are creating a Citizen Eorce, we should be careful to do Acts nothing to lessen the self-respect and imany memportance of its members. Therefore, I advise the Minister to leave out this proqualivision, which in any case cannot long continue in force, because the tens of thouit I sands of citizen soldiers, when they find be that they are debarred from promotion to the highest ranks, will demand its repeal. A similar rule created a great deal of difficulty in 1903, and our experience then will",35
183,Mr FINLAYSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Brisbane) [3.26] I apThere was sound sense in the statement attributed to a great general, that every those soldier carries a marshal's baton in his The Australian Army should other be modelled on that idea. The provision be under discussion would practically prevent all but those who pass through the Military for College from receiving appointments as officers, and the number of students at the College would of necessity be limited. That will impose a limitation on our selection of officers, and those who will have the honour of training our army will be, for the most part, quite young men. My opinion is that those most capable of trainmust ing others are the men who have had exonly perience. I am not convinced that mere to theoretical knowledge will make up for practical experience in warfare, which is a necessary qualification for an instructional officer. I am aware that provision is made for sending abroad a certain number of our upon military students to gain information in deother countries^ but they will have no opportunity to take part in actual warfare. as We are really depriving ourselves of the advantages which are to be gained by accepting the services of men of ability, knowledge, and practical experience. A young man with whom I am acquainted, who has had a good deal of experience in the Canadian and British armies, was not accepted as an instructional officer because he was over age. There are in the Old Country a number of men of experience who would be willing to come here, and would prove good citizens, and it would be to our advantage to use their military experience in training our forces. should not depend - wholly on young men possessing merely theoretical knowledge, but should have also men who know what it is to lead others on to the field of battle. We have in our midst a large number of most, estimable German immigrants-me n who have been trained from their youth in the use of arms. Some of our best agriculturists come from the German Empire; yet under this provision we absolutely debar ourselves, from making any use of their military knowledge. The same remark will apply to citizens of Australia who have served in the British Arm}'; or in the armies of France or Switzerland, each having been subjected to a particular system of military discipline and training. It is just such a combination of the best features of all-systems that we want to adopt. The clause as it stands, however, would prohibit us from taking advantage of the experience of these men. 1 suggest to the honourable member for Adelaide that he might favourably consider such an amendment as thisProvided further that should necessity arise candidates over the prescribed age may qualify for commissions as officers of the Permanent Forces by passing the examination tests of the Military College.",36
184,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,At the first glance it seems to me that the necessity would never arise.,37
185,Mr FINLAYSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I shall explain why I suggest the use of the words "" should necessity arise."" It has, unfortunately, to be admitted that many of the reverses with which the British met in South Africa were due, not to lack of bravery or ability on the part of the men, but to. a decided want of ability on the part of officers. The British Army was notoriously under-officered, and men who were notoriously incapable, since they had not had sufficient training, received commissions. to no one in my admiration for the British soldier. ""Tommy Atkins"" cannot be equalled, but I do not know that the same' can be said of the British officer. It may he necessary for us to appoint more officers than can be passed through the Military College. What guarantee have we that five years hence we shall have a sufficient supply of capable officers who have passed through the Military College to train the Military Forces of Australia? We have no provision in this Bill to enable us to meet such an emergency. The honourable member for Maribyrnong made a good point which he might well have emphasized. Young men will enter the Military. College We at an age at which they will scarcely have made up their minds as to what their profession is going to be. They will have a sort of general idea that they will better themselves by adopting a military career; but probably, in many cases, having completed their course, tiiey will decide to abandon that career. There is a very serious possibility ot our having a great dearth of properly trained and qualified officers. I therefore wish to make it easy in such an emergency tb secure other men of experience and ability by making eligible for commissions in the Permanent Forces those who have passed a prescribed test. Under the clause as it stands, we shall be unable to take advantage of the wide and practical knowledge of men who have served in the forces ot other countries, ancl have liad an experience that must make for the development of the best type of citizen soldiers. I urge the Acting Prime Minister, therefore, to no amend the clause as to make it possible tor us to have such officers in our Permanent Forces.",37
186,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3-35]-- would direct the attention of 1 honourable members to the suggestion made by my honourable friend, and to the difficulties of so framing a measure as to meet the various propositions that are put forward. The honourable member for Brisbane, a native of Scotland- a citizen of. the British Empire-put s forward as a serious - proposition the suggestion that we should staff our Australian army with Germans and other foreigners. The Germans are entitled to the highest possible respect, but such an ideal as that which the honourable member has expressed is by no means that which I entertain. Then we are also to accept French officers, and, if we are stuck up, I suppose, we can give commissions to Japanese, because they have T vielrl had the most recent experience, and have been more successful of late than have the people of any other nationality. We arealso to take' some of the honourable mem-, ber's friends who have been in the British and Canadian armies. And so we go on tioin one stage to another till we are to have a bewildering variety of officersthe Japanese with their "" Banzai,"" the Germans with their "" Hoch,"" and Frenchmen with their "" E n avant."" I would remind the Committee that we are dealing with an Australian army, that it should be manned by Australians, and that this is an attempt to staff the. Australian army by Australians. If . Australians are not fit to instruct Australians, let us say so at once. Directly a suggestion is made - that we should import an officer there is a. wild hullaballoo. We are told at once that we have amongst our own people men fit for the work; yet, as soon as we propose to officer our troops with Australians, we are told that we should make provision for the appointment of Germans, Japanese, and others. I have been as much imbued with the military spirit as has any one; but this is militarism run mad. My honourable friend calmly proposes to turn down the Australian because he has not had an experience of war. What, then, are we to do? Are we to plunge into a dark and bloody struggle, the result of which no one can determine, in order to furnish experience for our Australian Citizen Forces? Not at all. We are proposing to do the best we can in the circumstances ; and whether it is in sport or in economic fields, or elsewhere, the Australian can always hold his own. I come now to the amendment. It is proposed to create this College to educate, not the men who are going to fight, nor the men who are going to lead our troops into battle, but the schoolmasters of the army. ASK any one who has been a school teacher what sort of a chance there is in that profession for a man who has brains, but no training. What chance can he have, unless he has been through the pedagogic mill ? A man who has not cannot teach. The school teacher has to be trained, just as the man who wishes to follow any other profession. The Minister is willing to consider the suggestion that the age at which a person shall be allowed to enter the College shall be raised; but for five years the whole world, is ours. If there be any undiscovered pearls of military wisdom on the beach, let any beachcomber here gather them in. For five years he may do that, and I should have no hesitation in extending the period to seven years, so that we may have ample time to stimulate our poor lethargic Australian intellects up to the desired supreme Mr Hughes. tary height. I hope, however; that honourable members will have faith in their own countrymen. During the Boer War many honourable members who are now asking that we should go outside and obtain experienced men, had not a good word to say for those who went to South Africa. The suggestion now is, however, that we should avail ourselves of those who have had actual experience of war. What were our troops supposed to be doing during the Boer War? Spearing",37
187,Mr ANSTEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Poultr y !,38
188,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Yes , according to some people, poultry. These men are now to be elevated and appointed to teach us the noble art of war. For my part, I believe that this is a serious business. Lord Kitchener, who has had more experience of actual war than any one here I hope will ever have, says that the way to train men to make our army is that which we propose, and I am in favour of following his recommendation concerning a - matter about which I , happily, know nothing.",38
189,Mr RILEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"South' Sydney) [3.42] It was interesting to follow' the Acting Prime Minister as he travelled all round the clause, but I would point out that he failed to touch the Bill itself. This clause provides for instructors, and, under it, a man above a certain age who desires to enter the College to learn the art of instructing other men will be debarred from becoming an officer of our Permanent. Forces. In other words, no man may enter the College after he has passed the age of nineteen years. Some of the best of. pur. officers might come from the instructional staff, and I think that we should so amend the clause that an instructor who may desire, after a few years, to become an officer of the Permanent Forces, shall have an opportunity to do so. We should provide for the examination of such men after they have passed the age of nineteen years. The Acting Prime Minister has talked of the Germans, the Japanese, and the French, but we have to deal with the clause as it stands. My contention is that we should have the widest possible choice, and I would, therefore, broaden the clause so as to allow instructors to submit themselves to an examination for a commission in the army after they have passed the age of nineteen years.",38
190,Mr MATHEWS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Melbourne Ports) [3-45]-- I a m rather afraid that the Attorney-General does not grasp what it .is miliwe wish to alter. I listened with envy to the honourable gentleman when he was ablest abusing the honourable member for Bristermination bane, because I believe a good deal of what he said. We desire Australians, and not foreigners, in this business; but other phases of the question present themselves to me. First of all, this College, apsomething parently, is to be an institution for training of a sort of glorified sergeantsmajor or drill instructors. Does the torney-General mean to say that no'man that College will ever be able to rise higher than the rank of an instructor-that, ' for instance, the position of commanding officer will not be open to him?",38
191,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The men in the College clause will, of course, rise to a high rank in the instructional staff.",39
192,Mr MATHEWS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"My desire would be to see the age raised to at least thirty. Beyond that it would be inexpedient to because we know that, if a man has not obtained his captaincy at forty-five or fifty, he is not likely to rise in the future. desire, however, is to see this College open to men who, while learning soldiering in the militia, are determined to study the of war outside the College. Many men now in the learned professions acquired necessary knowledge long after the age which men usually go to college. In the past, there have always been openings the army for such men, and there are in England and elsewhere; and I do not see why we should not follow the example in this respect of ultra-conservative countries. In the Mother Country there is a means by which men may be promoted from the ranks, apart from those provided by exhibitions of gallantry in the field. a man in the militia shows that he an examination with tliose who are in the College, why not allow him to do so?",39
193,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"He may for the next five years, but after that there militia.",39
194,Mr MATHEWS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"But there will be capable men in similar positions after five years. I admit that the Acting Prime Minister is somewhat in a difficulty, as, presenting his Bill, he is representing Minister of Defence in another place. Acting Prime Minister, however, must forget that the Minister of Defence is ting in his Department surrounded by men who are determined that nobody shallcome in from the outside ancl take the positions for which those men think they are the chosen people. In Australia today there is only one promoted man who is really ranker; and, although he is one of the men ih the force, there seems a dethat he shall not "" get on."" Those military officers are reared in an atmosphere peculiar to themselves, and they desire to make the profession a close association. I ask the Attorney-General to do to relieve the position, and, to the lhat end, to extend the age to thirty.",39
195,Mr MASSYGREENE,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Richmond) [3.50] AtThere seems to be a good deal of misconin ception in the minds of honourable members regarding this clause. In the first place, the clause proposes no limit of age.",39
196,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The regulations do.,39
197,Mr MASSYGREENE,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I know; but all the provides is that any one rising to the position of officer in the Permanent Forces must be a graduate of the College. War is becoming more and more a science; and there is absolute necessity to have highlygo, trained men in command, and in the position of instructional officers. I have not seen the regulation, but I understand it My to state that boys must enter the College for the purpose of going through the whole curriculum between the ages of fifteen and art - nineteen. When the whole course is really educational from beginning to end, it the is essential, as a general rule, that at men should start their training young, so that they may be thoroughly grounded in in their profession. I have no wish now to see a military caste grow up in Australia, and I can perfectly understand the grounds that some honourable members .are taking, when they see, or think they see, in .this clause something which debars those who have had no opportunity between the ages named to enter the College from If rising. But do the regulations bar such incan pass dividuals? I do not think so.",39
198,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The Minister who framed the regulation thinks so; he framed will be no if for that purpose.,39
199,Mr MASSYGREENE,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Perhaps I had better say that I clo not see why the Minister the need pass a regulation for that purpose. It is - perfectly right that fhis regulation in sbould be passed, but there is nothing in it the to debar anybody, at any serviceable age, The from graduating-that is, sitting for exnot amination and graduating from the Colsitlege-withou t actually being a resident giaduate. It is quite right that, inasmuch as officers have to be trained up from youth, those who are residing at the College should consist wholly and solely of young men; but there should be, ancl there a is, nothing to debar any citizen who is willing to graduate from the College from doing so on passing the necessary examination. I see every reason why we should not throw open the College doors to anybody or everybody as residents ; all who have had experience of colleges and boarding schools know that there are very grave reasons why that should not be done. As a general rule, it will be found that very few will be able to graduate in later .years; at the same time, there is no necessity to debar them. The clause as it stands should, I think, remain, and it then becomes simply a matter of the regulations, which honourable members will have an opportunity of considering when they are submitted. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent anybody from becoming an officer; all it provides is that they shall be graduates from the College, so far as regards the instructional and permanent staff. We all understand that iany citizen may become an officer of the Citizen Forces, and all that is provided in the clause is that no one shall become a member of the instructional qr permanent staff who is not a graduate of the College.",39
200,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Capricornia) [3.56] - I move That the following word's be added to the clause :- "" Students of any age not exceeding thirty years may, on passing the prescribed petitive examination, obtain admission to the Military College.""",40
201,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,There is no prescribed examination for entering.,40
202,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I have here the regulations which show that, before a person can enter the College, he must pass an examination that is not very simple; and in that examination we have the obstacle. Mr ROBERTS. - There is nothing in that examination be)'ond the average boy of sixteen at the present standard of education.",40
203,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"But a young man of from' twenty to twenty-two, whose parents could not afford to send him to school, and who has to' work for his living, may desjre, and be competent, to lead a military life, but, under the regulation, he is debarred from offering himself for the examination simply because he is over nineteen. It is a fine old Tory argument on the part of the Attorney-General to declare "" We must not open the door."" It is a pity that there are not honourable members in the House capable of heaping on the Attorney-General vituperation of the character that he heaped on the honourable member for Brisbane. Vituperation is all very well, but",40
204,The CHAIRMAN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Will the honourable member deal with the clause?,40
205,Mr HIGGS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The Attorney-General dealt with the honourable member for Brisbane in a very severe and uncalled-for manner, entirely evading the point that we are about to create a military caste of the worse description. There can be no other result if we provide that only the sons of rich people shall be officers in the Australian Army. This is to be a Citizen Army, which means an army composed of the mech anics, labourers, architects, builders, and others, who play their parts in the economy of the Commonwealth. If only people whose parents can afford to send them to school so as to enable them to pass the examination prior to the age of nineteen are to be the officers in the Permanent Forces, we shall have a good many gilded youths ordering the mechanics of the Commonwealth about. That is wrong. I submit to honourable members, most of whom have gained their education and experience in the university of the world, that young men who go straight from the schools into the Military College, will not get the experience necessary to qualify them to treat the citizen soldiers properly. What happens in Germany ? Some time ago we read in the cables of a German officer actually runcomning hissword through a soldier because the soldier refused to salute him. We want as permanent officers of our Commonwealth Forces men who have an everyday experience of the world. It will do these, young men good to have amongst them men even of thirty years of age who have worked outside amongst the populace, and can give them a true sense of what is due to the citizens of the Commonwealth.",40
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Parramatta). [4-3]-- I am afraid the honourable member for Richmond is not quite accurate when he states that the intention of the scheme is that any officer may pass the graduating examination whether he has been to the College or not. The clear intention of the Kitchener scheme is that the candidates should all be taken young, kept at the College, and put through it. Lord Kitchener recommendsCandidates should be selected from the most capable of the Senior Cadets, each area officer submitting the name of his best cadet to the major in charge of ten areas, who will then examine these ten cadets and forward five names through the district headquarters, who will state their recommendations, if any, to the central administration. The latter will then select from the names received double the number required, and will refer the ultimate selection from these last to an authority to be determined by Government. Although entrance to the College is being made free, it is not to be altogether petitive. There is first of all a selection of those who may be permitted to compete and so the honourable member for Melthe bourne Ports is quite right in saying that this scheme rules out the ordinary ranker from commissions in the Permanent Forces. It is intended to do so, and it is of no to try to bluff the House into believing anything else. The method of selection, the age at which they are to be selected, and the prohibition proposed in this provitake sion, are all in terms of the Kitchener commendations, which are that the special 'Staff Corps charged vvith the instruction the Army shall be caught young, and trained scientifically and thoroughly on the model of the West Point C°H g United States. That means residence at the College, under such conditions as persent haps we shall never be able to obtain here. an The curriculum at West Point is so severe that they have on the average one instructor for every four cadets. I suppose no other place in the world where money is lavished to the same extent on a Military College. The idea is that you shall get the cadet when he is young, into the College, after he has been carefully selected by the area officer. A selection is first made of the few who shall be mitted to compete. Only one in every 500 future. will be selected, and the selection will be made first of all by the officer in mand of the area. His recommendation to be submitted to the major, who submits it in turn to the local head-quarters, and officers there, after sifting the matter, it on in turn to the authorities of the tary College, or some other body selected by the Government. It is provided those few selected cadets shall then pete for entrance into the College.",40

I do not know how it is to be got over. The more I look at it the more it seems to create a difficulty, because "" officer"" in section 22 of the Act is certainly wider it than "" permanent officer"" in new section 148 of the Bill. I believe, however, fhat we can deal with all these special cases later on, and if ever a war comes about, and men distinguish themselves in it. this Paran liament will, I hope, always be here to see that justice is done io them,, although' I am afraid a full measure of justice was not done to some of the most brilliant officers Honourable who went to the Boer War. I have stood in this House for some who did good work there and received very scant treatonly ment upon their return. However, we must always rely upon Parliament to do justice in these emergent circumstances. On the whole, the Kitchener scheme is good, and if it is a little too rigid for our Australian requirements, we must remember that it aims at efficiency first and foremost.",41
219,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Adelaide) [4-12] The more we discuss the matter, the more we see of the Bill, and the more we hear of the regulations and of the Ministerial trend of mind, the more clear does it become that we are about to create a military caste so far as the officers of the Permanent Forces are concerned. The Minister suggested in his mildest manner that we should leave it to the Government in the future to say what the regulations should be, and depend upon their promise to look into the subject. If we do that we sha]l be depending upon a very slender thread indeed, because the moment the Attorney-General"" was put into a corner his vehemence almost overwhelmed us, and his language became positively sanguinary. That is a clear indication that the Ministerial mind does not tend in the direction of making any amendment or improvement of the - regulations respecting the College. As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports pointed out, while we have an exceptionally capable Minister of Defence, one of the most capable and painstaking that we have ever had, according to the statements of military officers inside and outside the service, we must remember that he lacks even the smallest degree of practical knowledge of things military, and is to a large extent in the hands of officers. There is now in the Defence Department a caste. Among the officers who are advising the Minister in this direction there are a number who look with horror on the prospect' of any ordinary citizen coming into their - ranks, or in any way interfering with their privileges. The whole tendency is to keep the ranker down in the ranks, and to keep commissions for a particular class of the community. Lord Kitchener's first proposal was that a premium of £ 8 0 should be paid for entry into the College, and that the boy's parents, should keephim while he was there. This clearly indicated that in Lord Kitchener's opinion only a small section of the community, irrespective of ability, should ever be allowed entry into the College.",42

221,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"That is so now, but when Lord Kitchener is quoted as an authority on the question of officers for the Australian Forces, we should remember the effect of his recommendations on this subject. Of course, he brought with him the ideas of older parts of the world, where officers are drawn from a certain class, and in some Gases are given commissions with almost a disregard for their qualifications and adaptability. We propose to ignore the recommendation of Lord Kitchener, and to throw the College open to all, providing for the keep of the students during the whole of their term. But it is proposed to have a selection.",42

The honourable member for Richmond suggests that persons may be allowed to graduate without residing in the College, but that is not the intention of the Government or its advisers. Persons will not be able to graduate from the College unless they have entered it after passing a competitive examination before attaining the age of nineteen years, and have resided there for the whole of their term.",42
227,Mr MASSYGREENE,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"-As a general rule, residence should be insisted on.",42
228,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"If the honourable member says that one condition should be insisted upon, and proposes another, he is not on firm ground. My objection to the regulations is that certain persons will be unable to graduate from the College. No one dares say that he desires the creation of a military caste, or that officers should be drawn from any particular class of society; but, under the regulations, person* who have proved their merit will be debarred from promotion, because no one who is not a graduate of the College will be able to enter the Permanent Forces as a commissioned officer. That provision largely nullifies section 22 of the Act of last year, which empowers the Governor General to appoint any person to be an officer, and to promote an officer for distinguished service, or marked ability, or gallantry on active service - Appointments for distinguished service and gallantry, like kissing, go by favour. Distinguished service may be rendered, and no notice may be taken of it, while a trifling service rendered by a favourite may lead to the pinning of' decorations on his manly and heaving breast, so that he becomes the darling of the gods and of the girls.",42
229,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"My honourable friend means that men may serve their country well, without being decorated?",43
230,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Yes . Many of those who have been decorated will admit in private that they did not deserve the distinction given to them. The regulations will prevent capable men from proving their qualification to serve as officers. We hear a great deal about war becoming more and more a science; but, under this scheme, all the fighting is to be done by the citizen - soldiery and officers, while the brilliant, scientific men will be kept at home.",43
231,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The university professor who teaches law or medicine does not go out into the world to practise. That is left to the students who.have been trained by him.,43
232,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I am aware that professors do not leave the universities unless they can get better billets, just as a minister does not leave his church unless he receives a call to a better one. A man who is qualified to command in actual warfare should be permitted to enter the College if he wishes to do so.",43
233,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"We are creating a Citizen Defence Force, not a military system.",43
234,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"But we need not debar capable men from obtaining promotion. Under the system provided for, all who do not go through the Military College, which must be entered before a man reaches the age of nineteen years, will be debarred from promotion as officers. Obviously, if the Minister is left to deal with the matter by regulation, our suggestions will be put on one side. I know, from personal knowledge, that on the instructional staff there are commissioned officers receiving from £300 to £450 a year who, so far as knowledge, teaching ability,-education, and general capacity are concerned, are not equal to many of the non-commissioned officers on the staff, who receive from ^170 to £200 a year.",43
235,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Hav e not these commissioned officers obtained their positions in the way n which the honourable member wishes ; it to be possible for men to obtain promotion under our new system, namely, by influence, and not by proving their merit by passing competitive examinations ?",43
236,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I do not know how they obtained their positions, if it were not by undue influence; but I have never raised any objection to the competitive system, nor do I object to compelling those who wish to become officers to graduate at the Military College. But I object to a rule preventing persons from graduating, no matter what their ability, because they are over the age of nineteen years. Why should a man who is a ranker remain a ranker for life?",43
237,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member would have to draw, the line somewhere, and exclude some men from the chance of becoming officers. I have already said that the Minister is willing to favourably consider a suggestion for increasing the age at which men may enter the .Military College.",43
238,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I might accept the promise if this were my first session; but 1I have a thousand times heard Ministers promise to favourably consider suggestions, and do nothing to give effect to them. I do not wish to speak disrespectfully of the present Ministers. Every Minister has, at some time or other, used the words, "" We will favourably consider your proposal if you let the Bill pass.""",43
239,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I wish the honourable member would let us get to a division.,43
240,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"This is an exceedingly important matter, ancl the vehemence of the Minister in combating our view was of such a character as to lead me to think that this promise of favourable consideration will not be of much advantage to us. I therefore propose to add a further proviso. I do not favour the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Capricornia, but that which I shall propose will enable - persons with military leanings who have served, say, three years in the Forces, and have had time to obtain a settled conviction as to what vocation they would like to follow, to submit themselves to any entry test to which the Minister may choose to submit them before they have reached the age of twenty-seven years, and, on passing it, to enter the Military College, and to graduate therefrom. A smart non-commissioned officer who had served four or five years in the Forces, and had found that the vocation was one that suited him, might desire to submit himself for an examination",43
241,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member does not use the words "" a prescribed examination"" in the amendment which he proposes to move.",44
242,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Provisio n js already made in that respect, and such words are unnecessary. My amendment would afford such persons as those to whom I have referred an opportunity not to be pushed into the commissioned ranks, but, on passing a prescribed examination, to enter the Military College,' and to graduate therefrom.",44
243,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Wentworth) [4-33]-honourable member is not quite fair to the Acting Prime Minister. He ought to remember that the honourable gentleman cannot be expected to know intimately everything that is in the mind of the Minister of Defence; but the basis of his attack has been the Ministerial intention, whatever it may be, with regard to future regulations. I have realized in the course of this debate that the Acting Prime Minister, nobly as he is transacting his duty in the Chamber, is not, and cannot be expected to be, in such close touch with the Minister of Defence as his colleague who acts for the Minister in this House. Last night, for instance, we held combat on the subject' of whether uniforms should be provided for riflemen, and the project was scouted by the official head of the Government. That important matter had been definitely decided by the responsible Minister, but the Attorney-General was absolutely without information last night, and induced his colleagues to support him in an untenable position.",44
244,The CHAIRMAN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The honourable the member must not discuss that matter.,44
245,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Complain t has been made that the Acting Prime Minister indulged in vituperation against the unoffendprovision ing member for Brisbane. I did not hear any vicious attack upon the honourable memtho Forces. ber for Brisbane, or the honourable member for Capricornia; nor did I hear a whisper on his part against the reputation of the honourable member for - Adelaide. Why, then, this attack on the Acting Prime Minister, who is doing his best to struggle with a measure which possibly, owing to his having his hands full in other directions, he does not fully understand? Perhaps it would be better to ascertain from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, at question time, exactly what is proposed with regard to the Military College, and the point as to the extension of the age of entry to thirty years. It seems to me that whether the age limit be fixed at thirty, forty, or nineteen years, the younger, a man is - on entering the College, the better he must be equipped in competition with his fellows. Those who have had to study for competitive examinations late in life know that it is infinitely more difficult for a man, no matter what his intrinsic ability may be, to acquire new kinds of knowledge, than it is for a youth under the age of The twenty-one years to do so. Whatever age we may arbitrarily fix, nature will defeat us. Let me give honourable members an instance of what I mean. The right honourable gentleman who formerly represented East Sydney, and every one will admit his ability, told me once what a trouble his Bar examinations were to him when he entered upon them at the age of about thirty years. His difficulties were infinitely more than they would have been in the case of a man with so much ability had he started his studies ten years earlier in life. A man does not require great ability to pass an examination such as that set out if he starts upon his studies at an early age. There are periods when a man can readily acquire book knowledge, and other periods when a man finds it most difficult to direct his brain into new channels.",44
246,Mr WEBSTER,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Is the practical knowledge of no consideration?,44
247,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Certainl y it is, and I have already suggested that section 22 of the principal Act gives power to raise to commissioned rank any person in the Permanent Forces who shows his capacity.",44
248,Mr WEBSTER,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,It does not.,44
249,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Then I should like that to be extended to the Permanent Forces. I understood that it governed all,44
250,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"It would be better to omit it altogether. It is, after all, only a professional question of favouritism.",44
251,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Accordin g to the honourable member's jaundiced view, everything is a question of favouritism. We must have a system of advancement by merit, and risk favouritism; otherwise, we shall have a dry-rot setting in. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will consider seriously the representations that have been made to him. I do not think that he will do any good for those who urge the case of men who might wish to enter the College later in life by accepting the amendment. But some means should be adopted whereby a man in the Permanent Forces who has shown in a marked degree his practical fitness for promotion to commissioned rank will have an opportunity to secure that promotion without having to pass a theoretical examination too late in life. The extension of the age limit to thirty years will be a mere mockery to men who, too late in life, have to face the big difficulties of a series of examinations such as those set forth.",44
252,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member has done nothing but waste time in dealing with this matter, which, according to him, is the most important that could engage the attention of the Legislature. From the time he started, he has done nothing but act the fool.",45
253,The CHAIRMAN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The_ honourable member is not in order hi accusing an honourable member of "" acting the fool."" He must withdraw the expression.",45

257,Mr KELLY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I shall make no further reference to the honourable gentleman's temper; it is sufficiently apparent.

258,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [4.56] - Honourable members will be aware that during the last session of last Parliament, the question of Tariff anomalies was not only mentioned by more than one honourable member, but brought up by way of motion, and it was also one of the questions which came to the front during the election campaign. When I administered the Customs Department on a previous occasion, and during my present term of office-and also during the. any term of office of my predecessor, the honourable member for Kooyong-ther e were many deputations with the object of rectifying various .anomalies which have arisen under the Tariff. I have prepared a schedule of these anomalies; and, after submitting it to the Committee, will, before I sit down, move that it take the place, so far as it goes, of the Tariff which has been in operation until today. Many honourable members, I have no doubt, will be disappointed because particular items in which they are, perhaps,, interested, are not included. I may say at the outset, however, that this rectification of anomalies is not regarded by the Cabinet as Tariff revision; and it has been decided that there shall be no revision until after the referendum on the question of the extension of the industrial powers of the Commonwealth. If isthought that in the past the workers in both protected and unprotected industries, but particularly in the protected industries, have not had their fair share of the general benefits of Protection. Other Governments promisedand we must presume they intended to carry out their promise-to introduce a system of new Protection; and the present Government have introduced and carried Bills asking the people for increased powers to enable the workers to obtain their fair share of benefit under the settled policy of the country. It will be realized that the character of the revision must be largely influenced by the result of the referendum. It is not suggested that all employers are alike either in protected or unprotected industries. It is admitted that many of the workers have received fair treatment, but it is also acknowledged that many have not. When a deputation waited on me, in, I think, May of this year, and asked for a complete revision of the Tariff, I declined to support the request; and I take full responsibility for what I then said, having no desire to take shelter behind any action of the Cabinet. I represent, I think, one of the strongest Protectionist electorates in the Commonwealth; and I told the deputation that, until the workers were assured of their share of the benefits, it was not proposed to' revise the Tariff. I quoted to that deputation, as I could this afternoon if I so desired, case after case in which the employers had received practically a monopoly of the Australian market, and had not given the employees their share of the Protection. That is the reason why the Ministry decided not to re-open the whole Tariff until the people of Australia had had an opportunity of pronouncMr Tudor. ing upon what is known as the new Protection scheme, as involved in the proposal to amend the Constitution by giving increased industrial powers to the Commonwealth.",45
259,Mr SAMPSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Can the honourable member say what profits those mar.ufactureis have been making?,46
260,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I do not know, nor do I intend to single out any industry, although it would be fairly easy to single out some. I have in my mind at present one in which those engaged are able to sell in Australia every ton of the particular article they produce, and they have not been noted for fair treatment of their employees.",46
261,Sir JOHN QPICK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Do not the Wages Boards deal with those cases?,46
262,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"No , there are no Wages Boards in some of our industries.",46
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The Wages Boards cannot deal with the new Protection proposed by the Government. They go further than the Wages Boards.,46
264,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I hope we shall do as good work as the Wages Boards have done, and be able to do even better.",46
265,Mr GROOM,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"When the honourable member says that, has he any specific legislation in view? ' Mr TUDOR - No , I was simply replying to an interjection by the honourable member for Parramatta. After each Tariff revision anomalies have been found to exist. The first Tariff took over eleven months to"" settle, after a very strenuous session. It was not finished until October, 1902, and the work was hardly completed before there was an outcry that anomalies existed, because sufficient Protection was not given to some industries. Again, in 1907-8 the Tariff had hardly been revised before anomalies were discovered.",46
266,Mr FENTON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,And many injustices.,46
267,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I believe so, and I have not the slightest doubt that many honourable members will be disappointed when they see the schedule.",46
268,Mr FENTON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I hope the Minister has put a very liberal interpretation upon the word "" anomaly:'*",46
269,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I ""have not. There is to be no Tariff revision until after the referendum has been taken. One honourable member may think that half-a-dozen items in which he is interested have a claim to be dealt with at once, and independently of Tariff revision; but if each of the seventy-five honourable members of this House were to pick out one or two items for revision before the referendum is taken, I would not give much for the chance of the referendum being carried.",46
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Does the Minister say that there will be no Tariff revision if the referenda fail?,47
271,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I have not said so; bur the result of the referenda will influence the Cabinet as to how the Tariff is to be revised. I believe the bulk bf the people of Australia are Protectionists, because they believe that the conditions existing in Australia are superior to those existing in the countries which compete with us by sending their goods here. That is why this Parliament has placed ad valorem, or fixed - duties, upon a number-of articles; and it is to insure the workers their share of that increased Protection that the Cabinet have arrived at the decision that there shall not be any Tariff revision before the referenda, although the anomalies in existence shall be, as far as possible, rectified.  the free list articles which are manufactured in Australia. That is an anomaly.",47
272,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"It is not. I admit that there are on the free list articles manufacr tured in Australia, but that is more a matter to be dealt with in a revision of the Tariff. A deputation from Queensland which waited upon me the other day suggested a very simple method of'dealing with "" anomalies "" in the Tariff. They pointed out that, as there was a duty of only is. per central-upon bananas, and a duty of 2s. per central on other green fruits, we should bring the duty on bananas up to the higher level. I said that if we did the same thing with the apparel and iron duties, wcwould make a very sweeping change, and that if the deputation considered that that was a rectification of anomalies, and not Tariff revision, I . could not agree with them. That is why we have not dealt with any items which the Cabinet consider to involve Tariff revision. The list which I intend to move will, it is trusted, remove the diffiof making it here ourselves. culties which the Department experience in determining under what item certain articles come.",47
273,Mr DEAKIN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Then it is purely a departmental revision?,47
274,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"It is - practically a departmental revision, for the purpose of making the interpretation of the Tariff better and clearer. In one or two instances we have increased the rate of duty upon articles, thereby increasing the amount of protection in those instances, but the reason of that is as follows:-We have been reclassifying ""some of the articles, particularly with regard to the paper duties, which I am sure my predecessor, in office will admit are the most difficult in the Tariff to interpret. For clearness, some lines which were wrongly in the free list before have had to be made dutiable. That has made the raw material of some Australian manufacturers dutiable, and, therefore, we have had in one or two cases to increase the rates of duty on the lines produced by those manufacturers in order to compensate for the increase in duty on the raw material.",47
275,Mr THOMAS BROWN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Is that to meet the case in Sydney?,47
276,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"That is one of the cases that will be dealt with-in relation to the cardboard box industry, and so on.",47
277,Mr THOMAS BROWN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Is it proposed to increase the duty on cardboard? on Mr TUDOR - Yes ; but I shall deal with that item when we come, to it. When we are considering the matter of Tariff revision we should keep in view the necessity of utilizing as far as possible the raw material available in Australia, and also of turning out an article which gives employment to the greatest amount of labour under the best possible conditions,. I do not agree with the statement that has been made in this House, that there are some industries that are not worth protecting, because I believe that every industry is worth protecting, but 1 think that some are more worth protecting than others, and they should receive from the House in any Tariff revision a greater amount of consideration. We should endeavour, as far as possible, not to partly finish an article in Australia, but to turn out a completed article. An illustration was recently given in the debate on the oil bounty question, when it was shown that we were turning out raw material, sending it away, and importing the finished product again, instead When we do tackle the work of Tariff revision 'we should not allow any process of that sort to take place. We should utilize our own raw material and turn out the finished orable members are now being supplied That Schedule A. to the Customs Tariff' 190$ be the seventeenth day of N ovember One tnousand nine pursuance of the Customs Tariff as so amended. 4.

When the last Tariff was passed it contained, in item 123D, a reference to "" boxed robes."" I think there were at least half-a-dozen deputations to the Department 4 asking that that term should be defined. Finally, the importers waited on me when I was Minister, about two years ago, and asked that they might be made dutiable at the rate of other made-up apparel. It was felt at the time by the departmental officers that to do that would be to strain the law, but it was done, nevertheless, and has been the practice of the Department for the last eighteen months, so far as specially prepared parts of boxed robes were concerned. The alteration will cover also material cut to shape and cut into lengths for apparel. It has been found practically impossible for either the departmental officers or importers to distinguish between ribbons, galloons, laces, The amended braids, gimps and trimmings, and we have been asked to deal with them all alike. To provide for this it is proposed to amend items 12 3D and 134A and B ; this alteraThe question of tion will save a great deal of trouble and expense, and secure uniformity. This is dimcult even at the principal ports, but it is found in practice that elsewhere officers occasionally admit goods at lower rates than those charged elsewhere, not with any wrong object, but because they do not understand the intention of Parliament as interpreted by the head ofiice. Therefore we wish to make the wording of the Tariff . as clear as possible.",52
282,Sir JOHN QUICK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Is there to be a ing or a lowering of duties?,53
283,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The amendment to 25 which I have just referred is merely to rid of difficulty in administration, but one or two instances, with which I have dealt, rates have been increased, while others, to which I shall refer, they been decreased. VVe propose an amendbe ment tespecting malleable iron castings making them dutiable at if d . per lb. At present they are dutiable at 25 and 20 per a decrease. cent., according to the kind of machine for which they are intended. But Parliaduction ment, in dealing specially vesters, made castings for such machines dutiable at if d . per lb., and some unscrupulous importers have been introducing at the lower rates castings really intended for stripper-harvesters but imported nominHonorable ally for chaff-cutters or other agricultural machines.",53
284,Mr THOMAS BROWN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"There are castings for farm implements which cannot be used for stripper-harvesters. - Mr TUDOR - Yes ; but I am informed that a great deal of trouble will be avoided by making the duty uniform, and the rate will be only slightly increased.  new duty be per cent, ad valorem?",53
285,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"It will vary with the cost of the castings. We propose to amend item 178D to give effect to the original tention of item 172, which makes all work and gun-metal work used in general engineering and plumbing and other trader, dutiable at 30 and 25 per cent, according to the country of origin. Electrical and gas appliances, n.e.i., are dutiable at and io per cent., and it has been covered that brass-work used for plumbing which should pay the higher rate has been introduced as gas appliances, n.e.i. come now to a case in which a reduction duty is proposed. Under item 200, patent steel droppers of all lengths are dutiable at 17\ and 12 per cent., according country of origin; while under item 217, - steel fencing standards of all lengths, pillars and patent wedgers for droppers and standards, are dutiable at 5 per cent, or free, according to country of origin. We propose to make rolled iron and steel, as prescribed by departmental by-laws, for use in the manufacture of droppers and of standards and pillars, free. The proposed exemption of raw material under each item is intended to overcome the anomaly that such raw material, although somewhat similar to bar and rod iron, cannot be adraismitted as such, and must be charged as manufactures of metal at 30 per cent, or per cent., while the finished dropper or get standard is admitted at the rates I have in given. The proposal to increase the duties on standards and pillars is necessitated by in the fact that droppers and standards are have very much alike, and that standards may imported extra long at 5 per cent, or by free, and made into droppers at one cut.",53
286,Sir JOHN FORREST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,There seems to be,53
287,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"We are proposing a rewith stripper-harcerned bysomaking far as the droppers are confree the raw material, rod iron and steel, which is at present dutiable. The raw material is to be free, and the other two items are to be uniform. members will recognise that the duty fixed for standards should also apply to droppers.",53
288,Dr CARTY SALMON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Is there any reason for putting up the duty on patent ivedgers ?,53
289,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I think that the reason is precisely that which I have just given.,53
290,Dr CARTY SALMON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"But they cannot be cut in two. will the Mr TUDOR - I shall be prepared to consider in the light of the information at my disposal any request for a lower, duty, which honourable members may think desirinable, in regard to this fencing material, brass which cannot be made in Australia; but honourable members will recognise that since there are no less than 450 items in the Tariff, some of which embrace thirty or forty sub-items, it is practically impossible 17J for me to have at my fingers' ends full indisformation relating to every detail. The next item to which I desire to draw attention is item 230, which it is proposed to I . amend by inserting after the word "" dressof ings "" the words "" inks, stains."" At the present time, inks and stains for leather are dutiable, under item 425, at 20 per cent. to ad valorem. This amendment is necessary, because it is impossible in many cases and for the officers of the Department to determine at what point these goods cease to be inks and stains for leather, and become leather dressing. It is therefore proposed to bring them into line with dressings. When the last Federal Tariff was under consideration, many of the manufacturers engaged in the industry said that it would be impossible to distinguish between the two classes of goods, and we have detervalues mined to take inks and stains out of item 425, and to bring them under item 230, which deals with dressings, pastes, and polishes for leather, and under which they will be dutiable at the increased rates of than has any other. 40 per cent, and 35 per cent. It is essenduties. tial that there should be uniformity in this matter. We had either to reduce the-duty On dressings to that on inks and stains, to adopt the alternative of bringing up duty on inks and stains to that on dressbordered ings; and we have followed the latter course. Item 236 A and B relates to paints and colours. This proposal, whilst inas creasing the rate of - duty on small packages of paints and colours ground 'in liquid will facilitate business with the Department by removing the present necessity for examinawill tions to determine whether or not all paints imported are mixed ready for use. Under item 236 A and B of the Tariff, as it stands, paints ground in liquid are dutiable at 4s. per cwt., and if prepared for use are dutiable at 6s. per cwt. My predethis cessor in office will recollect the great difficulty in regard to this item. The Department has been compelled to open great number of packages to determine whether or not they contain paints prepared for use, and during my term of office exmachine haustive analyses have been entered into to determine-whether a particular imported paint is or is not ready for use.",53
291,Sir ROBERT BEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Will this satisfy those concerned?,54
292,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I cannot say, but we hope that it will carry us a little further the road to satisfying them than does the' item in the Tariff as it stands. Item 261 relates to glue and gelatine. It is lutely impossible to distinguish glue from gelatine. Chemists are unable to differenstationery, tiate between them, and we propose to make both liable to uniform duties at i j d . per lb. Under the Tariff as it stands, glue is dutiable at 30 per cent, and 23 per cent., and gelatine of all kinds at 2d. per lb. and i^d. per lb. We prowhich pose uniform fixed duties of 2d. and i.Jd. per lb., which, I am given to understand by those engaged in the trade, will work a out at about the present ad valorem rates. I have a preference for fixed duties, and possibly I have influenced the decision that we should impose a fixed rate of duty, instead of the ad valorem rates of 30 and 25 per cent. Undoubtedly, where we have a fixed duty there is less liability, of invoice being dropped down than there is - in connection with ad valorem rates. The - next item of importance to which I would direct attention is item 356, which has probably caused the Department more trouble It relates to paper Item 356, paragraphs G and H, in the Tariff as it stands, makes plain writing paper, cut less than 16 by 13 inches, ana or not in stationery packets, dutiable at 15 the per cent, and 10 per cent., and ruled and papers dutiable at 25 per cent, and 20 'per cent. It is proposed, first of all, to define what is known in the trade a ""board."" We propose an abbreviation of the definition given, in the' footnote to the item in the Tariff as it stands, which' relieve the Department of the difficulties that have been cast upon it in distinguishing boards from heavy paper. . The heavy paper, I may infonn honourable members, is heavier than a light board, but we shall get over the present difficulty by amended definition. We propose to omit paragraphs G and H of item 356which I have just read-fro m the existing a Tariff. They relate merely to stationery. Plain writing paper of not less than 16 by 13 inches has only to be put once into the to be converted, when folded, into ordinary note paper. We, therefore, propose to bring these two items under "" stationery."" They cover what is really recognised by the trade as stationery, and manufacturers, in order to accommodate themselves to our Tariff, have altered not only the names of various lines which they on have been manufacturing, but also the manufacture of certain goods, so as to enable them to be imported under lower rates absoof duty. By means of this amendment, these items will appear under the item of in which they should originally have been placed. Item 3561 in the Tariff, 2d. and as it stands, covers paper' Browns and sugar (grey, blue, and other tints); fruit bagpaper, candle blue and grey paper, is dutiable candle carton paper. are dutiable at 5s. and 4s. 6d. per cwt. We propose that they shall be subjected to the same rates of duty, but the wording of the item is to be altered. The whole of the sub-item will be omitted, and in its stead we shall insert the following:1. Wrapping of all colours (glazed, unglazed, or mill-glazed), brown, cap, casing, sealing, nature or ochre brown, sulphite, sugar, and all other bag papers, candle carton paper, and boards of all colours, strawboard lined unlined weighing less than sis ounces to the Department. vinlined sheet of strawboard of 25 x 30 inches, or its equivalent. All papers used for bag making will thus be included in this line. It was thought that the general term ""browns"" would cover all these papers, but many of them have since been brought in at a lower of duty, under the item "" Paper n.e.i."" In order to compensate the bag manufaca turers for this alteration, we have increased the rates of duty upon paper bags from and 7s. 6d. per cwt. to 9s. and 8s. 6d. boxmakers357D, per cwt. Item 3561, as amended, differs folding boxboards. from the old item only to the extent that under what item theseI came all wrapping papers are now included in it, and that candle carton boards are also mentioned with candle carton paper. Formerly large quantities of wrapping papers, which were similar to light brown paper, had to be classified as paper, n.e.i., at 20 per cent., or 15 per cent., according to the country of origin. It was sible to distinguish them from in some cases, ancl in others great difficulty was experienced. The new wording will remove these difficulties. The increase in the duties on item 3561., cent. Bags, is to compensate for the increase in duty in the wrapping papers which are used for bags. Item 356M is that referred to by the honourable member for Calare as the boards used by a Sydney firm. On acmaterials. count of the definition of "" boards,"" millboard is the only board let in at the free rate, that being the only board which is being manufactured here. The effect of the proposals in regard to the items 356M and 356N is to increase from 5 per cent, or free to 20 per cent, or 15 per cent, the duties on cardboard, pasteboard, woodboard, manillaboard, and coloured folding boards used by boxtoilet makers. The amendments were absolutely necessary owing to the impossibility satisfactorily determining when a board was a pulpboard, or one of the boards plain, mentioned. It is not proposed to alter the duty on millboard, as it is easily disweighs tinguished. We have been given to underpaper, stand that practically all the boards which paper duties. are marie are pulp or paste-boards, and is in order to get over the difficulty that the whole of the wording has been [221] I feel confident that this is one of the items which was very often brought under the notice of my predecessor. In one case, a man, who was supposed to be one of the finest experts in the trade, said he was or prepared to give evidence on behalf of the There was no doubt that such evidence could not have been questioned, but when the case came on the expert sent word that he could not testify on behalf of the Department. We had our own idea as to what had happened in the meantime; but it was impossible to deterrate mine the point. The Department should not involve itself, or any of the citizens, in law suit, but the Tariff should be so framed as to render determination easy. 8s. The duties on paperboard boxes, item are increased to compensate local for the increase in duty on their am not quite sure in the Tariff, but it. is proposed to increase the duties from 30 and 25 per cent, to 40 and 35 per cent., or an increase of 10 per cent, on each line. This will practically mean that the whole of the boxes will be manufactured in Australia, where we trust higher rates of wages will be paid, even though imposthis may mean that the raw material will ""browns "" cost a little more.",54
293,Sir ROBERT BEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The duty on pulp and similar boards is increased by 20 per,55
294,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"We went very carefully into the matter, and it is estimated that the increase of 10 per cent, will just about cover the increase in the cost of the raw",55
295,Mr THOMAS BROWN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"That means that all the stuff used by Firth and Company, not in Sydney, will be on the higher list?",55
296,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The whole of the boards will now be on the higher list. If honourable members will look at the Tariff, they will see that item 356111 isPaper, n.e.i., including pulpboard; clothgrey lined boards; and cloth-lined paper; floor paper; paperhangings, or wall papers; and paper in rolls or packets-Genera l Tariff, 20 per cent.; United Kingdom, 13 per cent. of There is the following footnotePulpboard shall mean a pulp paper, whether coloured, or coated, which at the size of single royal 20 x 25 inches or its equivalent, So lbs. or over per ream of 480 sheets; which is below the weight which constitutes "" boards"" to be dealt with under the it The Department are now given to understand that the proposal made represents the alteredcorrect reading of the Tariff.",55
297,Mr THOMAS BROWN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,But the other parties were upheld by the Court.,56
298,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,They were not.,56
299,Sir ROBERT BEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"They brought action against the Department, and we had to make a concession to them, because we could not get evidence at that time to support our case.",56
300,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"But the Department got evidence afterwards, and although this man has been threatening to go to law ever since, he has not done so. In any case, as I say, a man should not be compelled to go to law in such a matter, because the Tariff ought to be so plain as to be readily understood. The only other item I have to refer to is 373, namely children's tricycles and quadracycles. It was, unfortunately, successfully held that the quadracycles came within the category of bicycles, tricycles, and similar vehicles, not elsewhere included, and dutiable at 25s. each in the case of foreign, and £ 1 each in the case of British goods. It was known that that was not the intention of Parliament, but under the determination the charge had to be made, although it amounted to 100 per cent. The alteration is to bring the quadracycles into the same category as the toy tricycles. I admit that I had not seen the printed schedule until it was laid on the table today. I have been working from a typewritten copy, and, perhaps, like others, I took it for granted that honourable members were as well up in the subject as myself. I see, however, that the schedule, as printed, does not give honourable members any idea of the alterations proposed, and I hope by tomorrow to have the schedule in such a form as to be readily understood.",56
301,Dr CARTY SALMON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The alterations seem to deal almost entirely with definitions and administration.,56
302,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Practically , the whole of them; we are not proposing any Tariff revision.",56
303,Sir ROBERT BEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Kooyong) [5.57]. - It is, of course, impossible to discuss this schedule with any degree of fulness at this stage, and the Minister has very properly intimated his intention to permit an adjournment of the discussion until tomorrow, when he will be able to supply more concise information. I must say that the Minister has been quite frank in connection with this subject; he does not wish it to be understood for a moment that 'this schedule is in the remotest degree to be regarded as a revision of the Tariff. It is a mere correction, from a departmental standpoint, of anomalies, with the object of the more harmonious working of the Tariff. I an recognise many of the anomalies as those which ought to be dealt with as early as possible. At the same time, I must confess to a sense of profound disappointment, which will be shared by the community generally, that the Minister has seen fit to limit himself to these purely departmental corrections, in one case going so far as the mere alteration of a semicolon.",56
304,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,That semi-colon has been the means of losing revenue.,56
305,Sir ROBERT BEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"No doubt that is serious; but the Minister has rigidly confined himself to immediate departmental difficulties, and, as I say, there will be a sense of disappointment throughout Australia that many of the more glaring cases, which show a complete departure from the original intention of Parliament, have not been submitted; because I feel sure they had only to be presented for revision to meet with approbation. Of course, whenever a Tariff is revised, anomalies are necessarily disclosed within a few days or weeks. All this points to the absolute necessity for a permanent Board to watch the operations of the Tariff and supply the House with information on which we may form a correct judgment. I do not blame the present Minister for following the practice, which has always been to throw before the House forty or fifty, or, perhaps, 500 items without any information whatever, except the information that can be obtained in the discussion that follows. If, in connection with each item, an expert Board showed the necessity for the alteration, and its actual operation, and gave the House the knowledge essential for its judicious consideration, the passage of the measure would be facilitated, and the result would be an infinitely better Tariff than we have been accustomed hitherto to create.  Revenue-Tariffists on the other side of the House that killed the last attempt to do what the honourable member suggests.",56
306,Sir ROBERT BEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"It is not a matter for which either side of the House can be - blamed. The proposal must commend itself to honourable members on both sides. A Tariff to secure any degree of perfection must be arrived at by a process of evolution. As anomalies OGCur, as defects in its operation are discovered, as - products, perhaps, are more cheaply produced in other parts of the world, as improvements take place in machinery, and further information comes to hand, each item has to be considered in its direct and indirect relation to others. If we venture to alter one item the alteration may seriously affect many others. The House, from the stand-point of business, will find it essential to have a Board of experts to advise it in order that it may proceed with knowledge. The Minister has given as his excuse for not going beyond mere departmental difficulties and anomalies, as we have chosen to call them, the fact that it is proposed to submit certain alterations of the Constitution to the country, and that the shape and form of the revision of the Tariff will completely depend on the decision of the country in that connection. I disapprove of that as unfair, but quite apart from what the decision of the country may be on those measures, there are, perhaps, twenty or thirty items which have been brought under the Minister's notice, and under the notice of his predecessors, in connection with which it would be at once manifest to honourable members that an increased protection would give a very substantial advantage to industries and to the people of Australia. In regard to those items our own people are seriously suffering by reason of certain materials being brought in under items under which they could not hitherto have been admitted. The honourable member for Melbourne could give the Minister several cases which he has brought under the notice of the Department. Minister could have seen his way to introduce twenty or thirty of the more pressing and urgent items, he could have established such a conclusive case on their behalf that the House would readily have accepted his proposals with great advantage to the community as a whole.",56
307,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The honourable membei' has not been in this branch of the Federal Parliament when a Tariff has been considered.,57
308,Sir ROBERT BEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I was in this Chamber eleven years before the honourable member came in, and was for five months sitting where the Minister of Customs is now sitting, carrying through the Victorian Tariff of r8p6. It was also my privilege to pilot the Tariff of 1908 through another place, so that I have a little knowledge of the difficulties involved. Where, however, it can be shown that manifest injustice is being done, honourable members, no mat[221]- 2 ter what their fiscal ideas may be, are prepared, having regard to the decision of the people as to the fiscal policy of Australia, to do the utmost justice to the industries concerned. They will not stand by and allow them to suffer, as many of our industries are now suffering. The Minister should have been bolder, and dealt with some of these cases. I am not attempting to depreciate the value of the list now submitted to us. I am sure the Committee will readily accept it. It will assist towards the more harmonious working of the Tariff, by removing anomalies which have, to some extent, been created as the result of differing expert advice. The extraordinary thing is that on various items one can get the most skilled advice either way, and in the operation of the Tariff the result, in many cases, has been that large importations have come in under items under which this House had. no idea that they could enter. The Minister has contented himself with an increase of duty in regard to one item, and that has relation to paper. I do not think my honourable friend could have done otherwise in that matter. There is no more complex or difficult item in the Tariff than that of paper, and the experts themselves are those who differ the most in regard to it. If by this means the Minister can co-ordinate the various classes of paper, and can so assist the easier and more harmonious working of the Tariff, well and good.

I am sure that the Minister will tomorrow supply us with the fullest information.",57
309,Mr TUDOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I have asked that a statement be prepared, showing in each case the present rate of duty, and underneath it the rate now proposed.",57
310,Sir ROBERT BEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"That information will be valuable, so far as these items are concerned, and will probably answer our purpose, because I can confirm the Minister's statement that these alterations are essential in the administration of the Act in order to carry out the intention of Parliament. They are the result of the experience of the experts of the Department in the working of the Tariff, and the information promised, meagre as it is, will consequently be useful. But the sooner we reach a condition of affairs under which there will be submitted with every item, and every alteration of the Tariff, the fullest information obtained by a Board, the better. It should be the duty of such a Board to constantly watch the operation of the Tariff, to secure the fullest information obtainable trom a business stand-point with regard to each item, and to point out where existing industries can be stimulated and new ones started. Every consideration of the Tariff drives us more strongly to the conclusion that the sooner such a business Board of experts is formed the better it will be in the interests of the House, the.manufacturers themselves, and the Commonwealth as a whole.",57

Hence it is essential that its operations should be watched experts, who would be, so to speak, eyes of the House, and supply the House with the necessary information to enable to come to a decision just to all concerned.

The Minister was an out-and-out Protectionist, but those who heard his remarks this afternoon must be in doubt as to which side of the fence he is now on. Whenever he mentioned an increase of duty he took care to apologize for it, as will be evident from a reading of the printed report of his remarks. The proposal now before us is in keeping with the general attitude of the Labour party regarding Protection. The Protectionist policy is up for sale.

We might as well accept the new order of things, under which we shall be governed entirely by the departmental officers, taking their ipse dixit, and passing on to the next business. There is no reason why we should consider these proposals, because they do not affect questions of policy, but merely remove departmental difficulties.

349,Mr GROOM,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,That has always been practice. Progress reported. NAVAL DEFENCE BILL. SECOND READING.,60
350,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [8.3] - In movingThat this Bill be now read a second time, I have to point out that it is one which, the first time, makes provision for the tablishment of a Commonwealth Navy, and that it is to be read in conjunction the Defence Acts of 1903 and 1909. hardly think that there is any cause me to dwell at the present time upon the necessity for naval defence. The Imperial Defence Conference, Captain Creswell, and every expert, both local and Imperial, have agreed upon the absolute necessity for maintaining the command of the sea. Circumstances of late have changed so markedly that that equilibrium which was, as it were, maintained by a more equable distribution of the British Navy all over the seas of the world, has been so disturbed that there is now concentrated in the Home waters nine-tenths of the great British Fleet. In these circumstances, it becomes necessary to provide for the new situation,' and to face the possibility of there being, temporarily, at any rate, if not for a prolonged period, either a reverse of the British Fleet in the Pacific, where it occupies, at best, but third place, e or a temporary raid by hostile cruisers, which would prey upon our commerce, and literally cause us to lose millions upon milof valuable trade. It has been estimated that during the period that the Rusas sian Fleet was off the coast of Japan- a still fleet which was foredoomed to failure from the time that it set forth until it met its fate-the Japanese lost in trade ;£i75,ooo« which a day. The mere hovering of that fleet along the coast of Japan so disturbed their trade, so upset the commercial arrangements by which a nation lives, that, had it been able to maintain its position for a lengthened period, it would practically have determined the issue of the campaign by a process of commercial paralysis and of all the industrial and economic resources of Japan. This scheme is by the recommendations and have opinions of the Imperial Defence Conferthe Admiralty authorities, and all laid those who, possessing the necessary knowledge, have had an opportunity to offer an the opinion. We, therefore, put it forward with the assurance that it ought to be accepted, and that it is sufficient, at all events, for the present, for, I shall not say all, but at least some, of our purposes.. The principle adopted is that of a separate naval auxiliary of the British Navv. In this curious Empire of ours, comprising a congeries of separate individual nations, each pursuing its own destiny in ways that seem more and more marvellous to outfor siders as the time goes on, we have thought esit possible-and this is one of the most amazing features of the situation-to create with an Australian Navy which shall be under I Commonwealth control, and yet shall be an for integral part of the British Fleet in time of disturbance, or when an emergency shall arise. The principle is that it shall be a Commonwealth Navy, manned and officered by Australians; and that its purpose shall be to act, as it were, as a continual patrol of this great coastline of ours. Its antenna? will push forth into the outermost spaces of the Pacific, and will supply information as to the movements of' hostile fleets or cruisers. And so Australian commercewill be doubly - safeguarded, not only by the power of these vessels to repel or to threaten invaders, but by the fact that information will be at their disposal, so that they may time their journeys - by the circumstances and the position of the enemy, lt is a double duty, with which the Australian Fleet will thus be charged. standard of efficiency is to be the same as in the British Navy. There is to be a control which shall be efficient, and that control, obviously, must not be divided. In war it is impossible to have two generals of co-ordinate authority, and it is, therefore, provided in the Bill that in time of war, the control of the Fleet, subject to the sanction of the - Commonwealth, shall pass to the senior - naval officer, and that it shall become a part of the British Navy. The armoured cruiser, and the unarmoured cruiser may have to fight in seas far removed from what, in the widest interpretation of the term, are territorial waters. It is necessary to fight the enemy wherever he is. It may be in the China waters ; it may be nearer Japan, or somewhere else; but, wherever it is necessary, there the Australian Fleet will strike a blow for Australia. Naturally, the Fleet falls easily into two divisions: one.which is peculiarly for local defenceI speak of the destroyers and the subr marines-and the other, which may be, but is not necessarily, purposed for operation in far-removed waters. The destroyers, although in themselves not a match for a battle-ship or a first-class cruiser, must have the effect of keeping those in command of battle-ships and first-class cruisers very wary. At night time such war-ships may not approach within a radius of 100 miles of any port at which destroyers are known to be stationed. A coast infested by destroyers is as safe as a coast can possibly be. Land defences alone are admirable, but something more mobile is required-; and the deficiency is supplied by the destroyer. A destroyer is, as it were, a movable fortress, capable of striking a deadly blow at an enemy TOO miles from the coastline, or even further, and capable of demoralizing - whic h is much more important-the morale of an attacking fleet. When there is a never-dying period of vigilance necessitated by the operations of a fleet of destroyers, there is created, as was shown by the position of the Japanese and the Russian fleets, practically a panic, or something bordering upon it. There is created something that, as it were, emasculates those operations, which would otherwise culminate in a reckless dash through the narrow waters into the very heart of your citadel. It furnishes, too, a sufficient and effective provision against the bombardment of your capital. What is to prevent a vessel standing outside Hobson's Bay, during The the hours of the night, and dropping its shots or shells at its ease on the great city of Melbourne? Absolutely nothing. The land defences are practically powerless at night against everything that moves without the limited sphere of a searchlight, but the destroyers will keep such raiders moving at night well beyond gunshot. In daylight, we may see them, and our land forts can, at least, render, I hope, a good account of themselves. It is proposed that the Fleet shall be composed of an armoured cruiser of the Indomitable class, three unarmoured cruisers of the improved City class, six destroyers of the improved River class, and three submarines. Two of these destroyers are already in Australian waters, and are expected to reach Fremantle within the next day or two. The third is to be constructed from material already prepared in Great Britain, and the other destroyers are to be constructed in Australia. As to the vessels generally, I hope that they will all be constructed in the Commonwealth. It is very gratifying to be told by the Australian artificers who went Home that they see no reason why we should not construct a first-class cruiser here. It is very gratifying to Australians to learn that, by the universal admission of the authorities in England, no men were more adaptable and none quicker than they were in picking up those peculiar methods followed in the construction of ships in naval dockyards. They werefirst-classworkmen, both in the character, the quantity, and the quality of their output. It is the policy of this Government, therefore, not merely to have an Australian Navy, but to have it constructed, as far as possible, in Australia, and refitted in Australia. A navy, like an army, cannot move far from its base - Without coal, it cannot go far, and it must also be near a dockyard to be refitted and, if necessary, repaired. We hope to be able to make the gun mountings, the guns, and everything connected with them, and, before long, produce the iron of which they are made. I shall run very rapidly over the important features of the Bill, and leave to honourable members the task of criticism. There are to be established naval, gunnery, torpedo, and other schools for the training of our officers. Admiral Henderson comes here with the recommendation of the late First Sea Lord, Admiral Fisher, and of the present Sea Lord, at the invitation of the Government, to advise as to the establishment of naval bases throughout Australia. It is very think, any other navy. obvious that we must have more than one place in Australia where the vessels can find shelter, conveniently wait for the enemy, obtain coal, be docked and refitted; and, as to the precise localities, require the advice of an expert such as we believe we have obtained in Admiral Henderson. A Naval Board of Administration is to be appointed, and on that Board each sub-Department will have a representative, in the officers in charge of the Construction Branch, naval - intelligence, contracts, paymaster, the training of the Naval Forces, and there will be also the Minister. The office of Naval Director, now occupied by Captain Creswell, is to be abolished. That does not for. one moment mean that the services of Captain Creswell are to be dispensed with, but that there is to be initiated a new system. As I have said, the vessels are to be manned by Australian seamen; and until we have enough the Admiralty will supply British seamen. It is asserted that two years' training will be sufficient for the lower ratings, but that.ten or twelve years will be necessary for the men of higher rating. In modern days everything depends on efficiency, and principally on efficiency in gunnery and torpedo shooting. Since one man who shoots straight may save the nation, it is obviously of vital importance to the country, not so much that we should have guns, though these are necessary, as that we should have men who can fire straight. The history of the RussoJapanese war shows conclusively that effective gunnery decided the contest. If we have guns with which we cannot hit, they may be admirable weapons on paper, but in an engagement they will be a delusion and a snare. I am pleased to be able to say Mr Hughes. there is every reason to be proud of the gunnery of our land forces; and we have every reason to believe that in the new Fleet Australian seamen will display as great an aptitude for gunnery as have our Permanent Artillery and British seamen. There is now in the British Navy the highest record for accurate gunnery in the world. Practically the effectiveness of the British Navy has been, not merely quadrupled, but added to ten-fold, by the accuracy of its gunnery during the last few years: From the Boer War down to the present time British gunnery has been revolutionized; and now the British Navy shows a larger percentage of hits than, I I am perfectly certain that Australians, when they have an opportunity, will shoot as straight as anybody. There, is provision for training, from boys of we twelve to fourteen'years of age to men of twenty-six. Of course, the provisions of the Defence Bill will apply, and the Citizen Forces will be trained on the ships in exactly the same way, and subject to the same conditions, asthose on the land. Those persons recruited on the coast will be drafted into camps, and will join the Naval Reserve instead of the Citizen Defence Forces; but there will be the distinction that, whereas in the Military Forcesthere is no permanent fighting line, but only a permanent instructional staff, there must be a permanent fighting force in the Navy. To have good sailors and gunners the men must be permanently employed.",60
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,But they will be recruited on a volunteer basis?,62
352,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Of course; the compulsion relates only to the twetity-five days' training, which would obviously not make a man a sailor, much less an .expert gunner. If a man puts in eight days on a torpedo boat, his experience either then or afterwards may not strike him as altogether pheasant; but that is a matter for himself. The idea-and I think it is an excellent one-is that we have an enormous reserve of men in the mercantile marine. We are a nation, and the offshoot of a nation that has never been behind in producing an ample supply of sailors; and, therefore, we do not anticipate any difficulty in recruiting. Of course, if there is any difficulty we shall have to offer higher inducements. The Naval Force will consist of, first, the permanent naval forces; secondly, the naval reserve or militia; and, thirdly, the naval volunteer reserve. The last-mentioned will be composed of those who have served their term, and are over twenty-six years of age, and are liable to come up for training only when called upon. The line of the present naval reserve will be continued just as at present until we see whether we may safely disband it-for all practical purposes there will be no interference ""with this reserve. If the volunteers choose to continue in the service, it will be advisable to avail ourselves of their services. Further, we have a reserve in the Torres Strait pilots, who possess peculiar knowledge invaluable to the Commonwealth. Unless foreign nations have been very wide awake, it will be impossible for the ships of any to come inside the Great Barrier Reef at night, unless they are in charge of men with a very wide and comprehensive knowledge of navigation .in those waters. We have, therefore, decided to take over the Torres Strait pilots as part of our naval defence. The cost of this fleet amounts to ,£3,695,000, made up of one armoured cruiser, to cost £2,000,000; three unarmoured cruisers, £1,060,000; six destroyers, £480,000; and three submarines, £165,000. These figures represent only the estimates supplied to us by the Admiralty, and it may be that the piice of material and wages have since risen. Further, these are English prices, and the cost may be more in Australia. I do not desire honourable members to say afterwards that they understood ,£3,695,000 to be the total cost in Australia, because that is only an estimate, given for what it is worth. I have no doubt that it will be worthwhile to have the fleet constructed here at somewhat higher cost, considering that we have the inestimable advantage of dockyards and a staff of men who are able to refit and repair-a n advantage without which we should only be living in a fool's paradise. A vessel out of repair is worse than useless, because we are led to depend upon it, and it may fail us in our hour of need. The upkeep of the navy is estimated at ,£500,000, which is less than the estimate of the Admiralty. The reason is that we propose to pay for upkeep out of jrevenue, and not out of loans, so that we shall have no interest to provide; and, further, I may say that we - do not propose to accept the £250,000 from Great Britain in lieu of the subsidy. We propose to accept nothing from Great Britain, but to pay for the whole fleet ourselves; since we are going to do the work, we might as well do it well. The British Defence Act is to be adopted as a regulation. That is an up-to-date measure, containing no trace of the barbarous methods by which discipline, or so-called discipline, was enforced in days gone by. While death remains a punishment fer other offences than murder, it is reserved for desertion in the face of the enemy, and so forth. Honourable membfers will realise that men cannot be permitted to desert in the face of the enemy, because such is not only bad for the nation, but is contemptible and cowardly; and a man who does so is much better dead, and no one need shed a tear ""over his projected demise. In my opinion, the proposed expenditure is amply warranted by all the circumstances. We are a young nation just beginning to realise cur mighty potentialities. We are treading now with firm steps, and moving resolutely to our destiny. We propose to establish a fleet and man it ourselves. We propose to let the world see that Australia is moving along the line which she conceives has been marked out for her, and by J establishing this fleet, and. showing our capacity for construction, manning, repairing, and maintaining it, 'we are setting forth in the clearest way the fact, not only that we are here, but that we claim to remain here, and are taking the most effective ineans to substantiate our claim",62
353,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Parramatta) [8.28] - I have listened with some degree of pleasure, particularly to the reference to the Naval and Militia Volunteer Force, which it is proposed to keep intact. I remember very well only about twelve months ago the fierce fulminations of honourable members opposite at the very idea that any volunteers should be kept for the purposes of the navy. The honourable member for Maranoa pointed out time and again how wrong it was to have anything to do with volunteering in connection with these forces. This is evidently one of the changes which honourable members op : posite have made since they passed over from this side. The Attorney-General last evening, in connection with another proposal, declared that his party had made no changes in passing over; but here we have a right-about-face. They were fierce in their denunciations of everything relating to the volunteer principle in connection with the Naval Force, but now the honourable gentleman sees every advantage in fostering it to the fullest extent. I desire to-night, to examine the claim winch the Minister has made on every public platform, and whenever he is away from this House, that whatever developments there may have been in the shape of naval defence is due to something done by the Labour party. That claim has not been made to-night, because here is the place where it can be answered. I propose to answer it after it has been made about a hundred times by the honourable member in various parts of Australia. I have no quarrel with the honourable member's statement of facts, but to make the facts fit their former policy he has to go all wrong in his naval strategy. I challenge the honourable member's statement as to the strategy of this Fleet in his endeavour to make it appear that their former proposals were the only useful ones. We shall do well to remember our position in connection with the Fleet which we propose to develop, and its relation to the great Fleet oversea which stands for the defence of the Empire at large. The honourable member laid it down, only a moment ago, that our Empire must be defended on the high seas-that that is its first line of defence. Without superiority at sea, therefore, the Empire of which we form a part cannot by any possibility be maintained. It is also recognised to be the duty of each self-governing portion of the Empire to provide, as far as possible, for its own territorial security. That is another fundamental principle which finds embodiment in the Fleet which we are now discussing. Another requirement of a proper defence of the Empire is that there shall be evolved schemes for the mutual assistance of every part of it. That is to say, when times make it necessary, the whole Empire's strength is to be concentrated in the defence of any given part of it. In this way there must be mutual co-operation for the purpose of Empire defence. Those three principles, therefore, have been defined to be a sea command, self-defence by the Empire's units, and mutual support of the whole and form the basis' of any strategy for the purpose of an adequate Imperial defence. I find all ments of an Imperial defence met in the proposal which is now before the Chamber - a proposal which carries out our naval defence scheme. The Attorney-General says, "" It is ours also."" Query, whose is it?",63
354,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,It is certainly not yours. Mr Joseph Cook.,64
355,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"We shall soon see whose scheme it is. Whoever else may lay claim to it, the Labour party may not. They have denounced it from every part of Australia, gibed at it, and ridiculed it from every public platform in every State of the group.",64
356,Mr MATHEWS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"To which I say, "" Dreadnought "" 1",64
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Yes , a Dreadnought is part of this scheme. It formsthe basis and fighting strength of it.",64
358,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Our Dreadnought.,64
359,Mr FENTON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,We are not going to pay the English money-lender interest on the cost of it.,64
360,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"My honourable friend is off on another point. I propose to show, by an appeal to the facts, whose scheme it is. We are not on the public platform now, but in a place where we can get face to face with each other. I have already been taunted today with having, been quiet for a long time on the question of defence, because it was thought that 1 was in a very peculiar position about it. This scheme is our scheme. It originated with our Government. It was formulated in conjunction with the Imperial Government. We undertook the responsibility, and passed it on to our successors, and they are shouldering it in a way that leaves nothing to be desired. The only quarrel I have with them is that they still say, "" It is our scheme.""  does it make if it is a good one?",64
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I agree with the honourable member that it makes no difference. Then, why should the Attorney General go over the whole country and' claim at every public opportunity that credit for it belongs solely to him and his confreres?",64
362,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Has the honourable member looked at his own speeches lately?,64
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Yes ; and I defy the honourable member to find any speech of mine in conflict with the strategy these require- of this proposal.,64
364,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I have a book full of them.,64
365,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I challenge the honourable member to quote them.,64
366,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member would go back on them if I did.,64
367,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I would goback only on that report which contains a statement that I never made.,64
368,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,It was in all Adelaide papers.,65
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"What if it was ? Has the honourable member never been misreported ? I believe it was in the Adelaide Register-the honourable member's bible. He may well laugh, but he is setting that paper up as an authority for himself. He swears by it when he thinks it happens to be against one of his political enemies, and accepts it at no other time. Let us come to the point as to whose scheme this is. The scheme announced at Gympie was to be all destroyers. Honourable members opposite evidently bent on the destruction of something, somewhere, and at some time. They will destroy themselves if .given a little rope. At any rate, they set out to destroy the whole of the enemy's fleets by this Fleet of theirs, consisting of "" four ocean destroyers, sixteen other destroyers, and three already ordered."" I understand that it is in connection with the "" three already ordered "" that the Acting Prime Minister is constantly basing the - claim to the authorship of this scheme. Theirs was a policy of action, he said, others talked about it, but they acted. They did. They deliberately broke their word to this Chamber, and took funds",65
370,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,That statement - wholly wrong. The honourable member knows that it is inaccurate.,65
371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Then I shall have to turn up Hansard to show where the honourable member and his friends required from the Government of the day a distinct pledge that the money should not be spent until a definite scheme had been submitted to Parliament. As soon as Parliament closed its doors they spent the money, and so violated their word to this Chamber. That is how those three - destroyers came to be ordered. Another - Government saved the money and they spent it, as they are able to spend it",65
372,Mr MATHEWS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,A query can - opposite the statement about another Government saving the money. It was this party that had the Surplus Revenue Bill put through.,65
373,Mr TOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The money was put away safely in the Trust Fund, but before the Labour party would give the Government the money to put away, they required from them an undertaking, which was repeated three or four times, that not a penny of it should be spent until a scheme the for its spending had been outlined to this Chamber. Honourable members interjecting",65
374,Mr SPEAKER,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Order ! I must ask honourable members riot to continue these conversations. If they do, I shall have to remind honourable members personally of the fact that they are out of order.  the truth.",65
375,Mr SPEAKER,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Order ! The honourable member for Echuca must not interject.,65
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I have here a were printed statement showing what the various naval defence schemes have consisted of. It shows that there has really been an evolution of ideas beginning with a fairly sensible proposal by Captain Creswell,' eight or nine years ago,, so far as it went, but dwindling down in the time of my honourable friends to those ocean destroyers and nothing more. They proposed a fleet of twenty-three destroyers, which could do no damage to anything in the trade routes. It could not go into the trade routes at all, but was to skirt the mast of Australia, and prevent an enemy from coming here to bombard our cities and towns. We heard that antiquated strategy given utterance to a moment or two ago by the Acting Prime Minister, who is thereby furnished indisputable proof that' he knows nothing whatever about naval strategy. He talks of something which belongs to the period of the "" troglodyte in the post-pliocene epoch."" I have heard the Acting Prime Minister use that expression so many times that I know it perfectly well; hut to-night in His enunciation of naval strategy he has shown that he, at any rate, belongs in a naval sense to that period of the world's development. That projected fleet of ocean destroyers would be of no use whatever for co-operative purposes in «Empire defence. I shall prove that statement out of the mouth of Mr MCKenna himself at the Conference; out of the be put mouth of Lord Charles Beresford, whom honourable members opposite are never tired of quoting; and out of the mouth of the best naval writer of the day-Admira l Sir Cyprian Bridge. This localized defence flotilla was the very first thing which Mr MCKenna attacked and swept out of the way in his memorandum to the Conference which our representatives attended. It had to be cleared out of their minds altogether before they could attempt to elaborate a scheme of naval defence for outlying portions of .the Empire. saidUnder certain conditions the establishment local defence flotillas, consisting of torpedo craft and submarines, might be of assistance in time of war to the operations of the fleet, but such flotillas cannot co-operate on seas in the wider duties of protection of trade and preventing attacks frpm hostile cruisers and squadrons. The operations of destroyers and torpedo boats are necessarily limited to the waters near the coast, or to a radius of action not far distant from a base, while there are great difficulties in manning such a force and keeping it always thoroughly efficient. A scheme limited to torpedo crafts would not in itself, moreover, be a good means of gradually developing a self-contained fleet capable of both offence and defence. Unless a naval force-whateve r its size-complie s with this condition it can never take its proper place in the organization of an Imperial Navy distributed strategically over the whole area of British terests. The scheme of the Labour Government is twenty-three torpedo-boats to skirt our coasts, as the Acting Prime Minister said just now, to frighten all the big ships in the world away. What a ridiculous notion 1",65
377,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,No such definite scheme as that was laid down; it was only a proposal.,66
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"It was the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Wide Bay, at Gympie. that made for use? Here is the Minister repudiating his leader's Gympie speech ! I am quoting from the speech in which the Prime Minister declared that to be the naval policy of the Government. There were to be twenty-three torpedo-boat destroyers, with never a Dreadnought or a cruiser among them. I shall show the honourable member in a moment what these destrcyers are worth. I propose to sweep his little tin-pot navy away, and he can quote me again next time he speak as having said that his proposal was for a tinpot navy, which would be costly and useless, because unsuited for co-operation in the defence of the Empire. There could be no more absolute condemnation of the proposal of the Fisher Government than that contained in the memorandum of Mr. MCKenna, which I have just read. Now, honourable members opposite are continually quoting Lord Charles Beresford in defence of their proposals, but this is what he wrote in a magazine article which was published a little time agoThe only way that our distant Dominions can be hurt is by their trade routes being cut. the The honourable member told us to-night that He we could be hurt by ships coming here and blowing up our towns. No naval exof pert would express such a view. The naval opinion of today is that the local fire brigades could cope with all the damage the high which any hostile ship might doIn these days, if we go to war, it is most unlikely that a cruiser of a foreign country would get to the Dominions-' and operate by going into a harbour and blowing down a town. Away goes the justification alleged by the Acting Prime Minister a little time ago for the proposed fleetThe days for that are past. What would they get from a town? They would get a certain amount of money and probably a certain amount of bills which may not be paid when due. Foreign cruisers would go to a trade route. Remember, a torpedo boat or a subin- marine is a defensive vessel. All nations at this moment for fighting efficiency are short of cruisers. What would probably occur would be that an armed mercantile auxiliary would go out into the trade routesand there wage war upon the commerce of a country. In other words, ships are not likely to come here to destroy our towns. We need cruisersfor far other purposes than the defence of our cities. The idea of having ships along a coast-line of 8,000 miles waiting for a fleet which, according to experts, will never come, is madness and folly and waste. Sir Cyprian Bridge is as good an Was not authority on these questions as Captain Mahan-at least he is the best British authority. He says as to the proper use of smaller and special class craft in warThe greatest distance to which they are sent should not exceed forty per cent, of that represented by their fuel endurance. It has been stated that our vessels will have a 3,000 miles radius, and that they will be able to go 1,500 miles from our coast, and return. But, according to the opinion which I have just quoted, they will be able to go in safety only 40 per cent, of that distance, which is 600 miles. To continue the quotationLocalized floating defence is the weakest form that naval defence can assume. The aim of strategy should be to include its strongest form in any plan adopted. Fixed or passive defence against apprehended naval attack has, in practice, always led to the adoption of a long series of protecting arrangements, to enumerate which would be to parallel the jingle of the "" House that Jack built."" The battery defends the anchorage; infantry defends the battery; underwater mines defend the channel; electric lights and quick-firing guns defend the mines; a movable force defends the electric lights and the quick-firing guns. The sea-going naval force, which is sometimes unnoticed, defends the whole. An enterprising belligerent, if he cannot ture a piace or destroy the naval establishment situated at it, will have recourse to other methods of' decreasing or annihilating its utility for the purposes of war. He will try to prevent the maritime traffic on which its prosperity depends from being continued. This he can only do by naval means, and most 'effectually beyond the range of localized floating defences. The best way of frustrating his designs will be to meet him with an adequate sea-going force. If the sea communications of the place are kept open, this method of trying to render a place useless for the purposes of war wiil have failed. There are other quotations which I could make, all proving the uselessness of the scheme of the Fisher Government.",66
379,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Does the honourable member call this a non-party speech? He is the only man who would make such a claim.,67
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I call it an answer to the impudent claim of the honourable member, which has been repeated on platforms all through Australia, that the Labour party is responsible for the naval defence of the Commonwealth.",67
381,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Hear , hear. I repeat it again.",67
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The party is responsible for it in the sense that Huxley's protoplasm is claimed to be responsible for the highly-civilized beings of today. Primeval man might just as well claim to be the inventor and originator of all that has been done since his day. It is time that some reply was made to these statements.,67
383,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member is not making one. He is speaking of the kind of boats to be used, not of the scheme.",67
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I am tired of the impudence and impertinence of honourable members opposite. They have got into office, have taken up our scheme of defence, and now say, "" It is .our scheme, and never was vours. We originated it . "" The Attorney-General says, "" Have I not alwnvs been pleading foT land defence by comnulsorv methods, and did we not order three small torpedo-boats, which was the beginning of our naval defence? "" Mr. MCKenna declared it to be his first duty to dispose of the nonsensical idea that naval defence could be provided for in that way.",67
385,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The honourable member has not touched the scheme of local navn] defence.,67
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"No . I need not clo so. I stated the facts regarding it captwelve months ago, but I was not permitted to go further, because my honourable friend and his confreres prevented it.",67
387,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,That is incorrect.,67
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The Minister knows what happened. - Mr BATCHELOR - To the honourable member's eternal shame and disgrace.,67
389,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The Minister's action on that occasion helped to put the scheme through in no time. I heartily approve of the proposals before the Chamber, and am glad to hear also that Ministers are able to provide out of revenue for the annual outlay to be incurred in maintaining a fleet. I hope that they will realise their further obligations. In my judgment, we cannot safely stop in the development of our naval power. If the Empire is to be maintained during the troublous times, which must occur in the near future-becaus e the political atmosphere is so disturbed that I do not know how things can go on - as they are-w e must be ready; the nation which is not able to defend its interests with its strong right arm will suffer. Therefore, the Commonwealth and the other outlying parts of the Empire should concert further measures for contributing to its defence. We are rich enough to do it, ancl it is our duty, if only to relieve the Mother Country. We should free her, at least, to meet the menace in the North Sea. Our obligation is to secure and preserve our inviolability, and take measures which will enable us to defend the Empire by being ready wherever danger may threaten. And so I am glad to' find in this Bill a proposal for the standardization of these various units which will make up an Empire Fleet. It is not to be merely a mechanical standardization. We are not merely to have the same type of ship but the same discipline in the British and in the Commonwealth Navy; and we are also to have men trained to the same standard. And so we shall have a complete standardization, not only in ships, but in men. This, I believe, will help us to take a worthy place alongside of all who wish well to the Empire, helping to build up its prosperity, and for all time to maintain it against its foes.",67
390,Mr MATHEWS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Melbourne Ports) [9.1] - I feel sure that we should all be pleased to hear the Acting Prime Minister reply at once to the speech made by the honourable member for Parramatta. Doubtless he would both enlighten and amuse us; but since he has already spoken this evening, I suppose it would be too much to expect him to speak again at this stage. We are all agreed as to the necessity for naval defence, and, to my mind, it is even more important than is land defence. The Acting Prime Minister, in introducing the Bill, rightly assumed that our Naval Forces would prove to be as efficient in gunnery as are our land Forces, and those who last Monday had the privilege of watching the gunnery practice at Queenscliff must feel confident that the gunners at the Heads would give any vessel that attempted to pass .through a very hot time. I was exceedingly pleased to hear the honourable gentieman say that the estimated cost of constructing the Fleet, namely, £3,690,000, might be exceeded, because of the probability of a goodly proportion of the Fleet being constructed in Australia. I hold the view that we ought to build our vessels here, even if their local construction involves an additional cost of £1,500,000. In the first place, we have in Australia men capable of readily being instructed in the work of. building such vessels; and secondly, we cannot hope to have a perfect system of naval defence unless we are able to build our own war ships, and, when necessary, to effectively repair them. I still hold to the opinion that the requirement as to twenty-five days' drill per annum will seriously interfere with the wage-earning section of the community, and I trust that propei measures will be taken to insure that the least possible harm will be done those whq have to give up so much time to the work of fitting themselves for the defence of their country. I hope that provision will be made by regulation to prevent any employer punishing a man because he has to attend drill at a time when the employer thinks he should have his services. Whilst the honourable member for Laanecoorie was speaking last night, I interjected that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had "" sacked "" two of their men because, after asking for leave, they took a day of f , in order to attend, members of the Naval Reserve, a memorial service which was held in front of this building. Those men trained to fit themselves for the defence of Australia, yet a large company like the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which has fattened on the people of Australia, refused to give them time off to enable them to take part in that memorial service. If that sort of practice is to be indulged in, there is a Mr Mathews. hard time in front of our men who are called upon to attend drills. The Government must take steps to see that such companies, and not their men, shall pay for the defence of Australia, since they reap the whole benefit of the system. I hope that full opportunity will be given every man to avail himself'of the Naval, as well as the Military, College. The Minister told us that the administrative body would be reconstructed, and asserted that, whilst Captain Creswell's position could be done away with, we could not afford to lose the services of Captain Creswell. I have no feeling against that officer, but I trust that when we have a Navy, the Government will secure the services of a man who knows something about the handling of a fleet. Captain Creswell might have been an excellent officer to control a fleet if he had an opportunity; but no man in the Australian service has had any experience in handling a fleet such as we hope to establish within the next few years. I disagreed with the proposal that a military officer should be obtained from the Old Land in connection with our Defence Force, and I am not sure now that we. did right in that connection. But I do feel that it is essential, in the interests of the Australian Navy, that we should obtain from the Old World an officer capable of handling the fleet that we propose to create. I desire to draw the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to clause 38, paragraph a of which provides- - :",67
391,Mr SPEAKER,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The honourable member will not be in order in discussing the details of a particular clause. "" Mr MATHEWS - Provisio n is made in the Bill for the senior officer taking command, subject to certain regulations, when our Fleet co-operates with the British Navy. I hope that the Imperial authorities will not be allowed to make a regulation under which a junior officer in the British Navy will in such circumstance be able to supersede a senior Commonwealth officer. as If such a practice be allowed, then in no circumstances shall we have officers fit to control our Fleet. I do not know that it will be resorted to, but under the clause as it stands it will be possible. I hope that in the very near future, when we have completed our Fleet, no junior officer of the Imperial Navy will be able to supersede a senior Commonwealth officer, either on this or on any other station. The only other question to which I desire to refer relates to the matter of pensions. Provi-. sion is made for the wives and children of men who may be killed in action, and for men who are called upon because of infirmity or injury to retire from the Navy; but littie or no provision is 'made for a navy pension."" I contend that Aye should institute a pension system in connection with our Defence Force. Ours is the only Defence Force in the world of which I know in connection with which no provision is made for the payment of pensions. After serving for ten or twenty years in the army or navy, a man gets into a certain groove which unfits him for other callings. In the absence of a pension system, a man, after serving his country for twenty years or more, may be turned adrift, and may be subject to the bufferings of adversity, although he has spent the best years of his life in the defence of his country. The wages paid in the Australian Navy are not commensurate with the services rendered. If we capitalize the wages received by men in the Imperial Navy-thei r consolidated pay, their allowances, and their pensionswe shall find that our own men have been considerably underpaid. As a fighting unit, a man is not of much use after he has passed the age of fifty years. As a petty officer or an instructor, he may do good service, but as an A.B., perhaps, he would not be of much value. I do not think that men who have served in that capacity for twenty or thirty years should, on reaching the age of fifty years, be cast adrift without a pension. Such a system is by no means democratic. I hope that the Government will, in the near future, make provision for pensions in connection with our Defence Force. It has been suggested that the men themselves should contribute to a pension fund, but, whilst they receive their present rates of pay, they cannot possibly do so. A considerable addition will have to be made to the present rates in order to do justice to those who are serving us. In conclusion, I would again emphasize the point that the requirement as to twenty-five days' training a year will seriously dislocate every calling of the wage-earning section of the community in almost every part of Australia.",68
392,Mr RTLEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"South Sydney) [9.13Ishould not have spoken to this question but for the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta, who accused this Governwar, ment of copying the scheme of the Fusion Administration. The country will rememto ber that when the previous Fisher Ministry was in power the Fusion party Commonwealth, and demanded that an offer of a Dreadnought should be made to the Old Land. After a time, the. Deakin-Cook party came into power, but they did not offer a Dreadnought to Great Britain.",69
393,Mr SAMPSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"They did, and it was fused with the present scheme. It formed the basis of the present scheme.",69
394,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Nonsense ; there was a complete volte-face on their part.,69
395,Mr RILEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"I wish to point out that the policy of the Government has been approved by the Admiralty, and that they have told us that die best thing we can do in the interests of the Empire is to create a navy of our own, however small, to protect our coastline. The honourable member for Parramatta has quoted three authorities with regard to naval construction and the class of navy we ought to establish, but I would point out that all those authorities are Britishers. They give their views from the stand-point of Great .Britain, which is not a self-contained country like the Commonwealth, but has to depend for its food supplies on the protection of the trade routes.",69
396,Mr SAMPSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"VV e have a trade of £120,000,000 a year. ; Mr Riley - That trade may be affected by war, but not one man or woman in the country would thereby be deprived of a meal. What might be found suitable to Great Britain in the way of defence might be altogether unsuitable for Australia.",69
397,Mr SAMPSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Can any nation do without trade with the outside world?,69
398,Mr RILEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"In time of war, yes, if that country be self-contained. I do not suppose that Great Britain could subsist for a month without food supplies from abroad. ' Mr SAMPSON - What about the trade routes in time of peace?",69
399,Mr RILEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"That is evading the point. The Dreadnoughts and armoured cruisers are recommended for the protection of the trade routes, but such protection is not in accordance with the requirements of Australians. We have to de1 fend the country itself, and not go on the high seas to protect the trade routes. Our export trade might be cut off in time ot but the wealth would still be in this country, and it might be to our advantage keep it here until the war was over. The policy adopted by the Government for Ausstormed the tralia is the best.",69
400,Mr SAMPSON,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Self-containe d America builds battleships.,70
401,Mr RILEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"But America has departed-and , in my opinion, wrongly departed-fro m the Monroe doctrine. hope the day will never come when we shall build a Navy to fight on the high seas; although our ships should certainly be of a class that can go on the high seas, so that if naval battles are to be fought for Great Britain or the Empire, the whole of the forces may be concentrated at the scene of conflict. If the Fleet of Great Britain were defeated neither our Dreadnought, nor our little cruisers, would be of much use on our coast; and at such a time the whole of the Fleet should be placed under one Admiral, to fight the battles of the Empire wherever necessary. The authorities quoted by the honourable member for Parramatta relate to circumstances which have no analogy with the circumstances of the Commonwealth. For the reasons I have given, I am of opinion that the Government are quite right in the policy they have adopted. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses i to io agreed to. Clause II (Officers not to be appointed or promoted except provisionally until they have passed prescribed examination).",70
402,Sir JOHN FORREST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Swan) [9.21]. - I do not rise to move an amendment, but merely to point out that this clause, nearly all the clauses we have already passed, and most of those we have yet to pass, already find a place in our existing law. Although the Minister has not, I think, pointed it out, the reason is found in the desire to separate the naval and the military Statutes, with a view to easy reference. I do not see. any great necessity for this repetition, but the same course has been followed in the Defence Bill, also before this Chamber. Of course, there are some new and important provisions with which I agree. Clause agreed to. Clauses 1.2 to 17 agreed to. Clause 18 (Naval College).",70
403,Sir JOHN FORREST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Swan) [9.26]. - Here , again, is an instance of provisions already in the principal Act. The repetition does no harm; but I may point out that provision was made for the establishment of a College in 1903, though nothing has,been done until now.",70
404,Mr RILEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,It does not do to have too much repetition.,70
405,Sir JOHN FORREST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,If there had been no repetition this Biil might have been I comprised in half-a-dozen clauses. Clause agreed to. Clauses 19 to 33 agreed to. Clause 34 (Service for protection of a State from domestic violence).,70
406,Mr RILEY,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"South Sydney) [9.29] This clause is another instance of repetition. It simply re-enacts section 119 of the Constitution, and, therefore, is' not required. Sit JOHN FORREST - It also re-enacts section 51 of the principal Act.",70
407,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [9-3°]-- Is e e that this clause practically repeats the words of section 119 of the Constitution. Section 51 of the Defence Act provides that, where the Governor of a State has proclaimed that domestic violence exists therein, the Governor General, upon the application of the Executive Government of the States, may, by proclamation, declare that domestic violence exists in that State, and may call out the Permanent Forces, and in the event of their numbers being insufficient, may also call out the Militia and Volunteer Forces. The question is whether the same provision is also necessary in this Bill. Its excision or inclusion makes no difference to the fact. I should like to hear arguments on the matter.",70
408,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Adelaide) [9.31] - It is laid down in section 119 of the Constitution and repeated in the clearest possible terms in section 51 of the Defence Act that the Commonwealth has this power. Clause 34 has no meaning until we refer to the Defence Act. We seem to be loading up our Acts with superfluous clauses iii such a way that the average man cannot understand them. This clause is entirely superfluous..,70
409,Sir JOHN QUICK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The section in the Defence Act applies only to the Permanent Military Forces.,70

412,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I should be glad if the Government would agree to strike out a number of clauses which the right honourable member has designated as superfluous.,70
413,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Parramatta) to [9.34] - As the provision is in the Act it should be in this measure also, so that either Naval or Military Forces may be used if necessary. I do not see how the Permanent Naval Forces can be used original under the ordinary Defence Act. The indeal tention now appears to be to take all the naval matters out of the Defence Act, put them by themselves in a Naval Defence measure.",71
414,Mr BATCHELOR,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The clause is not necessary in this Bill, in view of the ConingMT. stitution.",71

418,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,We should have to do so.,71

420,Mr SPENCE,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Darling) [9.37]-- I bave clearly always been led to understand by legal of gentlemen that to say a thing a number of 119^ times leads to confusion. If this provision is in the Constitution it is of no use to resection peat it in a number of Acts. Both in this in connection Bill and in the Defence Act the words of domestic violence the Constitution are merely repeated.,71
421,Mr GROOM,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The Constitution places the duty on the Commonwealth.,71

As the stitution provides for the emergency templated, there is no necessity for clause, and the Minister would do wisely if he left it out. The sooner we, in this Parliament, learn to condense our Acts better it will be for all concerned. should make them as easy as possible for people to understand.",71
424,Mr GROOM,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Darling Downs) [9.41] I am inclined to think that the Minister should retain the clause. Section 119 the Constitution places the duty on Commonwealth, but it then becomes necessary to provide machinery for giving that duty. That machinery is provided Defence in section 51 of the Defence Act.",71
425,Mr SPENCE,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Is not that enough?,71
426,Mr GROOM,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Apparentl y not, since it appears to be the intention to leave the Defence Act, to a great extent, to with the Military Forces only. Therefore, this clause is necessary to allow the and Permanent Naval Forces to be utilized.",71
427,Mr ROBERTS,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The Permanent Forces include both Naval and Military. GROOM - They are apparently bedivided now into Permanent Military Permanent Naval. This Bill is apparently to deal with the Naval Forces generally, and, therefore, I do not think that the clause is surplusage, although it is Conquite possible that it would have been the simpler and easier to deal with both branches of the Forces in one Act. I urge the Ministry to stand by the clause.",71
428,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [9.44J - This Bill has to be read with the Defence Act, which contains the provision that has been quoted. Whatever else they do not include, the Permanent Forces must include the Naval Forces, which are permanent, so far as the manning the Fleet is concerned. Even if section of the Constitution is not sufficient, apply. 51 of the Defence Act seems to The obligations of a Government with what may be termed are clear and obvious, though I should 'not like it to be thought that one of the main objects of the establishment of an Australian Fleet is the reof what is sometimes called by that to term. A few weeks ago the monarchy of The Portugal was removed by a republican hope mob, and the guns of the fleet were successfully trained against the palace which sheltered the unfortunate King. One of the uses to which a fleet may be put is, therefore, to obtain the substitution of a the unrepublican form of government for a Conmonarchy, which would not commend itself conto my honourable friend. Sections 46, 47, this and S3 of the Defence Act apply to the Naval as well as to the Military Forces. Under them the Governor General may call the out the Naval Forces, and may in time of We war place them under the orders and commands of any portion of the King's regular Forces.",71
429,Mr GROOM,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,Clause 5 says that section of 51 of the Defence Act shall continue to the apply in relation to the Naval Forces.,71
430,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,I have no objection effect to the striking out of the clause. » Clause negatived. Clauses 35 to 40 agreed to. Clause 41 (Persons liable to compulsory naval training to be subject to Act and regulations).,71
431,Mr GLYNN,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Angas) [9.50] - Lookin g hurriedly at section 51 of the Defence Act, I am of opinion that it does not apply, because it deals with militia and volunteer forces which we have abolished. It might, therefore, have been better to retain clause 34. The clause was put into the measure because without it there would be no obligation for the Forces to serve as required. Forces are bound to protect the State against invasion; but the obligation to serve in the manner proposed must be provided by Statute. Clause agreed to. Clauses 42 to 44 agreed to. Clause 45 (Funds for annuities or gratuities in case of injury or retirement).",72
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"Parramatta) [9-S3]-- A naval force cannot be maintained in efficiency unless compulsory retirement on reaching an age limit is as rigidlyrequired as in the King's Navy. At present we keep our omcers long after they should be retired, because no provision is made for pensions or half-pay, and we cannot reduce them to beggary and destitution. We should provide either for some system of deferred pay or for insurance. In the British Navy a system of deferred pay is in vogue. I was speaking to a surgeon in the Navy the other day, who told me that, although he had served for only twenty years, he was now entitled to retire on a pension of £365 a year.",72
433,Mr WEST,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"The pay in the Navy is very low, but the pensions make up for that.",72
434,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,The pensions are part of the remuneration. We should set about providing as soon as possible for the retirement of officers.,72
435,Mr HUGHES,REFITTING OF TORPEDO,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [9.56] - I do not know what provision has been made, but I have asked the Minister for the information, and shall supply it to the honourable member as soon as I get it. If it were not the intention of the Government to deal with the matter, the clause would not have been placed in the Bill. Clause agreed to. Clause 46, schedules, and title agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill passed through its remaining stages. NA (LEGISLATIVE POWERS) BILL. Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. NA (MONOPOLIES) BILL. Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. NA (ADMINISTRATION) BILL. SECOND READING.",72
436,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Boothby-Minister of External Affairs) [9.59] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is merely a machinery Bill. The Northern Territory at present is administered by the Government of South Australia, and is represented by two members in the Parliament of that State. On the date of the issue of the proclamation the Territory will pass over to the Commonwealth, and unless we provide for some system of government we shall have no means of properly administering it. In these circumstances, this Bill is introduced as, so to speak, a stop-gap. It is by no means designed to provide a Constitution for the Territory. That is a matter which will have to be dealt with later on.",72
437,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No r would the Government make an Ordinance dealing with any question of general policy, such as a system of land tenure?",72
438,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Onl y so far as is necessary to enable land to be taken up. British Mr GROOM - Unde r the existing State laws ?,72
439,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; to deal with applications for land. At the present time, as the honourable member is aware, all land settlement in the Northern Territory is in abeyance. Permits only are granted, and the question of whether or not the South Australian terms of tenure and of leases shall be continued is one upon which I am not prepared off-hand to express an opinion. In order that all possibility of development may not be held up until this Parliament meets again and a Constitution can be framed for the Northern Territory, it may be necessary to pass some Ordinances, and that is really the object of this Bill. Any Ordinance made by the Governor in Council will be placed before Parliament, if it is in session, within fourteen days of its issue, and if Parliament is not in session, within fourteen days of its meeting. The laws of South Australia will continue to apply to the ""Northern Territory except in so far as it may be necessary to modify them by Ordinances. I do not know that we shall require to issue any Ordinances, but it is certainly undesirable that we should be compelled to continue some South Australian Act that might be found to be inconsistent with an attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to develop the Territory.",72
440,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will the Judicial Officer still continue under the State law?,73
441,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,At the present time the Judicial and Government Resident's offices are combined.,73
442,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,-The Administrator under this Bill need not necessarily be the Judicial Officer.,73
443,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Not necessarily; and I desire honourable members to understand that it is proposed that we shall take power to appoint an Administrator who may or may not be the present Government Resident. The question has not yet been fully considered.,73
444,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The Commonwealth will not necessarily take over all the existing officers of the Northern Territory ?,73
445,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; in the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill we took special precautions to guard against the Commonwealth, being compelled to - take over all the officers at present employed in connection with the administration of the Territory by the South Australian Government.",73
446,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,How many are there?,73
447,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I cannot give the honourable member the exact number, but there are a good many.",73
448,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,And they are very anxious to learn the intention of the Commonwealth with regard to them.,73
449,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Naturally , they are. I dare say that most of them will be taken over, but the Government do not bind themselves in taking over the Territory to take over all the officers at present em' ployed in connection with it. It may be advisable to make some changes, although I do not say that it will be, but there is no - reason why this Government should be compelled to take over officers unless they are suitable for the work.",73
450,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If possible, places will have to be found for those who are not taken over.",73
451,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Thei r interests are protected under the Northern Territory Surrender Act, passed by the South Australian Parliament.",73
452,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,On the abolition of their offices they are entitled to receive pensions.,73
453,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"That is so. There are some exceptions to the South Australian laws which will continue to apply to the Territory, and if honourable members read clause 11, they will recognise the necessity for taking power to issue Ordinances. That clause provides thatNo Crown lands in the Territory shall be sold or disposed of for any estate of freehold, except in pursuance of some contract entered into before the commencement of this Act. That clause has been inserted in accordance with a promise made to the honourable member for Kooyong, and also to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, whilst the Northern Territory Acceptance Bill was under consideration. Obviously, if no Crown lands in the Territory can be sold, then such South Australian laws as permit of the selling of Crown lands can be of no effect, and we must substitute other laws for them. To that extent, it will be necessary to make certain Ordinances before a complete working scheme is approved in order that lands may be taken up.",73
454,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But the Government will not allow much land to be taken up before it has framed a definite policy.,73
455,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Certainl y not, but it is wholly undesirable that the development of the Territory should be held up any longer than is absolutely necessary. For instance, we desire that certain experiments shall be conducted, and we shall need to permit persons to go on the land to make those experiments.",73
456,Mr GLYNN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That will have to be done before a land policy is adopted.,73
457,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If I were to state that I had a cut-and-dried policy, I should show at onee that I was not really fitted for my office.",73
458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But has not the Government a policy of immigration in regard to the Northern Territory?,73
459,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is such a policy, and it will be submitted at the right time. Since the honourable member has raised the question, however, let me say that I do not suppose it will be possible to successfully people the Northern Territory without adopting a policy of immigration in connection with it. I have not a very wide experience of tropical cultivation, but from what I can learn from others, one of the difficulties connected with tropical development has generally arisen from the fact that areas altogether too large have been taken up. Honourable members will see quite clearly the scope of this Bill. Under it, certain Acts will apply to the Territory, on much the same lines as those adopted under the Seat of Government Administration Bill.",73
460,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is it intended to use Lands Acquisition Act to acquire lands for public purposes?,74
461,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In most cases where leases have been granted, the conditions under which such land may be acquired are set forth in the South Australian Act, by virtue of which the leases were granted. To what extent they would conflict with the Lands Acquisition Act, I cannot on the spur of the moment say.",74
462,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"In clause 9, the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act are applied to the acquisition of land owned in the Territory by any person, for any public purpose.",74
463,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But that does not touch the question of the rights and obligations of lessees under existing leases.,74
464,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable member is referring to future settlement.,74
465,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,It may be necessary to exercise wider powers in connection with big leases and closer settlement.,74
466,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I do not think that we could at present touch the leases that have been granted. They have been granted for a fixed term, and we can alter the conditions of the leases only in accordance with the terms of the Act under which they were granted. Leasehold lands can be resumed for agriculture, and they can also be acquired, if required, for any public utility ; but whether they could be resumed to enable more pastoralists to be settled upon them is a question that is open to doubt, We are taking over the Territory subject to all the obligations of the State of South Australia in connection with it. It is provided that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, the Australian Industries Preservation Act, and the Secret Commissions Act shall apply to it. There is a further provision, which I undertook to insert, to determine the compensation to which an owner is entitled under the Lands Acquisition Act. It declaresThe value of the land shall be taken not to exceed the unimproved value of the land, or the interest therein of the owner, at the date of the passing of this Act, together with the value of his interest in the improvements on the land at the date of the acquisition of the land. That will carry out a promise that I made to the honourable member for Franklin. These are the only points to which 1 need draw the special attention of the House. Whilst we have no cut-and-dried policywhilst I am not prepared at present to in the dicate, even in a general way, the lines of policy that we shall adopt-ou r first vyork will be that of inquiry and investigation as to the best means of developing the known localities in the Territory. The Barklay tablelands, the Victoria Downs country, the MACDonnell Range country, the Victoria, Daly, and Adelaide River flats are all pretty well known; and attention will first have to be directed to the question of how best to develop the lands there. No big work of policy will be undertaken by way of Ordinance; and honourable members will be placed in possession of the decisions of the Cabinet when we have had an opportunity of arriving at them after inquiry. The question of the treatment of the aborigines has been raised, notably by the honourable member for Laanecoorie; and a very useful article on the subject has lately appeared in the Victorian Labour Call. The conditions of the aborigines are not, I think, a credit to us; and we shall have to take the earliest steps for their improvement.",74
467,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Is it intended to continue the existing Administrator in his office, or to appoint a new Administrator?",74
468,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I would rather the honourable member did not ask me to express an opinion. We have taken power to appoint an Administrator, who may be the present Government Resident, or he may not. The Leader of the Opposition asked whether the Public Service Act applies, and I have to say that it does not at the present time, except, of course, to the Postal, Customs, and other Common- ' wealth officials.",74
469,Mr GROOM,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is the State Public Service Act operating there now?,74
470,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Most of the officers are under a State Public Service Act. Some of them belong to the Provisional and Temporary branch, while others are on the fixed list, but most of mem are in a division similar to our General Division. It is not advisable at first place the officers under a Public Service Act, because it may be necessary to have a Territory service. The Papuan service is not under the Public Service Commissioner; and the conditions are such that it might be impossible to transfer men. In the more salubrious parts of the Territory positions might be made interchangeable, because it would give an opportunity for transfer from the parts where extreme heat prevails. It is too soon to talk of a Constitution, but at the earliest possible moment the Government will give the white residents there some representation, of which they have none of any kind at present. There are about 1,500 whites there, but we hope that before long there may be a great many more. The two State members will of course cease to represent them from the ist January supposing that to be the date of the proclamation; and it is not possible to give the people even a vote in the referenda because they relate to questions exclusively between the Federated States and the Commonwealth.",74
471,Mr DEAKI N,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Ballarat) [10.25] Under the circumstanees a Bill of this sort is inevitable to provide for an interregnum, but that interregnum is likely to be unusually long. That is to say, the parliamentary recess will probably be of exceptional length, yet the work to be done in the Territory is of the first importance. This measure merely authorizes the Government, in the vulgar tongue, to do as they "" darned well please "" in the meantime.",75
472,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That is one of the difficulties of the situation.,75
473,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I admit that course seems to be possible; but it would be unfair to allow Ministers to remain Caucus .' blind to their responsibilities. They will be expected to do a great deal during the next twelve months. They are assuming in this Bill and wilfully- I do not say they much choice-a n authority in regard to pointments, which has not been possessed by any previous Government, and which will need to be very discriminatingly cised. They are in a rather embarrassing position, in so far as they are confronted by a number of persons who have been employed by South Australia in, or in nexion with, the Territory, and who mav be, and probably are. of varied qualithe fications or disqualifications. A selection will have to be made. Those officers to will have to be equitably, or even generously, dealt with, though, at the same time, the Commonwealth must have effi- ciency, and at once. One of the strongest motives with a large number of honourable members was the urgency of commencing work in the Territory; and, while every caution which the Minister can display will be required, there will be great disappointment if anything checks the wheels of progress. I quite agree that the task for the next twelve months will be almost wholly one of investigation, inquiry, and research ; and very competent people will have to be chosen for that work. They will need to be sufficiently directed, and yet not tied too fast by any particular instruction given from here. Generally, the Minister is likely to have an extremely interesting and active twelve months under this measure. The chief rocks to avoid are those in connection with appointments, which, I assume, will be of a more or less temporary character until the fuller measure is introduced, and the Minister has made up his minu which officers he desires to retain, and which he is willing or unwilling to part with. In addition, I assume that he will make judicious use of his power since he is going to be a little Parliament .in himself. Whenever he has a spare five minutes he* can pass Ordinances about anything and everything applying over a Territory of enormous extent but of scanty population.",75
474,Mr FRANK FOSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,He will be a Czar!,75
475,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"He will be a Czar in authority; and, no doubt, will be able to furnish comic opera with many incidents, especially in his adventures in supervising, no other the aboriginal population.",75
476,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There is the,75
477,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Minister gets to the Territory, he can snap his fingers even at the Caucus for a time. No doubt there have will be a day of reckoning, and it may apnot be a pleasant one; but for the time being he will be monarch of all he surveys, and almost as lonely in his sway as exerthe celebrated person of whom that was originally said. In the Bill there is unlimited power of legislation and appointment in very few words, but a great deal of conspace is taken up in providing that secret commissions shall not be permitted among aborigines, that the Australian Industries Preservation Act will apply to gold diggers, while the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is to keep the buffaloes in harmony with one another.",75
478,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,There will never be any disputes in such an industrial paradise!,76
479,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Whil e we wish to assist the Minister in every way in dealing with this great problem expeditiously, we are not blind to the fact that we are asked to repose in him a great trust. We shall look to the honourable gentleman to bring home his sheaves by the time Parliament meets. The problems of this Territory will not w a it - if they would we should never have had this Bill-and next session we ought to take decisive steps towards multiplying the population and the productiveness of that part of Australia. The intervening twelve months can be well used, and will not be a day too long. often the Minister need expect suggestions to extravagance from this side, but I urge him not to be penurious. He should use all the time available, and all the assistance he can get, so as to be able, as soon as Parliament re-assembles, to place befoie us some actual propositions to which immediate effect can be given, which will be the means of commencing an expeditious settlement of the Territory. It is a gigantic task, and my sympathies are all with Ministers who are undertaking it, and particularly with the Minister in charge. There is no time to be lost, and, while there is no money to waste, there ought to be none - stinted in this regard. We expect to see under the Minister's, judicious control a good long stride made before we meet again. We hope, also, to find ourselves at that time equipped with sufficient information to legislate positively, instead of in this generous promissory-note fashion and for the time being.",76
480,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Brisbane) [10.31]. - The ist . January has been freely suggested as a suitable date for the issue of the proclamation.,76
481,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I meant to endorse all that the Minister said about the aborigines, and to insist that they should be dealt with at once on a different basis.",76
482,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"I cannot see that there is any particular reason for the haste suggested by the honourable member, and the gigantic character of the task is my reason for suggesting delay for, at least, six months. I see no reason why we should take over the Northern Territory before, at least, the ist July. Immediately we take it over, we take over its liabilities, which are very severe. I presume it would mean that from the ist January until 30th June we should be undertaking a liability of anything from ,£200,000 to ^300,000. If the Government can see their way to find that money, perhaps it is. not for me to complain. The Minister might tell us the exact amount of liability that would be incurred for that six-months' period.",76
483,Mr DEAKIN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Abov e all things, there should not be a day's delay.",76
484,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"It is very easy for the. Leader of the Opposition to suggest haste, because he has no responsibility with regard to the finances.",76
485,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We should not get rid of a penny of liability by delaying the proclamation. It is not Mr FINLAYSON - We have been piling up the Commonwealth expenditure this year, and large expenditure in the future is inevitable. Another reason is the gigantic character of the task, as suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. This Bill would be sufficient to carry on with after ist July next until Parliament met again. I presume that we shall then be faced with a measure giving the Northern Territory some form of responsible government. To postpone the proclamation until ist July would have the additional benefit of not unseating the members for the Territory in the South Australian Parliament until then, and it would not interfere with the development of the Territory in any way. Things will not stagnate there.",76
486,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"They will. They are all hung up, and actually going back. Nothing can be done until the proclamation is issued.",76
487,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If the Ministei took until ist July, he would have practically eight months to consolidate his plans and develop his ideas, and be able then to know exactly what he is going to do. At present, he knows nothing. Admittedly, no scheme has been prepared, and no arrangement made.",76
488,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"We cannot begin to do anything, or put any of our servants on the ground, until it is ours.",76
489,Mr FINLAYSON,NORTHERN TERRITORY,That would not prevent the Minister preparing in his own mind some scheme for the government of the Territory. In his own interests he should take sufficient time to arrange his affairs and formulate his plans.,76

I am disappointed with the Minister's statement regarding the Territory. His Department know nothing about it, and confess their utter inability anything until the Commonwealth actually takes possession. I have been seeing and reading memoranda which have been reeled at all. off by the Department for years past telling us all about the wonderful latent potennearly tialities of the Territory. One would think that the Department knew every river and every patch of mineral country in it, we are told now that they know nothing about it and cannot begin to know, or even inquire, until formal possession taken place. This is a revelation to me. The Department seem to have been making believe all these years, and it has been to the Minister to-night to say that not, and cannot, know anything.",76
491,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I only repeated what I said on the second reading of the AcceptBill ance Bill.,77
492,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The honourable subject. member gave us ever so many arguments .in his second-reading speech as to why should take the Territory over. They were the House. not arguments of national necessity, but related to the development of the Territory. Now we are told that he does not know anything about the Territory which he going to develop, or how, or where, he going to begin. It is a poor lookout for the Department, who seem to be absolutely ignorant of a matter with which they have had relations for years past. I am blaming the honourable member, but I am blaming the Department, who I should thought would have matured, by this time, some proposal, which, in rough outline, any rate, could have been sketched to the House as the probable line of procedure to be adopted when the Territory was taken over. I may have expected too much, but that, was my opinion, and I do not why it could not have been done. Visits have been made to the Territory. We not told whether the Minister has any plans for building a railway. _ All he us is that a flying survey is to be made. With what object? Is it for the construcamined tion of a railway or for rinding out what lands are available for settlement?",77

Now that we have decided to take over the Territory the utmost expedition are should be used in doing something with it. I admit that it is not an easy matter, tells and hope the Minister will be equal to the occasion. He should have the country exby competent persons, both in regard to the portion suitable for cultivation and also in regard to the railway routes that are thought necessary in order to develop it. We can do nothing with it unless we provide means of transit through it. sooner we set about that the better. The interest on the loans raised by South will be large in itself, and will loom very large, especially if we are not doing anything with the Territory. There are plenty of competent persons whose services can be obtained to examine the country and report on it in a few months, especially in regard to railway routes and the lands that should be surveyed along ihe railways and opened up for settlement. A good deal has been said here, especially this session, about the scarcity of land in the Commonwealth, and the difficulty experienced by people who want to get land. That statement will never be able to be made with any justice in the future, because we have all these millions of acres of land awaiting settlement. It has also been stated by persons who think themselves competent to speak on the subject that the climate of the Territory is salubrious, and that white men, women, and children can live and work well there. If this is so-and the Labour party say it is-how can it ever be said again that there is any difficulty about obtaining land for immigrants and other intending settlers? If the people about here want more land-if they are crowded out-all that the Government need to say to them will "" There are immense areas of fertile lands with a fairly salubrious climate, where you can work out your destiny, if not under peculiarly good circumstances, at any rate under circumstances of which the Labour party approve."" Honourable members opposite contend that white men as well as coloured men can work in any part of Australia. That being so, they have a great opportunity to utilize this Territory to the fullest. I hope that honourable members opposite, who have always been eager for the transfer of the country to the Commonwealth, with the object of making it the home of thousands of our own race, will be ready to send their nearest and dearest there to live. The Bill is a mere skeleton, and, no doubt, with the power to make Ordinances the Minister will be able to arrange for its provisional government - I hope that he will do a great deal in the coming year in connection with the examination of the country and ' the selection of railway routes. 1 do not know why provision is made for an Administrator. In Papua we have a Lieutenant-Governor and an Administrator, both of whom, perhaps, assume the title of Excellency. I have always understood that an Administrator was a sort of subordinate Governor, exercising, perhaps, the Royal prerogative. Sir John Forrest.",77

505,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The title of Government Resident would be sufficient. As a matter of fact, with telegraph communication, all business of importance will Be transacted by the Minister himself.

509,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Seeing that there is neither an Executive nor a Legislative Council in the Northern Territory, and that the salary to be paid to a representative there will be a .small one, the title of Administrator is inappropriate, as it is also in Papua where there is a Lieutenant Governor. We expect the Minister, now be:- that the Territory has been transferred to the Commonwealth, to make use of it, and without any delay. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses i to 5 agreed to. Clause 6 (Application of Commonwealtk Conciliation and Arbitration. Act 19041910).",78
510,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Parramatta) [ - S4]--How will the aplication of ComIO monwealth Acts affect the operation of South Australian Acts within the Territory?,78
511,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Our laws will override those of South Australia where there is conflict.,78
512,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Is it proposed to declare that certain South Australian laws will apply?,78
513,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; they all will apply except as modified by our Ordinances, or where they come into conflict with the Commonwealth Acts which have been made to apply.",78
514,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The sooner we have a proper system of government for the Territory the better. The Bill strikes me as merely a political placard. What reason is there for applying the Conciliation and Arbitration Act or the Australian Industries Preservation Act to the Territory? 'Are there likely to be any labour disputes there? Are tliere any flourishing industries there in which disputes are likely to arise, or is there any trust or monopoly which will have to be dealt with ? - These provisions sound very well, and, perhaps, were intended to hide the fact that the Territory will cost us ,£250,000 a year. Why were these particular Statutes selected for application ?",78
515,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Because they are specially appropriate. Clause agreed to. Clauses 7 and 8 agreed to. Clause 9 (Application of Lands Acquisition Act 1906).,79
516,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Swan) [10.59]. - The provision that for the determining of compensation the value of land acquired by the Commonwealth shall be taken not to exceed its unimproved value or the interest therein of the owner at the date of the passing of the Act, together with the value of his interest in the improvements on the land'at the date of its acquisition, will be a fair one if the land is resumed within a reasonable time, but it will not be fair if the land is not resumed for, say, twenty years -. This provision will stand in the way of improvements being made. If the Government want it, they should take it within a reasonable time ; but to say that this provision shall apply for all time, that after many years the Government are to go back and ascertain the value of the land at the date of the passing of this Act, is altogether unreasonable. A similar provision was inserted in other Bills where it was intended to take over land within a reasonable time.",79
517,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Does the honourable member contemnlate a depreciation of values?,79
518,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If a depreciation did take place, the land would still have to be taken over at its value at the time of the passing of this measure. It was never intended that such a provision as this should be beid in terrorem over the people, and I enter my protest against it. Clause agreed to, Clause 10 agreed to. Clause 11 (Disposal of Crown lands).",79
519,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Parramatta) £11.3] - Here , again, we have another political placard.",79
520,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,This is no placard.,79
521,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Then I should like to hear the reason for the insertion this clause.,79
522,Mr BATCHELOR,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"There is a similar provision in the Act relating to the administration of Papua, and other Federal Territory.",79
523,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Surely the Government do not propose to administer the Northern Territory on the lines of the administration of Papua. The honourable member has said that he is looking to this Territory as a suitable place in which to settle immigrants. That is part of the Government's immigration policy. I should like to know what they expect to get in the way of immigration under a policy of leasing all these tropical areas. I ask the honourable member, in all serious ness, whether he thinks that immigrant!, will be attracted by these leasehold conditions in respect of tropical areas when they can obtain freehold conditions in other - parts of the world in moderate latitudes?",79
524,Mr WEBSTER,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Will they go to the Northern Territory under any conditions?,79
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"If it is a place to which no one will ever go, why is the Government so anxious to prevent the land there from coming under settlement? 1 think that this clause was inserted for political purposes.",79
526,Mr ROBERTS,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The honourable membersuggests that people can get a piece of land in the Old Country.,79
527,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"No ; but they can go to Canada, and obtain land under a climate of a very different kind.",79

529,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Notwithstand ing that, no fewer than 250,000 people are annually going to Canada. Has the Government any hope of settling immigrants in the Northern Territory unless they can obtain land there, and possess, it as their own? I shall vote against the clause. Clause agreed to.' Clauses iz and 13 agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill read a third time. ADJOURNMENT. BUDGET DEBATE-ORDE R OF BUSINESS. Motion (by Mr HUGHES) proposed - That the House do new adjourn.",79
530,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Swan) [11.9} I ask the-Acting Prime Minister when the of Budget will be discussed. Some honourable members, including myself, intend to leave for our homes next week, and we should like an opportunity to discuss the Budget before we do so. There should be an opportunity on Tuesday or on some earlier occasion of discussing the Budget. It has to be discussed at some time, and the subject has already been delayed inordinately. If the Acting Prime Minister will not afford me an opportunity I cannot help it ; but I wish to be perfectly straightforward in saying that though I should like to have one, I cannot avail myself of it unless it be afforded on Friday or Tuesday.",79
531,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"West Sydney-Actin g Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [ II . II ] - I should like to give the right honourable member for Swan an opportunity of discussing the Budget, but he has placed me in rather an awkward position, with inclination and duty struggling for mastery. The right honourable member has informed us that he is going away from Melbourne, and he also asks me to put down the Budget for discussion before he goes. Well, one has had very fair experience of discussions lately, and I should have been inclined to put off discussion on this matter as long as possible. Still, however, I should like to give the right honourable member a chance to speak if he is really going away. I may, therefore, mention that it is our intention to proceed with the Tariff Anomalies Bill until it is finally dealt with. There then remain to be discussed the Defence Bill, a Judiciary Bill, a small Bill introduced by my colleague the Minister of Home Affairs relating to the referendum, a Bill relating to Customs Administration which has already passed, the Senate, 'and a Supply Bill. We can possibly deal with the Tariff Anomalies Bill, and the BUls in charge of my colleagues, the Minister of Home Affairs and the Minister of Trade and Customs, before Friday afternoon. If that be the case, I shall be very glad to give the right honourable member from 3 to 4 o'clock on Friday in which to make his speech, if that will serve his purpose. Will that be enough?",80
532,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Yes .,80
533,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"Well , I make that suggestion.",80
534,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,The gentleman ought to recognise that it is altogether unprecedented not to have had the Budget discussed at an earlier date.,80
535,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The whole position is unprecedented. At any rate, the right honourable member will admit that we have not wasted any time. I do not owe him anything.",80
536,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,I do not want anythingfrom the honourable gentleman either.,80
537,Mr HUGHES,NORTHERN TERRITORY,But I shall be glad to go even out of my way to give bim an opportunity to speak on the Budget before he leaves Melbourne.,80
538,Sir JOHN FORREST,NORTHERN TERRITORY,Pleas e yourself. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned nt 11.13 p.m. honourable,80
