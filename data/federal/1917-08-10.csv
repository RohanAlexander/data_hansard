2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Las t night, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked me whether, after the mention of a constituency in Hansard, the name of the member representing it could not be inserted in brackets. He statod that owing to changes in the representation of constituencies, he had occasionally, when reading the Hansard report, been put to the inconvenience of haying to refer to the records to ascertain who was the member representing some particular constituency at the time when the speech he was reading was made. In accordance with my promise to the honourable member, I have conferred with the Principal Parliamentary Reporter concerning, this matter, and he has furnished to me the following memorandum :-The suggestion that ithe names of honourable men? .members should generally follow in the Hansard reports the designation of their constituencies was considered by the Speaker first Commonwealth Parliament (Sir Frederick Bolder), but was not adopted, the Speaker fearing that it would lead ultimately to frequent breaches of the parliamentary rule that members must address one another only by the titles of their constituencies. I have further considered the matter, and it seems to me that the fear apparently' expressed by Sir Frederick Holder, when Speaker, that members might get into the habit of referring to each other by name in debate instead of by the titles of their constituencies need'not be entertained, as the Speaker or Chairman would intervene to insure observance of the rules of debate. I have issued the instruction that in future what the honourable member has for shall be done. The following papers were presented - Elections and Referendums-Statistica turns in relation to the Senate Election and the General Election for the House of 1917; and Summaries of Elections and Referendums, 1903-17. Elections, 1917 - Statistica l Returns showing the Voting within each Subdivision in relation to the Senate Eleotion and the General Election for the House of Representatives, viz. :New South Wales.

4,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I did not promise to obtain employment for those who came te see me. Some of them stated that they were returned soldiers, and had been dismissed, while other hands appointed at a later date had been retained, and I promised to have an inquiry made into the matter. This is being done.",4

10,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"No payment is made by the Commonwealth to State hospitals for the maintenance of inmates who are pensioners. The matter, however, is under consideration. WAR - TI ME PROFITS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL .",5
11,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"W it h reference to the ported Win-the-War caucus yesterday, and its consideration of the War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill , .I ask the Minister for the Navy if the Government considers the measure as vital to its fate, and is it going to permit amendments to be made in it?",5
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The Government intends to proceed with the Wartime Profits Tax Assessment Bill , and will consider any intelligent amendment fro m any quarter whatever. SECOND READING . Debate resumed fro m 1st August (vide page 707), on motion of Sir JOH N FORREST That this Bill be now read a second time. Mr 'TTJDOR (Yarra) [11.9] - I am glad to see the Treasurer in his place, because it was stated in the eently that he was indisposed, and might not be able to be with us today. As amendment to the questionbefore the House, I move That the following words be added :in the opinion of this House the Bill is utterly inadequate, and signally fails to place upon wealth its due share of the expenses of war."" Although we have now entered upon the fourth year of the war, the Treasurer tells us thati all the revenue he expects to from this Bill in connection with the operations of a period of two years is less than £1,000,000.",5
13,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"He says now £1,000,000 ",5
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In his Budget speech, the Treasurer stated 'that he expects to receive £1,000,000, but his earlier statement was that the proposed taxation would return only £900,000. Accepting the larger figure, it means a revenue from war profits of only £500,000 a year, - which is utterly inadequate. During the election campaign the Prime Minister described the manifesto of the Labour Party as ab-' solutely spineless. I should like to hear what he would say of this Bill were he now in Opposition. It is so anaemic that, as they would say in some parts of my electorate, it would not have strength to fight its way out of a wet tissue-paper bag. The Bill has beenbrought in late; it allows too high a rate of profit ; and it provides too many exemptions. The Treasurer in his opening speech told us the rate charged by the British Government refor the first year of the war, the financial year ended on the 30th June, 1915. This Bill , however, will affect profits made prior t'o that date. The Treasurer told us that the British Act allows companies to keep 6 per cent, of their profits untaxed, and private persons 7 per cent. For the first year of the war, 50 per cent, of all profits beyond those rates was taken by the Government, in the next year, I think, 60 or 65 per cent., and 80 per cent, in the financial year which ended on the 30th June last. In Canada the untaxed profits allowed is only 7 per cent., and the Government takes 25 per cent, of any profits beyond that, but itaxes a 15 and 20 per cent, excess at 50-per cent., and one exoeeding 20 per cent., 75 per cent.",5
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The Canadian rates newspapers reare less than ours.,5
16,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes , but I contend that an our legislation should follow the British Act. We should not allow such a high rate of profit before taxing the excess. "" But Some honourable members have said that it is proposed to f ax not war profits but warthe time profits. If the intention be to tax war-time profits, it would be easier to increase the income tax by levying a tax of 10s. or 15s., or even £ 1 , on every £ 1 get exceeding a certain amount of income. The Labour party, in its manifesto, issued prior to the recent elections, proposed a war-time profits tax on the basis of 50 per oent. of excess profits for the year which ended on the 30th June, 1915, and of 60 per cent, for the year which ended on the 30th June, 1916.",5
17,Mr MAXWELL,Unknown,Was that a war-time profits tax or a war profits tax ?,6
18,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"A war-time profits tax. We advocated a tax of 100 per cent, on excess profits after 1916, for the duration of the war. No person sbould be allowed to make excess profits in war-time. Our Bill would have allowed a reasonable return on invested capital. A Board of Referees would have been appointed to deal with Australian companies operating outside Australia, and new business and any local circumstances which might cause harshness or injustice.",6
19,Sir JOHN FOHREST,Unknown,Would that Bill have brought' in more revenue than tins Bill will produce 1,6
20,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not know.,6
21,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"The policy of the honourable member's party was, I think, to leave everything to the Board of Referees.",6
22,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Treasurer will correct me if I am in error in stating that the proposal for the appointment of a Board of Referees is practically the same in the various measures that have been submitted, and that the alterations which have been made are the result of experience of this class of taxation in other countries. It was intended that the Board of Referees should deal with new businesses, cases of hardship, and with enterprises such as tin mining companies, whose head oflices are in Australia, but whose operations are carried on outside the Commonwealth. In order to avoid payment of this tax such companies' are proposing to register outside Australia. I understand that one of them has already transferred its head-quarter's from Sydney to the Malay States. I hope that when we go into Committee the Treasurer will accept an amendment providing that the tax shall begin with the financial year ending 30th June, 1915.",6
23,Mr WISE,Unknown,That was never proposed by any Government.,6
24,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am entitled, at all events, to express my own opinion as to when the tax should begin to operate. In the financial year ending 30th June, 1915, there were eleven months of war, and some of the largest profits resulting from the war were made during that period. Mr. JOSEPH COOK.*-I presume that the honourable member for Capricornia, Mr. Higgs, also shares the honourable member's view as to the date en which this tax began to operate.",6
25,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,He has already spoken on the motion for the second reading of this Bill ; but my amendment will afford him another opportunity to place his views before the House.,6
26,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We shall be glad to hear him repudiate this monstrosity which the honourable member proposes.,6
27,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member may so describe my proposal, but I repeat that we ought to ante-date this tax to the starting of the war. Every one knows that when the war broke out there were large stocks of certain goods held in Melbourne, and in every other State capital, and that as soon as difficulty was experienced, as the result of the war, in t obtaining further supplies, the prices of those goods were increased to an enormous amount. My remark applies not only to groceries, but to such materials as iron. We have all read with interest the reports of a recent debate in the Victorian State Parliament, during which figures were given showing how the prices of certain iron goods have increased. There was no increase in the cost of landing these goods before the war, nor can it be said that there was any increase in the cost to the consignee of goods that were landed here for the first two or three months after the war. They were en route to Australia before the war broke out, but as the difficulty of obtaining supplies increased, the price of these goods to the consumer was lifted, even though large stocks were held by some persons in Australia.. Then again, large consignments were held up for nearly twelve months in South Africa. These had left the country of production before the war, and, therefore, were bought at pre-war rates, but huge profits were made upon them. I am anxious that the Government should, at least, get a fair share of the profits so made.",6
28,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,Unknown,The honourable member and his party were in office f a long time after the war broke out.,7
29,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not complain of such an interjection. I would point out to the House, however, that in ' the first part of the first session of the last liament-in 1914-15-w e dealt with war legislation. In 1915 the date. then Treasurer, Mr Fisher, proposed to introduce a War-time Profits Bill , but will be done. before he could do so he was appointed High Commissioner, and left for Engstatement. land. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs), who succeeded him as Treasurer, introduced such a B reasons with which every honourable member of the last Parliament is familiar, i was not proceeded with. The facts that early in January, 1916, the present rate of taxation. Prime Minister went to England, and that there was a definite understanding between all parties in the House ing his absence no controversial legislation should be dealt with. We dealt only with Supply. There were two adjournnew ments of the Parliament during the preGreat sent Prime Minister's absence in Engauthorities land, and on each occasion that the House met I took his place as senior Minister, that I have an intimate knowledge of a the facts. It was because of this underthis standing that our War-time Profits B i was not pushed through Parliament. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - Did not the honourable member for Capricornia (M Higgs) say, when he introduced the B i l that the additional revenue which it would provide was not required at that period ?",7
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not know whether it was wanted or not. I do know, howduced ever-indee d it is common knowledgethat many companies and business firms have paid these excess profits into reserve funds in order to meet taxation of this kind. Practically every company and business firm, knowing that the tax would be ante-dated, has made provision i way to meet it .",7
31,Mr KELLY,Unknown,But surely only anteages dated to the extent named in the previous Bill.,7
32,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is for the say to what extent the tax shall be antedated, but I certainly think that the surer's proposal, under which some como r panies will be taxed in respect of one period .of eleven monifchs whereas others will not, is a very clumsy one. It is far better that the tax should come into operation, in respect of all excess profits, as from the one given date, regardless of Parwhether companies and business firms only balance on the 30th June or on some other",7
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I believe that that,7
34,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I am glad to have that,7
35,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We are following ill , but for the English Act .",7
36,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am rather anxious t that we should follow the English Act in are another direction, and that is as to the",7
37,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The Britis h tax at the outset was not as high as it is today. that durI t has been increased.,7
38,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Every Department profits by experience. This was an absolutely form of taxation when introduced in Britain, and no doubt the Imperial have profited by the experience gained. We, too, may profit by their exso perience. The Treasurer doubtless knows l l a great deal more about the operation of tax in other lands than his predecesl l sor did, because he has been able to take advantage of a fuller experience of its incidence. The Treasurer, in introducing the Bill , r . said that he anticipated that it would l , yield only about £900,000 in respect of the two years' period. If we cannot hope for more than that, then the right honourable gentleman 'might well have introa measure calculated to bring in a bigger return. Since the introduction of this Bill the complete financial proposals of - tthe Government have been submitted to the House. We now know that the only new taxation they contemplate is that for which this Bill provides, and an additional income tax of 10 per cent, with a n that minimum of £ 1 0 on single men and widowers, without children, between the of twenty-one and forty-five years.",7
39,Sir JOHN FOBREST,Unknown,I suppose the honourable member thinks that we should House to have proposed more taxation ?,7
40,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do. I consider that Treathe taxation proposals of the Government are inadequate to meet the needs of the situation. What is more, I believe that many of the supporters of the Government hold the same view, and I trust that they will support my amendment!. Having regard to the number of exemptions for which the Treasurer has provided in this Bill it is no wonder that he does not anticipate collecting under it! more than £900,000 in respect of the two years' period. The principle of the Bill should be that any person who has made excess profits owing to the war or during the war period should be called upon to pay a wartime profits tax. Under the. Bill as it stands a profit of 10 per cent, is allowed, and superimposed upon that is an exemption of £ 2 0 0. Thereafter only 50 per cent, of the excess profits is to be taken by the Commonwealth. It is well known that the output of many firms and companies has enormously increased. A very interesting return based on the Victorian State income figures was recently pub before the Legislative Assembly by Sir Alexander Peacock. I have, a copy of that return in which he selected typical cases showing the profits made in 1914, 1915, and 1916. He was careful, of course, nob to give the name of any individual taxpayer, and the return does not show what particular industry or industries were carried on by the persons or companies concerned. It shows, however, large increases in profits since the outbreak of war, and there is every reason to believe that what hashappened in Victoria has happened in all the other States. I have been unable, unfortunately, to 'obtain similar information in regard to any other State, b ut the Treasurer, I feel sure, could obtain from the Commonwealth Income Tax Department' similar particulars showing the profits made by individual companies or firms in 50 or 100 typical cases throughout the Commonwealth. Such a return would give us some idea of the profits that have been made during the war. I propose to quote forty-one of the 265 cases, the net profits in the whole of which, including any amount set apart for reserve in the respective years, were £3,958,885 in 1914, £4,371,733 in 1915, and £5,479,895 in 1916, showingan increase of over £1,000.000 on the previous year, and in the two years the increase is over £1,500,000.",7
41,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,Then the estimate must be wrong. Mr Tudor.,8
42,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not know whether the Treasurer's estimate is wrong or not.

I regret that we have no opportunity of knowing the types of business to which the return relates, and what commodities are *being dealt with by them. Honourable members know that when the drought of 1914-15 afflicted the Commonwealth, farmers growing sheep and lambs had to sell their stock at any price they could get because of the lack of grass. That stock was sold at a very low rate in the city markets, and was put into cold storage. When it was brought out and sold, big profits were made from it . Very little of it was sent oversea.",10
85,Mr FALKINER,IN THE STATE PARLIAMENT HOUSE WHEN HE,"A lot of sheep died, and were not sent anywhere. Is iti fair to compare the incomes; of 1914-15, when the pastoralists received practically no return, with those of 1916, when conditions were again normal ?",10

For case. instance, there may be about two manufacturing chemists in Victoria, two three in New South Wales, and one in ability. South Australia. If a return were given for any one of those firms, its competitors would know exactly upon what business was working. No harm' would be done by publishing the nature business in cases where it would be impossible to identify the particular individual or company. Even with the return which they not be exempt? I have given, people who study the financial columns of .the press will pick out the companies to which the figures relate. Great increases have taken place in the prices of foodstuffs. Mr Knibbs has prepared for me the figures for the years 1913 to 1916, and I have taken from the press the information 1917. I stated yesterday that no person can have any objection to increases i price when the cost of production has i creased. The producer is as much ,to a fair rate of profit as any other individual in the community, but that does not apply to increases which are sult of artificial increases of the prices of land or stock. Where land which has been your own class. brought into use for the production these commodities has been raised from £4 0 to £ 5 0 per acre, when it is really worth only £ 4 0 , the consumer ought to be required to pay for the fictitious land value.

119,Mr TUDOR,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) suggested the other day that the Bill be with drawn. He pointed out that the New Zealand Act. was to be repealed because it was ineffective, and he had his doubts even about, the English Act. Let me quote Mr Bonar Law, the geneChancellor of the Exchequer, whom hontheir orable members will regard as a greater authority on the English Act than even elec- the honourable member for Kooyong. In the Argus o i 5th July last appeared a cable regarding war profits in the shipping trade. In this Mr Bonar Law was reported to have saidHe had invested £8,100 in fifteen shipping companies running, tramp steamers. Five per cent, on that would be £405, whereas he had received £3,615 in dividends in 1915, and £3,847 in dividends in 1010, after having paid excess profits. Joseph Palmer and Sons' monthly share list, compiled to 19th July, 1917-the last issue-ha s the following with regard to the Union Steam-ship CompanyNot to go back too far, it will be sufficient to start from the concluding quarter of the year 1005, when Union shares, then £10 paid, were selling at £15. A purchase of three shares at that time would have cost' £45. Two years later, in December, 1907, the company issued bonus shares in the proportion of one to three, and immediately afterwards subdivided each Prime £10 share into ten of £1. The purchasers of You are the original three for £45 would, therefore, receive forty of £1 without further cost. These new shares gradually improved in the market to about 45s., when, in February, 1913, the company issued, at 10s. premium, new £1 shares in the proportion of one to four. The.original purchase would now represent fifty shares on the outlay of a further £15 capital. Thus for £60 the holder would nave acquired fifty shares worth 42s. each in the market. A few months afterwards bonus preference shares were issued share for share, so the £60 capital had acquired 100 shares (fifty ordinary and fifty preference) in the company. Thence onwards the ordinary shares, which had naturally fallen to 22s. after the preference issue, steadily rose, t ill today the value is 61s. The preference have remained steady at 21s. The original £60 invested has therefore appreciated to £205 up t ill now. Most of our clients, acting on our advice, sold their preference shares, and reinvested in ordinaries at very nearly the same price. In their case the £60 will have improved to about £300.",12
120,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,Palme r are squatters' agents. That shows how fair they are.,13
121,Mr TUDOR,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"We have a right to let the public know what is being done by people whose stock is watered in this way. There are companies in this city whose profits have been increasing to such an extent that it is difficult for them to know what to do with them. They have watered their stock time after time. Some of them' would be included i u the list which Sir Alexander Peacock recently had prepared for income-tax purposes, showing the in crease in profits. We have now, I presume, the full finansial proposals of the Government. I could touch on other shipping companies. Honourable members knowwhat the White Star Company has paid.",13

125,Mr TUDOR,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"I have no doubt that these companies are well insured. The premiums are high, but the constant loss of ships has made the value of the remaining - shipping go up. In pre-war days a new steam-ship could be launched for £ 8 per ton. You cannot buy ships today for under £ 7 5 per ton, and ship-owners themselves expect that the price will soon top £100 per ton. When we see these companies malting inordinate profits, and piling money away into their reserves, we have a right 'to ask the Treasurer so to frame his Bill as to make wealth pay its full share. That is why I move the amendment. In view of the number of exemptions proposed and the small amount, of excess profits that the Treasurer intends to take, I trust honourable members 'will see that, if the Bill is not withdrawn, it is at least so amended by the Government in Committee,in the in terests of the bulk of the community as to place upon wealth its fair share of the expense of this, the most awful war that has ever happened to mankind.",13

To attack the Government in the manner in which he has done not is to attack it in regard to part of its The estimated revenue is £1,000,000; I hope that the return will really be greater. I am not in a position to offer an authoritative personal opinion on the point, and must accept the information which has been given to me, but if the honourable member had challenged the Government in a formal way, the Prime Minister would, of course, be here to defend the policy of the Government. The amendment is an attack by a side wind, and really places the honourable member in an awkward position. He was a member of the Government which introduced the original measure, which, like those which have succeeded it , was based on the British Act, subsequent Bills having been altered in detail only by successive Treasurers. As the British Act has been in operation for three years, it is entitled to some consideration. The original Bill , 1 Act, was introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) when Treasurer of a Government of which the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Tudor) was Minister for Trade and Customs. I gathered from the speech of the latter that he is disappointed because the Government has not proposed more taxation. That, to my ears, is a new complaint. I have never before heard a Government condemned for taxing too l it t l e ; the complaint to which I have been accustomed is that the taxation is too much. The honourable member complains that our taxation will not h it certain persons and certain classes sufficiently hard. In that I believe him to be mistaken. The Bill , with its defectsand, no doubt, it has some-wil l strike those persons who have made more money during the war than they were making before the war. That is the principle of the Bill . If you have not done any better during the war than you were doing before the war you will not be taxed, but if you have done better you will be taxed. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Yarr a has said, the Bill will tax those who have made more money during the war than they were making before it broke out. That is the principle of the Bill.",14
143,Mr RODGERS,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,The honourable member for Yarra gave a long list of persons who would be taxed.,15
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"I do not think that there axe many in this House or the country who are reslly disappointed because the taxation proposals of the Government are not more drastic. It shows what a good Government we are when we deal with the finances of the country in such a way that every one is surprised that what was anticipated in the way of, taxation has not been proposed.",15
145,Mr HIGGS,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Y o u are postponing responsibilities. ' Sir JOHN FORREST - Our method of finance is to deal with our liabilities as they occur year by year. I do not thinkany one would say that you should i m pose taxation this year to meet the prospective liabilities of next year. We impose taxation this year to provide the revenue needed for the year, and next year's needs will be met in a similar way when they occur. We have tried to finance the war fairly, by encouraging enterprise and helping those based on that engaged in industry to increase the production of wealth. There has been no drastic retrenchment, no dismissal of men from Government employment. There has been no shutting down of any of the avenues of employment and no attack upon any section or class of the community. So far as any evidence of partisan feeling or disunion is to be found in the proposals of the Government, we appear to be one of the most harmonious communities in the world. As to one or two matters to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred, I may say at once that I am quite in accord with him that the beginning' and ending of the taxable profit-earning period shall be the same for every one. Further, as .the B i ll really declares, any exemption for which the Bill provides will not extend to any other person who may subsequently trade in the goods to be produced. In considering the question of the adequacy of these taxation proposals, I ask honourable members not to overlook the fact that all profits made by any individual or company in this country will be subject to the ordinary income tax upon the existing graduated scale, no matter from what source the income may come. This war-time profits tax is another tax superimposed upon the existing income tax. Those who have made any war-time profits under this Bill will pay not only this taxation but income tax on the existing graduated scale. That is fact of which we ought not to los sight. As to the extraordinary contention that the taxation proposals are not sufficiently onerous, I think that taxation in Australia is steadily moving upwards. A return prepared by Mr . Knibbs shows that in respect; of the year 1915-16 the income £4,436,997, and that of that amount persons enjoying an income of £1,000 per annum or more paid 84.2 per cent.; those who received £200 a year, and less thaD £1,000 a year, paid 12 per cent., and those taxpayers receiving less than £200 a year, of whom there were some 167,853, paid only 3.8 per cent, of the tax. Somu people would have us believe that those who have been more fortunate than others in the race for wealth pay practically nothing by way of taxation, but here we have it that they paid 84.2 per cent, of the £4,436,997 raised by way of income tax in one year. Those unreasonable and .unfair critics should at least endeavour to - be fair. The Leader of the Opposition has said that our taxatiou is not drastic -.enough. He seems to be anxious to ruin .every oue, even when the Government - considers the proposed taxation sufficient. 3 would remind him that with a population of slightly less than 5,000,000, we estimate to raise this year a revenue of £35,181,655 , as against a revenue of £22,419,798 raised in 1914-15. We have thus an increase of £12,761,857 in three* years. That, however, seems to be not even noticed, so far as the Opposition is concerned.",15
146,Mr MCWILLIAMS,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,All that is spent as soon as it is raised.,16
147,Sir JOHN PORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"The honourable member, having regard for his astuteness, ought not to make such a remark. The people who contribute the revenue are often not chiefly benefited by its expenditure. I requested the Government Statistician to prepare a return showing our taxation per head of the population as compared with that borne by the people of the Old Country. In the return furnished by him it is shown that the Commonwealth and State taxation per head in 1915-16 was £ 6 8s. 5d. in the Commonwealth as compared with £ 6 6s. I d . per head in Great Britain. It cannot"" be said, therefore, that the taxation borne by the people of Australia is not fairl y heavy. Then, again, I invite honourable members to consider our war expenditure out of revenue. In 1914-15 our war expenditure out of revenue amounted to £540,217, and it has been gradually rising until in respect of the current financial year it is estimated that it will be £13,109,-351. In 1916-17 our war expenditure out of revenue amounted to £8,406,970, while this year tax yielded we estimate that it w i ll be £13,109,351, showing an increase of £4,702,381 for the year.",16

149,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,The honourable member should not make such a statement.,16
150,Mr MATHEWS,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,It is a fact.,16
151,Sir JOHNFORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,I am glad to say it is not a fact.,16
152,Mr MATHEWS,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,The Government ought to expend the money on reproductive works.,16
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"The honourable member's party was in power for years. We now have the responsibility of control in accordance with the voice of the people, and he ought to be fair . In conclusion, I have only to say that the Governmenb have already given caref u l consideration to other matters to which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has referred, and that in Committee we shall, place before honourable members certain amendments which, I hope, will go a long way towards meeting many of the objections that have been made to the Bill .

156,Mr WEST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"East Sydney) [12.40],-In his reply to the able speech made by the Leader of the Opposition, the Treasurer has touched on practically everything but the provisions of the Bill itself. I hold the view that the Bill has been hurriedly prepared, and has not received at the hands of the Government that attention which should be given, particularly at this time in our history, to every financial sure. The defects of the Bill are probably due to the fact, that it had to be hurriedly prepared in consequence of the refusal of the Opposition to debate the motion for the adoption of the Address-inReply. We were so anxious to give the Government every opportunity to proceed with their win-the-war policy that we refrained from debating that motion, with the result that the Government suddenly found themselves called upon to provide new business for the consideration of the Parliament. The amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition is, I am confident, in accordance with the wishes of the people. The electors of Australia would gladly relegate to obscurity the B as it stands. No Governmeut who was sincerely desirous of taxing war profits would have brought forward so inadequate a measure. The taxation of war profits is now engaging the attention of practically ever belligerent country. I do not know how any man of intelligence can be expected to accept the statement of supporters of the Government that practically no excess profits have been made in Australia since the outbreak of the war. We have been shown by the Treasurer that our revenue in 1914-15 was only £22,419,798, and that, this year we expect to raise £35,181,655 . All this additional revenue has been expended, and there has also been a tremendous expenditure of loan moneys since the outbreak of the war. Is it reasonable, therefore, to say that no excess war profits have been made in the community in which this expenditure has for the most part taken place? Every addition to the expenditure of the Government means an addition to the wealth of the people. Prices of commodities generally have also largely - increased since the war, and in these circumstances it is absurd to try to make a body of public men, engaged in the work of providing for the repatriation of our soldiers, come to the conclusion that no war profits have been made in Australia. These men deserve some recompense, and ousrht,-at least, to be placed in as good a position as they were before the war. If individuals and companies in business were satisfied with their profits in 1913, they ought to be satisfied with similar profits now, for Ave all know that then Australia was extremely prosperous, and mea- that, but for the unfortunate war, the countiy would, to use a common phrase, "" have stood on velvet."" It is absurd to contend that there are no excess war profits. I am satisfied that the intelligent Democracy of Australia is not of that opinion. The Bill may be one for Committee, but on the second reading it ought to be discussed on broad lines, because, when the individual clauses are under consideration, we are confined to the strict scope of the measure. My own opinion is that the Bill ought to be. withdrawn, and another introduced more in accord with the wishes of the community. When the Treasurer was asked what rei l l venue he expected to obtain from this taxation, he very promptly replied that he anticipated £900,000 for the two years, or £450,000 per annum. It is proposed, after the first year, to take 50 per cent, of the profits, and subsequently 75 per cent.; and, after-the figures quoted by the Leader of the Opposition, that certainly does not seem exorbitant. Those figures bear the impress of a departmental return, and would seem to show that the officers are not of the opinion that the Bill w i ll not touch all war profits, but only a section. When we bear in mind the enormous profits there disclosed, we cannot wonder that the press of Australia regard the Bill as one which should not be tolerated by an intelligent Parliament. The Treasurer, in his characteristic bluff way, said that we on this side were most extreme in our views .when we agitated for the taking of the whole of the profits; but the right honourable gentleman ought to bear in mind that during this war the best blood of Australia has been spent in the defence of our liberties, and that it is only fairand equitable that those who find themselves in such prosperous financial circumstances-and that chiefly owing to the war-shoul d pay their share of the cost. Similar legislation excited a good deal of opposition in England; but nothwifchstanding ""that fact, the British Government, unlike the Commonwealth Government, have refused to allow those concerned 10 per cent., and have fixed 6 per cent, in the case of companies, and 7 per cent, in the case of private persons. Why should we not do the same here? The British Government have provided that 80 per cent, of the profits shall be devoted to the country^ during the war period; and my personal opinion is that the .whole of the profits ought to go into the Treasury. In Sydney lately, Sir Anderson Stuart, who is the President of the Australian Branch of the British Medical Association, in formed the public that members of the profession in that city were earning from £9,000 to £16,000 and £17,000 a year. Sir Anderson Stuart is a man who takes a prominent part in public affairs, and his statement, so far, has not been challenged. Of course, no one can object to professional men receiving adequate payment for their work; and, as in all other businesses, the abler men rise to the top. All the same, those who are not in a position to risk their lives in the defence of the country ought to be prepared, or be made, to give financial support in the present crisis. The figures quoted by Mr Tudor are supported by the recorded profits earned in the case of English companies operating in Australia. For instance, to speak of mining companies, the Mount Morgan Company have paid £9,033,000 in dividends on 1,000,000 shares at £ 1 ; the W a l laroo and Moonta M in in g Company have paid £2,435,250 on 160,000 shares at £ 2 ; and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company have paid £10,169,200 on 1,181,000 shares at 8s. each.",16
157,Mr BAMFORD,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,What figures are quoting?,18
158,Mr WEST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"I am quoting the latest figures available. In the case of Broken Hill Proprietary, the price of their zinc has risen from £ 2 0 per ton before the war to £58 a ton at the present time; and, even allowing for any extra cost of labour, that, in my opinion, represents excessive war profits. Then, again, the price of lead and t in has increased by 30 to 50 per cent* as compared with pre-war prices; and I honestly believe that it is the desire of the people of this country that some of these excess profits should be used for the benefit of the country. I should now like to refer to the position of nineteen insurance companies doing business in Australia. The list is a long one, but I think that it ought to be placed on record.",18
159,Unknown,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. Mr ^WEST - It is a deplorable fact that very few public men take any real interest in the financial position of the Commonwealth. That remark applies to honourable members on both sides of the House. The party to which I belong has been very lax in regard to financial questions, although they constitute the most important of our parliamentary business. At the present time, an interest bill of something like £9,000,000 per annum has to be met; and when we see so littl e provision made for meeting it out of revenue, one is almost forced to think that the Government propose to pay the in terest bill from loan account.",18
160,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,You know that is not right.,18
161,Mr WEST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"W it h such a Bill as this before us, it is difficult for people to think otherwise. Even the E'udget statement of the honourable Treasurer gives no in dication of the raising of revenue to pay this enormous amount of interest. I know the Treasurer says that-the Government do not intend to pay interest from loans; that is a pernicious system that would not be entertained for a moment by anybody. Looking through the reports of the debates in the House of Commons, I find that there, too, very few members took sufficient interest in the finances to discuss the Budget; and the only critiyou cism offered seemed to be on the ground that there was too great a tendency on the part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask posterity to shoulder the financial burden of the war. I notice that honourable members on more than one side of the House expressed regret at the lack of interest taken in financial problems. I feel sure that in the Commonwealth greater attention will have to be paid to this important subject. Members of the British House of Commons have presented to the Prime Minister "" a round r o b in , "" in which the Government is asked to appoint a Committee to in vestigate all expenditure and discover, if possible, where leakages occur. I believe that the Commonwealth might do well to adopt that proposal. The figures which the Treasurer puts before us must be accepted by the House, because we have no other authority from whom to get authentic information. Whilst I can lay no charge against any particular Department, we do know that there has been a good deal of extravagance in connection with the expenditure in the Defence Department. Some of it , I admit, is unavoidable. In various camps I made inquiries, and the replies I received convinced me that by attempting to interfere with the officers responsible for the expenditure, I might do incalculable harm to the men. There does seem to be a need for the appointment of some Committee such as that suggested in the I m perial Parliament. Looking through the financial journals, I came across an interesting table, which shows how some people have a very good share of this world's goods, while many thousands of people in the world are penniless. Perhaps the reproduction of those figures in Hansard may lead honourable members to take a greater interest in the financial issues that must come before us. The Economist of 2nd June last publishes this table- .3d Alliance 198,871 Atlas 52,054 39,159 British Law 15,547 13,194 Caledonian 19,497 8,952 Commercial Union 317,316 191,953 Guardian 76,267 34,891 Liverpool, London, 233,094 f 395,5381 166,931 246,938 and Globe X 245.000 J London and Lanca- 84,234 50,000 shire London Assurance 101,314 20,410 Northern 98,708 12,753 North British 259,794 60,648 Norwich Union . . 97,206 183,258 Plicenlx 112,367 86,000 Royal 311,215 500,000 Koyal Exchange . . 82.371 60,000 Scottish Union .. 65,054 45,000 State 10,068 5,000 Sun 125,703 70,000 Yorkshire 66,308 50,000 The figures gave a bird's eye view of the financial position of those various organizations up to 1916, aud the Economist remarks, in regard to themA. more remarkable example is that of the Commercial Union. The whole paid-up capital of this institution is only £295,000. The net interest receipts, after deducting income tax and the interest on debentures (created to purchase subsidiary companies), were £317,316, or more than the paid-up capital. The company can, humanly speaking, go on paying a dividend of over 100 per cent, until the crack of doom. What is said of the Commercial Union, applies to almost all the other companies. Such a statement would not be made by a commercial journal with a view to injurin g the stability of the company, or causing any great rush on the shares of the Commercial Union. However desirous honourable members may be to encourage people to invest in commercial concerns, it should be recognised that a l i m it must be placed on profit making, whether in war time or at any other time. If those making excessive profits in war time only realized the position, I feel confident that they would admit that it would be only just for them to pay a greater proportion towards the cost of the Interes t Net . =9 war than they have been paying hitherto.

Working that' net out on the wool clip of Australia, most men will be satisfied that a large amount of profit is being made by wool-growers over and above what they made prior to the Avar. Any members who know how the commercial houses conduct their businesess must know that they work on the basis of a certain percentage of profit on cost. A house working on a 25 per cent, basis would mark an article costing them 5s. at 6s. 3d., but if the same article cost them 12s., they Would mark it at 15s. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to try to throAV dust in the eyes of the public, because there must be a vast increase in the profits made by these businesses, Will prices 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, higher than they were before the Avar. No one disputes that wages have risen, but an increase of as much as Is. is often put on the cost of an article where the increased cost of labour is not more than Id. or l^d. Nobody believes the Treasurer's statement that he can get only £450,000 per annum from a war profits tax. That may be so under this abortion of a Bill, but a proper war profits tax, carrying out the intention of the people of Australia, would produce more like £3,000,000 to £4,000,000. If this measure is licked into shape, and made more like what the people intended that it should be, its own father Avill not know it. Unless that is done, this Parliament will not be doing its duty. If people cannot go to the war, or cannot send others to represent them at the Avar, they should not grumble at Parliament taking their excess profits from them. I am prepared to render all the assistance I can to pass any amendment that Avill help to lick the Bill into shape, but, as it stands, it is hopeless to expect it to do what the people want. Possibly the Government have now been forced to recognise that they really have no Avin-the-Avar policy, and are going to ask members on this side of the House to show them how they should win the war. It Would be better for the Governanother, ment to dothat instead of paying, as ness. they are doing, so much attention to the interests of their own friends. charge may be justly laid at the disclaimed doors of those who framed this Bill. The Sydney Daily Telegraph, the Melan bourne Age, and one of the Western Australian papers have not received this ilfr. West. measure at all kindly, although they were champions of the Government before the election. Those three papers are beginning to recognise, and one of them has admitted, that the people made an error on the 5th May. The Treasurer, if he Avere Avell advised, Would withdraw the measure at once, and bring in a Bill more in accord Will the wishes of the people. If he did, a large majority of the'House would help him to pass it at once. I do not know whether to vote against the second reading or not. If I did, members on the other side would say, "" Look at the Opposition Ave have got,"" and would use it as a trump card, but, after all, it Would be far better to give them that trump card 'than to run the risk of being accused on this side of not understanding the true position. After all, the members of what Disraeli called "" He r Majesty's Opposition""-in this House I suppose it would be "" H is Excellency's Opposition ""-ar e just as much members of the House as the Government supporters are, although they have not the numbers, or the power, or the same opportunities to get information, and I believe some members opposite think they ought not to get as many privileges. Nevertheless, Ave AVIIO sit in Opposition have duties laid on us, and if the Government cannot produce a better War Profits Taxation .Bill, they ought to go out of. office and give those on this side an opportunity to shoAv hoAv to conduct the business of Australia in the Avay that Australia expects it to be conducted.",18
162,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Flinders) [2.42] - If I do not apply myself to reply to the weighty arguments of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), he will, I hope, understand that - this is not due to any want of respect to him. It is due entirely to the fact that I was only able to hear occasionally what he said, and find a great difficulty in connecting the flashes of lucidity which I heard, separated as they Avere from one to my ears, by chasms of darkThat Although the Leader of the Opposition such a purpose in moving the amendment, he must recognise thatsuch amendment on such a Bill amounts to a vote of censure on the Government. It is not in form a vote of censure, but every member of experience-and few members have more experience than has the honourable member for Yarra. (Mr Tudor)knows that such an attack on one of the important financial measures of the Government could not be accepted in any other way, if carried.",20
163,Mr WEST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,That would be no harm.,21
164,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"I heard that interjection, and it is a revelation. I had no idea that beneath that calm and dignified exterior there lurked such ambitions as that remark indicates. The Leader of the Opposition had no sooner launched his amendment, which declared that the measure was totally inadequate because the amount of money to be provided by it was so very small, than he proceeded entirely to demolish, by the figures he cited, the foundation on which his amendment was based. He went so far as to prove that his own statement, on which the amendment was based, was wildly distant from the actual truth . Assuming for a moment that his figures-I shall refer to them presently to show how entirely unreliable they are, and how it is impossible to base on them any real estimate or conclusion relative to this debate-ar e to be relied on, what is the conclusion to be drawn from them? The honourable member has courteously allowed me to see a copy of them. From it I gather that the proposed tax will take from 265 persons in Victoria alone the modest sum of almost £2,000,000, whereas the Treasurer estimates the receipts from all the taxpayers of "" Australia at about £1,000,000. Figures such as these are fallacious if a n y legitimate or relevant conclusion is attempted to be drawn from them. In the first place, without knowing the occupation of the persons set down in the lis*, it is impossible to estimate the taxation that they would be called upon to pay under the Bill . They might, for instance, all be pastoralists, and the year 1914 would not be the year chosen as that furnishing the pre-war standard of their income. We need much wider information than the figures convey to enable us fco form an opinion as to the correctness of the Treasurer's estimate. I do not in tend fco deal with the amendment, because I do not regard it as a seriously meant motion of want of confidence. beeu brought forward more to meet a demand made outside.",21

166,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Yes ; and therefore I propose to address myself, not to the amendment, but to the provisions of the Bill itself. Although I have had a great deal of experience in the, construing of Acts and Bills, I have never had more difficulty in ascertaining the meaning of a measure of equal length than I have experienced in dealing with this Bill . Metaphorically, I have struggled through it with a wet towel round my head. The Treasurer may regard it as an easy measure to understand; I do not; though occasionally gleams of light and hope have illumined my darkness and despair. In one regard, the more I look at the Bill the more I like it . '",21
167,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,That is from a lawyer's point of view.,21
168,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"The honourable member anticipates me. I have come to the conclusion that if the Land Tax Act may be regarded as the earlier rains, this may be compared with the '' later rains ' ' sent by a beneficent Providence to revive the humble and drooping industry of which I have the honour to be a member. . My attitude towards the Bill should therefore be one of thankfulness for the promise of a bountiful harvest*. Nevertheless, I consider it my duty to say a few words regarding iti from a public point"" of view. ' The more I consider the measure the less I blame the draftsman for its extraordinarily involved provisions. As honourable members know, every involution and twist in a drafting of an Act is the foundation and sprin"" of endless litigation; but the tortuous indirectness of the language of many of the provisions of this measure is due, not to want of skill on the part of those who drafted it, bub to the fact that they have 1 been asked to inclose within the for m or shell of a War-time Profits Tax Assessment B i ll what is, and must be, a War Profits Tax Assessment Bill . In outer for m and semblance this is a War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill, and machinery is provided for comparing periods before tihe war with periods during the war, bufc close investigation shows It has that its many variations from the English Act. are intended to make it whab it ought fco be, a War Profits Tax Assessment!

If the Bill is based on the principle thab in a time of war all who are getting larger incomes, no matter from what source, or for whati reason, than they had in normal times should be taxed, why should it be applied only to a small section and hundreds of thousands be exempt?",21
169,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,Does the honourable and learned member say thab hunexperience dreds of thousands are exempt?,22
170,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Yes , i Australia as a-whole, I think. However, let me say many thousands. I add my deal protest to those which have been made from both sides of the House against many of the provisions of the Bill . However much we may differ on other matters, think that we are all agreed that persons ought not to be allowed to make profits out of a war which is threatening the existence of the country. That is the justification you 'have for proposing to take away anything like 75 per cent, of man's profits, bu t it is a complete justification. But surely no one would suggest, when there are men who, by good luck, or for other reasons, are enjoying much larger incomes now than they had three years ago, those of one class only pleases. should be singled out, and 75 per cent, of their excess income taken from them. there is no appeal. Although the Bill is called a War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill , its justification is that it taxes not'war-time profits, but war profits, and our object make it as nearly a War Profits Taxation Bill as we can get it. I do not object to the exemption of persons who have increased their professional earnings by rendering additional services. I do not think that there are many in my profession to whom the exemption would apply. There is no reason why you should take from those who give additional service to the compowers munity the additional remuneration thab ing they have tliereby gained.",22
171,Mr FENTON,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,Would that apply to members of the medical profession?,22
172,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Yes . I say that all classes of persons, no matter what powers every day their occupation, who have made simply war profits, should return a large proportion of them to the State. The only doubt in my mind is whether the Bill provides the most effective machinery for bringing that about. The measure, although entitled a War-time Profits Tax Assessment Bill , provides endless exemptions, and gives the Commissioner power to alter and modify, to raise and lower standards, and in other ways to impose taxation, not on war-time profits, but on war profits. We ought to make it easier for thab to be done without injustice. In Committee, I shall suggest certain amendments which will simplify the measure, and make ib more effective for this purpose. Speaking from a large of the law, I say thab the method of meeting a difficulty by avoiding n any statement of principle, and endeavouring to forecast all possible cases and with them in an Act of Parliament, is the most ineffective and dangerous that can be adopted. The true method, especially whore very large discretionary I powers have to be left to those who are to administer the law, is to enunciate in the clearest and most distinct way the very principle on which the law is founded. only Honourable members, by referring to clauses 10, 11, and 12, will see what enora mous discretion is given to the Commissioner. He can determine what special circumstances exist ; he can vary the pre-war standard of profit ; he can calculate the amount of capital in any manner he That in itself opens up an enormous field of oppression, from which . Sir ROBERT BEST - The Commissioner will have power to determine the financial should be to stability of a business.",22
173,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"As the honourable member points out, this power to determine the financial stability of each business will make the Commissioner practically the controller of every man's enterprise for the time being. I do not deny that to a very large extent these must be given. I am only point out that this Bill , with all its complicated provisions, will not do away with the necessiby of vesting the Commissioner with enormous power.",22

177,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"The power to inquire into a company's affairs in order to gain information is one thing, biit the power given to the Commissioner to ruin a man or to allow him to go, according to the idea he forms of his business, is quite another thing. These powers are enormously wide, but I do not complain of that. In any case, the Commissioner must be given wide powers. The problem before him termining what are, in effect, war profits, requires that he shall have enormous little, powers. We must have a Commissioner whom we can trust, and a Board of Referees in whom we have implicit conmust fidence. Having got those men, we must ties. give them almost unlimited powers. am sure that the Treasurer will give f u l consideration to the suggestion I am about to make, because I know his diffihave culties, and those of his honourable colwe league (Mr Groom), who has been assistplete ing him, in meeting all the objections that have been raised.",23

182,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"But is it not a fact that even since this Bill presented to the House representations have been made to the Minister as to numbers of cases in which, if allowed to remain as it stands, it would work an in j ustice ?",23
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,Such difficulties have to be met every day and every hour in the week.,23
184,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Exactly. This is one of those measures, in connection with which many difficulties are bouud to arise, because of the failure to state in it the real principle on which it is founded. The principle itself should be stated in the Bill , and we should leave the working out of that principle, for the most part, to the discretion of those of dewho have to administer it . Where an attempt is made to build up, little by in the Bill , a complicated and necessarily imperfect scheme,- in order to do justice in every case, the Government always be faced with such difficulI f we were to sit until Christmas I and devote our attention solely to the l consideration of this Bill , with - the object of meeting cases of hardship that been mentioned as likely to occur, should not even then arrive at a comscheme of taxation, such as could be embodied within the Bill itself. The Minister may attempt, during the passage of this Bill through Parliament, to add a little to this clause and a little to that, to make a slight exception to the provisions of certain clauses, and to add new clauses, to meet cases of unthis doubted hardship, but even then fie will was not have dealt with one-half of the real cases of hardship that are likely to arise. up, Instead of meeting all of them by these directions, he may so hamper the discretion of the Commissioner and those who have to administer the law as to them to do an injustice in thousands of cases. That is the difficulty that is always attached to this mode of attempting to meet such a problem. On the other hand, if a definite principle be set out in the Bill - if we create the machinery to give effect to it , and leave those who have to administer the law free to give effect to the principleexperithe position will be improved. My suggestion-and it is only a mere outline that I shall give at this stagewas is this: A great deal of the machinery of this Bill is essential. We must provide for the appointment of a Commissioner and a Board of Referees. We must provide for the establishment of a pre-war standard, and the mode of ascertaining the pre-war standard. Further, there must be general directions as to the method of computing war profits, and provision must be made for determining what is capital. In short, we must have the general skeleton framework of this Bill "" as it is, although it might be put in a much more condensed form. Once you begin to fill up that skeleton-to load up the Bill it self-wit h a lot of definite provisions as to how particular cases of hardship are to be met, .then you will not meet one-tenth of the difficulties which will arise. the contrary, the hands of those whose duty it will be to meet them will be tied. I submit to the Treasurer that it would be better to cut out a great many of the provisions introduced to meet cases of hardship, as well as others which he contemplates proposing, in order to meet the suggestions made by various members, and to deal with the whole question on this broad basis: clause 17 returns will be sent in by those from whom the Commissioner desires to obtain them. I gather from the wording of the clause that the Commissioner, properly, will hot require every one who pays income tax to send in a return. That would be monstrous. He will send notices to those whom he desires to furnish returns as to war profits. obtain returns from those who are engaged in businesses in which there is any chance of war profits being made, and he will have the excess profits estimated according to the machinery of the Bill. But the hands of the Commissioner and of the Board of Referees should not be tied in any way by directions embodied in the Bill itself as to how particular cases of hardship or difficulty are to be met."" These returns will be sent in, and it will be assumed that primd facie the profits made in excess of the pre-war standard are war profits. But every taxpayer who sends in a return should have the right to show, either in the return or subsequently, reasons why in his opinion the whole or portion of those excess profits are not in any way connected directly or indirectly with the war. By way of let us take the position of the wool industry concerning which we have heard Sir William Jmine. so much of late. Take the case of a sheep-grower who sends in a return of the profits he has made as compared with his profits for the pre-war period. Let us assume that he says, "" My profits this year are £10,000 in excess of the pre-war standard.' Primd facie, that increased profit is due to the war, but while I admit that the price of wool has increased, and that therefore so much of my profits as come from the sale of my wool have arisen through the war, I do not admit that the rest, or a considerable portion of the rest, is due in any way to the war. It arose from the fact that I have been breeding up or increasing my flocks."" That is a very simple illustration. Would On not the suggestion I make be the simplest way of meeting the difficulty?",23
185,Mr GREGORY,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,But how would the honourable member get over the difficulty of dealing with the excess profits of a manufacturer or the owner of a big city emporium ?,24
186,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"There are honourable difficulties to be met, but I do not think there would be any difficulty in that case. Under",24
187,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,I do not t h i nk that there is any. difficulty in dealing with the wool-growers under the Bill as it very stands.,24
188,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"The Treasurer has made so many exceptions, and intends to make so many more, that he He will w i ll probably be able to meet the. difficulties in counexion with the position of wool-growers; but there may be other difficulties which he cannot meet in the Bill itself. There are others whose interests must be attended to. Take the case of a warehouseman who has made a great deal of money during the year of accounting. Let us take the case of a soft goods warehouseman in Flinders-lane, whose in come, say, is £10,000 in excess of the pre-war standard. He may say, "" I admit that you are entitled to tax me in respect of certain profits which have arisen from the war because I held stocks of certain goods, the price of which has increased the since the outbreak of war."" The Commissioner may say that so far as those goods are concerned he has made an excess profit of 25 or 40 per cent., and then illustration, ask him, "" What other exemptions do you claim?"" Supposing he says, "" The rest of my profit is due, not to the war, but from the fact that I have improved my business in some ways, bave exercised more skill in ' connection with it , and have had better work, and consequently a larger turnover. Every business is eithef growing up or coming down, and I have been fortunate enough to be among those whose business is increasing. you taxation in respect of what are legitimate war profits, but you ought to relieve me from this war profits taxation in respect of the rest of my excess profits."" Why should not such a contention prevail? And so with a manufacturer or any one else. Let him make his returns under this Bill . Let him choose his pre-war standard, and let it be assumed as against him in the first place that any excess of profits on the pre-war standard represents profits arising from the war. Give him an opportunity, however, of showing that any portion of those profits does not consist of war profits. Put the onus of proof on him. Let him be called upon to satisfy the Commissioner, and if he is dissatisfied with the Commissioner's decision he will be able to appeal to the Board of Referees.",24
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"The Commissioner would have to lay down working rules just as we are trying to do, however imperfectly, in this Bill.",25
190,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"I agree that the Commissioner would have, from time to time, to lav down rules with regard to the various classes of business with which he had to deal. It is righ t that he should. What is more, he will be continually altering and adjusting those rules to meet' new circumstances. tempting to do something which should be left to the Commissioner. We are attempting to embody in a hard and fast Act of Parliament rules which could not be altered except by an Amending Bill , and then could be altered only in respect, of a few details. We are trying to embody in the Bill what should virtually be left to the discretion of the Commissioner in administering it .",25
191,Mr FALKINER,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"The honourable member would allow the Commissioner to do what the Commissioner of Income Tax does earthly when he standardizes values and forces taxpayers to make a big profit, or, haps, a big loss. .",25
192,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"I do not think so. I would retain in the machinery we have for allowing a man to estimate what his profi t is.  every taxpayer should be entitled to make a deduction from excess profits on the ground that it represented profits due, I will pay not fco the w ar, but to more efficient t methods of business, would not every taxpayer be claiming such an exemption?",25
193,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"S u c h claims ' might be made, but it would be for the Commissioner to determine them. I do not think the honourable member  quite clearly. I gave one or two examples; and if he will cite any particular instance, I shall endeavour to meet him. I have spoken of the wool growers and the soft goods warehousemen; and perhaps the honourable member may be able to give me another 'example of where the scheme will not work.",25
194,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"If there is the pre-war arrangement, it is straightforward enough under the Bill .",25
195,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"The actual machinery for the assessment is all right, if you do not hamper it with all these particular provisions. In Committee I propose to,. at all events, endeavour to have it clearly stated that this is to be a tax on war profits. That will not alter the scope of the Bill , which, although in name a War-time Profits Tax Bill , is in essence a War Profits Tax Bill , so far as ' it is just. If it is not a War Profits Tax Bill , it ought to be so amended as to make it one, for that is the only way in which We are at- to justify any of the exemptions.",25
196,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,We should have to investigate every case to see whether it was or was not one of war profits..,25
197,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,That is not so.,25
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,It is now a W a r time Profits Tax Bill .,25
199,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Y o u call it so. but it is not a War-time Profits Tax Bill . Can the Treasurer suggest any reason, if we are imposing a tax, and a very heavy one, on war-time profits, perwhy there should be any exemptions?",25
200,Sir JOHN FORREST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,That is another matter; a similar measure has been two Bill the years in force in England.,25
201,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,It is not to the same measure.,26
202,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,It is exactly the same principle.,26
203,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,There are very great differences.,26
204,Sir ROBERT BEST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"And very important omissions. - Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - Quite so; and, even if the law in England were as stated, we cannot be guided entirely by that; but, under the circumstances, must do our best for Australia. If we persist in saying that this is to be deemed a Wartime Profits Tax Bill, then we do away with all justification for any exemptions. To leave out the element that these profits have been made as a result of the war is grossly unfair to the community. If we proceed to tax all who have happened to make more profit than previously, then it must strike every sensible man that the proper way would be by means of a surplus income tax. I do not advocate that, because it is not what the Government promised the couutry to do. Though we call it the War-time Profits Tax Bill, it is really a Surplus Income Tax Bill, with the unfairness that it means a huge plus tax ou a small section of the comministration. munity.",26
205,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Only who have made the money. . Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - Onl y on a directions small portion of those who have made the money. It is really imposing an income tax of 75 per cent, on one section of community and leaving the other sections free. The fact needs only to be stated to make the Bill absolutely indefensible. So far as concerns the people who have to pay, we are practically saying that every improvement made in a business to the Crown; aud the adoption of such a principle must be fatal to the progress and advancement of the community. The real object of almost every clause-of the powers of the Commissioner, and of exemptions and exceptions-is to make this measure, as nearly as possible, War Profits Tax Bill. I hope the Goobtained vernment will not close the door to the able proposal I shall suggest in make the Bill, in effect, a War Profits Bill. - Mr SAMPSON - Would it not be necessary to give the Commissioner the same wide discretion under your own direct proposal as under the present indirectproposal ?",26
206,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"I do not think any wider, but certainly as wide. The honourable member is right; but the discretion of the Commissioner would not be hampered - h e would have a simple definite problem before him in each case. He would, subject to appeal, make rules applicable to the particular cases. As the honourable member for Parramatta said, in practical administration by a Department, a Commissioner or a Board of Referees, with unlimited discretion to determine what are war profits, the controlling power, in a very short time, practically lays down certain rules for those cases which have common elements. But there is the difference that under this Bill the officer would be bound to look at all the complicated directions in the Act, which might in many cases defeat his own powers. . Mr SAMPSON - After all, the success of surthe measure depends entirely on the ad",26

The remaining 30 per cent, will be prohibited. That will be effected by a regulation of the Customs in the releasing of spirits from bond. All the other items mentioned are absolutely prohibited; but the Minister will have power to permit certain articles to be imported. Eor instance, representations may be made that certain jewellery should be allowed to enter Australia. The Minister will consider those representations, and will have power to grant a permit if he thinks it necessary. Goods in bond in Australia, or such as are in Australian ports, or in course of transit to Australia ou the date of the proclamation, will be allowed delivery. That will be done in order not to cause great inconvenience to the commercial community. I think that is a reasonable proposal. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT.

217,Mr HIGGS,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Capricornia) [3.50] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Acting Prime Minister a letter I have reare many ceived from the Wowan Farmers and In that communication I am asked to represent the Prime Minister the distress that is caused to settlers on the land in that disthrough the scarcity of water, and which is accentuated by the increased cost of bore-casing. For the purpose of relieving the distress, I am asked to urge the Government to allow German-made casing now in the hands of various Queensland foundries to be sold at a minimum cost to, the settlers of this and other such sparsely-watered districts of Queensland who are dependent on the Queensland State Savings Bank for payment for bores. It is also desired that the Government shall ascertain the amount of Geiman casing held by various firms in Queensland. I believe that public opinion is not so disturbed today as it was a couple of years ago, when people actually refused to play German music simply because it was German, and Beethoven was actually taken off the list of all musical programmes. The public are getting into a saner state of mind; and I notice that Beethoven has been played at the recent Verbruggen concerts. From this letter, it would appear that a quantity of German-made casings is in the possession of Queensland firms, and' the settlers desire it to be placed on the market. I cannot see that we shall either win the war or do any particular good by keeping that material out of use. Probably other casing is not available, and, if the facts are as stated, the Government might consider the release of German casing now held in stock. I shall be glad if the Minister for the Navy will consider the matter.",30
218,Dr MALONEY,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Melbourne) [3.41]. - In the Age of the 6th August appeared a statement by Brigadier-General Sir Eobert MCC Anderson that ""About a month ago General Sir Archibald Murray, who, until recently, was commanding in Egypt, told me that he would rather lose a division of other troops than a brigade of Australians."" In the Argus of the 8th August is a letteT signed by "" Fair Play,"" pointing out that, whilst a brigade of infantry consists of 124 cers aud 4,055 of other ranks, not including details at the base, a division consists of 5S5 officers and 17,488 of other ranks, not including details at the base. "" Fair Play "" points out that "" The statement, therefore, means that one Australian soldier, as a fighting man, is equal to five British soldiers."" Whilst oue may admire a man who, probably, without a scintilla of knowledge of warfare, can rise to the rank of brigadier-general, I can scarcely believe that a British general would make a statement that he would rather sacrifice five British soldiers than one Australian. Our boys who are at the Front lift their hats in admiration of the battalions who represent the four British Kingdoms, and they would not approve of such a statement as that. If General Sir Archibald Murray made such a coldblooded, brutal remark, he ought to be shot. I lift my hat to the British Tommy. The whole history of British ' soldiers is a record of bravery. I am proud of my Australian brothers, and if they only equal the Tommies in courage . and fighting capacity, I shall be satisfied. I ask the Honorary Minister to consult with the Minister for Defence as to whether a cablegram cannot be sent to General Sir Archibald Murray, asking him if he made such a brutal and cruel statement as is attributed to him.",31
219,Mr FENTO N,AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICES IN,"Maribyrnong) [3.44]. - I should like once again to refer to the question of unemployment, particularly in the case of returned soldiers. Several of these men were dismissed by the Colonial Ammunition Company about a fortnight OT three weeks ago, and there are amongst them married men, who are still out of employment, and whose position is more than precarious. Is there not a possibility of the Government making a special effort in regard to these men,' apart from repatriation? Later we shall have a repatriation scheme in operation; but it appears that the men who have returned early from .the Front will have to battle unaided, and they are not in that state of, physical health which enables them to take any kind of work. I could give the Minister details of half-a-dozen cases of actual distress. I have already asked the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Watt) to facilitate the matter offiof putting works in operation that will give employment to people, many of whom are endeavouring in these times of high cost of living to support families. I have a list of men with families of up to nine to support. In these hard times, one of the chief duties of a National Government is to see that people are fed, clothed, and housed. I shall send the Minister a list of names if he desires them, and trust that something will be done by the Government, in addition to pushing on with works as far as practicable, to give work to men out ""of work.",31

We have vacancies for all descriptions work, and iti would be a good* thing the Minister, instead of plunging the country into extra expense for unnecesrate, sary works, tried to organize labour as far as possible, and find out where these men could be placed. The other day some 200 women forced their way almost into this chamber, and have since been talking a .great deal about! unemployment. If they really wanted work, there are huninquired dreds of '.people living in the ' country districts who would be very glad to endiers gage them as domestic servants. - Mr HIGGS.;--.Hal f of those women are married women with families.  has been drawn to us about their starving. There was a time when I was glad to take anything in the way of work. Member of Parliament as I am, rather than starve, or beg, or create turmoil in this country, would take on any menial work. It is and no shame for a man to work, no matter what the occupation, so long as he is dohoning it ' honestly and honourably.
