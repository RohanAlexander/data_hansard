Motion (by Mr MEWZIES) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn tomorrow, at 11 a.m. THE PARLIAMENT. - Mr BEAZLEY - I ask the Prime Minister a .question which arises from the rumours that the Government intends to yet. terminate the current sittings of this House on the' 8th December instead the 14th December because of accommointention dation problems in Canberra. Will it possible to set aside some time remainder of the sessional period for honourable members to discuss and finalize the motion that has been proposed by the honourable member for Curtin with respect to aborigines and also the report in relation to the suggested payment of special subsistence allowance to former prisoners of war ?",12
2,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"I cannot answer the question positively, but I hope to have both matters discussed. I have noticed the speculation on the probable date termination of this sessional which the 'honourable member has referred. The position has been a little complicated by the fact that the Government has invited delegates to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in New Zealand, which is _ being issue attended by representatives of this liament, to come to Canberra on their back from the dominion. I am sure that all honourable members agree that sucb visit is most desirable. I am now invesKingdom tigating the possibility of arranging for the accommodation of those delegates over the week-end that will begin on the 8th December, but there is no certainty that that date will chime with their arrangenations ments. I cannot say positively upon what date the Parliament will rise for the Christmas recess. There is no intrinsic reason why we should not finish the business of this House by the 8th December. I sball certainly keep in mind the two matters that have been mentioned by the honourable member.",12
3,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Twic e during the four or five weeks the Treasurer has promised the House that he will introduce legislation during the current parliamentary sittings for the purposes of dealing _ with excess profits and controlling capital issues. Does the rigbt honourable gentleman adhere to his promise that the to bills will be introduced during the current sessional period? If be has changed his mind, when does he propose to make an announcement to that effect? Rumour has it that the bills have not been drafted",12
4,Mr SADDEN,Unknown,"The honourable memof ber knows what rumour is. It is my to bring down the bills, if at all he physically possible, during the current during the sessional period. KOBEA.",12
5,Mr GRAHAM,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Defence consider issuing a special disa tinguishing shoulder badge of the type worn by British Commonwealth Occupation Force personnel to the members of all Australian services, who are fighting with the United Nations forces in Korea? ""Will the Minister also consider discussing with representatives of the United of the Kingdom Government the issuing of a period to Korean campaign medal?",12
6,Mr MCBRIDE,Unknown,"I shall discuss with my colleagues, the Minister for the Navy and Minister for the Army and the Minister for Air, the suggestion for the of a shoulder badge for Australian Parservicemen who are engaged in the way Korean campaign. The suggestion that a Korean campaign medal should also be a issued will be discussed with the United authorities at an early date.",12
7,Mr WIGHT,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for External Affairs a question relative to the troops at present engaged in combat in Korea. Since the troops of the various engaged are fighting under the banner of the United Nations, and since all of tbem are giving the same service, will he say whether consideration has been given by the United Nations to having all these troops placed on the same rates of pay?",12
8,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"The answer is "" No "". No consideration has been given to that matter by the United Nations.",13
9,Mr MULOAHY,Unknown,Will the Minister for the Army assure the House that the Australian soldiers who have taken part in the rapid advance from the temperate region of South Korea to the more frigid zone in North Korea are fully equipped for the climatic conditions which they are encountering?,13
10,Mr ERANCIS,Unknown,I can give the honourable member an unqualified assurance on that score. The Government has obtained from the United States authorities special equipment that was developed as a result of three and a half years of research under Arctic conditions in Alaska. Australian troops in Korea have been wearing such clothing for the last fortnight. DENTAL SERVICES.,13
11,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"In view of the tremendous strain imposed on the family purse by dental treatment and the great importance of proper dental treatment to the health of the Australian community, will the Minister for Health say whether he intends to introduce dental services part of the national health scheme, and, if so, when?",13
12,Sir EARLE PAGE,Unknown,The Governservants ment intends to deal first of all with medical aspect and later with the dental aspect of the national health service. PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.,13
13,Mr MCCOLM,Unknown,"Can the Minister External Territories say whether it fact that some difficulty is being perienced in effecting shipments of to overseas markets, particularly United Kingdom, from certain ports the Territory of Papua and New Guinea,' especially from Madang? Will Minister say what action is being taken to replace the wharfs at Port Moresby, Samarai, Madang and Kavieng? understand that recently the master Bank Line steamer refused to port of Madang because he believed that hy doing so he would endanger his ship.",13
14,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"It is a fact that difficulties have occurred in New Guinea because of the deficiencies in wharfage equipment for the shipments of copra from New Guinea. It is also true that some time ago, as the result of representations made to my department, Madang was excluded by a particular vessel of the Bank Line. However, provision has since been made for vessels of that line to take two loads of copra from Madang this month. The honourable gentleman will remember that during the war the entire wharfage equipment in New Guinea was devastated. However, I think that the present position could be summarized as follows:-Tender s have been called for the improvement of the wharfage facilities at Port Moresby, and they close this month. The wharf at Lae is now in use. Tenders have been called and accepted for work at Madang, and preliminary work is already being carried out. Similarly, tenders have been called for and accepted for work on the wharf at Samarai, and work has actually been commenced. At Kavieng work is already in progress. I can assure the honourable gentleman that the present Government has not lost any time in dealing with the matter he has mentioned.",13
15,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,Unknown,"Has the as attention of the Minister for External Territories been drawn to a press statement in respect of the unrest among public in New Guinea, as reported by the the secretary of the Public Service Association? Is it a fact that, as reported, public servants in New Guinea have been called upon to work longer hours and have protested about the matter? Is it also a fact that the tropical allowance for of £150 a year to married women has is a been withdrawn, and that this has exresulted in many such women leavcopra ing positions with the administrato the tion and accepting employment with in private firms at a higher salary, including £150 tropical allowance? If the the report to which I have referred is correct, does the Minister consider the action taken by the Government in that, I regard tends to create and maintain effiof a ciency, contentment and loyal service enter the within the department ?",13
16,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"My attention has not been drawn to the press item to which the honourable member has referred, but I am aware of the subject of which he has spoken. I shall endeavour to make a statement before the session closes, which will indicate the extent to which this Government has dealt with the civil service in New Guinea, how officers have been reclassified, and how, in point of fact, it will be found generally officers have had some of their grievances which had been outstanding for some time, remedied by the Government. Some representations were made to me by the Public Service Association in relation to hours of work of public servants i r New Guinea, before I left Australia to go overseas. The officers conoerned protested against the extension of hours from 34 to 36^ weekly. I drew attention to the benefits given to the public servants in New Guinea by the Government, to the great shortage of man-power in the territory and to the tremendous difficulties that we had to overcome there. I said that I felt that in the circumstances an increase of hour? from 34 to 36-J weekly, in view of the additional advantages we had given them, could not be considered out of place. I understand that certain representations during my absence have been made to the Prime Minister on the same subject and that he promised that they would be referred to me upon my return. I shall consider the representations, but I can say to the honourable member that at the present time. I do not see any prospect of the decision being altered. NA SERVICES.",13
17,Mr WARD,HEAXTHAND MEDICAL,"""Will the Minister for Health say whether it is a fact that under his Government's allegedly free medical and pharmaceutical benefits scheme for aged, invalid, widow and service pensioners, a special charge of 5s. is proposed in each case in which a doctor is quired to attend a patient after 6 p.m. and that this charge will have to be paid by the pensioners? I understand that, in addition, whenever a doctor is required to travel beyond three miles to attend a pensioner a special charge of 5s. a mile will be imposed, of which one-fifth will have to be borne by the pensioners. If those are facts, will the Minister take action either to have the charges deleted or else discontinue the use of the term "" free"" in describing the Government's health scheme?",14
18,Sir EARLE PAGE,HEAXTHAND MEDICAL,"-Treatmen t of pensioners generally in their homes will be free, but a charge will be made against the Government for visits by doctors to that pensioners after the normal hours.",14
19,Mr WARD,HEAXTHAND MEDICAL,Does that also apply to visits made to patients at any time after 6 p.m. ?,14
20,Sir EARLE PAGE,HEAXTHAND MEDICAL,"Yes . In connection with the mileage charge, the position is that if a mileage fee is agreed toand that is at present under discussion and has not ""yet been settled-the Government will pay four-fifths and the pensioner will pay one-fifth of the charge. The reason for imposing some charge on patients is to dissuadepeople from sending unnecessarily for doctors who will have to travel long distances or to attend them at difficult hours. Provision is being made in the scheme to ensure that the nearest doctor will be called, so that it is expected that the mileage that will be involved will be infinitesimal. In addition to that point, it is absolutely necessary that there should be some charge made so as to provide for proper checks.",14
21,Mr ROSEVEAR,HEAXTHAND MEDICAL,"My question to the Minister for Health is supplementary to the question asked by the honourable member for East Sydney. Who was responsible for the printed instructions or the printed intimations to members of the medical profession that they might charge the fee of 5s. for visits made to pensioners after 6 o'clock in the evening? Was it the original intention to make that charge or was the charge subsequently approved? In any case, would the Minister, who does not appear to know anyre- thing about the matter, indicate who was responsible for the printing of the instructions to members of the medical profession that they could charge 5s. in the circumstances that I have mentioned ?",14
22,Sir EARLE PAGE,HEAXTHAND MEDICAL,"I know of no such instruction having been issued. Certainly, I have not issued any instmction of the kind to which the honourable member has referred. WAB GRATUITY.",14
23,Mr HANDBY,HEAXTHAND MEDICAL,"As claim forms in connection with the war gratuity to be paid next year can be obtained only from omciai post offices, at the moment, and as many country areas have only non-official post offices, which means that many ex-servicemen will have to travel many miles to obtain forms, will the Treasurer confer with the Postmaster-General to ensure that non-official post offices are supplied with such forms for the convenience of ex-service personnel in small outback towns?",15
24,Mr FADDEN,HEAXTHAND MEDICAL,"I shall be very happy to confer with the Postmaster-General on that matter. NA CELEBRATIONS. M.r. HAYLEN - I ask the Prime Wales? Minister wbo thought of the idea of celebrating die festival of 50 years of federation by importing an operetta or pageant called Hiawatha, which is a dramatization of Longfellow's poem put into verse and music by an American ? The pageant is proposed to be produced by an Englishman. The star is to be a Canadian. .Has anything been written in this country which is suitable for representing the progress of Australia, and has the committee in charge of the celebrations made any inquiries to ascertain whether a local writer can produce an Australian pageant so that Hiawatha will not be foisted on us? Furthermore, is the Prime Minister aware that provision is made in the cast of the pageant for some Red Indian performers? Will the right honourable gentleman indicate whether they would be declared upon their arrival in Australia?",15
25,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"The answer is "" I don't know "". CANBERRA.",15
26,Dr NOTT,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"My questions are directed to the Minister for National Development. They are as follows:-1 . Is the necessity for blackouts of power and light in Canberra due to the shortage of coal in Sydney, or is it due to the unsuitability of the coal supplied to key power stations in New South Wales? 2. Is the generating unit in Canberra able, under optimum conditions, to supply nearly 75 per cent, of all power and light consumed in the Australian Capital Territory; and, if so, will the Government consider the need for immediately installing new plant which will enable the local station to meet all the demands of the Australian Capital Territory for light and power ? 3. What prospects confront the people of the Australian Capital Territory in the forthcoming winter, unless such action is taken, if the power and light supply continues to fail so miserably in summer conditions ? 4. Does the Minister believe that the people of the National Capital and of the Australian Capital Territory generally should have to suffer vexations and inconvenient blackouts because of the hopelessly inefficient generation of electric power in New South",15
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Order ! I must ask all honourable members to present their questions in a concise form, and to refrain from making speeches. I ask the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory to complete his question.",15
28,Dr NOTT,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Ver y well, Mr Deputy Speaker. My last question is as follows: 5. Is it a fact that there is little likelihood of the position improving before the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme comes into operation in approximately four years' time?",15
29,Mr OASEY,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"^I believe that the frequent blackouts in the Australian Capital Territory are due to two causes. The first is the quality rather than the quantity of coal .available in Canberra for power generation, and the second is the dependence to an appreciable extent of the Australian Capital Territory on New South Wales for power. That means that the people of the Australian Capital Territory have to suffer inconvenience similar to that which is suffered by people in New South Wales, particularly in Sydney, and which arises from the power generation problems in New South Wales. I have not full particulars in my mind to enable me to answer all aspects of the honourable member's questions, but I shall obtain the facts and advise him of them as soon as I can. CIVIL AVIATION.",15
30,Mr KEKWICK,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Is the Minister for Civil Aviation aware tnat in recent years Trans-Australia Airlines, has lost a number of highly skilled technicians who, for the purpose of securing their own future, have obtained employment elsewhere because of persistent reports that Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited are likely to be amalgamated? In view of the intention that the Prime Minister clearly stated in his policy-speech thar Trans-Australia Airlines would be operated on a truly competitive basis, is the Minister prepared, in order to correct any wrong impressions that may be held, to state that no such amalgamation is contemplated ?",16
31,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I have no knowledge that engineers and other classes of employees are leaving Trans-Australia Airlines because of the uncertainty of their employment. I should imagine that the reverse would be the case. The question of merging Trans-Australia Airlines with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited or other airline companies arose during the regime of the Chifley Government when reports were published that the Leader of the Opposition who was then Prime Minister was contemplating that course. Subsequently, reports to that effect constantly appeared in the press. I have nothing further to say on the subject.",16
32,Mr DUTHIE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation a question which is supplementary to that which was asked by the honourable member for Bass. Is the Minister aware that employees of the Trans-Australia Airlines organization are gravely concerned about the reports of a proposed merger between Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited? Is it a fact that it is Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited that has been making the approaches to the Government on this subject, through the backdoor as it were ? Is the honourable gentleman aware that many people conscientiously believe that competition between airlines is wholesome and that, without competition, there would be an unsatisfactory monopoly? If the reports of the proposed merger are not true, will the Minister deny them so as to relieve the anxiety of officers of the very fine organization of Trans-Australia Airlines ?",16
33,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I have already answered a similar question. The honourable gentleman has suggested that many people have developed a state of anxiety neurosis about this matter, but I have not yet come in contact with any who are so afflicted. The honourable gentleman also said that he believes in competition amongst airlines. I point out to him that that is not the opinion of his political party, and that, in fact, the previous Labour Government introduced certain legislation in an attempt to eliminate all competition. As ' I stated in answer to a previous question, proposals for amalgamation were made by various companies to the former Prime Minister, who is now Leader of the Opposition, and they, recur from time to time. I have no further stntor»pnt to make on the matter.",16
34,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I understand that Qantas Empire Airways Limited has been conducting a weekly service between the mainland of Australia and Lord Howe Island and that Trans-Oceanic Airways Proprietary Limited has been conducting a fortnightly service on the same route. Will the Minister for Civil Aviation say whether there is any basis for the rumour that the number of trips made each month by Qantas Empire Airways Limited will be reduced to three and the number of trips which Trans-Oceanic Airways Proprietary Limited will make each month will be increased from two to three? If there is any basis for the current rumour, I should like the Minister to explain the reason for the proposed change.",16
35,Mr WHITE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I do not know whether a rumour such as that mentioned by the honourable gentleman is circulating. However, I know that changes have been made on the air route mentioned. Qantas Empire Airways Limited is principally concerned with operating routes from Australia to the United Kingdom, to New Guinea and to certain Pacific Islands. Lord Howe Island is, of course, administered by-the Government of New South Wales. Trans-Oceanic Airways Proprietary Limited pioneered the air route to tkat island, and that firm is anxious to operate a more regular schedule flights to the island. Qantas Empire Airways Limited is indifferent about wliether it operates a service to Lord Howe Island in view of its large compossibility mitments. Some re-arrangement of the number of trips to the island each may be made, but whether the service will operate once, twice or thrice weekly unable to say at present. COAL.",16
36,Mr GRIFFITHS,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Has the Ministei for Labour and National Service seen the report in the press that the Chairman the Joint Coal Board, Mr Cochran, when speaking at Wallsend drew attention the shortage of lahour in the coal-mining industry and promised to provide continumechanization ous employment for miners for at least ten years? Does the Government concur in the statements that were attributed Mr Cochran in that report? Is the Minister aware that the coal-miners and their leaders, in view of their experience of unemployment in the past, have exsafety pressed their disbelief in the promises that Mr Cochran made? Will the Minisreduction ter have Mr Cochran's proposals examined with a view to introducing legislation that will guarantee miners permanent employment for at least twenty years and thus encourage young men to enter this vital and important industry?",17
37,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I have.not seen any full statement of the kind to which the honorlevel? able member has referred, but I have read a report in the press that indicated that Mr Cochran, had expressed himself along the lines that the honourable member has mentioned. I am aware that there a shortage of labour in certain mining districts. On previous occasions in House I have intimated that the Governtrary, ment was endeavouring to meet that probis lem by establishing hostels in appropriate areas and allocating migrants to the indusfrom try in order to meet its labour needs, I remind the House that the Prime Minsteps ister made an important statement in the joint policy speech of the present Governthat ment parties in which he indicated their attitude in relation to the production of coal. I cannot recall the precise words that the right honourable gentleman used, but, so far as I recollect, the substance his statement was that in the event of there of being some assurance of continuity of production the Government would guarantee to purchase all coal produced over a period so that there would be no that coal-miners would work themselves out of a joh by producing great month quantities of coal. The Government would be glad to take up that matter at I am any convenient time with Mr Cochran and representatives of the coal-mining industry.",17
38,Mr JAMES,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Has the Prime Minister seen the report in today's press of an announcement by the executive of the of miners' federation to the effect that it will resist in every way, shape and to form the introduction of mechanization into the coal mines? We all admit that will increase the output of coal, but I point out that a fear complex exists among the miners that the to introduction of such machinery will reduce the number of employees in the coal-mining industry, that proper precautions will not be taken to ensure the of the miners, and last but not least, that they will suffer a serious of earnings. Can the Government give a guaranntee that if mechanization is introduced into the coal mines, it will not cause a shortage of labour and a reduction of employees, and that it will not in any way jeopardize the safety of employees in that industry or reduce their earnings below the present",17
39,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I have not seen the statement to which the honourable member has referred, but I cannot imagine that the development of coal production in is Australia, by increased mechanization or otherwise, could impair employment this or continuity of work. On the conthe Government believes that there ample scope for a much greater production of coal in Australia and has indicated time to time that it is quite prepared, by various ways and means, to take necessary to see that employment is maintained under such circumstances and safety precautions are also observed. CORTISONE AND AGTH.",17
40,Dr DONALD CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I ask of the Minister for Health whether any research is being conducted in Australia into the use of the drugs ACTH and cortisone? If so from where are supplies of the drugs used being obtained? Have any efforts been made in this country to synthesize either of these substances? If not, is it possible to make such attempts? In view of the great public interest in these substances and of the various statements concerning their powers that have appeared in the press, will the Minister issue a statement in order to explain their nature, availability, potentialities and dangers?",17
41,Sir EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"The value of the ACTH medicaments has been proved in certain respects, but some very untoward results have also been produced, and therefore, they are not being made available at the present time in Australia. A certain quantity has been obtained from America, and experiments are being conducted with them in Melbourne, under definite restrictions and instructions, to ascertain at the earliest possible moment when they may be made available for general use. I understand that some drug houses are eager to secure certain patents under which they will be permitted to produce these drugs in this country. MR. ERIC J. HARRISON, M.P.",18
42,Mr NELSON,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Can the Prime ter inform the House whether the reports are correct which indicate that the Minister for the Interior, who is Australian Resident Minister in London at the present time, will be appointed take charge of the arrangements for the forthcoming visit of Their Majesties, King and Queen, to Australia in 1952? If those reports are correct, will right honourable gentleman state whether the appointment of the Minister that purpose means that he will not assume control of the DepartTrade ment of the Interior until Royal Visit has concluded? Does the Prime Minister consider that it is in the calendar best interests of that department, particularly of the Northern Territory, which comprises one-sixth of the entire Australian continent, that an acting Minister, however capable he may be, should be responsible for administering that department whilst he is already administering another department which, in the past, has always been considered to require the sole attention of one Minister ?",18
43,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"The report to which the honourable member for the Northern Territory has referred is without foundation. The Australian Resident Minister in London will discuss in the next few weeks the preliminary arrangements for the Royal Tour. No appointment of a Minister to take charge of that tour, when it occurs in something like eighteen months' time, has yet been considered or made. HOUSING.",18
44,Mr SWARTZ,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I direct the attention of the Minister for Works and Housing to a report of a statement made on behalf of the Government of Queensland to the effect that a Dutch manufacturing concern has recently contracted to supply a number of prefabricated houses for that State. In view of the urgency of housing requirements, and of the fact that prefabricated houses will assist to overcome the existing shortage of dwellings, will the Minister give an assurance that the Commonwealth will be prepared to subsidize the purchase of the prefabricated houses for Queensland? Will he also indicate that the Commonwealth will grant a remission of customs Minisduty on such imported houses?",18
45,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Prefabricate d houses the from the Netherlands, provided they come within the terms of the Commonto wealth and State Housing Agreement, will be eligible for a Commonwealth subthe sidy, as will any other prefabricated houses selected by a State Government, the provided they come within the number of prefabricated houses in respect of which for the Commonwealth has undertaken to provide a subsidy. The Minister for and Customs has announced that the the present remission of customs duty will be continued until the end of this year. The matter of whether that remission should be extended into and 1951 is now being considered, but a decision has not yet been made. POLIOMYELITIS .",18
46,Mr MORGAN,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Has the attention ol the Minister for Health been drawn to the fact that two more deaths from poliomyelitis were reported yesterday by the New South Wales Department of Public Health. This brings this year's death-roll from that disease to 38 in New South Wales, although there were only four fatal cases in the corresponding period of last year. This year's total number of victims in New South Wales is 596, compared with 127 last year. Is the expert committee which has been set up by the Commonwealth able to throw light on this problem? If not, will the Minister urge the eommittee immediately to investigate the methods of treatment referred to by me in my previous question to him on the subject? Alternatively, will he take steps to have a parliamentary select committee appointed for the purpose of taking evidence from all available sources, unimpeded by preconceived notions or prejudices or any barriers of professional etiquette? Will the Minister give this matter his urgent and personal attention before further victims are stricken by this grim malady and will he make a full statement on the whole matter before the House adjourns this year?",18
47,Sir EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,I cannot imagine any grosser waste of public money than would be involved in the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to examine the causation of poliomyelitis when hundreds of the most expert technicians and doctors in the world are spending the whole of their time and many millions of pounds in trying to ascertain the cause of the disease.,19
48,Mr MORGAN,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,How far have they got?,19
49,Sir EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"The have got much further than any parliamentary committee in this country could get. It has been found that wet conditions are usually accompanied by an increased number of cases in Australia. That has also been so in America during this year. The actual cause of the disease has not yet been discovered, and it is not yet known how the disease is transmitted from one person to another. The special committee to which I referred some time ago will report tomorrow to the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Director-General of Health will b"". present on that occasion. I shall ascertain, when he returns, the nature of the report and whether a statement can usefully be made on the subject. RICE.",19
50,Mr CLARK,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"In view of the decision of rice interests to withhold rice from sale, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture arrange for an immediate investigation to be made by his department to ascertain the stocks of rice that are held in Australia, the legality of withholding this commodity from sale to certain citizens and the quantity of exportable surplus offering overseas? Will the Minister consider placing a restriction on the export of rice from Australia until the demands of the home market have been met in view of the scarcity and high costs of certain vegetables?",19
51,Mr MCEWEN,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I have asked for some information on this subject and expect to receive it in the near future. The export of processed and unprocessed rice calls for export permits. I shall keep myself informed on this subject and advise the honourable member for Darling and also the House, if necessary, of the position. I understand that the Australian Government has no legal right to order the withholding of rice from sale. The control which was exercised by the Australian Government over the distribution of rice was exercised under war-time authority and since the termination of that authority several years ago control has been exercised by agreement between the Rice Equalization Association Ltd. and the Australian Government. I am familiarizing myself with the position and will make a statement concerning it to the House if necessary. SNOWY MOUNTAINS SCHEME.",19
52,Mr FRASER,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"I ask the Minister for National Development a question concerning the progress of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme, which will involve the submerging of the village of Jindabyne. Can the Minister tell me, in the light of the present progress of the project, how much time will elapse before Jindabyne is flooded? Is the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority alive to the necessity for locating the site of the new Jindabyne and for drawing the plans of the new town as soon as possible How soon will the plans of the new Jindabyne be ready?",19
53,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,I believe that it will be at least five years before Jindabyne is likely to be submerged.,20
54,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Hear , hear!",20
55,Mr CASEY,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"For the comfort of my right honourable friend, the delay may be as long as eight years. The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority has the matter under consideration now. The views and wishes of the people of the township of Jindabyne will be taken into account, of course. I believe also that the Snowy River Shire Council is interested, and it will be consulted as well. I cannot tell the honourable gentleman exactly when precise plans, or even general plans, will be available but I hazard a guess that they will be ready about a year hence, which will be a number of years before the flooding of Jindabyne takes place. MR. EGBERT CUMBEEBATCH.",20
56,Mr CREMEAN,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Will the Minister for Immigration state the present position in relation to the proceedings that are reported to be pending against Egbert Cumberbatch, a West Indian native who was recently arrested in Sydney? Has the honourable gentleman received a petition from certain trade union oflicials that Cumberbatch be permitted to remain in Australia? If so, from what officials did he receive the petition and what was his reply to it?",20
57,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Cumberbatc h is a West Indian national who was taken off the ship on which he was working in 1949 for treatment in Australia. He could not be located later when normally he would have been repatriated, and recently he was charged with being a prohibited immigrant. The proceedings arising from that charge are still before the court. The hearing was adjourned until the 20th November. Some representations on behalf of Cumberbatch were received by the honourable member for West Sydney and the honourable member for East Sydney, and I have also received representations from the Sheet Metal Workers Union. I have not had an opportunity to consider the matter ? recently but, as it is now before the court, I shall ascertain whether any further examination of the facts is warranted. I point out that the man in question is not eligible to remain in Australia under our immigration policy. PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS.",20
58,Mr DALY,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"Is the Minister for Health aware that thousands of Australians are receiving from their doctors prescriptions for medicines that are not covered by the free medicine scheme? Does he consider that doctors are unnecessarily prescribing such medicines and, if so, what action does he intend to take to prevent that practice from being continued? If he does not consider that the medicines are being prescribed unnecessarily, what does he propose to do in order to add those essential medicines to the free medicine list?",20
59,Sir EARLE PAGE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"The Government's policy, which is to supply lifesaving and disease-preventing drugs to the community at large, has been very clearly stated. This Government has not the slightest intention of emulating either the New Zealand Government or the United Kingdom Government by permitting doctors to prescribe all sorts of medicines, many of which are of very little value. The free medicine schemes of New Zealand and the United Kingdom have been grossly abused and prescriptions of the kind that I have mentioned have imposed a tremendous drain upon the public purse. The money that the Government has at its disposal for the supply of free medicines, which is derived initially from the taxpayers, will be used in the wisest and best way.",20

66,Mr BEALE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE," - by leave- I desire to make a shortstatement concerninga matter that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition, (Mr Chifley) on the motion AOTthe adjournment of the House on Thursday last, the 16fch November:. Some time agoan honourable membermentioned to me the matter - of theallegeduse by the former member for, Corio, Mr Dedman, of a Commonwealth motor car in the Corio electorate, and recently the present r 1 honourable member for Corio (Mr. Asia. Opperman-) told me that constituents had complained to him about it, and' he asked rae to find out the f aets. I made inquiries, and last Wednesday I informed the House that Mr Dedman had from time to time been driven in a Commonwealth motor car in the Corio electorate with an' assessing officer of the Bepatriation Department, the effect of the practice being that Mr Dedman had been obtaining government transport for his own personal or political purposes. On Thursday last, while I was absent on urgent public business in Melbourne, the Leader of the Opposition referred to the matter in a speech on the motion for the adjournment of the House, and stated that he had been informed by Mr Dedman and by Mr. Broadby, ihe secretary of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, that Mr. Dedman had only travelled in a Commonwealth motor car as an associate regional officer acting on behalf of Mr Broadby in connection with the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme. added that Mr Dedman had also stated that he had never discussed politics on those visits. I was prepared to allow the incident to close on the reply that I had furnished the question without notice that was directed to me last Wednesday, the 15th November. However, as the Leader of the Opposition has seen fit to describe answer as a "" slanderous misrepresentation "" of Mr Dedman, I 'feel free to draw the attention of the House to the following additional matters:(1) Mr Dedman is the endorsed Labour candidate for Corio, and it is to Corio, and apparently only to Corio, that he has been travelling frequently for months past in a government motor car. Irrespective of the validity of the explanation which he now offers, one would have thought that by every rule of good taste and common Bense he would have refrained from travelling in a government motor car to the electorate where he was trying to win votes, lest his purpose be misunderstood, and lest he cause embarrassment to the civil servants who were thereby involved.

70,Mr BKTSON,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,I apologize.,22
71,Mr BEALE,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE,"(2 ) As to the explanation itself that Mr Dedman went down to Corio as an associate regional officer acting for Mr Broadby, that is, as a member of the regional committee, the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper) points out that visiting work is invariably done by a member of the industrial committee, all the members of which must be appointed by the Minister. Neither Mr Dedman nor Mr Broadby has ever been appointed to the regional committee, which is a State-wide comHe mittee concerned with the direction and organization of policy, and one is entitled to ask why this committee, which is not concerned with individual areas, is suddenly interesting itself, into the person of Mr Dedman, in the Corio area. In this connection it is significant - that a letter from the Director of the Re-establishment Division to Mr Dedman, my dated the 4th January, 1950, reveals that Mr Dedman, shortly after his defeat for the Corio division, was inquiring about Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme training and, to quote the letter, ""particularly in and around Geelong"", which is in the Corio area. (3) Furthermore, this story is also quite at variance with the official departmental explanation, which is as follows:Shortly after the last election arrangements were allegedly made by the then Director of Re-establishment Division with his then Deputy Director in Victoria for Mr Dedman, as ex-Minister, to see, as he desired, the results of the training scheme which he administered and which he had not had time to see. The House will observe that in this report there is nothing whatever about Mr Broadby appointing Mr Dedman as his delegate: The opinion of the chairman of the Repatriation Commission may be gathered from the final tersely expressed sentence of his report, which isInstructions were immediately issued that this was not to he repeated. (4) Finally, Mr Dedman says that he did not go down to the Corio electorate for political purposes or mention politics when he was there. On the other hand, it has been stated to me that Mr . Dedman has gone around among the trainees telling them who he is and that he was the Minister in charge when they got the benefits they were now enjoying. I do not know which is the righ t version, but I invite the House to draw its own conclusions in the light of all the matters that I bave mentioned above. BROADCASTING.",22
72,Mr ANTHONY,COMMONWEALTH JUBILEE," by leave-On the 9th November the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen) asked me a question relative to the overtime rates that are applied to the Australian Broadcasting Commission staff. A statement in relation to the matter was prepared for me by the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Mr Boyer, which readsThe effect of the penalty rates previously fixed by the commission applying to the rostered staff was to create serious anomalies between thoBe enjoying the penalty rates and other staff. The commission, therefore, made an alteration in the penalty rates which brought them into line with a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator covering announcing staff, in a government determination and other awards of the Arbitrator and Arbitration Court, covering week-end penalty rates for nhift workers. The alteration involves a reduction, but not elimination of week-end penalty rates. The commission has suggested to the Staff Association that if it desires an amendment of the new conditions, they should approach the Public Service Arbitrator for a variation, as he iB the appropriate authority to determine any dispute between the commission and Ita a taff. The Staff Association were under the impression that the Puhlic Service Arbitrator was not empowered to deal with the matter under dispute, but they have now been assured hy him that he can do so. The association, however, has indicated that it prefers at this stage to continue discussions with the commission. We have no official knowledge of any injunction to restrain the operation of the rates in question. MR. J. S. TEASDALE .  personal explanation. Some weeks ago I moved a formal motion for the adjournment of the House to discuss the action of the Minister for Commerce and A g r i culture (Mr MCEwen) in removing Mr .

During the course of my speech on that occasion I stated that Mr Teasdale, the present chairman of the board, was or had been a director of Westralian Farmers Limited . Mr . Teasdale has not asked me to correct that statement, but from another source that I accept as absolutely correct I have been informed that Mr Teasdale is not, and never has been, a director of Westralian Farmers Limited, but is a shareholder of that company.

75,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"MCPherson-Treasurer ) [3.35] - I moveThait the % ill be now 'read a second '.time. In - tnis bill the ""Government proposes to introduce 'a new system of Commonwealth ""payments for roads purposes to replace .the provisions of the 'Commonwealth Aid Roads and Works Act 1947 which expired on 'the 30th June this year. Briefly, the main proposals are(a) To make availa'ble each year for . roads a larger amount of money than under 'the former legislation and to ensure 'that the aggregate .grant will increase as petrol consumption increases. (6) To provide from 'this money a specific grant to the States for roads in rural areas as well as is grant for general roads purposes. (c) To give 'the States .express permission to use <any part of either of these grants to assist local authorities in the construction and upkeep - of - roads. (d) To provide for continuity in roads programmes 'by making the legislation operative for five .years. (e,) To :set >aside annual sums-for .ComBILL ""1950. monwealth expenditure on strategic roads and roads of access to Commonwealth .property and for the .promotion of road safety. These proposals have - been framed rby the ^Government 'after very careful - study of 'the present-day (problem of roads finance in Australia. Many representations have been ""received on various aspects of the subject from State governments, local .authorities, transport, motoring .and producers' organizations and other :bodies. The views 'have been obtained of people highly - experienced in resolution the engineering and administrative problems of roads, and the proposals in their present form were discussed with the State Premiers at the Conference of Commonwealth .and State Ministers last September. I .need not stress here the importance to .a country - like Australia .of a sound and .efficient roads system. Transport always has been and probably .always will be one of the 'basic economic problems .of this - country, ;and roads are one - of the main factors in the problem of transport. From a 'developmental standpoint, roads are - the .means of tapping large areas - of valuable resources. From the - productivity standpoint, ""roads involve the difference between slow, arduous and - costly transport .and the fast and cheap movement of .goods from place to place. From the defence .standpoint roads, together with railways and airways, provide 'the strategic lifelines for the land defence of the continent. With the development of motor transport, the relative importance of roads rhas grown enormously and it will 'probably 'continue to .grow. During Ithe twenty years 'before the recent war, a great deal of valuable .work was done to create .a network of .roads throughout Australia. This work would undoubtedly ""have gone 'a great deal further by now 'had it not been for the war. That road system proved of incalculable value during the period .of national danger. During the - war years main-power, equipment and - materials were drawn away into the war effort, new construction of roads for civil purposes came practically to .a. standstill, ,and standards of maintenance on existing from State to .State, it .seems that, by roads tended to decline. A number of la.i;ge, important new roads were, of course, built for military purposes during the war and though the economic value of of some of these roads is limited, they remain important links in our national roads organization. After the war will labour, materials and plant remained scarce and the .position in this regard improved only gradually. Meanwhile, the volume of road traffic was increasing and the heavier and faster types of vehicles which had .appeared were causing greater wear .and tear on road' surfaces. Coats of road construction and mainroad tenance rose very considerably. Priboth marily, .roads are the responsibility of State governments and local authorities, and the Australian 'Government ias no desire to encroach upon that responing sibility. Over many years, however, roads and streets. successive Australian Governments have recognized the developmental and defenbeing sive importance of roads and have made grants to the States for expenditure r.oad construction and maintenance. first such grant was made in 1923 while in 1926 the Bruce-Page Government negotiated with the States .a ten-year agreement under which the Commonthat wealth was to pay to the States £2,00.0,000 yearly for roads purposes. That agree will ment is generally regarded as a landyears, mark in the progress .of the Australian roads system. During the war Commonwealth roads payments to the States continued, though on a 'diminished scale, because .civil sumption of petrol, to which roads grants were related, also diminished. But exported penditure on roads was restricted in those years, and the .State .governments were all able to build up substantial ibalanccs in their roads funds. The effect of the Commonwealth Aid Boads and Worka financial Act 1947, and of amendments to that act in the two following years, was increase the amount of Commonwealth roads payments to the States, and the in petrol consumption also tended crease those payments. During the last three {financial years total Commonwealth payments for roads have averaged proceeds £7,7\00,0fl0 a .year compared with £3,800,000 a year in the three years 1936 to 1939. Whilst - experience has varied - and shortage <of labour and - materials has done more thaoi any lack .of money to hold - up pi-ogress in roads work. Some the State governments .still have substantial balances in their roads funds. It is abvious that a vast amount - of work .need to he done on the roads in - the next few years. A great deal of leeway has to be made up in repairing and rebuilding - roads and bridges. Heavier types 'Of vehicles are making necessary heavier forms .of .construction, not only on main roads and highwaysfeatalso on secondary roads. An immense programme of new building is waiting to be carried out in rural - areas and in and around the municipalities where the .establishment of industries and the development of housareas require the - construction of Boad construction and maintenance a function of the States, Commonwealth financial assistance for roads on should be regarded as supplementary to The State resources, and not .as a means of relieving the States of any obligation to provide their share of additional finance for the large volume of road work is now necessary. Since it is clear, however, that a good deal more money be required for roads in the next few the Australian Government is prepared again to increase very substantially its contribution to this vital national work. It is now proposed, therefore, to set aside for roads payments each .year for the next five years an amount equal conto 6d. a gallon of .customs duty on impetrol entered for civil consumption, and 3Jd. ,a gallon excise on locally produced petrol. As before, aviation spirit will not be included in the calculation of these amounts. In the present year it is estimated that the amount of money so set aside will be to approximately £12,000,000. By way of eomparison, I recall that Commonwealth rise payments for roads in 1949-50 amounted to into 'approximately £9,400,000. Moreover, since the full amount of the proposed payments is to be related to of duties on petrol, it will increase year by year to the 'extent that petrol consumption increases. On present trends in petrol consumption, the proposed payments will increase by about £1,000,000 a year, though it is of course not possible to predict whether the present trends will be maintained. I should point out that under the former legislation only part of the total payments increased with petrol consumption, so that the proposals in this bill afford the possibility of a greater annual rate of increase in road payments. On the question of allocating Commonwealth roads grants as between different classes of roads or different areas, the Government has heard many different views. Formerly Commonwealth road grants to States were made for roads purposes generally. Then in the Commonwealth Aid Roads and ""Works Act 1947 a specific grant was made for roads in sparsely settled areas and timber country. This was in addition to a general roads grant. In the light of all the information and advice available it appears to the Government that there is a strong case for making two separate grants. ""Whilst the States should be in a position to maintain and extend their road systems as a whole, including main roads, trunk roads and highways there are good grounds for the view that we have reached a stage when special attention should be given to what might be called secondary roads which exist principally in rural areas. These run off the main roads and traverse the actual farming and pastoral areas and extend into the undeveloped regions. Sometimes they carry heavy traffic and sometimes relatively little traffic; but in all instances they are highly important to the people in the areas that they serve. They are also very important to the economy as a whole, because they are the means of bringing the wealth of primary products to the main roads and to the railways. The Government, therefore, proposes to make a special grant for roads in rural areas as well as a general roads grant. This principle was introduced in the former legislation and it proved to be very valuable. In that legislation, however, the purposes of the grant were so defined that they could be taken to limit its scope unduly and doubts arose from time to time about Mr Fadden. which roads were eligible for expenditure under the grant. In the new proposals the scope of the grant has been widened to comprehend all roads in rural areas, other than main roads, trunk roads and highways. For example, it will now cover what are called feeder roads and developmental roads as well as roads in sparsely settled areas and roads serving ex-soldier settlements. It will also include roads in country municipalities and shires. This point was at issue under the former legislation because it was considered that funds made available for sparsely settled or rural areas could not be expended in and around country towns. However, that contention has little substance. The roads in and around country towns servo the surrounding districts as well as the. towns themselves. Many of them bear quite heavy traffic and entail considerable costs of upkeep. It seems entirely proper, therefore, to bring them within a grant for roads in rural areas. For this special grant for rural roads the Government proposes to allocate 35 per cent, of the total amount to be set aside for roads purposes annually. That is - to say the amount will be equal to 35 per cent, of the proceeds of 6d. a gallon customs duty and 3-Jd. a gallon excise on petrol. In the current year, the amount is estimated at £4,200,000 which would be £1,200,000 greater than the grant that was made in 1949-50 under the former legislation for roads in sparsely settled areas. The increase would thus be of the order of 40 per cent. Moreover, unlike the former grant which was limited to a specific amount, the proposed grant would increase with petrol consumption. Apart from this special grant, it is proposed to make, as before, a general grant to the States for the construction, reconstruction and maintenance of roads generally. Unlike the grant for general roads purposes made under the previous legislation this grant may also be used for the purchase of road-making equipment. This money, therefore, wili be available to State Governments to expend as they think fit on roads purposes whilst up to one-sixth of the amount may be expended on works connected with road, or water, transport. The States will be able to use tbese funds as they tbink necessary in either urban or rural areas. They may finance works carried out by their own roads organizations or, as I shall explain in more detail, they may assist local authorities financially to carry out roads works and purchase road making equipment. The amount of this general grant will be equal to 65 per cent, of the total amount to be set aside by the Commonwealth each year, less £600,000 a year which is to be allocated for strategic roads and for road safety. The estimated amount in this financial year is £7,200,000 which may be compared with the payment of ' £5,800,000 in 1949-50. As under the former legislation, this general grant will increase with petrol consumption. I wish to make clear the attitude of the Australian Government with respect to assistance to local authorities for roads purposes. Many urgent representations have been made to the Government on this subject, about which, however, there ought to be no misunderstanding. Local authority affairs, including local authority finances belong to the province of the State governments and the Commonwealth cannot and should not undertake responsibility in that field. The Government, of course, recognizes the very important functions of local authorities and believes that it is necessary that the local authorities should be in. a position to carry out those functions adequately. That, however, is primarily the concern of the State governments and the Australian Government will not try to intervene in the matter. In this legislation, therefore, it is made perfectly plain that the State governments may use any of the money to be received under the general roads grant to assist local authorities in either urban or rural areas and any part of the grant for roads in rural areas to assist local authorities in those areas. Beyond that, however, it does not go; and in respect of how the money received under either of these grants is allocated by the State governments, it is for local authorities to deal with the State governments themselves and not with the Australian Government. Apart from the grants to the State governments for roads, the Government proposes, as the former legislation provided, to set aside an amount of £500,000 a year for the construction and maintenance of strategic roads and roads of access to Commonwealth property. These strategic roads were built during the war as part of Australia's defence organization, and it is important from a defence standpoint to keep them up to a proper standard of maintenance. In some instances they run through Commonwealth territories and are, therefore, wholly the responsibility of the Commonwealth. In other instances, however, they are located in the States and whilst they may not have an economic value sufficient to justify the States maintaining them at the requisite standard, expenditure by the Commonwealth upon them will undoubtedly be of economic benefit to the States and to the community as a whole. The proposal to make £100,000 a year available for promotion of road safety continues the provision that has been made in recent years. I believe that honourable members would agree that money that is effectively expended on road safety could hardly be devoted to a more laudable purpose. To sum up, the payments which it is estimated will be made in the current financial year under this legislation compare with the road payments made last year as follows:1949-50. 1950-51, actual. estimate. fin. ' £m. Grant for general road purposes 5.8 7.2 Grant for use on rural roads 3.0 4.2 Provision for strategic roads .5 .5 Provision for road safety .1 .1 9.4 12.0 With respect to the term for which the legislation should operate, some balancing of considerations is necessary. Since authorities responsible for roads should be in a position to plan ahead and work to definite programmes, it is important that financial provision for roads programmes should be assured for a reasonably long term. On the other hand, the probability that circumstances that affect transportation and roads will continue to change makes it inadvisable to project legislation too far into the future, The Government has reached the conclusion that a term of five years will probably be found appropriate. At the end of that period' it can be expected that the subject will be re-consid'ered.. The proposed distribution of the grants to the States will be made in accordance with the formula that has applied under previous legislation. That is to say, 5 per cent, of each of the two grants will be paid to Tasmania and 9'5 per cent, to the five mainland States on the basis of fifths according to population of the States as at the 1947 census and twofifths according to the areas of the This' formula has on the whole proved satisfactory in the past and there are no apparent reasons why it should not be found at least as satisfactory during the 1 term of this legislation. I mentioned earlier that the bill pro1 vides that one-sixth of the grant for general roads' purposes may be used by the States at their discretion for works connected with road' and water transport. It . was recognized in earlier years that some people who used petrol and paid tax on it did not use theroads in their ordinary business and., therefore; they received no direct benefit from the roads grants. Typical of such peoplewould be the ownersof fishing boats and motor launches. Eor that reason the States were permitted to use a portion of the grants for transport works other than roads and under that provision the States were able to make money available' construct boat havens and j.ettiesfor benefit of owners and users of small water-craft. The relevant provisionin this bill is intended to serve a similar community. purpose. In this respect, as in other respects also-, the States are permitted to adjourned. use the Commonwealth grants in certain ways, but are not required to do. so. Taken, with the funds availableto the States from sources of their own,, the moneys to. be providedunder this bill should ensure, that adequatefinance wil be available for roadsduring the few years: Apart from: Commonwealth FAJJDENgrants, total receipts of State roads funds, other than-, loam: moneys in the last cialyear,, amounted to- £11,600,000-. This year, the amount will be considerably greater,, because motorregistrations Mr Fadden. increasing and because three of the States have lately increased motor taxation. Therefore, Commonwealth and State payments combined, seemlikely to provide between £23,000,000: and £24,000,000 for road's in this financial year, and the amount can be expected to increase in subsequent years with increasing motor registrations and consumptionof petrol'. I have not includedih those figures; ttie substantial sums which local authorities raise from rates, and which are partly three- available forexpenditure onroads and available for expenditure on roads and streets, or the balances in State States. roads funds. At the 30th June this year, these balances amounted to nearly £5-,500',000 and in some of the States at least, the balances were larger than necessary for working purposes. I should say. that, on a reasonable estimate, there should be something like £30',000j000 a year available for expenditure: on roads throughout Australia during the next five years, and even allowing for higheicosts of labour and materials', that sum should be ample foi"" the purpose. We bave to keep in mind that, important though we all recognize road development to be,, there are many other great fields of constructional work which have high priority claims to manpower; materialsand finance, and road programmes must be framed with due r.egard to the requirements of those other projects-. I confidently commend this bill to to honourable members as onedesigned to the promote great constructive progress throughout the whole of Australia, and to bring, great benefits to all. sections of the Debate (on motion by Mr Ward) SALES TAX (EXEMPTION S AND CLASSIFICATIONS) BIL E 1950. SECOND BEADING.. Debate resumed from, the12th October next (vide page 795) on motion by Mr. That thehill be now read a sceond. tame. finan Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [3.57] This is another measure in the' catalogue of bill* which this Government has are introduced, or proposes to introduce, allegedly .to .put - value hack auto the £ 1 , but like all other such bills, it will have precisely the opposite effect. The Government doubtless would like to create the impression that it is not only trying to put value back into the f l , but - is .also giving effect to the clear and uniquivocal promises made by the twin - leaders of the present tory coalition in their policy speeches during the last general election campaign. Let us refresh our memories about those matters, so that the House and .the nation can appreciate .the wanton and contemptuous manner in which the Government has repudiated the promises which it so glibly made a few months ago. I shall begin with the policy speech of the senior partner in - the leadership of this Government. The present Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) said in his policy speech at Camberwell, Victoria, - on the 10th November, 1949Wc wiJI institute H prompt overhaul of the Taxation la.\v<s by a competent committee, to simplify the Statutes and remove anomalies. Wc will review the incidence of indirect taxes .(which ar.e a huge though sometimes unrecognized item in Australia 1 upon basic wage and cost of living items and housing costs. The present Treasurer (Mr Fadden), who is the junior partner in the coalition, delivered a policy speech on behalf of the Australian Country party on the 17th "" November, 1949, at Boonah, in Queensland, and he made the following definite statement on our tax laws:Wc promise that a competent review will also be made of the incidence of indirect fixation because we recognize the necessity for sensible reductions in the many cases whore such reductions will nrrest the upward trend of living costs. No words could be clearer than those two statements made by the leaders of the present Government in their successful attempt to mislead the people of Australia into believing that, by voting for the Liberal party and the Australian Country party, they would elect a government pledged to a policy of .reducing taxes. The scaling down of indirect taxation was only complementary to their other project of reducing direct taxation. But the Government has not yet made an effort, strangely enoughalthough in some respects it is not so - strange-to give effect to those promises which were made so glibly during the last general election campaign. Until the ihudget session, which was not commenced u n t i l nine months after that election, we lieard no mention from the Government of its plans for putting value back into the , f 1, and reducing the cost of living, but the Treasurer began his second-reading speech on the Sales Tax -(Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1950 with the following words:In accordance with the assurances given by the Government, a comprehensive review of the .sales tax law has been carried out, and due consideration has been given to the many requests that have been made from time to time for exemption from sales tax of numerous classes of goods, I pause at that point to remind the House that the right honourable gentleman referred to the assurances that had been given by the Government, and f h at I have quoted them most f a it h full y from the policy speeches of the present Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I return now to the Treasurer's second reading speech on this bill. He proceeded as follows:It will be appreciated that it would be quite impossible to accede to all those requests, but relief is being given as far as is possible in the present circumstances. Up to that point, there was no suggestion that the degree of relief by way of reductions of sales tax would be much more than offset by the increases which the Treasurer subsequently announced in the same speech. He saidThe new exemptions of building material .iaclude builders' hardware such as naUs, bolts, screws, door handles, - locks and similar fittings of a kind installed by builders as fixtures in,'houses. - Shortly afterwards, the right honourable gentleman made the following statement:.Exemption is also being allowed in respect of structural steel in the form of girders, which, although used mostly in industrial and business premises, are to some extent used in buildings which provide residential accommodation such .as hostels. In other words, the few remaining items of building equipment, which were still - subject to sales tax, were - to be exempted from that impost. I believe that the figure would represent not more than about 5 per cent, of the total cost of 'erecting :a house. An interesting point is that .steel girders are to be .exempt from sales tax because they are, to some degree - to use the Treasurer's own. words-use d in buildings which provide residential accommodation such as hostels. The benefit from the abolition of sales tax on that item will mostly be derived by persons who construct factories, large residential premises and big private houses, for which steel girders are required. Such structures are not built with the same materials as are used in the erection of small houses. That concession is a pay-off to the Government's supporters in the big business world, particularly in the building world, for the services which were so generously rendered to the Liberal party and the Australian Country party to ensure their success at the la3t general election. The Treasurer has stated that the value of the remissions of sales tax will be approximately £1,000,000 for a complete year, and about £640,000 for the current financial year. So far, so good! Nobody would object in general terms to those remissions of sales tax if the Treasurer had stopped at that point. But, having given a miserable amount with one hand, he proceeded to scoop in large amounts with the other baud by increasing the sales tax on other items. They are set out in the schedule to this bill, and I shall deal with them presently. The collections from those increased rates of sales tax will yield additional revenue amounting to £10,000,000 for a complete year, and approximately £7,500,000 for the remainder of the current financial year. This is not only a tax reducing and a tax producing measure; this is not only a measure which gives away £1,000,000 in a full year and collects £10,000,000 in the same year. According .to the Treasurer this is a measure to meet the demon of inflation. These are his wordsAustralia is at present handicapped by shortages of certain essential goods, whilst oilier classes of less essential goods able to the public in large quantities, and sell readily even at high prices. The taxing of these latter goods at higher rates is regarded as clearly justifiable from more than one angle. No doubt other honourable members of the Opposition will deal more fully than I am able to do in my limited time with the items regarded as more justifiably Mr Calwell. taxable-mout h organs, lipstick, and Jew's harps. The Treasurer went on to sayIn the first place, a heavier impost can reasonably be expected to check the demand for such gootls, to cause a diversion of labour to employment of greater value to t h f nation, and to release more materials for goods which are essential to the nation's welfare aud protection. The goods the demand for which is to be checked are jew's harps, bagpipes, mouth organs, lipstick and similar luxury items.. The proposal is anti-inflationary, according to the Treasurer, because it has been framed to cause a diversion of labour to employment of greater value to the nation. And that is nothing short of man-power conscription. That is no different from an indirect man-power control. If honourable members opposite waxed eloquent during the recent general election campaign at all, surely it was on the question of manpower direction. I quote again from the speech of the Leader of the Liberal party. The right honourable gentleman saidThe socialists of Great Britain , nearer to the socialist precipice than we are in Australia, are already introducing industrial conscription. How could they do otherwise? It is essential to the whole socialist conception. Those were the words of the Prime Minister who leads a government which proposes to use a sales tax for the purpose of introducing industrial conscription.",24
76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,The honourable member is putting up an aunt sally and knocking it down in order to get outside the terms of this bill which has nothing to do with industrial conscription.,30
77,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"I am entitled to question the Treasurer's statement that the bill has been introduced to cause a diversion of labour to employment of greater value to the nation, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am entitled to point out that what the Treasurer said when speaking on the second reading of this bill was different from what he aTe availand what the Leader of the Liberal party said a few months ago. I am entitled to say that no Minister has the right to use the sales tax to prevent anybody from choosing his own job. No Treasurer has the right to introduce legislation of this nature and to tell people who are making lipstick today that they must make bricks tomorrow. He has no right to say to people, "" I will take you out of the occupation of your choosing where you are employed by an employer who wants to invest his money in his own way. That employer will have to close his business, if necessary, and you will have to take work in a brick kiln, making bricks, or in the country districts, cutting timber, or draw on the unemployment and sickness benefit fund "".",30
78,Mr HASLUCK,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,That is a fantastic exaggeration.,31
79,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Hasluck) can make his apologies to his electors on this issue and on other issues on which he will need to make them.,31
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,The bill before the House deals with the application of sales tax. That is the subject with which the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) should deal.,31
81,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"I am dealing with that subject, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Treasurer dealt with man-power conscription at the beginning and also at the end of his policy speech. This is what the Leader of the Australian Country party saidOn December 10th, you will be called upon make your final choice- a government pledged to foster and defend the philosophies of expanding freedom for the individual; or a government pledged to make you a pawn of a powerful State by a process of dictatorship, control and conscription. He concluded with an exhortation of the same sort. In between, he talked about reducing taxation, particularly sales tax. Referring to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley), the Leader of the Australian Country party, towards the end of his policy speech, saidHc does not tell you that socialism cannot work without man-power conscription. On the Treasurer's own words, capitalism apparently cannot work without manpower conscription and this Government cannot function without a measure of this sort which, en the one hand, seeks to raise a certain amount of sales tax but, on the other hand, uses the taxation instrument for the purpose of denying people an opportunity to work where and for whom they wish to work.",31
82,Mr HASLUCK,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,There is not the least direction of the individual provided for anywhere in this bill.,31
83,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"The honourable member is very simple. In. spite of his long experience of the United Nations organization and in spite of the fact that he had to fight Vishinsky on occasions, he fails to see that one does not achieve one's objective always by direct means so sucessfully as by the use of a measure of this sort. The Treasurer has said, ""Let us find work for these people in other spheres. It will make the economy function more efficiently and satisfactorily than it is functioning today when women are buying lipstick at the rate of about six a year in the case of business girls and two or three in the case of housewives "".",31
84,Mr HASLUCK,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,Does the honourable member object to the use of the tariff to bring about economic effects?,31
85,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"No . But I object to a government of this sort, which talks so much about cant and humbug and hypocrisy, perpetrating a measure of this kind and expecting the country to believe it is doing so in an attempt to stop inflation. The Treasurer is no modern St. George. He is not going to charge to the dragon of inafltion and spear it to death. He will creep up on inflation instead and pierce it to the heart with a lipstick container. He will woo it to the death with a jew's harp. He will soothe its troubled soul with the bagpipes, and then kill it with heavily taxed tooth picks. He will do all sorts of things but he will not meet inflation with the methods by which it must be met. Honourable members of the Opposition will tell the people of Australia this when they face them and the sooner we face them the better. Honourable members opposite have avoided the question of lipstick as if it were the plague. The Government proposes to tax lipstick but not shaving cream. That proves to the women of Australia that this is a man-drafted law, enacted by a man dominated parliament. No concern is displayed for the women in legislation of this sort. It is just another burden on the harassed housewife and the business girl. The Labour party stands for. theabolition of the sales tax. It bas alwaysdone soi",31
86,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,A Labour government introduced the tax.,32
87,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Yes , at a time of graveeconomic crisis. But when the Labour party was inpower during the worse period of the war against Japan, when the nation was in grave danger, it did not increase the rate of tax beyond 25 per cent, and it did not at any time take from the people more than £40',000,000by way of sales tax in any one year. TheChifley Government last year reduced the general rate from 10 per cent, to 8$ per cent. The present Government parties went to' the people in the .general' election campaign and said, "" We believe in getting rid of sales tax "". 'That declaration was implied in all their -.propaganda. Yet, now whenthey are in power, they present us with a bill which provides for the unprecedented rate of 33-J per cent., a new limit that has been Specially established allegedly for the purpose of fighting inflation. Into the new category of goods that, will be taxable at 33-J per cent, will go such items as furs, jewellery and toilet preparations, which were taxed at 25 per cent, under Labour's administration, and also many items that were taxed by the Labour Government at only 8-J per cent. Into the 25 per cent, category will go many items that were entirely exempt from sales tax previously. This Government proposes to take from the people of Australia by means of sales tax a total amount of £57,500,000 this year. Of that sum, £7,500,000 will be represented by the added imposts for which this legislation provides. Somebody asked me by interjection earlier what the Labour party had done to abolish the sales tax. Labour governments progressively reduced the rates of tax, as I shall show. The Treasurer can verify my statements by reference to officers of his own department.",32
88,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,I supplied the honourable member with the figures.,32
89,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"That is true, but there is a slight discrepancy between those figures and other figures that I . obtained earlier: I had no intention of checking the list that the right honourable gentleman provided, but I mislaid my first set ttemporarily and obtained another set. The Treasurer may not have seenthe 1 figureshe supplied, which set out in detail the relief that was< afforded to the taxpayers by theChifley Administration, especially from the end. of the war in 1945 until the end of 1949. I shall deal 1 specifically with-sales tax and customs and 1 excise duties* the two forms of indirect tax to which the Treasurer referred. In1943', long before the end of World War II . , and periodically thereafter the Labour Administration progressively reduced sales tax. Two reductions were announced in one year-1946 . In the aggregate,, the people benefited by concessions that represented £35,525,000 a year.",32
90,Mr TOM BURKE,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,And that figure is based upon the prices that prevailed before the onset of inflation.,32
91,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Yes . As the honourable member so sagely reminds me, the value of sales tax concessions granted by the Labour Administration,, if based upon present prices, would be about £50,000,000 a year. But this Government, with the greatest revenue in history bringing in £130,000,000 more than was recorded in the government accounts for last year, proposes to add £10,000,000 in one year to the sales tax bill and offers no worthwhile reductions. To the degree that it has planned a reduction of £1,000,000 a year, it has redeemed its promise; but to the degree that it proposes to levy additional sales tax amounting to £10,000,000, it has repudiated the undertaking that it gave to the electors. The Labour Administration reduced customs and excise charges by amounts that represented £6,000,000 in one year. In other words, the people benefited by the lifting of £41,000,000 a year from their indirect tax burden under Labour's administration. Of course, that amount would be nearer £60,000,000 than £40,000,000 if the prices of other years, on which it is based, were marked up to the level of present prices. The Treasurer will have to do a lot of talking if he hopes to explain away the proposed increases. He made two excuses in his second-reading speech. First, he said that the increases were necessary in order to raise revenue, and, secondly, he said that they would enable the Government to tackle the problemof inflation... Of the additional revenue that the. right honourable gentlemam proposes to obtaia by. this; means, about £.600',.0.00 will come from toilet, preparations, which are to be taxed at the nate ofr per cent. With a budget of over £70& 000;000, he will get. £600;000 r fiiona additional tax on toilet preparations ! The ideai is so fantastic that. I could not hav.e imagined any Government that wished to survive-and I have never knowm a government that was more desperately anxious to survive than is the present Government-darin g to embark on such a course of action. In: the worse days of the war against * Japan-, when the Labour Government had to tax the people as heavily as it could, borrow as extensively as it could, and use the national credit to the utmost limit it did' not raise the highest rate of sales tax beyond 25 per cent. But, in this war against inflation, when the Treasurer is able to lay his hands on all the money about - the place, and nobody will deny that Australia is much wealthier today than it. was in the dark days of 1942, the right honourable gentleman presents to us this infamous proposal to impose sales tax at the rate of 33$ per cent, and to drag into the upper category goods that should not be taxed at all. There is a long list of items, the inclusion of some of which isfarcical. The Government's proposals appear even more fantastic when one examines the proposed amendments to the schedules that have been circulated. deal with such items as school bags, bags and attache cases. The Treasurer must have reached the ultimate degree mathematical perfection in assessment be can proclaim that attache cases and kit bags shall be liable to the highest rate of sales tax if they exceed 18 inches in length, but shall be taxed at S-J cent, if they do not. TJnder his amended scales, also, a mother who wants to a lunch bag for her child will be taxed at the rate of 33-Jper cent, if the bag ing. exceeds 12 inches in' length. And all this is intended to help the Treasurer his fight against the enemy of inflation. Many members of the community are otherwise. gravely concerned about the setback that, will be given to cultural development by the heavy impost of 25 per cent, upon Hume! radio sets, musical ' instruments, and gramophone records. That chargewill not be confined to. recordings of jazz-music and the rest of the-cheap, stuff that isi often 1 described as negroid and nasty. The finest wodss, of the most famous composers; asperformed' by the greatest modern, inteopofeters of music; will beai thisvieiousi taoc. Recordingsof Bach fugues and preludes; Beethoven sonatas, and' the works, ol Rachmaninoff, Brahms, Wagner, Haydn and Liszt will be taxed in order that the Treasurer may combat inflation! The exquisite interpretive genius of men like Kreisler will bearan extra charge of 25 - per cent, in order that luxury living' shall be discouraged! This proposal, of course, emanates from a government that is always boasting of its culture. It has a lot of university products in its ranks, men whomix with thenice people and the higher orders of capitalist society. They propose to deny the average worker, who cannot afford to attend many high-class concerts, the right even to listen to gramophone records ujaless he pays an extra 25 per cent, for the privilege. ",32
92,Mr OAL WELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"I am sorry that Government supporters are so amazed whenever I tell them a few home, truths. They open, wide their big, blue, innocent eyes and gape when I tell them what the Government is doing to culture, and They they become quite excited when I kit explain how this Government is making the little people carry the of burden of its war against inflation. I if shall be glad to hear their excuses and apologies, and I hope to meet some of them on public platforms in the electorates that they represent so that we can per discuss these matters. I enjoy nothing better in the field of disputation than, buy to meet opponents in public on issues such as the one that we are now discussI shall guarantee to provide audiences in their own electorates for in any Government supporters who may wish to debate with me. Many of them would not be able to attract an audience",33
93,Mr CHABLES ANDERSON,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,Com e to,33
94,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"I shall be glad to do so and to debate publicly with the honourable member the demerits of this bill and the wool sales deduction legislation as well. The Government proposes even to put photograph frames into the 25 per cent, sales tax category. Anybody who wants to frame a photograph of his grandmother or of a family group will have to pay 25 per cent, additional tax. If we want to hang framed photographs of the present Treasurer and the present Prime Minister side by side, we shall have to pay 25 per cent, more for the pleasure of doing so than would have been necessary under the Labour Government's scale of tax. I am concerned about the interests of young couples, who will have to pay this extra tax upon frames for their wedding photographs. Why, this Government even regards marriage as a luxury!",34
95,Mr FADDEN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"But Labour taxed the wedding ring. ' Mr Calwell-The Treasurer can talk for 75 minutes in reply to this debate, as he did in reply to the debate on the wool sales deduction legislation, and try to explain to the people then why he finds it necessary to impose these outrageous and obnoxious charges. The right honourable gentleman would find an examination of the reductions and exemptions that were granted by Labour governments most enlightening. In 3944, the Labour Government exempted most building materials from sales tax. In 1945, it exempted a further list of such materials as well as plant and machinery used in various manufacturing processes and in certain mining operations. In April, 1946, it exempted certain foodstuffs, building fittings and explosives.",34
96,Mr WARD,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,This Government has left alarm clocks off the sales tax list.,34
97,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Yes , for the reason that the honourable member for East is Sydney (Mr Ward) has already stated. It wants the workers to wake early in the mornings so that they can get to work early and thus help to increase producwealthy, tion. But all other clocks and watches, which the Labour Administration reduced to the S-h per cent, tax category, are to be lifted to the 33$ per cent, category. The reductions that the Labour Government made in 1947 affected foodstuffs and aids to manufacture. In 1948, it made further reductions and exemptions, and in 1949 lowered the general rate of sales tax from 10 per cent, to 8$ per cent, and transferred some items from the 25 per cent, list to the 8$ per cent. list. The Chifley Government established the lowest category of sales tax ever imposed-that of 8$ per cent. This Government has reversed the process and established the highest ever known in our history, that of 33$ per cent. The goods that we reduced to the 8$ per cent, list will go back in many cases to the 25 per cent, category. The measure has nothing at all to recommend it. It is not devised in accordance with any of the recognized canons of taxation, because taxation that is properly applied is levied upon those who are best able to bear the burden. This proposal conflicts with, contradicts aud violates every canon of taxation of which I have ever heard. It is a retrograde and retrogressive step and is one of which the Government will have reason to be ashamed when it ultimately faces the electors. Labour promises the people of Australia a complete review of all taxation. We shall get rid of the 33$ per cent, rate of sales tax. If it were not necessary to impose such a high sales tax during the war, it is not necessary to do so now. I remind honourable members opposite that sales tax was first imposed for the primary purpose of obtaining additional revenue. If hack in 1931, the Government of that time was not, according to Government supporters, justified in introducing sales tax, then the present Government has even less justification for increasing it because it proposes, quite illegitimately, to do so in order to introduce control of manpower and industrial conscription. When Labour takes office-and the time not far off now--it will reduce indirect taxes, including sales tax and duties of customs and excise, because it believes that the right people to be taxed are the and that the best and fairest tax is income tax that is imposed on a sliding scale according to the incomes of the taxpayer. If the Government wanted additional revenue wliy did it not introduce a nieasure to increase income tax in order to provide the money that it now seeks to obtain by increased sales tax? I know that next February or March the Treasurer will have to come to the Parliament again and bring down a blood and tears, supplementary budget to increase all taxes. Doubtless he will then seek to impose more taxes on wheat and wool, on manufacturers and on profit makers, and amongst other proposals he will probably ask the Parliament to increase income tax. He should confront his difficulties fairly now. If the honourable gentleman considers additional taxes must be imposed, then he should troduce legislation for that purpose withtally out delay. He will find that running away from that unpleasant duty will pay no better dividend than the Government's decision to run away from currency revaluation. The present Government is on the skids, and the sooner it falls better. Mr DEUJOffOND .(New England) occurring [4.32] - The forecast made by the honorlikely able member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) about the fall of the present Government was inspired, no doubt, by wishful thinking. One admires the burst of optimism which led the honourable gentleman to conclude that the people of Australia, who so recently experienced eight years of Labour's administration, with which the honourable gentleman so prominently connected, will forget those experiences so quickly. However, the honourable gentleman turned his guns on the measure that is now before the House, and in doing so he brought into issue, as it were, the credibility of the witnesses for the defence. He said that the Labour party stands for the abolition of the sales tax. I remind the honourable gentleman, however, that while Labour was in office it did not supply much following extract:evidence of its desire to abolish that tax. The honourable gentleman also spoke at a The considerable length of the disabilities under which the Government of which ing he was a member laboured in dealing with the a situation that arose out of the receut war and the after effects of that war. I am quite prepared to admit at. the validity of that argument. We not conduct a war on the basis that sacrifices are unnecessary. On the contrary, war must be conducted npon the basis that sacrifices are inevitable. Consequently, if the honourable gentleman takes his stand upon the theory that war and the implications of war render sacrifices necessary, including the levying of sales tax, which I dislike in theory as much as he does, I agree with him. Obviously if any nation is to survive in war everything must be made subsidiary to its proper defence. We come now to the consideration of right how that valid argument may be applied to the present situation. Are we in- at war, or in danger of war? IncidenI notice that discussions have proceeded elsewhere upon those questions. The Parliament is asked to confront the question whether we are at war or are in imminent danger of becoming involved in war, because, after all, any real threat the of war requires us to implement a major defence programme. If we admit at once that there is a possibility of war or, what is worse, that war is to occur, we must accept the full implications of the arguments placed before the House by the honourable member for Melbourne in justification of the attitude towards sales tax adopted by a previous Labour administration. I take up the argument from that point. I have with me a copy of the "" Monthly Letter on Economic Conditions and Gowas vernment Finance"" issued by the National City Bank of New York for September, 1950. That bank is, I suppose, the largest private banking institution in the world, and it is certainly one of the best informed. The issue to which I have referred deals with certain matters that have a distinct bearing on the problem that is now confronting Australia. In particular, I invite the attention of honourable gentlemen to the prompt action by Congress in expediting bill to increase federal taxes substantially, as recommended by President Truman followthe outbreak bf war in Korea, will haye effect both of providing an increase in Treasury revenues to cover the risins military exnenditnres and of acting as a brake upon the inflationary pressures now present. once That statement refers both to the candefence programme undertaken by the United 'States of America and to the inflationary pressures that 'have arisen from the defensive - action that has 'been taksen by the 'United States 'Government. Wien such action is taken by our .great ally and friend, can we be so 'blind to fihe obligations >of our own .position that we will ""neither face - up to the need to provide '.proper defence for ourselves nor take steps to counter inflationary pressures? After all, Australia's destiny is inextricably bound up with that of the United States of America and, indeed, of all Western democracies. When we find that a nation so wealthy and powerful as is the United States of America is compelled to revise the taxation programme put before it by its President in order to achieve a similar objective to that now sought by the Australian Government, which is to obtain .additional revenue by increasing taxes, I 'think that it is idle and beside the point (for honourable members opposite - to criticize the present vernment for having introduced this measure. To suggest that because the present Government promised, in the light 'of the situation that obtained during the last general-election campaign,, to reduce taxes, it should be reproached for having (broken faith with the electors, or that it has introduced .a taxation measure that is not necessary, is to reflect the irresponsibility «of those who offer such criticisms. As one who - followed the leaders of the present .Government during the last general e'lection campaign, I admit at once that I expressed freely flie view that it was desirable that taxes should be reduced. I said, in particular, that it would be in - the interests of the country to reduce - sales tax, and I still believe that if circumstances permitted sales tax 'should be reduced and ultimately discontinued. However, we should be failing in our duty, .and the 'Government would be failing in its 'duty, if we did not clearly appreciate the - fact that circumstances have materially altered since the 'Government leaders delivered tlieir .policy speeches. It requires courage to introduce to the Parliament measures that are exactly contrary to those advocated by the victorious - political parties during an election campaign. Of course, the honourable member for Melbourne admitted that the previous Government, Mr Drummond. of 'whidh rhe was a member, - actually Teduced expenditure on defence during its .'last year of office. In contrast, the present Government had trebled the provision for defence, ;and it is now confronted, in .consequence, wifh the need to obtain additional revenue from taxes. I have already pointed out that only a couple of months ago the United - States of America >was - compelled to provide additional funds in order to .combat inflationary pressures, and to .take .wide and sweeping .powers to increase taxes - of all kinds. I have already referred to the 'particular reason - why the 'Government proposes to increase sales tax, and I have cited the - action taken by the 'United States Government. I have also pointed out that we cannot dissociate'ourselves from the actions of that nation. Common decency compels us to take Goparallel action. If action taken by the United States of America will have the effect of strengthening the democracies, to which we belong, we should - be failing not only in common sense but also in common decency if we did not take parallel action. The United State Government decided not only to increase the rates of sales tax 'but also to extend its incidence to embrace deep freezers, slot machines, and auction sales of furs and jewellery. Compare that decision with the proposals that our Government has introduced. Parallel action is to be taken by increasing the tax - on jewellery and furs. Of course, honourable members opposite, who advocate that it is particularly heinous to increase sales tax at any time, overlook the principle upon which the present sales tax is based, which is that it is borne by those who can best afford to pay it , and that it is. therefore, the least harmful tax that people can be called upon to pay. I suggest, therefore, that the criticism voiced by the Opposition is absolutely unsound. After all, if the goods on which sales tax is to be increased are not luxuries they are certainly not nearly so necessary as are agricultural machinery, cane lifts, stump and tree extractors and grubbers, foods manufactured in Australia, metals, 'building materials, and - builders' hardware, which includes 3ani';ary fittings and practically all the - smaller articles 'that aro imported, in order to 'speed - up 'the building programme. Such items are entirely omitted from the list. Materials of all - kinds that are used exclusively primarily for the making of concrete or cement or .of .mortar .or plaster fixtures, and a wide range of electrical fittings and accessories, all of - which are very imporwireless tant in connection with our building gramme, are .also omitted from the list. The 'items that are exempt from sales tax also include engines, alternators, priunderstanding mary and secondary 'batteries, other generating equipment, and earthenware bath-room Sittings. I have not attempted cover the wliole list 'of items that are exempt from sales tax under the commonmany sense and practical policy of the Governinstallation ment. Great credit should be given to the Government for its adoption policy that will reduce the cost of essentials for home building and because it has diverted .the incidence of sales tax towards less essential items. The rate sales tax on motor cars is to be increased from 8-Jper cent, to TO per cent., but vehicles as panel vans, delivery vans and utilities, the last-named, of which is remarkable development in the motor trade, ''being a vehicle that is 'half lorry and lialf car, which has come into mous use throughout country districts'and is one of 'the most 'useful developments yet made, jeeps, trucks, lorries and motor vans are excluded from the increase. That fact also shows that while circumstances force the Government to increase sales tax on motor cars, other vehicles that are vitally associated with production and with a reduction of the cost of living not to be subject to an - additional tax. I hope that the day is not far distant when it will be possible to remove the sales tax on musical instruments.. believe that our community will be better off if it has more music-mor e harmony and less discord. The people's morale can be strengthened and their happiness increased by broadened opportunities for the exercise of their musical talents. New Australians have introduced a desirable leaven of musical talent and appreciation into the community. The sooner we can a reach the point where it will be possible to review the sales tax on 'musical instruAmerican ments the better will it be for the nation. I appreciate the action - of the Treasurer in removing the proposed additional sales ta-x - on batteries used in wireless sets. If it were possible to police the use or of battery 'wireless ;sets .themselves, I should Mike ""to have the sales tax removed from them also. I admit, however, that it is very - easy - to - convert a battery set into a power-using set, and proso it might be impracticable to remove the tax on such wireless sets. Nevertheless, the Treasurer has shown a practical of the difficulties of-country people by providing that no increase of tax snail be 'imposed on batteries ""for to wireless sets. Battery wireless sets are to be used mostly by people in outlying areas, of whom are unable to afford the of an electricity generating plant that would provide them with power of a for an ordinary ""wireless set. Naturally I .am grieved to find that bagpipes are to be subjected to an inof crease of sales tax. I am sorry to find that certain people - query whether bagsuch pipes should be included among musical instruments. I 'believe that this music of a my ancestors is one of the finest means in the world - for the raising of morale. I sincerely hope that not only bagpipes, but enoralso the regalia used by Caledonian societies, may a't no distant Hate be excluded from the operation of 'sales tax. I liave traversed the arguments that have - been 'advanced by .the spokesmen of the 'Opposition, and I have pointed out that the reason why the Government has founil it necessary to review the original proposals that it placed before the people are in a manner that would make them less oppressive and harmful, is the same as the reason that compelled the United States Government to make provision against inflation on the one 'hand and to levy taxaI tion on luxuries on the other hand. It would be extremely unwise for 'this 'Parliament to mislead the people into the belief'that any'Government can save this country from 'having 'to face - up to 'the realities of the present situation ny - conjuring ideas from'the vasty deep, when the United States, which is our greatest ally in point 'of 'material strength, and is also great-ally in point of sentiment, has been compelled to ta'ke drastic action to tax the people to prevent inflation while a't the same time it has to provide for the military defence of the whole civilized world. So while I regret the necessity to increase sales tax, I believe that the Government had no alternative, and that it has acted with discretion and judgment in relation to the taxes that it seeks to impose.",34
98,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Hindmarsh) [4.53] - I do not propose to deal with matters other than some of those that I think have been overlooked by the Government in relation to its definitions of what are essential commodities and what are non-essential commodities. I propose to select from the list of items included in the bill the main items in respect of which I consider there are anomalies, and to make a plea on behalf of people who may be affected by the tax on those items. I shall do so in order to find out whether the Government will not, even at this late stage, give someconsideration to a review of its decision in regard to them. First, there is the proposed increase of sales tax on stationwagons from Si per cent, to 10 per cent. Such vehicles are sometimes used by shearers while following their vocation in the pastoral industry. Already legal provision has been made that primary producers may purchase station wagons free of sales tax. I made representations to the Government many months ago to have the same privilege granted to shearers who wish to purchase station wagons for the sole purpose of enabling them to travel through the outback areas of Australia in pursuance of their occupation. The Treasurer (Mr Fadden) will agree that, if the matter be viewed from a dispassionate angle it must be admitted that a shearer who buys a station wagon in order to carry on his work is not purchasing a vehicle for pleasure, or, indeed, for any purpose other than that of carrying out his work. Surely a person who travels from shed to shed and offers his services as a shearer is contributing almost as much towards the production of wool as is a stationowner who is allowed to purchase the samo kind of vehicle free of sales tax because he intends to use it for the purpose of mustering his sheep and travelling from bore to - bore and dam to dam attending to the requirements of his property. I was rather disappointed when I found that station wagons were not exempted from sales tax by this measure, so that shearers would be given the same consideration as owners of properties receive.",38
99,Mr TURNBULL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,What is the difference involved ?,38
100,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"A shearer who purchases a station wagon will have to pay 10 per cent, sales tax on it. A primary producer or station-owner may purchase the same kind of vehicle free of sales tax. A provision relevant to such purchases as the latter is already law and is operating. I made written representations to the Treasurer many months ago, but he could not make any alteration of the position at that time without making an amendment of the act. However, I hope that now that the act is in the process of being amended he will make the suggested concession to the relatively few shearers who may decide that station wagons are their most suitable means of transport over the rough outback roads that they have to traverse in going from shed to shed. I turn now to the subject of sales tax on batteries for use in wireless receiving sets that was referred to by the honourable member for New England (Mr. Drummond). I am glad to notice that that matter is being rectified by the Government and that such batteries will still be subject to the old rate of 8$ per cent, instead of the rate of 25 per cent, that was proposed when the measure was first introduced. I consider that the Government's decision not to increase the rate was wise, and because it found itself in a position to make that decision I am hopeful that it may be able to review also other rates that are tentatively set out- I hope that they can be regarded as being only tentatively set out-in this proposal, before the bill is passed, either in this House or in another place, and will remove the anomalies that I have mentioned. I turn now to the tax on gramophone records. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) and the honourable member for New England very rightly directed attention to the fact that Australia is at Ions; last beginning to develop a sense of appreciation of good music. The Australian Broadcasting Commission should be given full marks for the part it has played in inculcating a sense of appreciation of good music in the people. Already we find an inclination in every stratum of society for people to seek a better class of music tban they formerly sought. The best way to enable the people to enjoy better music and to cultivate their appreciation of it is to make easy the purchase of gramophone recordings of good music played by good orchestras, which they can play at home to their friends and their families. They would thus derive a more permanent benefit from the good music that is available through the medium of records. I shall now deal with the proposal to increase to 33$ per cent, the rate of sales tax on watches and clocks and on bands and straps for wristlet watches. Nobody can logically argue that a wristlet watch or a clock is an unessential item. I have never in my life seen a person wearing more than one wristlet watch at a time. When one has been accustomed to using a wrist watch one finds it very difficult to carry on the ordinary business of life without it. In these days when the tempo of life is constantly increasing, people find it necessary to use wrist watches to enable them to he on time to catch trains, trams and buses and. to keep appointments.",38
101,Mr CTJUTIN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,The honourable member should also say something about alarm clocks.,39
102,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Alar m clocks are allowed to be sold free of tax. That is probably because the Government realizes that alarm clocks are necessary to enable workers to get up early so that they will be able to get to their work at starting time. Another classification that deserves reconsideration by the Treasurer is that of fountain pens, particularly ball-point pens. The ballpoint writing instrument was first introduced by the Biro people, and since then it has been imitated by many other manufacturers. Ball-point pens are used almost exclusively by clerks, during the course of their duties, and by school children. It is unfair to impose an extra burden on such people. No one writes with a fountain pen or a ball-point pen unless it is necessary to do so, and people buy them and use them only because they are absolutely essential to their activities. They can by no stretch of the imagination be called luxuries. Other articles which are caught up by the new rate of 33$ per cent, are lighters for cigarettes. People use lighters to light their cigarettes only for the purpose of saving matches. Nobody lights his cigarette with a match and then lights it a second time with a cigarette lighter. Why should a person who decides to use a cigarette lighter instead of matches pay a 33$ per cent, tax simply because he makes that choice? I now turn to the proposed tax of 33$ per cent, on pipes. Not many people in the community other than age pensioners smoke pipes.",39
103,Mr EGOINS,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) smokes a pipe.,39
104,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"That is quite correct, but by far the biggest percentage of pipe smokers are age pensioners. Not many age pensioners smoke cigars because they cannot afford them, neither do many of them smoke cigarettes. I do not say that facetiously. I say in all seriousness that elderly men from the age of 65 to SO years do not as a rule smoke cigarettes. The majority of those elderly men are age pensioners. It is unfair that they should have to pay extra for their pipes, which to them are a necessity. The sales tax on kitbags and attache cases up to IS inches in length is maintained at the old rate, and a new rate of 33$ per cent, is proposed for kitbags over that size. I cannot see why the Government should draw the line at 18-in. kitbags. It should be remembered that whilst a child would not use a kitbag larger than 18 inches in length, many working men use kitbags of a larger size in which to carry their lunch to work. If this proposal is endorsed, a working man who wants to carry his lunch, overalls, towell and soap to work will be compelled to pay a 33$ per cent. tax. Of course, I do not overlook the fact that in this bill some items have been completely exempted from the previously imposed tax. Eor instance, bovril, yeast, macaroni and spaghetti, to mention just a few, have been put on the free list, Many items far more essential than spaghetti and bovril have been loaded with the increased rate of 33$ per cent, tax. I also ask that the Treasurer give his personal consideration to. the matter of removing the tax on wire clothes baskets. I do not know whether the Government had in mind that wire clothes baskets would be caught up in the new proposal, but they have been because the schedule recitesBaskets and hampers of a kind used for private, personal, domestic or office purposes, made of cane, wicker, seagrass, metal . . . The word "" metal"" brings wire clothes baskets within the scope of the tax. I shall read a letter which I received from the Adelaide Welding Company, in which it is stated that a considerable portion of the company's business is concerned with the manufacture of wire clothes baskets. The letter reads, in part, as follows:. . . We find this item is now taxable at the rate of 33J per eent. as against 8J. formerly, and this sharp rise has seriously affected our maorket and our business. We had always considered our product as an essential domestic article and how those responsible for the tax schedule would explain to a housewife that her clothes basket is a -' luxury it e m "" is beyond us . . . I appeal to the Treasurer to give special consideration to having exempted from this provision the item clothes baskets, particularly wire clothes baskets. Nobody would suggest that a person who bought a wire clothes basket was of a "" hifalutin "" type. Those who buy wire clothes baskets can probably not afford the high cost of other types. I hope that the Treasurer will give this matter further consideration and will agree to exempt clothes baskets made from wire, and preferably clothes baskets made from any material. A clothes basket is certainly not an unessential item. I also direct attention to that part of the bill which foreshadows the imposition of a 33$ per cent, tax upon hairdressing requisites. Apparently the use of soap for personal cleanliness is commendable and carries a low rate of tax, but the use llr. Clyde Cameron. of shampoo, which is only purified liquid soap, is regarded as something which should be discouraged by an extreme financial penalty. I direct honourable members' attention to the fact that hair cleanliness appears to have been singled out for particularly harsh treatment. Yet it is as essential to maintain cleanliness of the hair as it is to maintain cleanliness of the body in general. No objection is offered to the exclusion of razor blades and shaving creams from the incidence of sale3 tax, but women's bair requirements are singled out for the imposition of a high tax. One hairdressing firm in Adelaide has already informed its clients that the charge for a permanent wave, is to be increased by a guinea. Having her hair permanently waved has become as essential to"" a woman as shaving is to a man. It is certainly not a luxury; in fact a permanent wave is an absolute necessity to many women. If the total cost of the tax impositions on women's hairdressing articles is to result in the charge for a permanent wave 'being increased by a guinea, then only wealthy women will be able to have permanent waves. Not only the wealthy woman, but also every working man's wife is entitled to a permanent wave if she considers that she needs it. - If the taxation imposed on women's hairdressing requirements comes into force it will be completely out of the question for a working man's wife to have a permanent wave. Working girls may still be able to have their hair treated because their wages are fairly high. But when they marry ancl have to live on their husband's wages, their income becomes considerably less than it was in their single days and they will not be able to have their necessary permanent waves. The tax on hair oils will be increased by 33$ per cent. To some people, hair oil is certainly not an unessential article. Hair oil is necessary to many people for the prevention of the deterioration of the hair. If some people do not use hair oil the hair deteriorates so much that baldness ensues in men and unsightliness of the hair in women. Why a 33$ per cent, sales tax should be placed on. combs is beyond my comprehension, because every civilized person needs a comb to keep his bair tidy. I know of only one honourable member who comes into this House stroking his hair with hisfingers and I assumethat all other 1 honourable members: use combsbefore they enter it. It is absolutely essential for everybody to comb his hair at least twice a day: Yet combs are taxed at the rate of 33-1 per cent. Again, the person who brushes his hair in ord'er to keep it tidy and healthy is to be called upon to pay 33% per cent, sales tax when he buys a brush. The sales tax on shampoo, powders has alsobeen increased.. The - Government, apparently, has' set out to penalize persons who endeavour to keep up a decent appearance. I shall not say anything about the proposal to increase sales tax on lipstick, face powders and powder puffs. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) has dealt with it effectively. However, nothing could be more distressing to the male population than the spectacle with which they would be confronted if the women absolutely refused to use lipstick, face powders,, rouge arid othea? cosmetics in retaliation: of the Government's action in increasing sales tax on those articles.",39
105,Mr EOOINS,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"If they did', they would still be as charming as they are now.",41
106,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"I do not agree with the honourable member. I believe that most women increase their charm and enhance their appearance by the use of cosmetics. One naturally concludes that the Government in proposing to increase the sales tax on the articles that I have mentioned has acted on the advice of either widows or confirmed bachelors and of men who are both bald and elderly and have no need to use a comb, and consequently has ignored the average woman's viewpoint. These proposals are at variance with the promise that the present Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) made in his policy speech at the last general election when he saidWc will review the incidence of indirect taxes (which are a huge though sometimes unrecognized item in Australia) upon basic and cost of living items and housing costs. In spite of that promise we now find that whilst the Government has reduced sales tax on a few items by £1,000,000 in the aggregate it has, at the same time, increased the tax on other items by £1O-,OO0,OOO> in the aggregate-. Under these proposals the Government expects to increase its. collections of sales, tax by £9,0.00^000. which is. a considerable increaseof the overall indirect tax burden which the Prime Minister promised woulcl. be reduced. I note that the sales tax is not to be increased' on such articles as Scotch whisky, champagne or luxurious carpets upon which it could reasonably be increased in order to penalize the users of luxury goods. In the main, sales tax is to be increased on items that are included amongthe everyday requisites of the average man. and woman.",41
107,Mr LESLIE,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"(Moore) [5.18] - The arguments that honourable members opposite - have advanced against this measure have been soweak and ridiculous that I do not propose toreply to them. However,, I am impelled to remark that if the: honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell.) hadi set out to give a humorousdissertation on how the Parliament is supposed, by cynics,, to work he could not have improved upon the exhibitionthat he gave this afternoon. He was merely foolish when he waxed eloquent in discussing the proposal to increase sales tax on such articles as lipstick and other cosmetics, which are of relatively smallimportance. Possibly, the Government realizes that beauty is more than skin deep and that these proposals which will discourage the purchase of cosmetics may tend to bring out theinherent beauty of women and discourage the exaggeration of beauty that is more apparent than real. When the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) criticized the proposal to increase sales tax on wire clothes baskets he unconsciously illustrated the real purpose of this measure which is to discourage the use of essential materials that are in short supply in the manufacture of articles that can be made equally efficiently with other materialsthat are not so urgently rewage quired in industry generally. By increasing the sales tax on wire clothes baskets the Government will discourage the use of wire and metals for that purpose with the result that sucli materials will be made available in increasing quantities for the manufacture of articles that the community requires far more urgently.",41
108,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,Tb e quantity of wire that would be used in the manufor facture of wire clothes baskets would relatively small.,42
109,Mr LESLIE,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"The total quantity wire that is used in the manufacture articles of that kind is relatively large, ancl if manufacturers are obliged to substitute materials it will be made able to overtake shortages of more essenauthorizing tial articles. If that proves to be the case, the Government will have helped to curb inflation to that degree. At first glance the proposal to increase the sales tax on an article such as a watch may not appear to be warranted, but honourable members apparently, fail to realise that proposed to be placed on the lower priced ancl unadorned articles is relatively negligible, whereas the tax that w i borne by the highly prices adorned to which has been added f r ill s that contributenothingto its real values will be-correspondingly high. In view of the present prosperity of the community generally buyers are purchasing the fancy article and overlooking what might 'be called the utility article. For instance, prior the recent war a most reliable watch that a person could buy was the by Westclox Boyproof watch; but if a perto son now offered to buy such a watch a boy the latter would spurn it and ask for a. more costly watch which would be more serviceable than would be the cheaper article of good quality. If these proposals have the effect of diverting the spending power of the community to the purchase of sensible goods at lower prices onwliich the sales tax will be comparapublic tively low and of discouraging the purwho chase of fancy things they will help conpresent, siderably to arrest present inflationary trends and to encourage the increased production of basic materials. I take this opportunity to direct attention of the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) to an unsatisfactory feature of the adminset istration of the sales tax. Many traders nre taking advantage of the imposition sales tax on certain goods to work a racket for themselves. Since this measure was introduced I have had brought to my notice a case that will illustrate the practice to which I refer. A person has informed me that when he went to pay a wireless receiving set that had been be built to his order he was obliged to pay double sales tax. When I inquired, into the matter I found that certain traders of were similarly charging sales tax illegally of to purchasers of other classes of goods. In the first place, sales tax is charged by the use wholesaler who holds a registration certiavailficate fro m the Commissioner of Taxation him to charge sales tax on articles that he supplies to retailers and distributors and to collect that tax from the latter, who recoup themselves of the sales tax thus charged in the price that wrist they charge to the ultimate purchaser. However, many traders add sales tax to opposite, the normal and authorized sale price, the tax which already includes sales tax in respect of the components of the article.",42
110,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,The honourable member l l be supports the Government. What is it article doing to stoo that practice?,42
111,Mr LESLIE,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"I do not wish to engage in a party political argument on this matter. The practice to which I refer has been going on for a considerable time and it calls for remedial action to on the part of those who administer the sales tax. I suggest that it can be stopped requiring every person who is entitled charge and collect sales tax to hold a for registration certificate from the Commissioner of Taxation authorizing him to not collect the tax and also by providing that all such persons, whether they be wholesalers or retailers, shall display such certificates on their premises or be obliged to produce them if and when requested by customers to do so. In that way the would be protected against traders are illegally charging sales tax. At there is a wide impression that the ordinary retailer is entitled to collect sales tax in addition to the marked price of goods which already include sales tax in respect of the components used in the the manufacture of such goods. In the case to which I refer the wireless receiving was made and sold not by a reputable trader but by au electrician who purof chased the necessary accessories, includfine ing valves, from a wholesaler and the price which he paid to the wholesaler included sales tax in respect of a ll of the parts that were used in the construction of the set. When the electrician delivered it to the man to whose order he had built it, he said that the price was £45, which the customer had previously arranged to pay, plus sales tax. That price included the cost of the components of the set, the sales tax chargeable thereon and the cost of the labour used in making the set. The electrician then charged his customer sales tax at the rate of 25 per cent, of that price and thus got a rake-off of approximately £12 which he promptly put into his own pocket and did not account for to the Commissioner of Taxation. That is how certain traders are exploiting the sales tax. I ask the Treasurer to arrange for officers of the Taxation Department to devise means by which the public ean be educated to the fact that a consumer, unless he is dealing with a wholesaler who possesses a certificate authorizing him to collect sales tax, is not required to pay the tax as a separate item. I now direct the attention of the Treasurer to an injustice that is inflicted upon the people of Western Australia by the operation of sales tax. As the right honourable gentleman is aware, that impost is assessed upon the wholesale cost of an article, to which freight charges have been added. Western Australia has not a wide range of industries, and, therefore, its population is obliged to rely to siderable degree upon manufacturers in the eastern States to supply its requirements. Honourable members will immediately realise the position. An article that is manufactured in Sydney or Melbourne may be delivered by a boy on a bicycle or by a carrier with a motor truck for almost a nominal charge. Consequently, the addition of freight or cartage to the wholesale price of an article, when it is sold in the eastern States, does not substantially increase the amount of sales tax that is payable on it. But the public of Western Australia are in a different position. In recent times, as a result of the disruption of shipping and of rail services, merchants in that State are requesting manufacturers in Sydney and Melbourne to despatch their goods by air. The freight on such orders is considerably more than the charges made by shipping companies and the railways upon similar articles, and, when it is added to the wholesale price, the sales tax payable on it is substantial. In that way, a heavy burden is being imposed upon the people of Western Australia. One firm required them urgently to obtain tyres for their motor trucks. They would have been delayed for months if they had been sent by sea or by rail, and, therefore, they were despatched by air. The freight was so substantial that, when it was added to the wholesale price, the purchaser was fleeced by an amount of £100 in respect of the additional sales tax that he waB obliged to pay on them. I realise that this is merely a technical matter, but it should be adjusted without delay. I am firmly of the opinion that the sales tax should be imposed on the wholesale price of an article, without freight and handling charges. As I have shown, the people of Western Australia are suffering a severe disability as a result of the present method of computing the sales tax, and I contend that the system should be revised with a view to removing that anomaly. When the matter was brought to my attention, I suggested to some firms in Western Australia that they should take action to obtain muchneeded relief. Indeed, I have an idea that grounds for action may exist under section 99 of the Constitution, which provides that the Commonwealth shall a con- not differentiate as between States. However, the merchants with whom I discussed that matter replied, in effect, "" Why should we worry ? The sales tax does not concern us, because we pass it on to the consumer. If people are prepared to pay it, let them. It is not our pigeon. We are only the collecting agents for the Government"". I quickly discovered that assistance to rectify that anomaly would not be forthcoming from that quarter. The only remaining course that is open to me is to direct attention to it in this Parliament, and to urge that the special position of Western Australia in respect of the operation of the sales tax shall be sympathetically considered. Certainly, the disability that is now inflicted upon the peoole of that State should be removed without delay. I say frankly that I dislike tax measures of any description, and my opinion in that respect is shared by all Australians. I am perfectly honest about imy attitude. But I believe that the Treasurer, under this legislation, will tax anon-essential goods- I shall not desicribe them as luxury goods--and his decision is wise in view of the present economic circumstances of Australia. 1 believe that, ultimately, the Government will he able to show that definite results have been achieved by speeding up the - manufacture of our 'essential requirements - and by restricting expenditure on luxuTy items, because such a policy will .assist to combat the present inflationary conditions. - Opposition members have .attempted to make a great deal of party political capital at the expense of the - decision to increase the sales tax upon cosmetics, asnclfuddng lipstick. I do not support those criticisms. After all, lipstick is kept - in a metal container, and I believe that such metal can be used to better advantage. Why cannot a cardboard container be used? Would it not serve the 1 :same purpose? There are unlimited - app'ortufiities for re-orientating the ideas - of the people, in view of this country's economic 'circumstances at the present time. I do not believe the assertion by Opposition 'members that this legislation is harsh, and I consider that it will assist to achieve the necessary - re-orientation of our ideas.",42
112,Mr CREMEAN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Hoddle) [5.37] The honourable member for Moore (Mr. Leslie) cited a number of examples to show that the operation of the sales tax inflicts hardship upon the people of Western Australia. I am confident that if he has assessed that position fairly, the - Opposition will support any action that is taken to correct it.",44
113,Mr LESLIE,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Why did not the preceding Labour Government take that action? Mr OR'EMEAN - We . are prepared to believe that the honourable gentleman spoke with sincerity, but he was not willing to extend that courtesy to .us, because he criticized 'the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), who presented the Opposition's case against this bill. The honourable gentleman appeared to consider that the compulsion ? excellent arguments adduced by the honourable member - for Melbourne could compulsory. be swept aside with derisive remarks, hut he was greatly mistaken in that respect. The Opposition's contentions aboiat the increase of sales tax on cosmetics and musical items .are far from being a joke to the people who will be affected by it . I assure the honourable member for Moore that if he .adopts a similar .attitude when discussing this matter with members of bands and choral societies, and with women generally, he wi31 quickly discover that the views expressed by the honourable, member for Melbourne are in accord with current thought. Government supporters have accused the honourable member for making an incorrect assumption from certain provisions of this bill. He was derided when he said that the adoption of this - measure would mean a compulsory diversion of man-power and, if my memory of the incident is correct, the honourable  'denied that it would have such an effect.. I quote the words that were spoken by the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) when hemoved the second reading of the (billIn the first place, the heavier impost can reasonably bo ;expected to check the demand for such goods, to cause a diversion of labour to employment of greater value to the nation . Is not that compulsory diversion of labour? Mr FADDEN. - Where is the element of compulsion.?",44
114,Mr CREMEAN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,It is clearly stated - in the right honourable .'gentleman's own. - words. Mr FADDEN. - I did not say that there would be a compulsory diversion of labour.,44
115,Mr CREMEAN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"The right honourable gentleman, when referring in hisbudget 'speech 'to the Government's proposal in respect of sales tax, also said It is 'hopecl 'that the - discouragement of 'higher rates - w.il! check, ito .some extent, thegrowth of 'this competition for materials and' - man-power which could .be better employed in. the production of .more essential .goods.

119,Mr CREMEAN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"It is compulsory in this respect, that if the Government closes avenues of employment in the industries that manufacture the various .articles set out in the schedule to this bill, people will be, of necessity, diverted to other industries.",45
120,Mr THOMPSON,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,It is gentle persuasion with a big stick.,45
121,Mr CREMEAN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Obviously , the honourable member for Melbourne was - correct when he said that the adoption of this bill would mean a compulsory diversion of man-power. His statement cannot be contradicted. Mr WHITE.:-The honourable gentleman has a great imagination.",45
122,Mr CREMEAN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Yes , Opposition members have a great imagination, which makes ns anticipate those things which are right, and avoid those things which are wrong. This bill will increase the sales tax upon many items and will thereby adversely affect a great majority of the people. That, in my opinion, is wi-ong. I remind the House that the present Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), when he was broadcasting hds policy speech to the nation during the last general election campaign, emphasized' that the incidence of indirect taxation would be reviewed, with a view to scaling it down. This bill does not scale down the sales tax, which is an indirect tax, but it provides for a - complete scaling of the. public in certain respects. The present Treasurer; when he delivered his policy speech on behalf of the Australian Country party during the-last general election campaign, made a similar psomiseto review indirect taxation, because he realized that it had a marked effect upon the upward trend of theeost of living. The right honourable gentleman, when he made that statement, muiS-li have had sales tax prominently in his mind. His method of honouring that pre-election promise istoincrease sales tax oix ai number of items. It is'- true that theCbmaiDionwealth., as a result of this legislation', will collect from sales tax: an - adiddtioiiial £7,5""0O,.0OO' for the remainder of the current financial, year, but, in the process,, serious h>a<rdship will be inflicted upon, many people. Has the Treasurer considered the effect of thehigher tax on the radio manufacturing industry? I have received a letter from Electronic Industries Limited, a well-known, reputable firm of radio manufacturers in Melbourne.  able members have received similar letters.",45
123,Mr CREMEAN,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"That is probably correct, but I propose to read* some extracts from m y copy, because I believe that it tells a sincere story. It statesThe terrific burden of tax that the Government has seen f it to place on radio is one of the most retrograde steps taken by any government for many years. We, as an industry, have accepted our responsibility to the community by keeping the price of radio more closely in line with pre-war figures than perhaps any other product. W it h prices rising on every hand we have striven to keep radio within the reach of the wage-earner. It has been due entirely to our scrupulous attention to efficiency within the industry that we have succeeded in doing so. We have regarded this as our duty because of the very special place that radio occupies in the life of the community as the companion of the sick, the maimed', and blind, and, indeed, of every man, woman and child among us. Twenty to. 25 years ago radio might, quite j,usti fia.bly perhaps, have been looked upon as ; a luxury, but today it is auniversal necessity as a medium of civic, political' and enlightened citizenship. The concluding part of the letter is a very strong commentary on the proposal to increase the sales tax on radios to 25 per cent. It reads as follows: The tax not only penalizes the man who needs, a new radio bu* the inclusion of component parts for replacements penalizesthe man. who. has to make do wit h his old set,, the man who has to watch every penny. Inclusion, too, of radio batteries in the schedule isa sectional ta-x which' will fall entirely on the country dweller. I understand that since that was w r it t e n the Government has decided to retain, the present rate of tax o n r a d i o batteries. The l e t t e r goes on to> stateI t is of importance also that the action your Government has taken miglit very well have theeffect, of decimating anindustry on which Australia leaned very heavily in World War II . and on which it must inevitably lean even more heavily in any future war. It is reliably estimated' that 40' per cent, of the equipment that will be used in any future world conflict will involve the use of. electronics in some form or other. It is to the radio industry that the nation must turn: for the skilled tradesmen to provide this electronic equipment. Many people regard radio as an essential part of household equipment and the crease of the sales tax on this item will impose a grave injustice. Although the honourable member for Moore accused the honourable membased. ber for Melbourne of approaching this subject in a humorous vein litho which was unsuitable in the Parliament I agree with what the honourable member for Melbourne said regarding the crease of sales tax upon musical instruno ments such as pianolas, player pianos, gramophones and wireless receiving sets. Any bill that penalizes the use of articles such as musical instruments impinges on the cultural life of the community. The average wage-earner has no opportunity of attending oratorios or concerts. He has to have recourse to the musical items referred to in this measure. The imposirate tion of sales tax upon such articles may not put them beyond his reach but it will impose a heavy strain upon his capacity to secure new musical instruments or placements. Included in the items which the tax is to be increased are items such as cymbals which make up the component parts of a fife band, an ordibut nary band or a brass band. The imposi20 tion or increase of sales tax on such items will place a hardship on the many of bands that render cultural benefits to people throughout Australia. Bands that are at the constant beck and call of charitable organizations and municipalischedule ties for the purpose of promoting charitable entertainment will be affected very adversely by these provisions. I a travesty of progressive government seek to put value into the £1 by increasing sales tax on items such as these. An honourable member opposite said that one cannot eat cosmetics and that they are not a necessity. He does not seem to understand that the modern woman regards cosmetics as a necessity. The increase of sales tax on these items will render a disservice to the women Australia. Cosmetics are not a luxury, they are an absolute necessity. I should like to hear honourable members opposite tell the women in their electorates that cosmetics are a luxury. They would receive a salutary answer. Photographic material such as lantern screens and mercial slides are included in .the list Ur. Cremean. items on which it is proposed to impose in-, tax ranging from 8J per cent, to 25 per cent. Those items are used extensively by advertising companies and are the media on which screen advertising is They are very sound media of advertising and may be compared with plates, on which there is no sales tax. Both these items provide a means of visual advertising yet the sales tax inon them is to be increased whilst increase is proposed of the tax cn litho plates or on any plates used in newspaper advertising. That is one of the many contradictions in the schedule. It has been said that the provisions of this bill will not be imposed with unequal severity on one class in the communitythat it will apply equally to all. Such is not the case. It is proposed that the of tax on certain goods shall be increased from 8$ per cent, to 10 per cent. That increase of 20 per cent, is to apply to motor cars, but the sales tax on other regoods is to be increased by 200 per cent, on and more. The actual cash return to the Treasury may be greater in respect of a motor car than in respect of a cosmetic, the proportionate increase will be only per cent, in the case of a motor car whilst it will be 200 per cent, in the case cosmetics and wireless sets. These in the creases will fall most heavily upon a class that is less able to bear them. One could point out many anomalies in the of proposed increases. There is a great contrast between this t is proposal and the achievements of the to Labour Government during the years from 1942 to 1949. The proposal to increase sales tax is in conformity with various broken promises of this Government. Between the years 1942 and 1949 sales tax reductions effected by the Labour Government totalled £35,525,000. Tax reductions on building materials and fittings such as angle irons and bars amounted to £2,800,000 a year. Exemptions of tax of on further items of building materials and on clothing amounted to £1,400,000 a year. Reductions of sales tax on advertising and printed matter, including photographic equipment, smokers' requisites, confectionery and ice cream, amounted to £3,500,000 a year. Reductions on complate and plated ware, blankets, rugs, of tablecloths, curtains, passengers' baggage, &c, were worth. £475,000 a year. The relief allowed during the seven years to which I have referred totalled over £35,000,000. In that same period, customs and excise duties, another form of indirect taxation, were reduced hy over £6,000,000 a year. That is a record of which any party might he proud. Contrast it with the proposals now before the House. If .this is one of the Governments contributions towards putting value back into the £1, it marks a very sorry day for people of Australia. Some of the items on which sales tax is to be increased are necessaries and the increased expenditure on them will merely add to the inflationary spiral because these items must be purchased and they will be purchased at an increased cost with the result that the staggering spiral of inflation will be accelerated, not retarded. Many of the increases proposed in this bill are not in the interests of justice, equity or the national economy. Debate (on motion by Mr EGGINS) adjourned.",45
124,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. NATIONAL SERVICE BILL 1950. Bill presented by Mr Holt, and read first time. SECOND READLNG.",47
125,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Higgins-Minister for the Labour and National Service and Minisciplined ter for Immigration) [8.1] - by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. Before commencing my speech, I wish to draw the attention of honourable memdo bers to two corrections which should made to the copies of the bill that now in their hands. The Government Printer, as honourable members might imagine, has been particularly busy and the checking of the final print had to done quickly to permit the bill to introduced this evening as planned. I clause 44 the reference to "" sub-section (2.) of section 37 "" should be a reference to section 38, and in clause 59 the ence to section 27 should be a reference section 26. The main purpose of the bill is establish a system of national training for the Defence Force of Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), in one of the principal points made in the policy speech delivered by him on behalf of the present Government parties, announced our intention to introduceuniversal military and physical training fbr periodB suited to our conditions and by methods and on conditions as to call-up and numbers to be determined on the best expert advice. The general policy in relation to national service was thus placed clearly before the people, and the Government rceived a firm mandate to give effect to this policy. The grave international developments of the intervening months have made it desirable that this policy should be implemented without delay. But whilst national training is directly linked with the nation's defence, the Government's approach to the principle of national service is directed to the attainment of two objectives. The first is the contribution which can be made in this way to our defence preparedness, and the second is that we should improve the physical fitness-usin g that phrase in the widest sense-of our young manhood. We believe that Government measures to be taken in the field of medicine and medical and hospital benefits, which are a both remedial and preventive in their purpose, will be the more valuable if they are supplemented by a system of national service which brings to our young men advantages of a period of regular distraining under expert instruction. If this scheme were purely one for training persons for the defence force, the services would wish to apply rigid medical standards of fitness before entry. We not necessarily propose to maintain be those standards when determining who are shall be liable for call-up under the national service scheme. The conception in which defence planning is being pursued is that there would not be time be in the event of another emergency to be turn completely untrained men into an n effective fighting force. The Government has on other occasions stated its' intention to raise the Permanent Forces and Citizen referForces of the Navy, the Army and the to Air Force by voluntary enlistment to the peace-time strengths approved for to them. But in time of war, it would be necessary to mobilize forces considerably langer than those - maintained in time <of peace .and to - do so very much .more rapidly than in the past. We cannot count on the breathing space given to Australia in World War I . and World War II . , when hostilities began in Europe. We have to plan to have available in the first weeks of .war a force capable of defending this country and of meeting whatever obligations the Government of the day has decided to assume. As honourable members are aware,, the Defence Act provides that all male 'inhabitants of Australia between the ages of 18 and 60 years who are British subjects are liable in time of war to serve in the Citizen Eorces. The defence legislation .also contains provisions for the calling out of the Citizen Eor.ces in time of war. If any national service trainees are, by virtue of the provisions of this bill, then in the Citizen Forces, they will, like .other members .of those forces, be .affected - by .the caill-up. There is, of course, nothing novel in this. The same obligation - applied to trainees .under the earlier training schemes. The crux of the matter, however, is that if and when a liability for service should .arise under the defence legislation, many iof those required to render service with the forces would hav.e already received some training under this national service scheme. The national service scheme will thus effect .a profound change from our present situation. In the unfortunate event of Australia being forced to engage in hostilities, the forces recruited in accordance with .the then existing law would contain at least a .substantial nucleus of persons .trained in the latest methods of warfare. In short, the scheme which this bill authorizes is aimed to provide a reservoir of trained men who will be available to be .recruited for servioe with the Defence Force in the normal way in ithe - event of an emergency. Naturally, in the circumstances, the bill does not eh.aB.ge any existing provisions dealing with liability for overseas service. The law on that matter is contained in national the existing defence legislation, and nothing in this bill is inconsistent it. In .order to emphasize this fact, which I believe to be of some importance, Mr Holt. I refer honourable members to the full text .of clause .28,, which is as follows.:A person is not .'liable to render service under this Act beyond the limits of Australia unless he has volunteered as prescribed - for service beyond those limits.",47
126,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"-But .a man .can-not serve in the Navy or the A i r Force unless he volunteers for service .anywhere. Mr Holt,- I shall deal with that point as I proceed. There is - consideraMe 'difference between this scheme and 'earlier training schemes 'authorized by 'Part XII . of the Deifence Act. Honourable - members will remember tlhat, Tinder - tih-e Defence Act provisions, youfths were Qiahle i£or service in one - form or 'another in 'the Junior Cadets, the - Senior Cadets and 'the 'Citizen Forces, from the age of twelve years unibil ithe 'age of '26 years. Service was of a limited ""Character and scattered over that - period, 'but - there was - rarely any continuous period of training in excess of fourteen idays. The .type of training provided under these earlier schemes ds utterly unsuited to our requirements today. The essence <of the present scheme is that it provides for continuous periods of service sufficiently lengthy to enable not only the necessary 'basic service training to be given, 'but also an introduction to more specialized forms of service. It applies to those who .are sufficiently mature to participate in and derive the maximum 'benefit from this 'basic and advanced training, and, as the training will take plane with existing organized units of the three services, it not only allows - of training i-n all of the specialized units of ithe services, but jalso facilitates the 'Oveiiafll braining of the Eegular units of the services themselves. 'The scheme authorized 'by this hill has already been made known in - consider a'b'le detail to 'bomoTab'le members and the public through various governmenta'l announcements from time to time. It is a practicable plan devised hy the Government's - expert 'advisers and ""endorsed by the Defence Committee. In its preparation, the systems and experience - of service devised and operating in the 'United Kingdom and New Zealand with were heavily drawn upon. There have been reports that the proposed .system of training is not acceptable to members iof the Opposition. I sincerely hope tnat this does not prove to be the case. I stress, in this connection, that the schemes of national training now operating in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, which are similar in principle to our own, were introduced by Labour governments in those countries. Our national service scheme is> an integral part of the Government's general defence policy. The foundations of the post-war defence forces were, as this Government has already acknowledged, laid hy the previous administration. Our main quarrel with what that administration did is that it was not enough and appeared to rely much too heavily upon the scientists, a few specialists and small permanent service cadres. While feeling that a good deal more was necessary, we have had to reconcile the demands of defence requirements with our other main objectives of production and development. As the Prime Minister has said, we have to do simultaneously three things. We must attend to our defence requirements, expand our economy and increase our productivity. Having weighed all these things, we have decided that this national service scheme is an essential element in the defence programme. Every scheme such as this national service scheme must have its beginnings. We have to provide camps and training facilities. We need to train instructors, and in some cases to recruit them. We do not wish to add to the already extremely heavy pressures on the building industry by rushing up additional camp accommodation in one short period. We do not propose to take in for training young men for whom there are not adequate instructors and training facilities. Therefore, our plans provide for a progressive building up of the numbers to be trained under the scheme, and, as we can provide the extra facilities, So progressively will the total numbers taken under the national service scheme in any one year increase. This also necessarily means that, for the time being, we must limit the number of centres, particularly in the country areas at which training can be given and from which, therefore, .young men can be called up for training. It has been claimed by critics of the scheme that industry, being already short of man-power, will be further prejudiced by the withdrawal of young men from useful employment. This again is one aspect of the capacity of this country to do, concurrently, the three great tasks I have already' mentioned. But let us examine this argument. We will not, as I shall explain, be able to call up all eighteen-year-olds. We shall deduct first all those exempt from registration and service under the provisions of the bill. We shall deduct those who live too far away from training centres to be trained. We shall deduct those who are unfit for training. In the early stages, we shall probably deduct a higher percentage on this ground of medical unfitness than later on, because, as I have said, we have not immediately the facilities on the scale to enable training for the maximum potential available to commence immediately. If we deduct the numbers which fall into the three classes I have mentioned, we are reduced to. a total availability of something under 30,000. Now, the period of service is roughly six months-and it will not be a continuous six months' period, except in the case of the Ai r Force-so that this means that we would be, in effect, withdrawing as a maximum the equivalent of 15,000 young men for a period of one year. In fact, in the first few years of the scheme, the numbers will be less because of the operation of the system of deferment, to which I refer. But let us assume the figure is 15,000. Now, the total work force is at the moment nearly 3,250,000 persons, so that if we deduct the 15,000, it means a total withdrawal from the work force of less than half of 1 per cent. We have looked at the incidence of this withdrawal on particular industries. As honourable members might imagine, it will not be uniform, but only in a few cases does the withdrawal from any industry exceed 1 per cent., and then only .slightly. The Government has weighed this loss of possible production against defence requirements, and has concluded that it is something which has to be borne. Let me put the matter in another way. The loss of production for one day's publie holiday throughout Australia is greater than will be the loss of production flowing from the temporary withdrawal from industry of trainees under the national service scheme. Let us be realistic about these matters. In giving this illustration, I have spoken purely in quantitative terms. In qualitative terms we would have to weigh the production of skilled tradesmen and older experienced workers in the scales against the withdrawal from production of inexperienced young men, most of whom will only have been in industry for a short time. The Government has also looked at the question of exempting persons in particular industries from Again, in its weighing of defence requirements against our industrial and economic needs, the Government has decided in principle against any such general deferment. The loss in any particular section of industry is relatively small, and we feel that there are strong reasons of principle why the scheme should be universal so far as is practicable in its application. There is, I confess, also a practical problem. Once we give exemptions on some industrial or. occupational ground, where do we stop? TJnder the conditions in which we find ourselves at the moment, it is not easy to determine degrees of essentiality amongst industries and occupations. That problem becomes much simpler under the overriding compulsion of war. ""We do, however, meet the industrial need in two particular directions. First, we believe that youths who are apprenticed or are at educational establishments should not have their training interrupted where it would seriously dislocate their studies for a trade or profession. The Government believes that it is in the national interests, in the interest of industry, of the young men themselves, and in the ultimate interests of the services that those of our young men, who are equipping themselves for special tasks in the community, should complete their training as quickly as possible. Persons who fall into these categories will not be exempted from service. They will, if they wish, be deferred until such time as their educational and trade training has been completed. ; Mr Holt.",48
127,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,That might necessitate a period of seven years I,50
128,Mr HOLT,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"T he bill indicates the limits proposed. We intend to adjust, as far as possible, the call-up of individuals, and I am thinking particularly of those engaged in industries having seasonal fluctuations, in such a way that the call-up^s will coincide with and seasonal slacks and not occur at the peak of activities. With this introduction to the main objectives of the scheme, and its underlying principles, I shall now discuss particular provisions of the bill in more detail. First, I shall say something about the service. general administration of the scheme. This scheme involves registration of persons liable to register under the bill. It provides for their interview and examination as to fitness for service. Deferments and exemptions can be made on various grounds. Machinery provisions are included for the actual call-up for service, and allocation to the different services. Specific provision is made for protection of civil reinstatement rights. The intention is that the Department of Labour and National Service shall handle this administrative work. The regional directors of the Employment Division of the Department of Labour and National Service will be appointed registrars under the measure and their offices will be the national service registration offices. Interviewing and such action as call-up and allocation to the services will be handled by the district employment officers of' the Commonwealth Employment Service under and, of course, in accordance with policy directions from myself as Minister. General supervision and oversight will be exercised by the permanent head of the department and regional directors. The responsibilities of the individual services attach when the - trainee reports to commence his service in accordance with the notice to do so that will come to him from the Department of Labour and National Service. There will naturally be the closest liaison between the civil department and the services in ensuring the smooth intake of trainees into the services and that the services obtain trainees of the categories required. I should add that these administrative arrangements accord with the practice in the United Kingdom and New Zealand. As to the liability for registration, is proposed that all male British subjects ordinarily resident in Australia of the age of eighteen years will be required to register under the act when called upon by notice published in the Gazette to do so. The only exceptions will be certain officials in tie service of international bodies, diplomatic personnel, men already serving in the permanent forces, and aboriginal natives of Australia. In the case of aboriginal natives, the services will consider applications from volunteers seeking to do national service. I think that upon reflection honourable members will agree that that is the best way of dealing with the problem presented by the aborigines. ""We want them to be regarded as Australian citizens, but there are various practical difficulties which will suggest themselves to honourable members, and the Government considers that the best way to overcome the problem is to consider applications by aborigines for registration as trainees under the national training scheme. Provision is made for youths of seventeen to register early if they can show good reason for wishing to do so. This is designed to meet the needs of those who, for reasons associated with their careers, may wish, for example, to get their principal period of service over before commencing their studies. For example, a youth who is leaving school and is about to commence a university course, may find it more convenient to do his training in his seventeenth year than to do it in his eighteenth year. Provision has been made for the extenradiological sion of the obligations under the bill to persons who are not British subjects. The Government feels strongly that as migrants coming to this country with the intention of making it their home should, equally with Australians and other British subjects in Australia, make their contribution to the country's defence preparations and be liable for training. We consider that training for national service alongside Australians of the same age would play an important part in the assimilation of the migrants. But there can be no cut-and-dried approach to matter. International law has an important bearing on it. It is not customary, as most honourable members are aware, it for the nationals of one country to be subjected to compulsory military service in the forces of another country. In some cases, those who join the forces of another country are liable to lose their nationality. That is a serious difficulty. On the other hand, among the migrants to this country there are many stateless aliens concerning whom these difficulties do not arise. But I reaffirm that we desire to see aliens who have migrated to this country joined in this scheme. We are seeking the co-operation, to this end, of other countries. For example, we are seeking the co-operation of those countries with which we are negotiating immigration agreements. To the extent that we can do so within the rules of international law and the practices which govern the comity of nations, we propose to make these new residents of this country liable for national service. The requisite registration forms will be available at all post offices as well as at district employment offices, and as each registration form is received in the national service registration office a certificate of registration will be issued to the registrant. The bill, it will be noticed, provides that each registrant must notify changes of address to the registrar until such time as he actually commences his national service. The bill provides for medical examination by a medical board consisting of two medical practitioners. The standards of fitness will be as laid down by the services. This examination will include a examination of the chest. I have already referred to the fact that we propose to adjust standards of fitness we go along, so as to bring in persons who might not be fit for actual service with the defence force in time of emergency. I am pleased to be able to say that the State authorities are co-operating with us in relation to radiological examinations. This has considerable value in connection with the general campaign which is being waged against tuberculosis. We have already been assured of the assistance and co-operation of the British this Medical Association in arranging for doctors toundertaike medical examinations,, amd. I am confiden't that the medical profession will,, when individual doctors are approached for assistance,, he ready and willing; to make its contribution to the successful operation, of the scheme. The medical examinations will normally be conducted in local training depots-, formerly known as drill halls, and will follow upon the interview of the registrant with an officer of the Commonwealth Employment Service. At this interview, questions of deferment, preferences in, relation to the service, and ability for allocation, to particular arms of the services will be determined. ""We propose that these interviews and examinations shall take place in the evenings of week days. This: should obviate avoidable interruption, of industry, enable the scheme to be administered with a maximum of economy of staffing, and provide the most favourable conditions fbr the full co-operation of medical, practitioners. The time occupied by registrants in attending for these interviews and examinations is, under the bill, to be treated as an absence permitted by the employer without deductions or loss of pay, but, as they will normally take place in the evenings, there will not be many cases where employers will be required to bear the cost of such absence.",50
129,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"Opposition members interjecting,",52
130,Mr CALWELL,COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS,"The doctors will be paid for attending, but the youths will not!' Mr HOI/T - I can understand the mirth of honourable members opposite. However, as the provisions of the bill are explained honourable gentlemen opposite will realise that employers will be called upon t'o shoulder substantial responsibilities und'er this measure. In addition, there are, of course, many workers enshould begin gaged on shift work, and when such persons attend for interview at night their employers will be called upon to make their pay. Indeed, theliabilities of ployers in respect of the reinstatement continues. provisions of the measure will fall much more heavily upon them than the obligaat tions imposed by the requirement to pay for time lost during those interviews. Concerning the provisions for the up, exemption and deferment, the position is that every registrant who complies with the standard's of fitnesslaid down, will be liable to> be called, up. for service unless he is exempt, from service. The exempt classes, apart from persons subject to. prescribed physical or mental disabilities, are theological students, ministers of religion, members of religious orders and conscientiousobjectors. The Government has-given careful consideration to the position of conscientious objectors. The Defence Act, Part IV . , provides that persons whose conscientious suit- beliefs do not allow them to bear arms shall be liable in time of - war to be enlisted for duties of a non-combatant nature. During the last war, however, » the act was superseded by the National Security (Conscientious Objectors) Regulations, which provided that if a person was found by a court to hold conscientious beliefs which did not permit him to engage in any form of naval, military or air force service, he should be totally exempt, but that if his objection was only tocomhatant duties, he should be enrolled for non-combatant service. The Government believes that conscientious beliefs should be respected. It haSj therefore, decided to adhere to the principle established by the National Security Regulations and to admit conscientious objection as a ground of exemption from service under the act. It will be necessary for the applicant for exemption to establish the ground of conscientious objection to the satisfaction of a court. Courts constituted by a police, stipendiary or special magistrate will have jurisdiction under the bill to determine these applications. Those who do not establish objection to all forms of service will be registered for non-combatant service. 1 I have already said that it is a basic principle of the scheme that training at the age of eighteen years, but there will be exceptions to this prinup ciple-case s in which call-up will be emdeferred while the ground of deferment In that class will be apprentices and students whose course of study a university,, technical school or other approved educational establishment would be seriously dislocated if they were required to d'o their national service at callthe same time as others of their age. These will begranted deferment until they have completed their courses. Another class of people who will he deferred will consist of those who reside at places too remote from training centres to be able conveniently to attend for training after the first and major period of continous training. The Air Eorce would probably prefer trainees living in some proximity to air force stations, while in the case of the Navy, it follows that trainees will be sought who can attend at naval depots. All the services will encourage national service trainees, after their training under that scheme has concluded, to continue to be associated with their units and undertake additional training as do other young men in the Citizen Forces., The services also hope 1 that the later association of national service trainees with the units will lead some of them to enlist in the Permanent Forces. In the case of the Army, in which service the majority of the trainees will serve, the present intention is that the training will include in the second, third and fourth years a number of evening and week-end parades and bivouacs. This raises the same difficulty as was experienced under the training provisions of the Defence Act in that it would be some burden to require persons who live far from centres where there are training depots to attend such periodic parades. The old provisions exemptedpersons whose bona fide residence is not a distance of 5 miles, reckoned by the nearestpracticable route from the nearest place appointed for training. The Government is still examining the question whether this definition meets modern conditions. I believe that most of us would consider that it does not. Persons who live in remote places, however defined, will not be exempted from service, but their call-up will be deferred so that if a training centre is established at a future time in an area where none at present exists, then all registrants in the area may be called up. There is a qualification which, of course, has general effect, which is that no person can be called up to commence service under the provisions of the bill if he has reached the age of 26 years. Certain students doing long courses may constitute an exception to this rule. It USD] is necessary to have an upper age limit after which liability for service shall cease, as otherwise a man could be under the liability all his life. In any case, it is desired to maintain some similarity in the age groups of persons who will be serving together on national service. Of course, if a person changes his place of residence from a place where no training facilities exist to a place where they do, his deferment will automatically terminate. The circumstances in which students, apprentices and persons living in remote areas will be deferred, will be laid down by ministerial decision. Provision is made whereby individual applicants who claim that service under the scheme would impose exceptional hardship on the applicant, his parents or dependants mav apply to a court, which may grant deferment for any period up to twelve months, at the expiration of which time the applicant has the opportunity to apply again. It will have been noticed in my opening remarks that it is not proposed as a matter of general principle to grant exemption or deferment from service on the ground of occupation or employment in a particular industry. At the age of eighteen years the trainees will have had limited industrial experience, and their absence from work during training at this age, followed by short absences in subsequent years, is not expected to involve any within serious loss of man-power to industry. It is possible, however, that an exception will be made to the general rule in the case of the coal-mining industry, which, because of our great need, occupies a position of unique importance in the Australian economy. Men can hardly be spared from it at present, and it is unlikely that recruits would he sought from that industry in time of war. Therefore, at least in the early stages of the scheme, youths engaged in the coal-mining industry will be granted deferment of their liability for service. I now turn to the nature of the service to be rendered under the bill. It will be with the Citizen Naval Forces, the Citizen Military Forces, or the Citizen Air Force. Over the period of five years during which a trainee will be in the Citizen Forces, he will undergo 176 days' training. Having completed that training there will he no further liability for training or service apart from that which, as I have explained, would attach, under the defence legislation, to all members of the Citizen Forces should war break out before the five years' period has expired. The present intentions are that, in the case of the Navy, there will be a period of 124 days' continuous training in the first year, and thirteen days in each of succeeding second, third, fourth and fifth years. In the case of the Army there will be 98 days' continuous training in the first year, and in the second, third, and. fourth years there - will be a fourteen days' camp and twelve days devoted to evening and week-end parades and bivouacs. In the A i r Force the training period of 176 days will be served in one continuous period following call-up. It is conceivable that in the light of experience the services will training. find it desirable to recommend some adjustments of their training programmes, and this will be possible within the framework of the bill subject to the total training period not exceeding 176 days over five years. It will be noted that in the case of Air Force, the whole of the training, and in the case of the other two services a stantial part of it, will be concluded in one straight stretch, and usually in the trainee's eighteenth year and in his first year of training. These arrangements will not only meet the needs of the services, will also cause the minimum disruption of civil employment. There are few workers of the age of eighteen years who cannot be spared from their employment for the period of training proposed for the first year, and the short absences which will be necessary in the years following should give rise to little more inconvenience than is occasioned by annual recreation leave now granted to employees under the terms of industrial awards. It might be asked why the periods of training differ in the various services. The fact is that the type of training to be given differs in each of the services and, furthermore, it has been necessary to take into account our capacity adequately to administer, house and train the trainees. Moreover, the training, as I have preMr Holt. viously said, has to be integrated with the training of the regular forces of the various services. In the case of the Navy, the initial training period will be divided into two parts-ashor e and afloat. The sea-going training will follow immediately on the training in shore establishments, and will be carried out in vessels commissioned specially for the purpose. These vessels will also be used to afford seagoing training to the existing naval the reserve force. In the case of the Army, the first period of 98 days, or fourteen weeks, will comprise basic and specialized training. Training in each of the succeeding second, third, and fourth years will be with Citizen Military Force units. In the case of the A i r Force, training will be on air force stations and will include class-room instruction and working with qualified permanent personnel. In addition, a selected but limited number' of trainees will be given elementary flying The pay and the terms and conditions of service of national service trainees will, in general, be regulated by the servico acts applicable to the particular arm of the Citizen Forces in which they are serving as is the case with volunteer members the of the Citizen Forces. I repeat, however, that this bill does not deal with liability subfor service in time of war. As honourable members are aware, however, the present arrangements of the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force do not provide for enlistment of persons but who are not liable to serve overseas. That being the case, it would be senseless to train national service personnel in these services if they were not going to be in a position in which, in time of war, they could be employed in them. Therefore, the bill provides that no registrant should be allotted to and called up for service with the Navy or Air Force unless he has indicated in advance that he is willing to serve beyond the limits of Australia. A formal document in which a registrant volunteers in this way and which is countersigned by a parent, guardian, magistrate or justice of the peace, will have to be forthcoming from a registrant before he will be allotted to training with tbose services. This will apply notwithstanding that he may, in his registration form, have indicated a preference for servioe with, one or other of those services. It will also be open to a registrant who prefers service with the Ajmy to complete a similar instrument. It may be that at some future time the Navy and the Air Force may decide it enlist persons for service in Australia only, and the bill, therefore, makes provision to enable allocation of registrants to those forces, even if they do not volunteer for overseas service, if and when such a decision is so taken. I should also point out that the intention is to give effect, as far as possible, to the preference for particular services expressed by registrants, but this may not, of course, always be practicable. There remains an important part of the bill that I have not yet discussed which is the part that deals with protection in relation to civil employment. It is here that the bill calls upon employers to make some contribution to the smooth working of the scheme. It is of great importance that a young man should not feel that he will be prejudiced or penalized in his employment by reason of his liability for service or his absence while serving under the scheme. Any such conduct on the part of an employer will constitute an offence. No reflection on the Australian employer should be read into that statement. The Government believes that this whole plan has the enthusiastic support of individual employers and their organizations. Already it is evident that many employers propose to give practical support in the form of making up any difference between the service pay of trainees and their civilian pay. This, I might add, is also the policy of the Government. Subject to some qualifications which will be mentioned, an employee will be entitled to reinstatement in his employment upon return from a period of national service. He will be protected from dismissal, except for reasonable cause, for a period after his reinstatement equivalent to the period that he has just served. The qualifications to these rights are that the employee must have been employed by the employer for at least 30 days immediately prior to his going into camp, and that he must present himself for work without delay after coming out of camp. The reasons for attaching those conditions to the right of reinstatement should be obvious. The bill further provides that a reinstated employee, provided that he stays in the job at least as long as the period of his absence, will have the period of his absence counted as time worked in his employment for the purposes of computing his entitlement to annual leave, sick leave and, where applicable, long service leave and superannuation. The bill also requires an employer to pay his employee for any time which he loses from work while he is attending, under instructions, for interview and examination as to fitness. These provisions in the bill are modelled on those that operated so smoothly in relation to service during the last war. I think that I have now covered the principal provisions of the bill. It is proposed that as soon as the measure becomes law all registrable British subjects whose eighteenth birthday falls between the lst November, 1950, and the 31st March, 1951, will be called upon to register on a date to be notified, or within fourteen days thereafter. As to the numbers who will be trained under the scheme, all I need say is that, as has already been announced, the plans for the first twelve months are to train at least 13,500, with a progressive increase in the following years. This 13,500 will be divided among the services as follows:Royal Australian Navy-50 0 to be called up in two groups of 250the first to commence training in March, 1951. Royal Australian Air Force-3,00 0 in four groups of 750-the first to commence training in April, 1951. Army-10,00 0 in three groups, the first 3,300 to commence in May, 1951. As honourable members will see from these dates it is imperative that this legislation be passed through the Parliament in the course of the current session, because with the necessity for registration, medical examination and interview, if the scheme is to commence on the dates that I have already mentioned we shall have to press forward with the task without any delay. It is preferable that we should go ahead as soon as the bill becomes law, wbicb I hope will happen during the course of this session. Deferments during the first year of the scheme on the grounds mentioned, already are expected to be. heavy, but as these deferments expire, for example as students complete their courses and apprentices become tradesmen, the numbers available for training will rise. The numbers available will also obviously be related to the standards of fitness fixed from time to time and the capacity of the services to extend training facilities to smaller centres in the country. One of the things that has made the planning of the scheme difficult has been the absence of statistical and other data to answer such questions as the distribution geographically of the 18-year-old population and the numbers of 18-year-olds who are students or apprentices and therefore likely to apply for deferment. This has made it impossible to predict with any certainty what numbers will be available for training in the first year on the basis of the present plans. Honourable members can, however, be assured that it is the Government's intention that all shall be trained who prove to be available and the present service training programmes will have to be adjusted to cope with any such situation. [Extension of time granted.] The whole of the plan will be kept under constant review and such adjustments made as circumstances show to be necessary. The commencing rate of training in the first year of the scheme will be some- adjourned. what lower than the Government hoped would be possible, but we had the choice of getting the scheme launched with the least possible delay and with the camp and training facilities and instructors that could' be mustered in the shortest possible time, or of postponing the commencement until such time as these facilities could be extended to permit of the training of greater numbers initially. I feel that honourable members will support the Government's decision to take the first of these choices. This could mean that the training of some registrants in the first year of the scheme might be deferred, perhaps for some months. We shall not have a clear picture of the working out of the scheme until we are well, advanced Mr Holt. with the calling up of the registrants in the first year. The Government has pushed ahead with the implementation of this scheme. The commencing date has been advanced considerably from the first estimates made by our service chiefs. We shall be doing what we can in the future to make the scheme as widespread as possible in its operation. There will necessarily be some consequential amendments to be made in the existing defence legislation when this bill comes into effect, and my colleague, the Minister for Defence, will bring before the House these other measures. I commend the bill to honourable members, and I invite the co-operation of the House in effecting a speedy passage for the measure. To keep to the scheduled target date for making the first trainees available to the eerviceSj very considerable administrative work must still be done, and the first registrations should be completed at a very early date. Naturally, some of this work cannot be carried out until this measure becomes law. We believe that the bill has the support of the Australian people. We believe that it will make for greater peace-time preparedness for defence than we have previously known in this country. The troubled times through which we are passing make the adoption of a workable scheme of national training imperative. For these reasons, the bill should command the close consideration and full support of every member of the Parliament. Debate (on motion by Mr Chifley) NA CONSOLIDATION BILL (No. 2) 1950. Bill received from the Senate and (on motion by Mr Holt ) read a first time. SECOND READING.",52
131,Mr HOLT,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Higgins-Minister for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [8.50] - by leave- I move That the hill be now read a second time. It is perhaps appropriate that having presented to the Parliament on behalf of the Government an instalment of national security, I should follow that with, an instalment of social security, a matter which also forms part of the Government's programme. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Social Services Consolidation Act to give effect to the Government's decision, as announced in the budget speech, to increase the pensions paid to age, invalid and widow pensioners and to make certain other concessions to those pensioners and to other recipients of social services benefits. As announced by the Treasurer, the increase provided by the bill to age and invalid pensioners is 7s. 6d. a week, which will raise the maximum pension from 42s. 6d. to 50s. a week. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that this is the largest increase ever granted to these pensioners since old-age pensions were introduced by the Deakin Government in 1909. The increase of 7s. 6d. a week in the maximum pension will mean an automatic rise of that amount in the permissible limit of pension plus other income which a pensioner may have under the means test. A single pensioner will be able to have a total income of £4 a week, inclusive of pension, instead of £3 12s. 6d. as at present. A married couple, both in receipt of pension, will be able to have between them a total income of £8 a week inclusive of pensions, instead of £7 5s. as at present. This will benefit persons retired on superannuation who are also receiving age pensions. They will receive the full benefit of the increase in the age pension rate, their total incomes being increased by 7s. 6d. a week for a single person and 15s. a week for married couples who are both receiving the pension. The bill contains a special concession for blind pensioners which I am sure honourable members will welcome. Not only will they receive the increase of 7s. 6d. a week in their pensions but they will also benefit by a substantial increase in permissible income. For many years past blind pensioners have been permitted to have an income, including earnings, considerably in excess of the income permitted to other pensioners. The reason is to enable the blind to engage in occupations for which they are specially trained, which not only gives them a greater interest and zest in life but adds to the productive efforts of the community. The rise in wage levels, however, which has occurred during recent years has not been accompanied by increases in the permissible income for the blind pensioners. The Government has decided to rectify this, and the bill provides that the amount of income, including earnings, which a blind pensioner may have without reduction of pension shall be increased from £5 17s. 6d. a week to £8 a week. This will mean that a blind pensioner will be able to have an income of £8 a week in addition to the pension of £2 10s., a total of £10 10s. a week. A married couple, both blind, will be able to have an income of £8 a week between them and each receive the full pension of £2 10s., making a total of £13 a week between them. These liberalizations will benefit approximately 3,200 blind persons already receiving the invalid pension and will make it possible for quite a number of blind persons, at present excluded by the income test, to qualify for pensions for the first time. Honourable members may remember that in October, 1948, a new principle was introduced into social services legislation applying to those cases where the pensioner received a war pension in addition to his civil pension. Certain ceiling limits were imposed on the total amount which a pensioner could receive by way of war pension olus age or invalid pension. The Government proposes to make an appropriate increase in those limits to enable pensioners to derive some benefit from the increase in war or civil pension for which provision is now being made. The bill accordingly provides for a rise in the ceiling limits on these dual pensions from £3 2s. 6d. to £3 10s. in the case of a single person, and from £6 2s. a week to £6 10s. in the case of a married couple who are both receiving a civil pension. Where only one spouse of a married couple is receiving a civil pension the ceiling limit will be raised from £5 to £5 7s. 6d. a week. Age and invalid pensioners will benefit from another concession contained in the bill which relates to the treatment of life insurance policies under the property test. At the present time up to £200 of the surrender value of life insurance policies is disregarded in applying the property means test. This special exemption is raised to £500 by the bill. It applies, of course, in addition to the general property exemption of £100 for a single person or £200 for a married couple. It would be possible for a pensioner who now receives a reduced pension on account of life insurance policies to benefit by as much as 23s. a week as a result of this concession. Therefore, it is a substantial concession. The bill also provides for increases in the pensions payable to civilian widows. The increase for class A widows, that is, widows with one or more children under sixteen years, is 7s. 6d. a week, which will raise the class A pension from 47s. 6d. to 55s. a week. The increase for other classes of widow pensioners is 5s. a week. The great majority of these comprise pensioners in class B who are widows over 50 years of age with no children under sixteen years. The pension for such widows will be raised from 37s. to 42s. a week. This increase applies also to women known as class D widows who may be granted pensions during the imprisonment of their husbands for more than six months. Class C pensions, which are payable for not more than six months to widows who are under 50 years of age and have no children under sixteen years, will be raised by 5s. from 42s. 6d. to 47s. 6d. a week. The increases to which I have referred will be paid also to other women for whom civilian widows' pensions are provided, such as deserted wives, divorcees and women whose husbands are in a hospital for the insane. The increases to widow pensioners will automatically raise the limits of pension plus other income which a widow may have under the means test. The permissible income for these pensioners is 30s. a week, which is the same as that allowed in respect of age and invalid pensioners. Class A widows will thus be able to have a total income of £4 5s. a week, inclusive of pension, instead of £3 17s. 6d., as at present. Child endowment is payable in addition to the pension and is not included in the permissible income. Widow pensioners in classes B and D will be able to have a total income of £3 12s. a week, inclusive of pension, instead of if r . Eolt. £3 7s. as at present. There is no specific permissible income for class C widows, the economic qualifications for the pension being that they are in necessitous circumstances after the death of the husband. The special ceiling limits on dual pensions, comprising war pension plus civil pension, to which I have referred in connection with age and invalid pensioners, apply also to civilian widow pensioners. These ceiling limits do not concern what are known as "" war widows "", who receive war pensions in respect of the death of their husbands. Such widows are not eligible under the law to receive, in addition, a civilian widow's pension. The ceiling limits, however, do affect other widows who are in receipt of a civilian widow's pension. The bill provides for these limits to be increased from £3 12s. 6d. to £4 a week in the case of class A widows and from £3 2s. 6d. to £3 10s. a week in the cases of widows in the other classes. The liberalization of the property means test in respect of the surrender value of life assurance policies, which is to be made for age and invalid pensioners, will apply also to the means test for widow pensioners. As I have already mentioned, the special exemption of £200 of the surrender value of such policies will be raised to £500. It would be possible for a widow pensioner, who is receiving a reduced pension because of the surrender value of life assurance policies, to benefit by as much as 16s. a week as a result of this concession. I come now to other concessions provided for in the bill. These relate chiefly to persons who are entitled to unemployment or sickness benefits. It is with considerable satisfaction that I inform honourable members that the concessions include the exemption of war pension from "" income "" in applying the means test for these benefits. Many honourable members will recall that the Liberal and Australian Country parties, which now comprise the Government parties, when in Opposition, fought hard for recognition of this most desirable principle at the time when the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Bill was before the Parliament in 1944 and on a number of subsequent occasions when social services amending bills were being debated. The Labour Government was not prepared to accept that principle. I am sure that not only ex-servicemen's organizations but also the public generally will welcome this decision. The concession will mean that many war pensioners wbo are otherwise qualified will become eligible for unemployment or sickness benefits for the first time. The means test for these benefits allows 80s. a week of other income, in which, at present, war pensions are included. Any income in excess of this amount necessitates a corresponding reduction in the rate of benefit. ""When this bill becomes law, war pensioners who are eligible to receive unemployment or sickness benefits will be able to have 20s. a week income apart from their war pensions and will still be eligible to receive the maximum rate of benefit. Another concession that is now provided for in respect of persons who are entitled to sickness benefit is the extension of the time limit for the lodgement of claims from six weeks after the date of incapacity to thirteen weeks after that date. This extended period should give ample time for persons who, for one reason or another, delay the lodgement of their claims to receive the benefit without any loss of arrears, provided that the claim is lodged within three months after the date of incapacity. If , however, owing to the effects of the incapacity or to) some other sufficient cause, the claimant is unable to lodge his claim within the extended period of three months, the Director-General of Social Services, under discretionary powers that are being retained in the act, may approve of payment of arrears of the benefit as from the normal date, or from such later date as he considers to be reasonable in the circumstances. A further concession provided for in the bill in respect of persons who are eligible for sickness benefit is a provision under which a claim for workers' compensation that is made within thirteen weeks after the occurrence of the claimant's incapacity will be treated as a claim for sickness benefit in determining the date from which that benefit will be payable. This will safeguard the rights of workers who defer lodging their claims for sickness benefit while awaiting the determination of their claims for workers' compensation. In the past a number of claims for sickness benefit have been rejected because by the time the claim for workers' compensation has been decided the period during which an application for sickness benefit should be lodged has expired. It is considered unfair that workers who sustain injuries which cause an interruption of their employment, and who fail in their claims for compensation, should also be deprived of sickness benefit merely because of the late lodgement of their claims in such circumstances. There is, of course, no reason why such a person should defer his claim for sickness benefit. He should not do so. But departmental experience shows that some workers, believing themselves entitled to workers' compensation, fail to claim sickness benefit, only to find subsequently that they are ineligible for workers' compensation. It is then too late for them tb claim sickness benefit. The new provision will remedy this situation. The bill also contains a concession relating to child endowment. This will enable endowment to be paid in respect of the children of members of the naval, military or air forces of the United Kingdom who are serving with the Australian forces and who have brought their families with them to remain only during their term of temporary service. Undei; the present law, endowment is not payable in respect of these children for the first twelve months of their residence in Australia, notwithstanding that the eligibility of the parents for payment of family allowance from the United Kingdom Government ceases on their departure from the home country. As these personnel are liable to pay Commonwealth taxes from the time of commencement of their service with the Australian forces, it is only right that the benefit of child endowment should be available to them. The bill corrects this anomaly, and as soon as it becomes law endowment will be payable in respect of the children concerned from the time of their arrival in Australia. Honourable members will note that the bill contains provisions for the discontinuance of payment of an age or invalid pension or a widow's pension during the period in respect of which the pensioner receives an allowance under section 9 of the Tuberculosis Act 1948. The reason for this is that the allowances granted under that act to sufferers from tuberculosis are payable in substitution for the pension and at rates which are considerably higher than pension rates. The bill contains a similar provision relating to persons who are in receipt of unemployment, sickness or special benefits and who are granted tuberculosis allowances under the new scheme. My colleague, the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page), has already explained to the House the generous scheme of allowances to sufferers from tuberculosis which came into operation on the 13th July, 1950. The maximum allowance for a single person is £3 12s 6d. a week and for a married sufferer £6 103. a week, plus 9s. for each dependent child under sixteen years. Obviously, it is not intended to pay pensions in addition to these allowances. Under the scheme that was in force prior to the 13th July, 1950, the allowances were paid to sufferers, thus supplementing their pensions. These allowances were at much lower rates. For example, the allowance was 10s. a week for a single person and 25s. for a married person, plus 5s. for each dependent child under sixteen years. The Tuberculosis Act is administered by the Department of Health but the grant and payments of the allowances under the new scheme are made by the Department of Social Services. The increased rates of pensions vided for in the bill will be paid on first pension pay-day occurring after the date on which the legislation is passed and receives the Royal Assent. The increased payments, however, will have retrospective effect to the first pension pay-day November. This will mean that the creased payments to age and invalid penhealth sioners will commence with and include the fortnightly instalment due on the 2nd November, 1950, and the increased payout ments to widow pensioners will commence with and include the fortnightly instalis ment due on the 7th November, 1950. So far as is practicable, all pensioners receive the arrears of the increase their first payments at the new rate. however, the time between the date of passing of the legislation and the next Mr Bolt. pension pay-day is very short, that may not be possible in all instances. Any pensioners who do not receive the arrears on the first pay-day after the legislation is passed will receive them in the shortest possible time after that date. .It is expected that approximately 416,000 age and invalid pensioners will benefit from the increase of 7s. 6d. a week provided for in the bill. This is estimated to cost £8,250,000 for a full year, and £5,500,000 for the remainder of the current financial year. Approximately 17,800 class A widows will receive the increase of 7s. 6d. a week in their pensions, whilst 25,000 widows in the other classes will receive an increase of 5s. a week. The estimated cost of the increases of widows' pensions is £700,000 for a full year, and £500,000 for the remainder of this financial year. The other concessions provided for in the bill are estimated to cost £75,000 for a full year. This will bring the total cost of the increases and concessions to £9,000,000 for a full year, and to approximately £6,000,000 in the current financial year. The expenditure on age and invalid pensions for the year 1949-50 was £44,557,000. As a result of the increases and liberalizations provided in the bill and the normal increase of the number of pensioners, it is estimated that the expenditure on these pensions for the vear 1950-51 will reach £51,500,000, whilst the liability for a full year will rise to £54,250,000. The expenditure on widows' pensions for 1949-50 prowas £4,420,000. The estimated expend the ture on these pensions for 1950-51, including the cost of the proposed increases, is £5,000,000, and the liability for a full year will become £5,200,000. The total expenditure on social in services provided under the Social inServices Consolidation Act, excluding benefits, for the year 1949-50 was £85,294,000. The estimated expenditure on these services, including that arising of the increases and liberalizations provided in the bill for the year 1950-51, £108,000,000. Many honourable members will recall that the total Commonwill wealth budget did not pass the with £100,000,000 mark until the year If , immediately preceding the outbreak of the the recent war; and that seemed to be a phenomenalfigureat that time. I repeat that the Government's provision for social services alone will amount to £108,000,000 during the current financial year. Taking the cost of the increases into account for a full year, the annual liability for social services under the Social Services 'Consolidation Act will rise to £111,000,000. Finally, I direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that the extension of endowment to the first child at a cost of £15,000,000 per annum, together with the increases and concessions provided for in this bill which will cost a further £9,000,000 per annum, means that the Government within twelve months of its taking office has increased and liberalized social services benefits by an amount of £24,000,000 per annum. This, I submit, is the clearest possible evidence of the determination of the Government to pursue a social .services policy based on social justice and the capacity of the community to provide an equitable spread of social benefits. I commend this measure to honourable members and express the hope that it will be given a speedy passage. Debate (on motion by Mr Chifley) adjourned. SALES TAX (EXEMPTION SAND CLASSIFICATIONS) BILL 1950. SECOND BEADING. Debate resumed (vide page 2723).",56
132,Mr EGGINS,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Lyne) [9.14] - I support the measure, the object of which is to implement an important part of the budget. Members of the Opposition addressed themselves to the bill this afternoon devoted practically the whole of their time to a discussion of its side issues and ignored its primary purpose which is to encourage an increase of duction as a means of curbing The Government, although it has been in office for only eleven months, has accomplished a great deal, and I believe that the Parliament and the people generally will regard its achievements during that time as outstanding. It has been obliged to change the outlook of the administration from a policy of socialization to that of encouraging vate enterprise, and its achievements that respect have been marked with considerable success. A number of the promises that were made by the present Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) in their policy speeches during the last general election campaign have been fulfilled. Opposition members, although they endeavour to convey the impression that the Government has failed to honour its pre-election promises, are unable to produce evidence to refute our claim that the Government's achievements in that respect have been noteworthy. I shall briefly describe them. The Government has abolished the rationing of petrol, butter and tea, and has provided for increased expenditure on roads, for improved postal and telephone facilities involving considerable expenditure, for additional social services, for increases of age, invalid, widows' and war pensions, and for health benefits. The Government has thereby fulfilled the promises that were made by members of the Liberal party and of the Australian Country party during the last general election campaign. The present Prime Minister and the Treasurer also promised the electors that they would review the incidence of taxation, and grant relief, wherever possible, to taxpayers, so that encouragement might be given tb the people generally to increase production. But honourable members should not overlook the fact that during the last general election campaign no one could foresee that a few months later, Australia would send its sailors, soldiers and airmen abroad to join with the troops of other members of the United Nations in defendwho ing the cause of freedom.",61
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SERVICES,Order ! The honourable member may not discuss general taxation policy when he is debatproing this bill. He must confine his reinflation. marks to sales tax.,61
134,Mr EGGINS,SOCIAL SERVICES,"I am endeavouring to relate this bill to the general responsibilities of the Government in respect of taxation. The proceeds from the sales tax make an important contribution to general revenue, and I am reminding the House that the present Government, when it promised the people' during the last prigeneral election campaign that taxation in would be reviewed, could not foresee the developments that have since occurred in the international situation. The Treasurer has been obliged to make provision in the budget to meet them. In other words, the Government must raise additional revenue to meet its increased commitments for defence. I shall now examine the fundamental principles of this bill. Opposition members have attempted to emphasize the minor or secondary aspects of it, and have conveniently overlooked the all-important fact that sales tax will be abolished on goods urgently needed by people. The policy of the Government is to reduce the cost of living wherever possible, and, therefore, the Treasurer proposes to remove the sales tax from all foodstuffs. I point out at this juncture that the preceding Labour Government did uot see fit to grant that measure of relief to the people. It is a commendable action on the part of this Government to make it possible for the people to obtain food at a reduced cost. Another important concession that I emphasize is that the Government has abolished sales tax on building materials. The two fundamental factors which concern the people are the cost of food, and of housing, and the Treasurer has been able to remove the sales tax from items in - those two categories. Yet, Opposition members have completely avoided making reference to them, and have concentrated their attention on minor or secondary aspects of the bill. Much has been said in this debate about the proposed increases of sales tax on various items. I can say, without fear of contradiction, that no member of the Parliament enjoys supporting, a bill that increases taxes. We definitely enjoy granting people relief from taxation, and the policy of the Government is to grant such relief, wherever possible. However, the requirements of the nation demand certain action, and the Government would fail in its duty if it did not accept its sponsibilities in that respect. I am sure that persons who now consider that increases of sales tax arc unwarranted will ultimately recognize the need for such action, and will give the Government credit for being - honest in its policy to promote the welfare and to ensure the security of this country. Afr. Eggins. A vital aspect of this bill, which shuld not be 'overlooked, is that our resources of man-power for industry and defence are strictly limited. Earlier this evening, the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holt) explained some of those problems in his second reading speech on the National Service Bill 1950, and the Government, in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1950, is endeavouring, not entirely to transfer labour immediately from one industry to another, but to discourage the expansion of non-essential industries. It would not be wise, for example, to allow migrants to engage in industries that are not really essential to the national need. Therefore, the action of the Government in increasing the sales tax on the products of less essential industries, will establish the principle of discouraging, for the time being, the expansion of such industries. That policy, in turn, must help to guide migrants, and many Australians, into employment in essential industries. The Government, regrets having to take such action, but it has a responsibility to fulfil to the nation as a whole. Opposition members have endeavoured to make party political capital out of the increase of sales tax on cosmetics, but I believe that their remarks merely tend to belittle the womenfolk. In the present national need, matters that are essential to the safety and happiness of the people must receive priority, and I am certain that the minor sacrifices, for which this bill calls from the people generally, will be accepted cheerfully. The Government, as soon as it considers that results justify the relaxation of those impositions will grant the necessary relief. I again emphasize the fundamental principles underlying this hill that should not be forgotten. They are, (1) that refoodstuffs and building materials will be exempt from sales tax; (2) that the people generally will be guided into more essential industries for the time being; and (3) that the sales tax can he adjusted from time to time as the national economy warrants. Having in mind those factors, I have much pleasure in supporting the bill.",61
135,Mr BIRD,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Batman) [9.26] - My first impression of this bill was one of pleasure, because I noted that the Government intended to reduce the sales tax on certain articles. But my pleasure turned to consternation and dismay when I discovered, on perusing other provisions of the measure, that it was proposed to increase the imposts on various goods in order to collect an additional £10,000,000 per annum. Therefore, I believe that the bill is a big disappointment to the Australian people. I , in common with many electors, had hoped for a reduction of sales tax this year. My hopes had been raised by the promise made by the present Prime Minister (Mr Menzies)' in his policy speech during the last general election campaign when he said, among other thingsWe will review the incidence of indirect taxes (which are a huge, though sometimes unrecognized item in Australia) upon basic wage and cost-of-living items and housing costs. On hearing that weighty pronouncement, about twelve months ago, I thought that the least that could be expected from a Liberal government would be a sharp reduction of indirect taxation. My opinion was reinforced by the comments that had been made by members of the Liberal party for a number of years whenever sales tax legislation was under consideration. The pages of Hansard are literally studded with their statements in which the incidence of the sales tax is roundly condemned. I recall that the sales tax was introduced by the Scullin Government in 1930, and that the members of the conservative party of that day strongly opposed it. On various occasions since that time, they have not been backward in condemning increases of sales tax. Their hostility to it was manifest even in the darkest days of World War II . , when the Labour Government was forced, by the national emergency, to increase the sales tax, although those rates were not comparable with the scale proposed by this Government. Naturally, I thought, with that evidence at my disposal, that the last thing that could be expected from a Liberal government would be an increase of sales tax, and, therefore, my astonishment was not to be wondered at when I learned that this Government contemplated, not a nominal increase in the main, but a most savage increase of sales tax on articles that were really needed by the people. The sales tax was introduced in 1930 in the trying times of the financial and economic depression. It was originally intended as an emergency measure but has tended to become a source of permanent revenue. During the early 'thirties the governments of most countries which were forced to impose sales tax said that it would be only a temporary imposition. This Government has not only made it permanent but also increased it to a degree never before known in the history of Australia. The governments of the depression days can be excused for the imposition of sales tax because falling price levels caused income tax receipts to shrivel to such an extent that the raising of additional revenue became necessary. But never at any time was it suggested by those who introduced the sales tax that it was an equitable apportionment of the taxation burden. To say the least, it is a most inequitable apportionment. The Labour party recognizes that fact. When the Labour Government introduced sales tax it said that at the first available opportunity it would decrease the rate and it did so over the last three years or fours years of its regime. In a period of prosperity such as the present, one would expect further reduction of sales tax rates, but they have been increased most viciously. I indict the principle of sales tax generally and the proposed increase in particular because it fails to meet the needs of equitable taxation. Because of the operation of a sales tax a large proportion of the amount earned by the worker is spent instead of being saved. It is unavoidable that sales tax should be unfair to the lower wage-earner because it fails to take into account the economic position of the people who purchase the items taxed. Successive governments have retained the sales tax without detriment to themselves because it has been of a comparatively mild nature. The constant collection of a mild tax from millions of consumers lends a painlessness to the process of payment with the result that there has not been much condemnation of sales tax. But, with the steep rise of the cost of goods the Government will be more unpopular than before, if that is possible, when these proposals are implemented. It appears reasonable to appraise any taxation from three points of view. First of all, how doe9 it apportion the burden of taxation among persons with different incomes? Secondly, what is its efficiency when measured by the cost of administration in relation to the revenue produced? Thirdly, what is its effect on the productivity of the economic system? Judged in this way sales tax and the increases proposed in this measure are to be roundly condemned. Sales tax places the same burden on all sections of the community. A man may be a millionaire or a pauper but when he buys an article, irrespective of his financial position, the same tax is imposed on him. In that respect a sales tax is unfair and cannot be justified in these days of prosperity as it was in the 1930's. When the Treasurer foreshadowed this measure in his budget speech, he said It is proposed to increase the rate of sales tax on certain goods, the manufacture and sale of which are considered to cause inordinate competition for materials in short snpply and skilled man-power. It is hoped that the discouragement of the higher rates will check, to some extent, the growth of this competition for materials and man-power which could be better employed in the production of more essential goods. The additional revenue which it is expected will be obtained as a result will be about £10,000,000 in a full year, or approximately £7,500,000 in the current year. The dual purposes of this bill, as related by the Treasurer, are to raise additional money to the amount of £10,000,000 and to fight inflation. This bill will not fight inflation because it will fail in its objective of causing a diversion of labour power. The articles on which it is proposed to increase the sales tax from 25 per cent, to 33$ per cent, are those which people must have and the burden will fall on the workers who will have to dip further down into their pockets in order to meet the increased cost. Honourable members opposite have waxed eloquent about the necessity for increased taxation. They have said that because of the position in Korea and Mr Bird. the desperate defence position which may obtain in Australia shortly additional expenditure on defence is most necessary and that therefore this bill should not be opposed. The Labour party recognizes that certain obligations have been entered into and must be borne by the people of Australia but if taxation is to be increased why cannot it be increased equitably? Nobody can suggest that the increased sales tax proposed is equitable. If the Government were to put to the people in broad terms the necessity for increased taxation they would not object to a proper and fair increase, particularly on higher salary earnings. A huge reservoir of taxation is still untapped by the Government. Honourable members have heard that the Treasurer contemplates introducing a bill to deal with excess profits very shortly but I gravely doubt whether it will be presented to the House before Christmas. The Treasurer could obtain more than £10,000,000 from an excess profits tax, but no effort has been made to obtain extra taxation from the people who can afford to pay it. The Government has made a most unscientific and unintelligent approach to the rate of taxation applicable to suitcases. The sales tax on music instrument cases is 25 per cent. If one has a cornet or a piccolo one must pay a tax of 25 per cent, when purchasing a case in which to carry it. But the sales tax on a suitcase which is a most necessary article is 33$ per cent. Every housewife must have a suitcase, particularly at the present time, because most retailers will not deliver goods. That is the continual grievance of housewives in Victoria who have to buy goods and carry them home like a pack horse. The Government has an excellent opportunity to give encouragement to housewives by imposing a lower tax on fibre suitcases. The additional 8$ per cent, tax on these cases, as compared with music instrument cases, is a most unfair imposition. A case for a trombone or a cornet will cost an additional 25 per cent, but a case for the purpose of carrying essential goods for the family will be subject to a tax of 33$ per cent. It may be that the Government has overlooked this point. If so, I shall be glad to hear the Treasurer admit the mistake and reduce the tax on suitcases to 25 per cent. This bill is ill-conceived and reeks with anomalies. The Government would be well advised, in its own interests, to draw it. I think that the Government is attempting to do some sort of job in the interests of the people although it has not done very well up to the present. If it wants to do a good job I advise it to withdraw this bill and draft a scheme which will meet the requirements of the Australian people. The Government could permit the sales tax reduction of £1,000,000, eliminate the increased taxes it has been estimated will produce £10,000,000 and obtain more than that amount by means of an excess profits tax.",63
136,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Balaclava-Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation) [9.43] - The honourable member for Batman (Mr Bird) has emphasized that this bill is unfair to the lower-paid wage earner. If honourable members of the Opposition believed that, there would be merit in their protests. In fact the very reverse is the case. As the honourable member for Batman has said, sales tax was introduced by a Labour government during the depression. No taxation is pleasant and it should be as fair and light as possible. The sales tax covered a wide range of commodities during the depression including many foodstuffs and it was only after strong protests had been made by honourable members of the then Opposition that many items were exempted. The honourable member protested strongly against the tax on trombone, cornet and other musical cases, but he did not mention the numerous items from which the Government has removed the tax, such as cane lifts, trailers, a number of foodstuffs manufactured in Australia, and ice which is a necessity for the family. The honourable member protested on behalf of the poor harassed housewife and the worker but the tax was retained on those foodstuffs and on ice over the years although honourable members on this side of the House protested that the poor housewife could not afford an electric refrigerator as members of the Labour party could and that she had to put up with an ice chest. This Government now proposes to remove the impost on ice. It is only one item in a long list of proposed exemptions. Coffee ani coffee essence, cocoa and cocoa essence all will be removed from the schedule o' withtaxable goods. Important exemptions will be those which affect goods required for home building. Coal, which is vital to the production of steel and cement, also will be exempt. The Labour Government retained the sales tax on coal imported. We shall remove it. Metal building materials, such as girders, rods, bars, wire, sheets, mesh and fabricated units will be omitted from the sales tax schedules, and builder's hardware, which we asked the Labour Administration to exempt years ago, will be treated similarly. These changes will be of great benefit to the working men about whom members of the Opposition bleat so plaintively. The Labour Administration insisted on retaining sales tax upon all those items, which have an important effect upon the cost of building. The list of exemptions covering builders requirements occupies nearly a page. Apparently members of the Opposition would tax the working man who wants to build a house or extend his home. Bolts, brads, catches, decking spikes, doorbells, door handles, hasps, hinges, hooks, and knobs, which will be exempt, all affect the cost of building a house. I shall not read the whole list, but I direct attention to electrical fittings. Do members of the Opposition want to keep the working man on the candle or kerosene lamp standard? They retained the charges on electrical fittings when they were in power; we shall eliminate them in order to make housing costs cheaper. We have said that we will put value back into the £1 and check inflation. This bill is one of many measures that the Government has prepared for that purpose. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), in his fatuity, laughs and jeers and fails to appreciate the value of the Government's plans. But I am sure that the ex-serviceman who wants to buy a war service home but can borrow only £2,000 for that purpose will appreciate what we are doing. Members of the Opposition have not examined the bill properly. They merely shout a few threadbare socialist shibboleths that were first used in the time of Karl Marx without understanding the subject that they are supposed to be discussing. I direct their attention to many other items that will be exempt from sales tax under this new provision. Bath heaters, which probably do not interest them but which interest many other Australians, will be removed from the list of goods that are subject to sales tax. The arguments that have been advanced by the Opposition favour the purchasers of luxury motor cars, one of the few commodities that will be subjected to a higher rate of tax than previously. Members of the Opposition have protested against the Government's proposals merely because they know that their objections are being broadcast. They hope thereby to gain a few extra votes at the next general election. The facts are that this measure will remove sales tax from many commodities and will increase the impost on a few items. No government increases taxes for fun. The present Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) told us in 1939 that the total receipts from taxes in Australia for 1939-40 would be £100,000,000. This year the Government proposes to expend over £112,000,000 on social services alone. Furthermore, it must obtain extra money for defence. It has adjusted many anomalies that the Labour administration refused to adjust. For example, the Chifley Government would not allow an ex-service pensioner to obtain unemployment relief without suffering a deduction on account of his pension. This Government has put that anomaly right. However, such acts cost money and money cannot be taken out of the air. The Government does not believe in inflation, the nationalization of banks and the printing of bank notes ad libittvm. It believes in conducting the affairs of the country on a business like basis and in paying its way. Therefore, it proposes to obtain a little additional money at the expense of such citizens as those who ride in Chrysler motor cars and other luxurious vehicles, which members of the Labour party are known to favour. At the same time, it intends to reduce the cost of building and to enable the housewife to obtain food more cheaply. Mr White.",65
137,Mr BIRD,SOCIAL SERVICES,I agree with the proposed deductions.,66
138,Mr WHITE,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Apparentl y the honourable gentleman' is one of the fair members of the Opposition, hut he did not say anything about that during his speech. I have had to say it for him. This measure will enable the people to build more houses and it will help, in a small measure, to check inflation. The Government must obtain additional revenue for defence and for social service benefits. Changes will be made in the sales tax schedules if and when anomalies are disclosed. Any representations that members of the Opposition may make on such issues will be considered carefully by the Treasurer (Mr. Fadden). The bill will remove many anomalies that the Government parties promised that they would remove when they faced the electors during the general election campaign. This is the earliest opportunity to do so. We are lightening the burden of taxes upon those citizens who feel the burden most. Members of the Opposition have claimed that the sales tax is variable. But income tax also is variable. The person on the lowest scale of income pays the least income tax, and the person who is least able to bear the expense will pay the least sales tax. That is in accordance with the Government's policy, and that is why this bill has been introduced. It deserves the applause of all honourable members.",66
139,Mr BRYSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Wills) [9.52] --The Minister for Air (Mr White) made a remarkable speech in support of the bill. He told us Ihat the measure was necessary partly to finance increased defence expenditure, partly to finance additional social services costs, and partly to provide funds for other government expenditure. He also described it as a great anti-inflationary measure. But, when we consider the fact that the Government intends to collect only an additional £7,500,000 this year from the sales tax, the honourable gentleman's argument in relation to expenditure on defence, social services and other governmental activities immediately falls to the ground. He told us that the bill would remove many sales tax anomalies and that building materials, foodstuffs and a number of other important items would be exempt. He quoted extensively from a list of goods covering three pages in the printed schedules. In his eagerness to tell a good story, he forgot to mention that the total saving to the taxpayers from exemptions and reductions will represent only £1,000,000 in a full year, or £640,000 for the current financial year.. That exposes the weakness of his assertion that the alterations will have any marked effect upon the cost of building. The saving will be only a miserable one.",66
140,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,The Labour Government did not make those concessions when it had the chance to do so.,67
141,Mr BRYSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"It enacted many other valuable measures. But the point at issue now does not concern the achievements or the shortcomings of the Labour administration. We are now discussing the sales tax legislation that has been introduced by the Treasurer (Mr. Fadden). That right honourable gentleman will stand alone as the greatest political acrobat in the history of this Parliament. Year after year, when he was a member of the Opposition, he criticized the acts of the Labour Government and suggested what should be done in order to reduce the burdens of taxation and government expenditure. On dozens of occasions he opposed the sales tax. He and his colleagues were elected to power last December on the strength of a programme that included promises to reduce taxes and government expenditure. Yet one of the first results of his accession to office has been an increase of government expenditure by about £170,000,000 a year. He now proposes to increase sales tax charges so that he can obtain an additional amount of £7,500,000 this year from that source. He has completely somersaulted and reversed the policy that he expressed so vehemently during the eight years in which the Labour party was in office. He has made a greater mess of this bill than he has made of any other task during the whole of his political career. One can scarcely believe that he has given any serious consideration to the job of amending the sales tax schedules. The Minister for A i r said the purpose of the measure was to remove anomalies from the sales tax system and also to raise additional revenue from the sales tax on luxury goods. He made a big song about the proposed increased tax on motor cars. We admit that privately owned motor cars are luxuries, but I point out that the Government's plan is to increase the rate of sales tax on such vehicles only from 8$ per cent, to 10 per cent., which represents merely £1 13s. 4d. for each £100 of the cost. Furthermore, spare parts for motor cars will not be subjected to higher sales tax. Apparently, the Government regards them as necessities instead of as luxuries. The tax on wireless sets, which are virtually essential in every home, will be increased from 8$ per cent, to 25 per cent. That will remove another anomaly, I suppose! It seems that a wireless set is a much greater luxury than is a new motor car. Anomalies may be found throughout the schedules that the Government has prepared. Certain electrical appliances are to be exempt from sales tax, but electric light globes, which are a necessity in every house to which electric power is supplied, are not included in the list, although they wear out and must be replaced at regular intervals. Does that represent the removal of an anomaly? Bell equipment, burglar alarm equipment and fire alarm equipment, which are important in a civilized community, will remain taxable although certain other electrical accessories will be exempt. Will that remove anomalies, or will it increase the number of anomalies? I ask the Minister for Air to express an opinion upon that question. Electrically operated appliances and machines will not be exempt although they are necessary in a modern economy. Floral tributes, including bouquets and wreaths, will be exempt from tax. No doubt such items are not luxuries in the opinion of the Treasurer and the Minister for Air. I wonder why wreaths should be removed from the field of sales tax at a time when the tax on many other commodities is to be increased. The only explanation that occurs to me is that the Government expects that the mourners will not provide wreaths, if they are subject to sales tax, when it is being decently buried at a very early date. Musical instruments bave been dealt with at lengthj and I sball not refer to tbem. But watches and clocks are considered to be luxuries, and they are to be taxed at the hew high rate of 33$ per cent. The movements, parts and keys for such instruments will be taxed at the same rate. Although spare parts for luxury niotOr cars are undoubtedly luxuries the sales tax on such goods will not be increased. However, sales tax of 33$ per cent, will be imposed on spare parts for watches and clocks. Is that particular provision intended to remove an anomaly front the principal act, or is it hot, in itself, an anomaly? Sales tax of 33$ per cent, will also be imposed on studs, sleevelinks and fountain pens. Indeed, the more closely we examine the tax schedules ih the present measure the more glaring the anomalies appear. I shall not delay the House very long* but I cannot help directing attention to some of the more obvious anomalies in this measure. Sales tax of 33$ per cent, is to be imposed on toilet and beauty preparations, which include powders for use on the human body and toilet powders for use on babies. Does the Treasurer consider it a luxury for a mother to powder her baby's bottom before wrapping a napkin round it? I should like the Treasurer to answer that question.",67
142,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Order ! I should like the honourable member for ""Wills (Mr Bryson) to restrain his language. Has he no respect at all for the House ? Mr BltYSON - I am sorry if I have transgressed. I was pointing out some of the anomalies ih the legislation. The Minister for Air said that the bill was designed to remove anomalies in the legislation introduced by the previous Government. I say that the present measure will increase tenfold the anomalies in the previous legislation. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that the Treasurer has already circulated a number of proposed amendriients to the bill because of glaring anomalies that have been pointed out to him by certain interests and by persons other than the members of the Opposition. For instance, certain food preparations will apparently be exeitipt from the payment of sales tax. Although wireless sets are apparently regarded by the Government as luxuries; because sales tax at the rate of 25 per cent, will be levied oh wireless sets, the Treasurer is preparing an aihendnieht which will provide that batteries for use in wireless sets of certain types shall be exempt from taxation. That proposal is typical of the inconsistency ih the outlook of the Government oh these matters. Although wireless sets, including even those that are operated by batteries, are apparently regarded by the Government as luxuries, tie batteries, which form a component of those sets, are not so regarded. I suggest to the Government that valves for wireless sets should be treated in the same way as batteries for the purpose of imposing sales tax, and that valves for replacement purposes should be regarded as necessaries. In conclusion, the bill contains so many obvious anomalies and inconsistencies that I suggest to the Treasurer that he should withdraw it altogether. After he has giveri proper Consideration to the Government's heed to obtain additional revenue and has carefully considered the requirements of the community, having regard particularly to the present high cost of living, he could present fresh pre posals to the Parliament. If the Government finds it necessary to increase the revenue from sales tax by 10 per cent, the Treasurer should get some of the officers of his department to make a careful examination of the items proposed to be taxed, segregate the luxury goods from the necessaries, and introduce a new measure which will provide for increased sales tax only on goods that are truly luxuries. Mr TtTRNBULL (Mallee) [10.5] The Minister for Air (Mr White) covered most of the points raised by honourable members who have taken part in the debate, bilt I shall deal with certain remarks made by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Bird), who spoke subsequently to the Mmister. the honourable gentleman said that the Labour party was justified in introducing sales tax originally because at that time the Government ""needed revenue to combat the suffering caused by the depression, but that the present Government was not justified in seeking to obtain additional revenue from sales tax at a time such as the present. I cannot understand such confused reasoning. Again and again members of the Labour party have harped 6ii the sufferings of the people during the depression, when many persons walked the roads and did not have sufficient money even to buy food. Of course, that picture of the tragic state of affairs during the depression is, unfortunately, true. Therefore, one finds it difficult to understand the Contention of honourable members Opposite that sales tax should be imposed on goods of all kinds, including foodstuffs, during a depression as it only added to the heavy burden already being Carried, but that such taxes should iiot be imposed during a time of comparative prosperity. I do not seek to justify the imposition of sales tax, and I should like it to be eliminated altogether. However, the difficulty seems to be that at present the Government cannot do without the revenue derived from it. The honourable member for Batman also made another remarkable statement. He said that if there is One article that is absolutely essential to a housewife it is a Suitcase. I should think that if thefe is one article that is indispensable to a housewife it is a wedding ring, and I remind members of the Opposition that Labour imposed a sales tax of 25 per cent, on wedding rings. In his wisdom, the present Treasurer (Mr Fadden) proposes to exempt wedding rings from sales tax. The action taken by a former Labour Administration ih imposing and retaining a sales tax of 25 per Cent, oh wedding rings indicates the nature bf Labour's Concern for the welfare of the ordinary womenfolk of this' Country. It is ali very well for members of the Labour part to advocate more marriages, the encouragement of child birth and so on, but how can they reconcile their attitude with their actions in regard to this tax? I congratulate the Treasurer on his proposal to remove this injustice. The honourable member for Batman attacked the Minister for Air and said that every argument advanced by him had fallen to the ground. In remind the honourable member for Batman that the preceding Labour Government imposed sales tax of 8$ per cent, on builders' nails, notwithstanding that any building without nails would fall to the ground. The proposals contained in this measure are progressive, because nearly all the goods and articles on which sales tax is proposed to be increased are luxury items. The honourable member for Wills (Mr. Bryson) referred to the proposed tax on luxury motor cars, and complained that the Governinent was guilty of inconsistency because it does not propose to increase sales tax on motor car parts. The honourable gentleman did not appear to realise that spare parts will be required principally for old cars, which become increasingly difficult to maintain as they grow older. Undoubtedly what the Treasurer had in mind when he included this proposal in the measure was that a man who buys a new motor car does not ordinarily need to buy parts for replacement for many years. It is only fair, therefore, that the sales tax on spare parts for motor Cars should not be increased. Similarly, the proposal of the Government in regard to the sale of tyres is to be commended. Another anomaly that will be corrected by the passage of this measure concerns the sales tax on trailers purchased for agricultural pursuits. .The anomaly in the existing legislation was first brought to my notice some years ago by a constituent in Kerang who purchased a trailer which had a drawbar to enable it to be towed behind a motor car. The purchaser had to pay sales tax amounting to just under £30 on the trailer. Later he discovered that if he had bought a similar trailer fitted with a pair of shafts it would not have been liable to sales tax. That was a glaring anomaly which constituted a serious injustice, and I ventilated it in the House on several occasions during the last Parliament. The former Prime Minister and Treasurer, who is now Leader of the Opposition (M.T. Chifley), said that his Government would not do anything to rectify the position. In fact, he told me finally that I did not. appear to appreciate that the tax imposed on the sale of such trailers was a sales tax, and that when a person purchased a trailer the tax was calculated according to the value and the condition of the vehicle at the time of sale! It was obvious that the right honourable gentleman was not very much concerned about the effect of the sales tax on primary producers. I represent the great. Sunraysia and Nyah areas in which there are probably more growers of dried fruits than in the whole of the rest of Australia. Those engaged in the dried fruits industry have suffered particularly because of the incidence of sales tax on agricultural machinery, and until the present Government assumed office and introduced this measure it seemed that primary producers generally would continue to suffer. I congratulate the Treasurer on having proposed in this measure to exempt from sales tax trailers for use in the agricultural industry. I do not say that I approve of every proposal contained in the measure. For instance, I should like wireless sets to be exempt from the payment of sales tax because I do not think that they should be regarded as luxury goods. However, I hope that the sales tax on wireless sets will be reduced, if not removed altogether, as soon as possible. The honourable member for Hoddle (Mr Cremean) said that the Government is increasing everything to some degree. I agree with him. It is increasing our defence commitments and is increasing the pensions of ex-servicemen and war widows and, generally, is doing so much for the national good that we must compliment it. The increased services provided by the Government cannot be financed without additional revenue, and in order to obtain sufficient revenue the Government has been obliged to introduce this measure. However, I hope that the proposed increase of sales tax will be only temporary and that the tax will be reduced, if not removed altogether, as soon as the opportunity to do so presents itself. conclusion, I say that the Government should be complimented its decision to exempt so many articles from the payment of sales tax. I am particularly pleased that it proposes to remove sales tax from articles used in house building. Although that proposal Mr Turnbull. may not immediately reduce the cost of house building, I can assure the Government that anything that tends to reduce the cost of house building will be appreciated by the people generally. I support the bill although, as I have already pointed out, I prefer that sales tax on wireless receiving sets should not be increased, and I hope that at the first opportunity it will be reduced. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Fawkner) [10.15] - The bill provides for the exemption of certain items from sales tax. It also increases the rate of sales tax on a number of other items, in some cases from 8$ per cent, to 10 per cent, and in other cases from 8$ per cent, to 25 per cent. In addition, many new items are to be brought by the bill under the operation of sales tax at the hitherto unheard of rate of 33$ per cent. My attitude is that sales tax sbould be abolished altogether.",68
143,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"I agree with the honourable member in that respect. Mr W. M . BOURKE - Then the honourable member for Mallee (Mr. Turnbull) is not giving effect to his agreement with my attitude, because he is now supporting a Government that intends to impose sales tax at the rate of 33$ per cent. Indirect taxation is wrong in principle because taxation should be raised directly on the principle of ability to pay. A man with family responsibilities who earns less than £10 a week should not pay income tax, which should be paid only by people on higher incomes. The rate of income tax should increase in accordance with the level of income. Fields of taxation which could be further exploited by the Government include the big brewing combine of Melbourne, which last September obtained permission to increase the price of beer and promptly proceeded to double its profits, which last year amounted to In more than £500,000. Other fields include big retail stores, furniture stores on and chain stores which are making fabulous profits and which should be paying direct taxation on the principle of ability to pay. Indirect taxes such as sales tax and customs and excise duties are all paid in direct proportion to the consumption by the consumer of the commodities on which they are levied. That means that a man on the basic wage, or a man with a large family, pays the same rate of indirect taxation a unit of consumption as the millionaire or the wealthy bachelor pays. In my opinion that is an inequitable principle. I remember reading an article that was written by Mr John Curtin, who will assuredly go down in history as one of this country's greatest sons. The article was published soon after he became Prime Minister in 1941. In i the stated that the principle which he wholeheartedly supported was that all indirect taxation should be ultimately abolished and that that principle should apply even to protective customs duties. We all support the principle of protection, but, as John Curtin said in that article, in many instances in which customs duties are intended to protect industries in this country, the desired measure of protection could be afforded by way of bounties instead of by way of customs duties. The basis of that contention is that bounties would be paid to manufacturers out of revenue, that is, out of money that would have been raised by direct taxation on the principle of ability to pay, whereas customs duty is indirect taxation and falls upon the consumer in proportion to his consumption of goods. It was interesting to note that in a recent report on the rayon weaving industry the Australian Tariff Board specifically approved of the principle that, in the case of that infant industry, protection should be afforded by a bounty paid out of general revenue rather than through indirect taxation by means of customs duties, which would be passed on to the consumer and would increase the cost of living. I turn now to the list of goods that to be exempt from the operation of sales tax. Honourable members opposite have tried to give to the House and people the impression that the main puractually pose of this bill is to' extend the range exemptions. Actually, although the bill does provide for a number of exemptions, the revenue that would have beeii received from sales tax on the items to be exempted would total only about £1,000,000 in one year, whereas birth-rate. the revenue that will be derived from the imposition or increase of sales tax on other items will be about £10,000,000. In other words, the consumers will have to pay another £10,000,000 in tax that will be passed on in prices and the people will end up poorer to that extent. The list of items that are to be exempted from sales tax, which covers two and a half pages, includes items that concern the constituents  are rather expensive items. The right honourable gentleman has no doubt been anxious to help his constituents and to do what they wish him to do by abolishing sales tax on the following items:-Can e lifts and other machinery, implements or apparatus for use exclusively or primarily and principally in the loading or unloading of sugar cane; fencing wire strainers; stump and tree extractors and grubbers; plants, trees, &c. I agree with the exemption of those items from sales tax, but I should like sales tax to be abolished altogether. Although the Treasurer has been looking after the primary producers and his own supporters the housewives and the community generally will have to find the money to make up the charge from which he is exempting' his supporters. The people who can least afford to pay are to be asked to foot the bill.",70
144,Mr DRUMMOND,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Would the honourable member apply that to houses and to everything in them, because housewives live in houses ? Mr W. M. BOUEKE - There is to be some small relaxation in relation to building materials and there are also to be exemptions in relation to some manufactured food products. I support those exemptions, but they are quite small. The total loss of revenue because of the exemptions, as I have already mentioned, are will be only £1,000,000, whereas the extra tax to be imposed under the measure will raise an additional £10,000,000. the The honourable member for Mallee implied that the Treasurer had of a romantic streak because he had included in the bill provision to remove the sales tax on wedding rings, and implied that some sort of contribution was thereby being made to the encouragement of people to marry and to improve the",71
145,Mr THOMPSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"But the tax is to be put oil engagement rings. Mr ""W. M . BOURKE - That is so. It is about five years since I bought a wedding ring, and if my memory serves me right I paid about 25s. for it. I do not know whether other honourable members have had more recent experience in relation to that matter.",72
146,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SERVICES,"I paid £3 3s. for a wedding ring. Mr W. M. BOURKE - That indicates the rise in the cost of living that occurred between my purchase of a wedding ring and the purchase of one by the honourable member for Fremantle. The honourable member for Mallee did not point out that although the bill provides for the exemption of wedding rings, rings set with gems are not to be exempt. In other words, engagement rings are still to be subject to sales tax, at the iniquitous rate of 33$ per cent.",72
147,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"It has been increased from about 8$ per cent. Mr W. M . BOURKE - Yes , it has been increased considerably. The people who buy engagement rings are in a fairly vulnerable position. They are exploited more and have their sentimental feelings more played upon hy the commercial community in connection with the purchase of engagement rings than is the case in relation to the purchase of any other item. Jewellers who sell engagement rings to young couples intending to be married show them expensive rings in the hope that, because of the presence of the young lady, the man will buy the most expensive ring offered to him. Often the price of such rings is more than young men can afford to pay. A big profit is made on them, and now the Treasurer apparently wants to get his cut by adding 33$ per cent, to the cost of such rings through the imposition of sales tax. If the removal of the sales tax from wedding rings can be held to provide an encouragement for people to get married, then the increase of tax on engagement rings could be held to discourage people from 'becoming engaged. I am sure that young people about to become engaged will make representations to the Treasurer for the removal of the proposed iniquitous impost on the young people of the community. I add my protest to those of other honourable members regarding the imposition of a sales tax of 25 per cent, on wireless receiving sets because the principle of such a tax is very bad. A wireless set is a necessity in every home, and, despite the imposition of the heavy tax, people will still buy wireless sets. However, in future they will have to pay more for them because of the increased tax proposed in the bill. The principle is bad because, in the course of a few years, we shall have television in this country. I hope that there will be a television set in the home of every family. Television will be a necessity, not a luxury, but people on the lower ranges of income will not be able to buy television sets if they are subject to a heavy rate of sales tax. Instead of increasing the rate of sales tax on wireless sets, such sets should be completely exempt because they are a necessity. The argument advanced by Government supporters that the . hill will reduce the incidence of sales tax is not borne out by the fact that the list of items on which a tax of 33$ per cent, is to be levied covers nearly two pages of closely typewritten script. There are only two items in the list that I approve of as suitable for a luxury tax of 33$ per cent. One of them is furs, which is really a luxury item. I notice that luxuries such as imported model frocks, costing 50 guineas and upwards, have not been included in the list of luxury items. Certain other expensive items that might well have been included in the list have been omitted from it, but a number of items which by no stretch of the imagination can be regarded as luxury items have been included in the list. They are items which people will continue to buy, despite the imposition of this extra tax, but they will have to pay more for them. The average housewife likes to indulge occasionally in the . luxury of buying crystal-ware, vases and other ornaments, but those items are to be subject to the iniquitous tax of 33$ per cent. Housewives will, of course, continue to buy them and will have to pay higher prices for them. Other items that are to he subject to the 33$ per cent, impost are necessities like hair brushes and clothing brushes. A stationer who conducts a newsagency stationer's shop told me recently that, in anticipation of the imposition of this sales tax of 33$ per cent, on so-called luxury items, he had stocked up with all the luxury items that he considered would become subject to the tax. He said that not one of those items of luxury stationery is included in the list of items to be subject to 33$ per cent, tax, but that fountain pens and ball-point which he thought would not be included in the category of luxury items, have, in fact, been included, although they are absolutely necessary for every schoolboy and schoolgirl and for tradesmen and shop assistants who are continually writing out receipts. The list of items to be subject to the tax of 33$ per cent, includes handbags, evening bags and purses. Every woman must have a handbag, an evening bag and a purse, and women will continue to buy such articles. I do not think that the object of the Treasurer is to prevent women from buying these things, and to force them to alter their clothing styles so that they will be in same position as men, who have to fossick through a dozen pockets when they want to find any small article they are carrying. A woman must have a handbag in which to keep her make-up kit and other articles. The imposition of this extra tax on the items I have mentioned will fall particularly heavily on the lower-wage section of the community, because the tax is based on consumption and not upon ability to pay. The only other item to which I desire to refer is shopping bags. A lady constituent of mine brought me the shopping bag which I now show to honourable members. Honourable members will see that it is a simple string bag, but apparently the Treasurer regards it a luxury item. If the Treasurer would visit the Prahran market on any Saturday morning he would see bags such as this being carried while shopping by four out of every five housewives. Such bags are used by the women to carry home their vegetables, meat and groceries. This Government has had a lot to say about putting value back into the £1 and about reducing the cost of living, yet it intends to impose a tax of 33$ per cent, on such and a simple and widely used essential as this shopping bag. The Government will increase the cost of these bags by the iniquitous method of increasing sales tax on them. Let us be just in our approach to matters such as this. Bevenue must be raised to carry on the business of the country, but that revenue should be raised by taxation imposed on the just and equitable principle of ability to pay. Let pens, iis reduce all indirect taxation, and for a start let us abolish the sales tax. I suggest that the Treasurer should examine the string shopping bags upon which he intends to impose a 33$ per cent. tax. If , after such an examination, be should decide to lift the tax from these articles he would be making a simple little gesture which would show the housewives of Australia that this Government is at least doing some little thing for their benefit.",72
148,Mr TOM BURKE,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Perth) [10.33] This bill to increase the sales tax has not been warmly welcomed in this House, and it will not be kindly received by the the country. During the last few years of their period in Opposition honourable members of the Government parties showed an increasing hostility towards indirect taxe3 in general and the sales tax in particular. They seemed to feel that indirect taxes were the worse form of taxation. That attitude has been in complete agreement with the attitude of the present Opposition. Throughout the years the Labour party has believed that indirect taxes, particularly sales and pay-roll taxes are the worse of all taxes. They are regressive in their effect and throw a disproportionate burden upon the lower and middle income earners. Because of that effect, and because they tend to raise the cost of living and to involve additional clerical as work on the part of business concerns, it has always been our sincere hope that at some stage the sales tax might be abolished. When honourable members on the Government side were in Opposition, they were loud in their attacks on indirect taxes, yet this bill is now placed before the House. The increase of the sales tax might he justified in some circumstances by the need to raise additional revenue, if might be said that income tax is unpopular because it has an immediate effect upon incomes and therefore this more indirect method of obtaining revenue should be adopted. In this connection I direct the attention of honourable members to the ultimate paragraph of the Treasurer's second-reading speech on the bill. That reads as follows:I commend the hill to honourable members as a measure which will be a material factor I ask honourable members to note these words in the fight against inflation, and also because of its beneficial effects in the removal of anomalies. Perhaps this measure does remove some anomalies, but it certainly creates others. The statement of the right honourable gentleman that the measure will combat inflation is completely fallacious. As the honourable member for Pawkner (Mr. W. M . Bourke) has said, how any one can suggest that a measure which raises about £9,000,000 of additional taxation and increases prices generally by at least that amount can be a major weapon, or indeed a weapon of any sort, in the fight against inflation is diflicult to understand. The Treasurer pointed out that the Government had included in the first sohedule a fairly lengthy list of nontaxable items. He directed attention to the items used in house-building which are now to he exempt from sales tax. The stark fact is that about 99 per cent, of the goods used in house construction were exempted from sales tax by the Curtin and Chifley Governments. The only items used in house construction upon which sales tax remained when this Government took office were materials used in buildings other than house buildings, as well as in house buildings. The effect of anything that this Government has done to remove sales tax from housing materials will never be felt; but the immediate effect of the imposition of new rates upon other commodities will be immediately and sharply felt by the community. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) dealt with some of the items that have been included in the Mr Tom Burke. higher brackets of the sales tax. Many are paltry, and will be vicious in their effect. Por instance, women will not be stopped from using cosmetics by the imposition of a higher rate of tax. I am in substantial agreement with the statement of the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) that women will not be prevented from using cosmetics, but that in the main the wives of the working men and of the men in the middle ranges of income will be penalized because they will have to pay more for what is regarded by most women as an essential. The same remarks may be applied to a whole range of other articles. A sales tax is a completely bad tax. Previous Labour governments have reduced the range of the sales tax, and have exempted a large number of items which were formerly taxed. It is true that the sales tax was first introduced by a Labour government, but that action was taken during a period of crisis, after a worldwide examination had indicated that in such circumstances a sales tax could not be harmful. The right honourable member for Yarra in the last Parliament, Mr. Scullin, informed me that an extensive survey had been made throughout the world with regard to the imposition of the sales tax at that time, and that it had led to the opinion being formed that consumer demand being small and buying power low the tax would have to be borne by the sellers and could not be passed on to consumers. That did not prove to be the case, but it was the considered opinion arrived at upon evidence obtained at that time. In any case the Government of that day, having followed a non-Labour government, was at its wits' end to know how to meet the situation that existed at that time. This Government is quite unwilling to face up to the situation that exists now. At present the incomes of the community are very high and goods are in short supply. Supply is not short in relation to what was regarded before the war as the normal demand, but because of the large volume of purchasing power supply is short in relation to the demand caused by that purchasing power. That situation clearly calls for some action whether it be tax legislation, loan measures, distribution control, or some other such proposal by which either purchasing power can be drawn off, or control can be instituted to ensure that the limited volume of goods now available will go to those who need them most, and not to those who can pay the most for them. However, this Government, in accordance with the pattern that it has followed since it assumed office, has sought the easy course and has refused to take the only measures that can meet the present situation. The items affected by this measure are set out in detail in the various memorandums that have been circulated. In dealing with those items it is important to realise that the sales tax, like all indirect taxes, is not borne hy the original buyer of the goods. In 99 cases out of 100, the sales tax, in common with other costs and charges, is passed on to the public. Motor cars provide an illustration. Only on motor cars used solely for private purposes is the sales tax borne entirely by the original purchaser. The sales tax payable on vehicles used for business or professional pnrposes is, of course, passed on to the public in the form of higher charges for goods provided and services rendered. Therefore, the new imposts on motor vehicles will find their way into the prices of commodities and will ultimately tend to increase rather than decrease costs. The Treasurer has sought some psychologieal support by abolishing the sales tax on ice. I remind the House that the tax was first imposed on ice by a government of the same political colour as the present Administration. In fact, if my memory be correct, it was imposed in 1940 when the present Treasurer first introduced the classified sales tax system. He was urged then to abandon the pror posal to impose sales tax on ice for obvious reasons, and I have no doubt that those are the very reasons that have prompted him to remove the tax today. While we all are grateful that the sales tax on ice i9 now to be abolished, I point out that ice is not such an important household commodity now as it was in those days. To-day, refrigerators are in much more general use, not only in the households of persons in the higher income brackets, but also in those of working people. Therefore, even this concession will not achieve very much either as assistance to the housewife, or as a means of pushing down the cost of living. The Treasurer's move to place a lengthy list of items into the 33$ per cent, sales tax classification is a retrograde one. As the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr W. M . Bourke) has pointed out, this move will not prevent the sale of those commodities. It will not have that effect, even on costly items such as furs. The volume of money in the community today is such that people who normally purchase those goods will continue to do so. They will not consider themselves obliged to cut their spending and to invest in government bonds or securities.",73
149,Mr TKELOAR,SOCIAL SERVICES,They will have to put more money into the Treasury.,75
150,Mr TOM BURKE,SOCIAL SERVICES,"That is the only effect that the increased impost will have. It will not prevent the purchase of luxury lines which the Treasurer claims to be one of the prime purposes of this measure. Therefore it will not reduce the amount of money in circulation. Instead, it will merely increase prices. Generally speaking, the measure is in direct conflict with all the statements that the Treasurer himself has made during the last six or seven years. It is certainly in conflict with all the promises that were given to the people during the last general election campaign by the present Government parties. It will not curb inflation. In fact, it will have the opposite effect. The Opposition will not oppose the bill because the Government must have the revenue that it seeks. We merely point out to the people of Australia that, once again, the Government is proving that its faith is bad. Honourable members opposite are showing clearly that whereas on the hustings, they are prepared to say anything that is calculated to gain support in the electorate, having been returned to office election promises mean nothing to them. The Government is willing to go back on every promise that it made, and even to do exactly the reverse of what it promised to do. We point these things out to the people now and we shall point them out in the electorate. We believe that the people, having been deceived by this Government, will be ready and willing to make a change when an appeal is made to them.",75
151,Mr THOMPSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Port Adelaide) [10.47] - This measure shows clearly to the people of Australia that what the anti-Labour parties say when they are in opposition is no guide to what they will do should they be returned to office. Since I have been a member of this chamber, many sales tas measures have come before us for consideration but this is the first one that has increased the tax. Clearly the objections that honourable members opposite raised to the sales tax when they were in opposition were not sincere. The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull) mentioned the necessity to raise funds for defence purposes, and the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Treloar) said by way of interjection when the honourable member for Perth (Mr Tom Burke) was speaking, that the increased sales tax would bring more money into the Treasury. It is interesting to note what the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) said in his budget speech on this subject. He saidA comprehensive review has been made of the sales tax law. As a result, it is proposed to remove certain anomalies and assist housing construction by removing the tax from such items of building requisites as etill remain in the taxable field. The most notable item in this category is builders' hardware. Certain foodstuffs are also .being removed from the taxable field. Judging by the way in which the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Eggins) spoke, one would think that the Treasurer had made a substantial reduction of the sales tax on building materials. Whilst I commend the Government for its decision to remove sales tax from many classes of building materials, the relief that will be afforded by that means will not be so great as the honourable member for Lyne suggested that it would be. The Treasurer in his budget speech saidThe most notable item in this category is builders' hardware. Certain foodstuffs are also being removed from the taxable field. Kull details of these exempted items will be given when legislation to effect the changes is introduced later today. The loss of revenue in a full year will approximate £1,000,000 and in the current year approximate £040,000. It is proposed to increase the rate of sales tax on certain goods, the manufacture and sale of which are considered to cause inordinate competition for materials in short supply and skilled man-power.",76
152,Mr TRELOAR,SOCIAL SERVICES,They are very sound reasons.,76
153,Mr THOMPSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"I agree. The Treasurer continuedI t is hoped that the discouragement of the higher rates will check, to some extent, the growth of this competition for materials and man-power which could be better employed in the production of more essential goods. I'hat statement implies that the Government has introduced this measure for the purpose not of raising revenue but primarily of directing man-power and materials used in the manufacture of non-essential goods to the manufacture of essential goods. The Treasurer addedThe additional revenue which it is expected will be obtained as a result will be about £10,000,000 in a full year, OT approximately £7,500,000 in the current year. The goods affected will be enumerated in legislation to be introduced lated today. I commend the Government for its decision to remove the sales tax on ice. A considerable time ago, when the Chifley Government was in office, I urged that relief be provided in that way to poorer sections of the community who cannot afford to purchase refrigerators.",76
154,Mr HAMILTON,SOCIAL SERVICES,Sale s tax is to be removed from most classes of building materials.,76
155,Mr THOMPSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"But the Chifley Government removed sales tax from 90 per cent, of building materials. Upon perusing the amendments that the Treasurer' circulated this evening, I learned with regret that he had not acceded to my request to remove sales tax from cane baskets. I am not concerned about the increase of sales tax on such articles as face powders, hair oil, lipsticks and cosmetics generally. Persons who use those articles can speak for themselves with respect to the Government's proposal to increase sales tax on them. However, the Government has made a mistake in increasing the sales tax from 8$ per cent, to 33$ per cent, on cane baskets, including clothes baskets, in the manufacture of which blind people are specially trained and, in the main, earn their livelihood. That proposal will do a grave injustice to that section of the community. I again appeal to the Treasurer to reconsider my request to exempt such articles from .salestax. I do not know what the practice is in other States, but in South Australia it has heen customary to train blind people in wicker work. A blind man who has set up in business has told me that he is afraid that any increase of the selling price of wickerware as a result of an increase of the sales tax will make it very difficult for him to carry on his business successfully. I do not think that any honourable member would suggest that clothes baskets which are generally used by housewives are luxury articles or that blind people who are engaged in their manufacture can be usefully diverted to other work. At present, the price of baskets of the kind that are usually made by blind persons for 12s., on which sales tax is levied at the rate of 8$ per cent., amounting to Is., makes the price to the retailer 13s. Assuming that the latter added 25 per cent., or 3s. 3d., to that cost, the cost the basket to the customer would be 16s. 3d. Under the proposal to increase the sales tax on cane baskets to 33$ per cent., which represents an - increase of over 300 per cent, on the existing rate, the cost of such a basket to the retailer will be increased from 13s. to 16s. As the retailer fixes his margin not on the net but on the gross price that he pays to the wholesaler the retail price of these baskets will be increased from 16s. 3d. to £1. In many instances, however, retailers allow themselves a margin in excess of 25 I repeat that the proposal to increase the sales tax on wicker baskets will seriously affect blind people who engage in their manufacture. Therefore, I again appeal to the Treasurer to remove sales tax from such articles. Generally speaking, cane baskets are not widely used. In South Australia most of these baskets are made either by the Royal Institute for the Blind or by blind persons who have learned basket weaving at the institute. I make an - earnest appeal to the Government not to make it more difiicult for them to sell their wares. I could say a good deal about the principle of indirect taxation, but I do not propose to do so to-night. I content myself with saying that whilst I do not like indirect taxation it is in certain circumstances a proper form of taxation for a government to impose and that those who can afford to buy luxury articles should be prepared to contribute to the revenues ""of the Commonwealth. In framing its sales tax legislation the Government should give the most sympathetic consideration to the exemption of goods that are manufactured or processed largely by blind and other disabled persons. If the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) has not yet made a final decision I ask him even at this late hour to exempt from sales tax cane and wicker baskets even though that might cause a benefit to be derived by a few persons other than those on whose behalf I have made thi9 plea. I regret that the Government considers necessary an increase of the sales tax on any item, but I trust that, in the interests of the very deserving section of the community to which I have referred, the Treasurer will see his way clear to exempt of cane and wicker baskets from the tax.",76
156,Mr DALY,SOCIAL SERVICES,"iGrayndler) [11.1] - The more legislation the present Government introduces the keener student do I become of the policy which the Liberal and Australian Country parties announce to the people during the last general election campaign. Certain aspects of this bill have caused me to re-study the policy of those parties in relation to indirect taxation. In a little publication entitled Financial Policy of ihe Australian Country Party appears, among other statements, this statement per cent - by the present TreasurerIf the socialists are defeated their rates of taxation, both direct and indirect, can and - will be steadily reduced. A study of Hansard will reveal that on the 31st May, 1949, at page 335, the present Treasurer is reported to have saidIn view of the tremendous increase of indirect tax receipts since the Treasurer assumed office, and the resultant increase of the cost of living, it is high time the Government, in fairness to Australia, substantially reduced indirect taxation. Tho Minister for Immigration (Mr. Holt) is also reported to have saidSales tax has an important effect on the cost of living. It s existence is one of reasons why costs have reached a point which, according to an article in the Sydney Horning Herald of the 10th September, 1949, tlic purchasing power of the £1 in comparison with, its purchasing power in 1939 is only approximately 12s. Speaking on the budget in this House the 15th September, 1949, the present Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Spender) is reported in Hansard to have saidThere was a Prime Minister of England, think it was Pitt, who said a long time that the power of imposing indirect taxes guve power to the government to tax the shirt off the back of the worker. The legislation now before us has reached the degree of severity contemplated  joint policy of the Liberal party the Australian Country party were promises to put value back into the and to reduce direct and indirect taxes. We all remember the occasion when present Treasurer, referring to the sales tax imposed by the Chifley - Government, made this historic utterance: "" As you drink your tea you must remember that 50 per cent, of its cost is going to Chifley. As you smoke a cigarette drink your glass of beer approximately 50 per cent, of the cost goes to the Treasury in sales tax."" I wonder whether as the sweet young ladies today put on their eye shadow they realise the presence of another shadow nearby-the surer-wh o dips his hands into their purses and takes 33$ per cent, of the cost power. ui sales tax. I wonder whether young women of the community as they adorn themselves attractively realise that ing nearby is the Treasurer who with bland smile takes from them 33$ per cent, of the price which they have paid for cosmetics. This bill represents a classic example of the manner in which the Governothers ment has somersaulted on its promise reduce taxes and to bring down the cost of living. This bill is a clear indication to the people that the Government has no intention to reduce taxes, either direct or indirect. On the contrary, this Governto or. Daly. ment, which is committed to a policy of reducing indirect taxation, has increased the sales tax per capita from £5 5s. 5d. to the £6 19s. I d . TJnder the administration at of this Government the average cost of indirect taxes to the average Australian family of four has been increased in the ten months from £21 to £28. An analysis of the overall indirect taxes on imposed by this Government and by the Chifley Government reveals that whereas under the Chifley Government the per capita annual amount was £23 2s. lOd. or £93 for each family unit, after ten I months of office of this Government, notago withstanding that it was committed to a policy of reduction, the per capita amount has been increased to £26 10s. and the cost to the family unit has been increased to £106. What a remarkable back out by on the part of a government which is committed to the reduction of indirect and taxes! This Government has adopted the the strangest policy of which I have £1 ever heard. I do not profess to he an economist or an accountant, but I have the yet to learn how any government can put value back into the £1 by an all-round increase of sales tax on the ordinary necessaries of life. The Government's extraordinary policy is exemplified in the Ben. legislation now before us under which or if proposes to exact a further toll from the poorer sections of the community simply because it is not courageous enough to place the burden of taxation on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. Instead, it proposes to extract more tax Treafrom those who cannot afford any further diminution of their purchasing This legislation not only affects indistandviduals as I have indicated but also a threatens certain long established industries. I represent in this Parliament a their very large constituency in which numerous Australian manufacturing industries have been established. I have received from leather manufacturers and bitter protests against this legisto lation. Some interestingfigureshave heen presented to me by the radio manufacturers to show how adversely it will affect that industry. A radio cannot be regarded as a luxury. I ask those who are listening me to-night, be they poor or rich, whetlier, next to the provision of furniture and the ordinary requirements for eating and sleeping a radio is not an tial amenity in the home of all citizens to enable them to hear the news of the world, to take an intelligent interest in the ordinary happenings of our national life and, above all, to hear the debates in this National Parliament, particularly the speeches by members of the Labour party, who enlighten them on the real problems of the country, and on the attitude of this Government to their welfare. The radio manufacturing industry will be vitally affected by this bill. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), who led the debate on it this afternoon on behalf of the Opposition, stated that an attempt was being made by the Government to introduce a measure of man-power oontrol; that by compelling, some industries to close, it will direct their employees into other industries. Such a form of manpower control was not visualized when the present Government submitted its policy to the people during the last general election campaign. The Treasurer has admitted in his second-reading speech on this bill that the Government seeks to close luxury industries. That statement, in itself, is an indication that the Government is in favour of man-power oontrol, and will endeavour to direct workers to industries in which they may not wish to work, but in which the Government considers that they should be employed. An attack is made in this bill on the great radio manufacturing industry which, in the year ended the 30th June, 1949, produced approximately 293,000 radio sets, which was considerably fewer than in the previous year. That reduction in itself showed that the lag in manufacture during ""World War II . bad been substantially overtaken. The average cost of radio receivers in the same year was £27, on which sales tax of £1 4s. was payable. Honourable members may not be aware that when the rate on radio receivers was 8$ per cent., the total receipts of sales tax from that source for the twelve months ended the 12th October last was £350,000. The present Government, although it is committed to a policy of safeguarding the interests and the welfare of the poorer sections essenof the community, proposes to increase the sales tax on radio receivers to 25 per cent. That figure, in the language of the ordinary man, is 5s. in the £1. A radio receiver that costs £20 will be subject to sales tax amounting to £5. Is that an instance of the manner in which this Government reduces indirect taxation? The increase of the sales tax on radio receivers is estimated to yield £1,051,932, or an increase of £701,288 under this budget, for the current financial year. No other section of industry will be hit so heavily by sales tax as the radio manufacturing industry will be. I wonder whether the Treasurer has considered the effects that his proposal will have on it? I remind him that one female is employed in it for every two males, and that the new basic wage will increase the basic production costs by 25 per cent. The over-all increase, including, sales tax, will be 40 per cent. In other words, every person who purchases a radio set will be obliged to pay an additional 8s. in the £1 for the privilege of possessing an instrument that has come to be regarded as a necessity in every Australian home. The Treasurer budgeted to collect approximately £3 12s. from the sale of each radio receiver, but as a result of the various increases to which I referred a few moments ago, he will actually receive sales tax amounting to £4 10B. on each instrument. The Government will impose that additional burden on the worker, who has no income other than his weekly wage, and on other citizens for the purpose of raking in a few extra £l's in taxation. I also find that the increase of sales tax on radio receivers will have the effect of increasing the percentage of turnover in this industry that is taken by specific taxes from 6 per cent, to 14 per cent, or, in other words, from £551,000 to £1,300,000. An almost intolerable burden will be placed in that way on the radio manufacturing industry, simply because the Government is endeavouring to divert men from it to other industries. At the same time, an additional financial burden will be imposed on every purchaser of a radio receiver. I believe that the Government's sales tax proposals inflict a burden on other industries, though possibly not to the same degree as on the radio manufacturing industry. I could cite the effect of the impost on the leather industry and on other industries, but the limited time available to me prevents me from doing so. Much depends on the radio industry in peace-time, but its importance is enhanced in war-time, when it preserves our communications, and renders valuable assistance to the Royal Australian Navy, the Army and the Royal Australian Air Force. During World War II . , the armed forces depended to a substantial degree on the advances that had been made by the radio manufacturing industry in peace-time. General MACArthur is reported to have stated that, had it not been for the valuable assistance rendered by the electrical industry of Australia and the telecommunications sectionthe radio manufacturers-in particular, the war in the Pacific might conceivably have been lost, and most certainly would have been prolonged for some years. That statement is sufficient proof that much depends in war-time on the efficiency of radio communication. Thousands of Australians who are engaged in the radio manufacturing industry will be indirectly forced by this Government to work in other industries simply because it considers that they are engaged in work which, in peace-time, is not essential. Mr Warner, of Melbourne, a well-known member of the Liberal party",77
157,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,He was a member in the former Liberal Government Victoria.,80
158,Mr DALY,SOCIAL SERVICES,"That is so. This company has taken the trouble to write to me, a member of the Labour party, about the proposal to increase the sales tax on radio receivers. Such action shows how deeply he must have heen moved by the Treasurer's decision in that respect. He wrote a business letter to me on that matter, in the course of which he saidLast Thursday must, indeed, go down history of radio in this country as "" Black Thursday"". The staggering increase of tas from 84 per cent, to 25 per cent., coming, a» it did, on to.p of the wage increases announced earlier in the day by the Full Arbitration Court, must inevitably mean an increase in the price of radio receivers by 33J per cent. I have pointed out that this Government has somersaulted on its policy of reducing taxation. It is prepared not only ro sacrifice the individual's standard of living, but also to attack the general welfare of great Australian industries. This bill provides a further indication, if such is needed, of the complete insincerity of the present Treasurer, and is a complete negation of the policy enunciated by this Government from time to time to the effect that Australian industries and the purchasing power of the people would be protected. I shall oppose vigorously those provisions which increase the sales tax on various items, including radio receivers that are considered by the Government to be luxuries. It is a clear indication that the Government is prepared to sacrifice all and sundry in the interests of a small section of the people, and in preference to calling upon those in the best position to bear the burden of taxation, to accept that responsibility.",80
159,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Fremantle) [11.18] There is not much point in labouring the fact that has already been made quite clear by Opposition members that this bill represents a repudiation of the impression of policy which the present Government, when in Opposition, studiously sought to convey to the Australian people as its views. No justification whatever exists for increasing the sales tax-a n indirect tax-whe n the budget reduces income tax- a direct tax-by £7,000,000 in for the current financial year. After all, income tax is scientifically graded according to ability to pay. Eightly or wrongly, the Government decided that it must greatly increase expenditure, and having done so it had no right to reduce scientifically graded income tax and substitute for it the sales tax provisions contained in the measure now before the House. When this matter was first mentioned, the Sydney Daily Telegraph contained a splashing heading, "" Seven in the Million pounds cut in taxation"", but it was a £7,000,000 cut in income tax. The £7,000,000 cut in income tax will be more than compensated for by the £10,000,000 return to the Government from additional sales tax. The fallacy underlying the Government's plans concerning this matter is easy to expose. For some reason or other, the Government has considered it necessary to pretend that every taxation measure introduced by it has an anti-inflationary effect. Inflation, by definition, is a condition of rising prices. Inescapably, sales tax causes prices to rise further, so how it can be honestly maintained by anybody that sales tax is anti-inflationary is more than I can fathom. I recognize that the pretence is that the taxation, if it is directed at luxury indusfor tries, will discourage people from spending money on luxury goods, and that therefore it will have an anti-inflationary effect. But that it not a true statement. If a wealthy lady does not spend £300 on furs, she will spend it on something else. If it is decided to strike a blow at inflation, one taxes luxury incomes, not luxury goods. By direct taxation surplus earning power is skimmed off. I should like the Treasurer (Mr. Fadden) to explain the reason for his violent prejudice against musical instrube ments. Listed in this measure there are at least 100 musical instruments on wh'ich increased sales tax is to be imposed. Some of them, I appreciate, are instruments that are somewhat of a joke, but others not. The Government has declared that gramophone records are a luxury. I are deny that, and I also deny that the people who buy them are earners of luxury form incomes. Some people spend on books whatever money they have above their needs; others spend it on music. The purchase of those articles has much more bearing on taste than upon income. Some wealthy people spend nothing whatever on musical instruments, and I maintain that by taxing those instruments the Government is not hitting at wealthy incomes as It claims to be doing. The tax on musical instruments is a savage discrimination against a particular industry. Certain musical houses, such as Musgrove's Limited and Nicholson's Limited in Perth, sell every type of musical instrument, and this measure means that the type of business in which they are engaged has been singled out for an unprecedented battery of sales tax at the maximum level of 33$ per cent. The whole musical industry is struck at in that manner, and I consider that the measure is extremely savage in its attack. I wish to support the remarks of the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr. Thompson) to the effect that the making of baskets and wickerwork in every State of the Commonwealth is an industry almost wholly specialized in by the hlind. I am not suggesting that there are not other people engaged in the industry, but it is a well-known fact that all schools the blind and the industries actually run by the blind concentrate on the manufacture of those articles. They, also, are singled out for a very savage increase of sales tax. Supporters of this Government, when in Opposition, rightly attacked the Labour Government for retaining sales tax. Everybody recognizes that no valid case can he made out for the maintenance of any kind of sales tax whatever. There is no sound economic principle involved in taxing a sale, and no sound result can achieved by it. Where there is redistribution of income by means of a graded income tax, there is no principle whatever in taxing a sale, and it is quite obvious that such action has certain vicious arc effects. People with larger families tend to buy more of certain goods that subject to taxation, so that the effect of sales tax, like that of any other of indirect taxation, is anti-social. However, having been a supporter of governments that maintained sales tax. I do not consider that I am in a position to criticize the present Government because it maintains sales tax. But I de criticize it for having declared that it did not believe in sales tax and then increasing it, and also for its unsound claim that the measure that it has introduced has an anti-inflationary effect. If the members of the Government had said, ""We must obtain money and this is a popular way of getting it, because by and large people can see the difference in their pay envelopes if income tax is increased, but they have become used to. rising prices, and this method will obtain for us the necessary money relatively painlessly "". At least that would have been politically honest. In the face of promises to reduce taxation, which cannot be honoured, the Government now proposes to increase taxation by an indirect method, while pretending to reduce taxation. If the Treasurer had stated that there would be no reduction in income tax because the Government, on coming into office, had found that, in consequence of increased expenditure,' such as the £50,000,000 for stock piling and other non-recurring items, it could not give effect to the promises previously made, it would have been a courageous stand. But the Government wished to maintain a pretence of reducing taxes while adding this indiscriminate increase of sales tax, and, at the same time, making the dishonest claim that the effect of the tax would be anti-inflationary. It knows that the effect will be exactly the reverse.",80
160,Mr OSBORNE,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Evans) [11.26] Having listened to the dissertation on political honesty delivered by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) I feel compelled to protest against the patent insincerity of one after another honourable member of the Opposition. I have no desire to add to the discussion on this matter, but I think that it is right that some answer should be given to the insincere speeches to which we have listened during the last two hours. As the basis of the Opposition's objection to the bill before the House appears to be a charge that the Government is inconsistent in bringing forward this measure, because, when its supporters were in opposition, they had opposed the previous Government's sales tax policy, I point out that the Opposition is open to exactly the same charge. It also introduced such a measure when it was in office. This searching of past records, and seeking to criticize the Government on the basis of inconsistency, gets the Opposition nowhere. The second point which plainly demonstrates the insincerity of the Opposition towards this measure is the ingenious suggestion put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), that involved in this legislation is some dangerous degree of industrial conscription. A more nonsensical suggestion could hardly be made. May I remind the House that the suggestion arises in this way. The Treasurer (Mr Eadden), in introducing this bill, stated that the Government had considered the desirability of measures designed to decrease the demand for goods that may the classified as of a less essential character at times such as the country is experiencing at present. On that basis, the honourable member for Melbourne has produced the extraordinary theory that the measure involves industrial conscription, and that theory has been adopted by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly). When we consider the attitude of mind of the supporters of the last Government and the very real threat of industrial conscription which they held out, that argument is placed in its right perspective. I remind the House that the present Leader of the Opposition informed his listeners at an industrial meeting in Sydney that they must be prepared to accept a degree of industrial conscription, or direction of man-power. Now his supporters have the effrontery to declare in this House that this measure involves a dangerous degree of industrial conscription. The suggestion is absolutely nonsensical. No taxation measures of any sort are popular, and no government expects them to be popular. But this is an essential measure. In the first place, it will remove a number of anomalies and patent misplacements of sales tax imposts. It will remove the tax from building materials and certain foodstuffs. The Opposition has chosen to overlook that fact entirely and has concentrated its criticisms upon the proposed additional tax on such items as cosmetics. The honourable member for Melbourne made the astounding and interestins; suggestion that this was an obviously man-ridden Government which was determined to attack the housewife. The suggestion will be received with the seriousness with which, I am sure, it was made. It is plain that the increased cost of cosmetics which will result from the additional tax will reduce the demand for cosmetics.",82
161,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SERVICES,The honourable member is an optimist.,83
162,Mr OSBORNE,SOCIAL SERVICES,"There can be no doubt that any increase of the price of a particular class of goods must cause a reduction of the demand for such goods. That must be obvious to the honourable member. The general lines of the measure are necessary and reasonable and should be supported by the House. It is in the nature of financial measures of this sort that they must be prepared in secret without any prior open debate. Therefore, they should be subjected to review at the earliest possible opportunity. I submit to the Treasurer two suggestions which have been made to me by constituents for a revision of two provisions of the bill. One suggestion relates to the increased tax on handbags. A constituent has argued that handbags are not luxury goods but are, in most instances, necessities. I hope that the Treasurer will give consideration to that item at the first opportunity. The other suggestion relates to silver-plated and other plated articles of a utilitarian nature. It is claimed that they are ordinary necessities and that their inclusion in the tax schedule should be re-considered. Basketware articles made by blind persons fall within the same category, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Thompson) has said. I hope the Treasurer will give serious consideration to these requests. This measure will remove sales tax anomalies. It provides for a sensible and helpful direction of purchasing power towards essential articles and away from unessential articles. Finally, it will assist to raise the additional revenue that the Government is forced to seek in order to finance its defence programme. On those grounds, it merits the support of the House.",83
163,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"MCPherson-Treasurer ) [11.35] - in reply- I shall not allow the Opposition to get away with the claim, which it has consistently made, that I , on behalf of the Australian Country party, and the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) on behalf of the Liberal party, made any extravagant promises about the reduction of direct or indirect taxes during the last general election campaign. This is what I said on the subject in my policy speechOur policy is a progressive reduction of taxation on individuals and the community in general, commensurate - with national economic and nnancial policy. I also saidWe promise .that a competent review will also be made of the incidence of indirect taxation, because we recognize the necessity for sensible reduction in the many cases where such reductions will arrest the upward trend of living costs. I remind the House that I persistently directed attention to the serious anomalies that existed in the sales tax law throughout the period of Labour administration. But my representations were ignored, and it was left for this Government to remove them at the first available opportunity. One. member of the Opposition has said that building materials had been exempted from sales tax by the Chifley Government to the greatest possible degree and that little further could be done by means of sales tax concessions to encourage building. I direct the attention of honourable members to the numerous items which were subjected to sales tax under the Labour Administration but which this Government has decided to exempt. My list is as follows:Builders' hardware (not including electrical fittings, accessories or equipment), being goods of a kind used in the construction or repair of, and wrought into or attached to so as to form part of, buildings or other fixtures, includingBolts, brackets, brads Catches, ceiling ties, clips, clouts, corrugated fasteners Decking spikes, door bells, door handles, door knockers, door sheaves and tracks, door stops and stoppers, door and cupboard catches, door and gate springs, drawer pulls, dryvins Flush rings Gate loops Hasps, hinges, hooks, hooks and eyes, house numbers Knobs Latches, letter boxes, letter plates, locks, locksets and keys there for, loxins Metal frames for the support of wash basins Nails, name plates, nuts Padbolts, panel pins Rivets Staples, screws, scruins Washers. Metal window frames and sashes, metal fanlight frames and sashes, metal window screens, metal louvre frames and shutters, metal doors and door frames, of a kind used in the construction or repair of, and wrought into or attached to, so as to form part of, buildings or other fixtures. Materials of a kind used exclusively marily and principally as ingredients of concrete or of cement, mortar or plaster mixtures. For eight years the Labour Administration, left that field untouched. The honourable member for Perth (Mr. Tom Burke) and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) waxed very enthusiastic about their opposition to indirect taxes in general. I remind them that they actively supported a government which, in season and out of season, exploited indirect taxes very effectively in order to supplement its revenue. They continued to do so whole-heartedly throughout the period when that Government took advantage of every opportunity to reduce direct taxes in order to win the support of the taxpayers. It is all very well for them to pretend now that the Labour party is eager to reduce the burden of indirect taxes. They advocate that this Government should adopt a policy of increasing direct taxes in preference to one of increasing indirect taxes, although that would be the reverse of the policy that was adopted by the Labour party when it was in power. Having heard the speeches made by honourable gentlemen opposite in the course of this debate, one could be pardoned for believing that the Labour party had never been in power in this country and had never had an opportunity to do what they have advocated to-night in connection with sales tax. Their speeches would lead an undiscerning person to believe that conditions in this country have not altered materially since the 'Chifley Government was in power and that a responsibility has not been cast upon this Government which has made a national stocktaking necessary, not only in relation to our national obligations but also in relation to our international obligations. Since the last general election, the position of this country has altered in many respects. The world situation and our international responsibilities have given rise to an extraordinary set of conditions which has made it necessary for this Government, in the interests of the defence of Australia and the discharge of our obligations Ifr. Fadden. to our allies, to prepare a vigorous defence programme that will involve us in an additional expenditure of nearly or pri- £80,000,000. The financial position of this country has been altered very materially by circumstances over which, in many instances, we have no control, but which the Government has had to face in the interests of the welfare of Australia. We were faced with a man-power shortage. We were told that we had inherited a policy of full employment. We had done so, hut it was a policy of a kind that did hot make the best possible use of available labour. We found that our basic industries, which are necessary for the financial stability and safety of this country, were short of man-power. We have had to import coal, steel and cement to meet the requirements of the vigorous immigration policy that we have inherited, the developmental programme that we desire to implement, and the defence programme that we have had to formulate to enable us to discharge our international responsibilities. It is for those reasons, among others, that we have been forced to increase the rate of sales tax in certain respects. We are anxious that the resources of this country shall he used to the greatest possible advantage. We appointed an interdepartmental committee and a sub-committee of Cabinet to review the incidence of the tax in an endeavour to ascertain how we could make the best possible use of the very meagre man-power resources that are available in this country. We have had to do something that is not very pleasant, because no government enjoys increasing taxes. I remind honourable gentlemen who have criticized what the Government has done in connection with sales tax that the circumstances in which we find ourselves now are entirely different from the circumstances that existed when the Labour party was in power. Because the country was at war, Labour governments were able to control man-power, prices and other things, and to continue those controls after the war had terminated, when revenue was buoyant. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) has said that this Government has brought back into the taxable field articles that were exempted from tax by the previous government. That statement is absolutely untrue. No article previously exempted from tax is now subject to tax. The honourable gentleman advanced the ridiculous argument that this Government, because it is endeavouring to encourage the proper utilization our resources in accordance with degrees of priority, is following a policy of industrial conscription. That statement is entirely illogical. The Government is endeavouring to ensure that the production of essential articles shall receive priority. The only inference to be drawn from the speech made by the honourable member for Perth is that an increase of the rate of sales tax imposed .upon some articles to 33-J per cent, is not enough. The honourable gentleman said that the increase of tax proposed by the Government would not achieve its objective, because the people of this country had plenty of money and, therefore, would buy the goods that they want. According to the honourable gentleman's argument, the rate of tax should be increased to perhaps 50 per cent, to aehieve the objective that the Government has set out to achieve. The cultured gentleman from Fremantle asked us to believe that the Government is interfering with the cultural life of this country. I remind him that the Labour party, when it was in power, imposed sales tax upon musical instruments at the rate of 25 per cent. Mr OALWEM. - That was four years ago.",83
164,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Accordin g to the honourable member for Melbourne, time does not count as far as the Labour party is concerned, but time does count and circumstances do not matter as far as this Government is concerned. I remind honourable gentlemen opposite that the Chifley Government imposed a 25 per cent, sales tax upon wicker products produced by blind workers. I was struck by the argument presented by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr. Thompson) in connection with those products, and I examined the whole matter of the imposition of sales tax upon articles produced by blind workers. I LOO] wondered why the Government with which the honourable gentleman was associated had imposed a 25 per cent, sales tax upon those articles, and why it left them subject to a tax of 8-J per cent, after it had reduced sales tax generally at a time when revenue was buoyant. of The same reasons that influenced the previous Government to retain the tax have convinced the present Administration of the need for retaining it. It has been contended that the operation of the tax will affect the business of those unfortunate blind people who are engaged in the wickerwork industry. Those representations have been sympathetically considered, but whilst the Government is in full sympathy with blind industrial workers it considers that it would be impracticable to give to them the benefit of an exemption from sales tax on the goods which they manufacture. In any event, it should be borne in mind that sales tax is paid, not by those who produce goods for sale, but by those who purchase the goods. It follows, therefore, that a continuance of the tax on wicker work manufactured by blind people would not affect the interests of the blind people who manufacture the goods. In other words, the considerations which impel the present Government to continue the tax are the same as those which influenced the previous Government to retain it. Members of the Opposition, who endeavoured to woo the wool-growers, and, generally, to behave towards them as the little lamb did towards Mary, are now endeavouring to ingratiate themselves with the women of this country by protesting very loudly against the proposed increase of sales tax on cosmetics. After listening to their protests, one would imagine that Labour had never imposed a sales tax on cosmetics. ""What are the facts? During the most buoyant period of revenue in our history, a Labour administration imposed a sales tax of 25 per cent, on cosmetics. After all, the increase of 8-J per cent, proposed by the present Government will amount to only Id . more for each ls. of the price of beauty preparations. The only appreciable effect that the increased tax will have on users of cosmetics will be that those who purchase the higher priced preparations will have to pay a little more for them. The attempt made hy members of the Opposition to make political capital out of the proposed increase is ridiculous. The honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) said something about the tax charged on the sale of station wagons. He was incorrect in stating that primary producers are entitled to purchase such vehicles without paying sales tax. A sales tax of 10 per cent, has to be paid on all such vehicles purchased by primary producers and other persons. However, Land Rovers are exempt from the payment of sales tax when they are purchased by primary producers. The reason for this exemption is that they come within the general category of exemption from sales tax of machinery used primarily for agricultural purposes. Whilst Land Rovers fall within that category, station wagons do not do so. I shall not detain the House much longer. Because of the nature of sales tax it is inevitable that differences of opinion will arise about the incidence of it. I point out, however, that the Government did not prepare its proposals in an arbitrary or slipshod manner, but only after thorough consideration by a departmental committee and by a subcommittee of Cabinet. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: - Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4 (First Schedule).",85
165,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Melbourne) [11.55]. - The Government proposes to exempt certain goods set out in the First Schedule to the principal act from the payment of sales tax, as the result of which £1,000,000 less will he collected from sales tax during a full financial year. However, I remind the Government that reductions of sales tax introduced by the Chifley Administration represented a saving to the people of Australia of £35,000,000 in a complete financial year. Let me put it in another way. If Labour had not reduced sales tax to the extent to which it did, the people * of Australia would be paying £35,000,000 more in sales tax than they are paying at present. Furthermore, if present values were applied to the goods which we exempted from the payment of sales tax, the saving to the people would be approximately £50,000,000. Fancy honourable members opposite talking about the largesse that they are distributing! Their present proposal will save the people of Australia only one-thirty-fifth of the amount saved them by a Labour government. Paragraph (x) of this clause proposes to remit sales tax on electrical fittings, accessories and electrical materials, but many kinds of apparatus will not be included in that exemption. For instance, sales tax on Neon signs is to continue at the present rate of 8$ per cent., which the previous Labour Government imposed. I mention this matter of Neon signs because I suggest to the Treasurer (Mr Fadden) that if the Government really wants to arrest inflation it should do something to limit the expenditure on advertising by companies and other large firms. The expenditure of most large concerns on advertising now amounts to 2 per cent, of their total expenditure. During the war advertising amounted to only 1 per cent, of the expenditure of such concerns, and the Government should do something about the substantial increase of advertising that has taken place, because it is increasing considerably the cost of living.",86

His reputation as a financial expert has suffered very greatly because of his sponsorship of this list exemptions. If the right honourable gentleman wants to give exemptions let him exempt everything or at least let him make a worthwhile exemption. It is ridiculous for him to provide for a able exemption of £1,000,000. Whilst the. war was still on and the Labour adminisduring, tration had its hands full, exemptions which now total £35,000,000 a year were granted by instalments. To-day, when revenue is buoyant and there is more money in Australia than ever before, all that the 'Government can do is to grant exemptions which will cost £1,000,000.

179,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,The right honourable gentleman knows that that is true.,87
180,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"That amount was not remitted in respect of one year. Even if it had, it was due entirely to the fact that the former Government, by its oppressive taxation policy, had exto tracted too much money out of the public over the years, and that revenue was buoyant because its estimate of revenue for that year was understated and its estimate of expected expenditure overstated. The honourable member for Melbourne has stated that Neon signs have exempted from sales tax. I draw his attention to the fact that they have been merely taken out of one category and put into another one. There has been an adjustment of the classification",87
181,Mr THOMPSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Port Adelaide) [12.3 a.m.] - The clause provides for the abolition of sales tax on certain builders' of hardware. As I have pointed out previously, building materials including hardware, at present subject to sales tax, represent only about 5 per cent, of the total oost of a house. A supporter of the miserGovernment has stated that at least 60,000 houses will be built in Australia this financial year. The Treasurer (Mr Fadden) has estimated that all of the exemptions from sales tax now proposed will involve a loss of revenue of £1,000,000 a year. For the purpose of my submission, I should regard the average cost of a house as £2,000. Five per cent., or £100 worth of materials used in its construction are subject to sales tax, and that would amount to not more than £10. Therefore, in respect of 60,000 houses, not more than £600,000 sales tax on materials is payable. Although some honourable members opposite laughed at me when I stated earlier that sales tax is at present payable only in respect of 5 per cent, of the materials used in the construction of a house, I assure the committee that the investigations that I carried out several years ago confirm that opinion.",87
182,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Mallee) [12.5 a.m.], - The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Thompson) has made unfair criticism of the proposal.

Although the Treasurer has estimated that the total saving to the people will he £1,000,000 a year, I consider it will be nearer £3,000,000 as it depends on the number of homes we can build. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) waved his hands about and treated the committee to one of those comic opera speeches for which he is becoming known in this chamber. He stated that the Labour party when in office had granted reductions of sales tax. The real point is that if the Labour party had met with the approval of the people it would still be in office but it was defeated. The honourable member mentioned Neon signs. I remind the committee that when Labour was in office there was not even sufficient electric power available in Melbourne and Sydney to keep those signs illuminated. Not one Neon sign could be seen flickering, because they were banned. It did not make any difference at that time whether sales tax was imposed on Neon signs or not, because if people could not use them they would not buy them.",88

He was apparently referring to rabbits instead of sales tax. To show how far off the beam the honourable member was, I point out that he did not mention the following items not used in connection with the building of houses, on which sale3 tax has been removed, which are enumerated in clause 4:(6 A ) Cane lifts and other machinery, implements or apparatus for use exclusively or primarily and principally in the loading or unloading of sugar cane: (15) Fencing wire strainers; (1 5 A ) Fencing tools for use in agricultural industry; (46) Stump and tree extractors and grubbers; lift in g jacks for use in agricultural industry; 9 - (49) Waggons, drays, spring drays and trailers for use in agricultural industry, but not including motor trucks or other self-propelled vehicles or semi-trailers; 4 - (1) Plants, seeds and similar goods, namely, plants, trees, tree stocks, root stocks, budding and propagating wood bulbs, seeds, pulse and mushroom spawn, but not moulding edible f r u it , vegetables or nuts; (2) Fertilisers and raw materials for use in the manufacture of fertilisers. (1) Sauces and relishes (including mustard, mayonnaise and salad dressing, whether liquid, semi-liquid or dry. (6) Macaroni (including macaroni fancy pastes), spaghetti (including egg spaghetti) and vermicelli; (7) Processed wheat or other processed grain for use for culinary purposes. 34A. Ice and solid carbon dioxide. (2) Coffee . . . (3) Cocoa . . . (4) Instant postum, Kwic Bru Coffee and other similar preparations for potable use which are made principally from cereals or cereal products. It is apparent that either the honourable member has not read the bill, or that, if he has, he did not understand it . When the honourable member for Port Adelaide Thompson) suggested that there will be a saving of 5 per cent, in the cost of housing because of the reductions of tax proposed by this measure, he was too liberal, because there will not be a saving of 1 per cent., for the reason that as far as housing is concerned the reductions to be effected are practically infinitesimal. I should like to know from the Treasurer why, whilst certain household electrical fittings, accessories and parts there for, which are to be used exclusively or primaril y and principally as part of electrical installations in bouses, are to be exempt from sales tax, bell equipment, burglar alarms and fire alarm equipment, and electric light globes, lamps and tubes are to remain on the list of goods subject to tax. I consider that if it is reasonable to exempt from sales tax electrical installations being put into new homes, then electric light globes, which are necessary for use in conjunction with such electrical fittings, should not still be subject to tax. Why have certain luxury lines been exempted from tax, such as(1) Wreaths ancl covers and mounts for wreaths. (2) Floral tributes (including bouquets, posies, floral baskets and sheaves), containing natural flowers. Those are all luxury lines. There are so many contradictions in this clause that the committee is entitled to some explanation of how the Treasurer arrived at the decisions that are incorporated in it . The clause is a mass of contradictions. The Treasurer's stated reasons for the introduction of the bill are contradicted by almost every item in this clause, so I should like to have some reasonable explanation of it , if there is one,",88
186,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"MCPherson-Treasurer ) [12.11 a.m.] - The reason for the proposed exemptions and increases of rates, is that the Government has decided accordingly.",89
187,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SOCIAL SERVICES,Hindmarsh) [12.12 a.m.] - Wil J the Treasurer (Mr . Fadden) re-consider the matter of the (Mr incidence of sales tax of Land Rovers purchased hy shearers? I mentioned this matter in my second-reading speech and referred in error to those vehicles as station wagons. I apologize for the error. Why has a shearer to pay tax on a Land Rover when other people can purchase them tax free? Will the Government give consideration to allowing shearers who need Land Rovers specifically for the purpose of following their occupation to purchase them tax free?,89
188,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"MCPherson-Treasurer ) [12.14 a.m.] - It is a pity that the lionorable member was not in the chamber when I replied to the second-reading debate, because I explained that Land Rovers are exempted from tax when they are purchased for use by primary producers, principally or exclusively for agricultural pursuits. That position does not apply to the shearer. However, I shall re-examine the matter and see whether any action can be taken when the sales tax is next reviewed.",89
189,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,SOCIAL SERVICES,All I want to say is that the shearer uses the vehicle only to follow his occupation in a primary industry.,89
190,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"So does a baker who delivers bread. Amendment (by Mr FADDEN ) agreed toThat, in paragraph (m ) , proposed sub-item (7) .be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following proposed sub-item: "" (7) Cere-creme, Cerevite, Bycena, - Rycola, Vigoriee, and similar products for use for culinary purposes (Nos. 1 to 9) Clause, as amended, agreed to. * Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 6 (T h i r d schedule). The Third Schedule to the Principal Act is amended by omitting all the words before .Division XIII . ancl inserting in their stead the following division: Divisiox I - MUSICAL , BANDASH ORCHESTRAL INSTRUMENTS. 1. Mtisienl, band and orchestral instruments (and accessories and parts there for) including(S) Wireless receiving sets and combined wireless receiving and gramophone sct3; record players and pickups. Amendment (by Mr FADDEN) proposed - That, in proposed Division 1, item 1, subitem (3), after the word ""sets"", second occurring, the following words be inserted:'-"" but not including batteries there for "".",89
191,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Melbourne) [12.16 a.m.] - Tb e Treasurer's proposal is completely impracticable. He proposes to exempt from taxation batteries for radio sets that will operate in country districts, but purchasers of batteries for radio sets used in city areas are to pay sales tax on them. How can the Wireless Branch of the Postmaster-General's Department possibly administer a provision of this sort? As a person who lives in a country district not served by electricity may buy a battery for a wireless set tax free, obviously all that people who live in city areas which are not regarded as areas not served by electricity have to do to obtain such batteries tax free, is to go to the prescribed areas and buybatteries tax free for use in the city. This provision is just a foolish and fatuous attempt to pretend that the Government is giving some advantage to a person who has a radio that is not served by electric power.",90
192,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"MCPherson-Treasurer ) [12.18 a.m.] - There is only one thing wrong with the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell), and that is they are not correct. This sub-item causes tax to be payable at the rate of 25 per cent, in respect of wireless receiving sets and combined wireless receiving and gramophone sets, as well as batteries for use therewith. It has been represented that the taxing of batteries at this rate will operate to the disadvantage of people who live in areas not served by electricity and who depend upon batteries to operate their radio sets. Persons living in city areas do not need such batteries and obtain power for the operation of their sets from electricity which is not subject to sales tax. In order to remove this auomaly, it has been decided to exclude batteries for radio sets from the Third Schedule aud thus to allow them to remain taxable at the general rate of 8$ per cent., as was the case prior to the introduction of this bill, which refers to all parts applicable to radio sets. Amendment agreed to.",90
193,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Melbourne) [12.19 a.m.] - The committee will realise that in division 1, musical, band and orchestral instruments are to be subject to various rates of tax that will not be uniformly borne. Purchasers of wireless receiving sets already pay £600,000 in sales tax, and under the new provisions will pay another £1,200,000 in tax. Radio sets have now become a luxury for old-age pensioners, for the small farmers and for those who want to listen to the broadcasts of the proceedings of the Parliament. The impost will not, of course, affect wealthy graziers and others who are represented by the "" hill-billies "" in the corner. Unless we encourage the radio industry, we shall not get television in Australia, and if we do not get television within a few years, it will not be possible to organize the construction of radar equipment for defence purposes. The raising of the sales tax by 200 per cent, on these items will cause a number of industries to curtail staffs. The Government proposes, in effect, to use this measure as a means of introducing industrial conscription. It hopes to force workers out of the radio factories into the brickyards, or to work for low wages for wealthy graziers. Honourable members opposite laugh and screech, but they will not have an opportunity for much longer to screech like cockatoos. This also deals. with such articles as pianolas, gramophones, radio receiving sets, records for gramophones and phonographs, drums, cymbals, chimes, triangles, and other musical instruments. Altogether, it covers about 150 different musical instruments, and the increased sales tax is estimated to return an extra £300,000. I should have thought that was too little for the Treasurer (Mr. Fadden) to worry about.",90
194,Mr GULLETT,SOCIAL SERVICES,He is doing his best.,90
195,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Yes , he is doing his best with his limited ability, and with the help of the limited ability of his supporters. The total estimated revenue to be raised under the third schedule to the bill is £1,500,000, as compared with £750,000 being raised at the present rates of tax. The Treasurer is mistaken if he thinks that his party will achieve any political advantage out of these increases. I do not usually take much notice of what the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Turnbull) says, but I recall that he declared that £1,000.000 wns being saved to the people of' Australia. Conversely, £10,000,000 is being filched from them, and the clause now under consideration provides for the filching of £1,500,000 of that £10,000,000. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 7 (Fourth schedule).",90
196,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Melbourne) [12.25 n.ni.J - On most of the items in this schedule sales tax is to be increased from S$ per cent, to 33$ per cent. Only on jewellery and imitation jewellery, and a few other items is the tax to be raised from 25 pcr cent, to 33$ per cent. Item 4 of the schedule covers toilet and beauty preparations. Sub-item (3) covers nail polishes and lacquers, lacquer and polish removers, hand creams and lotions, and similar preparations. Item 7 includes articles made wholly or principally of furskin. The other items in the schedule at present bear a tax of S$ per cent., and should never have been included in this classifiCiition. For instance, there are included such articles as the baskets made by blind persons and others for sale to harassed housewives for use when shopping. includes this miserable string bag that I hold in my hand. It is to be taxed at the rate of 33$ per cent. I ought to decorate the Treasurer with it . He is going to tax it at the rate of 33$ per in order to stop inflation. If it were practo ticable I should ask permission to have the string bag incorporated in Hansard. As someone has remarked, it is just number of holes joined together by string, and the demon of inflation could easily escape from it . Sub-item (8) of item includes such extraordinary examples allegedly epiceuran taste and luxury ing as tooth picks, which are to be at the rate of 33$ per cent. It also includes lighters for cigarettes, cigars or pipes and, of course, shopping and knitting bags. Indeed, anything that looks like a bag has been included. Mr TURN BULT. - Includin g rat-bags?",91
197,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"They are in the Australian Country party corner, and I am looking at them now. Fountain pens have now become a luxury. Practically every one in the community uses a fountain pen, even schoolboys and schoolgirls; but, under the terrible threat of inflation parents will have to pay sales tax at the rate of 33$ per cent, on the pens their children use. Other articles mentioned in the sub-item are serviette rings, book ends, book marks, collar boxes, gold and silver safety pins, and self-propelling pencils, all of which are to be taxed at the rate of 33$ per cent. The Treasurer has told us that the impost is necessary because the Government must meet additional defence expenditure. The Government has chosen to expend £50,000,000 this year on stock-piling defence materials. The expenditure could well have been spread over a number of years. There is no need for the savage imposts that the Government proposes. We have been told that the Government must find £67,000,000 with which to pay war gratuities, but £37,000,000 was collected for that purpose by the .previous Government.",91
198,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,It is non-existent.,91
199,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,It does exist. The It also people paid the money in taxes.,91
200,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"They paid it , and the Labour Government used it .",91
201,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"The Government is cent, faking its budget figures in an attempt j u s t if y what it is now proposing to do. We intend to put the Government on the spot, and to keep it there. We shall a enjoy hearing honourable members who are supporting this proposal explaining to their electors why they slugged the 1 - children and took it out of the houseof wives and the poorer sections of the l i vcommunity. The Treasurer talks about taxed communism, but that is now merely another matter like King Charles's head. As an issue it is so dead that it is no longer of any value even as a political stalking horse. We shall make honourable membera on the Government side answer for this bill, which will be one of the nail."" that Labour will drive into the Go1 vernment's political coffin.",91
202,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Wilmot) [12.31 a.m.]. - I shall not speak on this measure at such a length as was taken by the. honourable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell). I merely want to mention one or two points. Among the items to be taxed at 33$ per cent, are cameras, photographic enlarging and reducing apparatus, photographic negatives produced for sale, transparencies and reversals, sensitized film, cards, board, linen and other sensitized materials. All those materials are used in the one industry, that is in the photography business. I - regard the imposition of a heavy sales tax on all tbose articles as one of the most vicious on one form of industry that is to be found in this iniquitous measure. The photographers, particularly those who conduct one-man businesses, will suffer severely through the increase of sales tax. Their photography businesses are their sole means of earning a livelihood yet this Government is placing a sales tax of 33$ per cent, on almost all the materials that they use. I feel that all the one-man photography businesses throughout Australia will suffer severely when this sure becomes law. Last Saturday a man who conducts such a business visited me in Launceston and told me that the 33$ per cent, tax will be a terrible blow to him. The Government does not appear to be one scrap concerned about these men; it is no more concerned about photographers than it is about wool-growers and others. I ask the Treasurer (Mr Eadden) seriously why these men should be singled out for attack, and I should like him to answer seriously. Probably, as the honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Haylen) says, if he does answer the answer will be in the negative. But this is a serious matter and I should like him to tell the committee why he has selected the photographer for this attack.",92
203,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"MCPherson-Treasurer ) [12.33 a.m.] - It is unfortunate that the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Duthie) did not read the bill a little more carefully, because professional photographers will not have their equipjnent taxed under it. The honourable member has my assurance that the cameras of professional photographers will not be taxed under this bill.",92
204,Mr WARD,SOCIAL SERVICES,"East Sydney) [12.34 a.m.] - The criticism that I intend to offer on this clause could be offered on any clause of the bill. The Treasurer (Mr. Fadden) has said that he intends to increase sales tax so as to reduce the use of certain items by the community because they are luxury items. The fairesr method of doing that, if it was really the intention of the Government to divert labour to what it regards as more essential industries, was to prohibit completely certain classes of manufacture. By increasing the tax as is conattacks templated by this measure the only people who will be penalized will be those on the lower incomes. People with substantial incomes will not be debarred from making purchases of the heavily taxed items. They will be able to buy such goods whatever the cost. If the use of heavily taxed articles decreases it will be because those on the lower incomes cannot afford to purchase them. Therefore, this legislation is aimed directly at the workers. If the Government believed that mea- it was necessary to conserve man-power, the fairest way to do so would have been by a prohibition of the manufacture of what the Government considered to be luxury goods.",92
205,Mr MOMAHON,SOCIAL SERVICES,TJnde r what constitutional power can the Government prohibit the manufacture of any goods?,92
206,Mr WARD,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Power s exist if the Government wants to use them. Certain powers were used by other governments in times of national crisis, and the manufacture of certain articles was prohibited.",92
207,Mr OSBORNE,SOCIAL SERVICES,The prohibition was made only under the defence power.,92
208,Mr WARD,SOCIAL SERVICES,"I understood the honourable member to say that a state of cold war existed. No doubt Judge Berne was not sure of the exact position wben he asked during recent court proceedings for a clear statement of our position with regard to the war in Korea. Mr MCMAHON,-That is not so. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Mr. Ryan) - Order ! The honourable member for East Sydney is getting a little away from the clause under discussion. The honourable member should deal with the clause.",92
209,Mr WARD,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Wit h respect, I suggest that what I am saying is connected with the clause because the question of power is the string bag. involved. If the Government's earlieT statement that a state of war now exists is correct, then the Government has power to ban the manufacture of certain goods. If no state of war exists, then many of the acts of the Government in recent times were completely unjustified.",93
210,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,SOCIAL SERVICES, Order! The honourable member must address the committee on the clause under consideration.,93
211,Mr WARD,SOCIAL SERVICES,"-Wit h all due respect to you, Mr Deputy Chairman, I have not. taken up much time on this matter. In my opinion, the Government, in this measure, has introduced a piece of class legislation. Honor- definition. able members on this side of the committee are often accused of trying to maintain class antagonism, but I submit that this measure is a piece of class-legislation because it proposes to penalize only one section of the community. Surely it will not be argued .that all the items enumerated here by the Treasurer are luxury items.",93
212,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Nobod y used the word "" luxury "".",93
213,Mr WARD,SOCIAL SERVICES,"That is the term that the Treasurer used in his second-reading speech, and at an appropriate time. I shall refer him to the particular part. In the schedule of items to be taxed there is one upon which I find myself in complete agreement with the Government; that is, if the item refers to what I believe it refers to. The item is "" transparencies and reversals"". Surely, that could not refer to anything but Government policy.",93
214,Mr TURNBULL,SOCIAL SERVICES,Mallee) [12.38 a.m.]. - I desire briefly to refer to the great play made by the honourable memberafor Melbourne (Mr Calwell) on the string bag. Before Labour came to power in this country goods were delivered to the housewife and the string bag was unknown. After Labour assumed office the womenfolk throughout the country began to trudge along to the shopkeepers and carry loads of household requisites back to their homes. Then came the era of,93
215,Mr CALWELL,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Melbourne) [12.3!) a.m.] - The Treasurer (Mr Fadden) should withdraw this clause and briny: down an excise or a customs duty of say £10 or £20 a ton on newsprint used by the metropolitan dailies. That would bring him in a lot more money than he can get by this measure, and it would be a much fairer tax and would be borne by the people who are best able to bear taxation.",93
216,Mr THOMPSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Port Adelaide) [12.40 a.m.] - The items included in the fourth schedule include ""decorative candles "". I should like to know whether the small candles that children have on their birthday cakes are included in that",93
217,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"MCPherson-Treasurer ) [12.41 a.m.] - I think that the candles to which the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Thompson) has referred would be included. Probably they are of the kind that was placed on pink icing before its use was prohibited at the instigation of the former honourable member for Corio, Mr Dedman.",93
218,Mr BRYSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Wills) [12.42 a.m.] Included in the items to which the sales tax at the rate of 33$ per cent, is to apply are powders of various descriptions. I should like to know whether baby powders are included.",93
219,Mr DUTHIE,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Wilmot) [12.43 a.m.]. - On e item that I am astonished to see made the subject of this vicious increase is "" lantern, screen, and camera slides "". Lanterns are widely used by churches of all denominations to illustrate lectures on various subjects such as mission work, and I am wondering why they have been classed as a luxury item.",93
220,Mr FADDEN,SOCIAL SERVICES,"MCPherson-Treasurer ) [12.44 a.m.] - It is a pity that the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr . Duthie) does not t ry to exert the same influence over members of his own party as he is endeavouring to exert over me. The item to which he has referred was subject to the sales tax when the Labour party was in office. Amendments (by Mr FADDEN) agreed toTiiat, in proposed item 3, sub-item (1) be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following sub-item:"" (1) Travelling bags, brief bags, kit bags exceeding eighteen inches in length, gladstone bags, bookmakers' bags, hat boxes, trunks, suitcases, dressing or toilet cases, attache cases exceeding eighteen inches in length, writing or letter cases, music cases, sporting cases and bags, regalia cases, lunch eases exceeding twelve inches in length, hat cases, satchels, grips, sewing bags and cases, sleeping valises and bags, but not including school bags or cases."". That, in proposed item 4, sub-item (12), he left out.",94
221,Mr BKTSON,SOCIAL SERVICES,"Wills ) [12.45 a.m.] I have asked the Treasurer a question about baby powders, and I should like it to be answered. I ask the right honourable gentleman again whether baby powders are to be subject to a tax of 33$ per cent.",94

226,Mr MCMAHON,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"Lowe) [12.55 a.m.]. - I rise to correct any misapprehension that might have been aroused in the minds of honourable members as the result of a question that the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) asked relating to the formation in Sydney recently of a company known as Mainguard (Aust.) Limited. It is desirable that honourable members should know more about that company. It has a nominal capital of £5,000,000, of which £1,000,000 has been called up. Of the latter capital approximately £600,000 has beeu provided by purely Australian companies that have been in existence for many years and in which practically all the shareholders are Australians. In - respect of the balance of share capital of £400,000 that has been called up, the five directors have bought and now hold approximately 135,000 shares whilst the remaining shares are held by members of the public. Not one of the shareholders is a foreigner. An exaniination of the register of the company will show that only 100 shares arc held outside Australia and that they a rc held by an investor who lives in New Zealand. The value of the shares has been fixed at 5s., in order that persons of small means may acquire shares in what will be a prosperous company and may add to the financial strength of the community. The average individual holding is 1,100 shares of a value of £275. Recently, the register of the company was compiled, and the honourable member for Melbourne may examine it and ascertain for himself who the shareholders are. I have explained these facts because the honourable member's question may have given the impression that the company was formed to represent foreign interests. That is not correct. I also make it clear that no overseas funds whatsoever arc invested in the company. Consequently, it cannot be said that it is holding money that has been sent to Australia in the expectation that the Australia! £1 will be appreciated, in which event money would be repatriated. The information on which the honourable member based 'his question is incorrect. The company will fulfil a national function of great significance. In 1931, Lord Macmillan, one of England's most distinguished commercial lawyers and a member of the Judicial Committee of the Priv y Council, presided over a committee on finance and industry at the request of the British Parliament. That cominittee inquired into the British financial system and recommended unanimously that the outstanding need of Britisli industry was the development of organizations like Mainguard (Aust.) Limited to act as intermediaries between industry and investors and to perform in the interests of British industry functions which up to that time had been performed by merchant banking and issuing houses, most of which, however, were owned and controlled by foreign interests. That conimittee recommended the formation by British interests of companies of the type of Mainguard (Aust.) Limited. Such companies were formed first in Lombard-street, London, and later in the United States of America, and Main guard (Aust.) Limited represents the first company of that type to be formed in Australia. The company will pei for m a very useful function. Eirst. it will operate as a financing house, that is, as an intermediary between investors and industry. An y investors who wish t f establish industries and who are in need of capital will be able to obtain the best advice possible from it . The - company will underwrite the capital of new undertakings which, it believes, will have a good chance of succeeding. On behalf of proposed new undertakings it will conduct investigations of potential local demands, advise with respect to the most suitable locations for new ventures and generally provide advice to enable new companies to get on their feet with the least possible delay and with the greatest possible chance of success.",95
227,Mr CALWELL,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"Why did it get r i d of "" h o t "" the journalists whom it sacked?",95
228,Mr MCMAHON,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"I shall come to the that. Activities of that type were discussed and strongly applauded by the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems in 1934. The licence to publish Smith's Weekly has been sold to another newspaper, and the newsprint and machinery have been disposed of, so that this company will , in no circumstances, compete in the newspaper world in Australia. It will be, as I have said, purely a financial corporation which will fill a gap in the Australian financial machinery. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Chifley) said in his speech on the Commonwealth Bank Bill , Australia has never had a mature money market. In other words, the right honourable gentleman indicated that we have never had a short bill market or open market operations in Commonwealth bonds, notwithstanding that the whole paraphernalia for a mature money market exists in this country. company will remedy one of these deficiencies. Far from making this company the object of innuendo and suspicion and seeking to damn it at birth we should give it the greatest possible encouragement. The directors are men who have attained outstanding success in the Australian business and commercial world. They are men of integrity, and, what will not be understood by the honourable member for Melbourne, men of complete honesty.",95
229,Mr CALWELL,STATUTE LAW REVISION,I ask for a withdrawal of that filthy observation.,96
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"As the honourable member for Melbourne objects to that statement, it must be withdrawn.",96

234,Mr KENT HTJGHES,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"Chisholm) [1.2 a.m.] - Las t week I referred to the railway strike in Yictoria and South Australia. Since then the situation has altered and whilst the strike in South Australia has ended, unfortunately there seems to 'be a complete deadlock in Victoria. I understand that the Victorian Government has supported the chairman of the Victoria n Railways Commissioners in insisting on the following courses of action:(1) That the union claims must he referred to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for settlement; (2) That the Victorian Railways Commissioners will not oppose the original, as distinct from the subsidiary, claims made by the unions if those claims aro so referred to the court or to a conciliation commissioner. ""Whether that is right or wrong is not at issue at this stage. The third point The wasThe Government and the chairman have insisted on the claims made by the two unions, the Australian Railways Union and the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, being treated as a whole instead of on a separate basis. There may have been some justification for the insistence on those points at an earlier stage of the dispute. I understand that the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen has now referred its claims to the court or to a conciliation commissioner, and that the Australian Railways Union has not done so. I ask the Government whether the Victorian Government and the chairman of the Victoria n Railways Commissioners are within their rights under the provisions of the act in in sisting that the separate claims shall be treated as an indivisible whole. I do so because I believe that that triflin g point is one of the main obstacles which prevents a settlement of the strike.",96
235,Mr EJ HARRINSON,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"Blaxland) [1.4 a.m.] - I wish to make one or two observations in regard to the strike in order that the public and the members of this House may view the facts in proper perspective. The Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen regrets very deeply the inconvenience that has been caused to the public as a consequence of the strike. It is. concerned particularly with the grievous damage that has been done to what should he a flourishing State. The press has published all sorts of statements in an attempt to fix the responsibility for this dispute. All I wish to say on that aspect of the dispute is that as a consequence of an incident that occurred in Victoria an effort was made by the Victorian Railways Commissioners to settle a dispute which had arisen in regard to overtime, and which has assumed great proportions. The overtime worked by train crews, including engine-drivers and firemen, is greater today than it was in war-time. The Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen endeavoured to overcome the problem of overtime by encouraging men to enter the service. A considerable time ago it lodged applications for increased pay for those on the lower grades in an attempt to attract more men to the railways service in those grades. The commissioners opposed the application and it was rejected. Early in September both unions were concerned about the subject of overtime. Early in September the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen held a State conference, following a similar conference by the Australian Railways Union, and thereupon, submitted to the Railways Commissioners that the time had arrived when something had to be done to meet the overtime problem. The commissioners agreed that something should be done and arrived at a formula under which .all overtime was to be paid for. They agreed that passive time, as distinct from operative time, should be taken into account for the purpose of calculating overtime payments. They insisted that both unions should confirm in writing the terms of settlement. On the 14th September, after consultation with rank and file members, the general secretary of the Victorian division of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen sent to the commissioners the following letter:The union, through its annual conference, directs mc to indicate that the present dispute is to be settled on the basis discussed between us, i.e., that the necessary variation of Federal Award No. 2GS of 1945 be agreed to between the parties providing for the abolition of passive time and the payment of overtime at the rate of time and one half for all time on duty in excess of eight hours up to and including eleven hours on duty and double time thereafter on any shift. That was a complete settlement of the dispute as far as the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen was concerned, but the commissioners insisted upon both matters being referred to the court simultaneously. The Conciliation Commissioner, Mr Hall, in the first line of his judgment in which he referred to what had been agreed upon by the parties, saidThe application is consented to by the Victorian Eailways Commissioners. However, after dealing with the case extensively in 24 pages of typescript he then saidInsofar as the application seeks the payment of overtime rates after eight hours' work on any shift, it is refused because the existing margins include consideration there for, and for the additional reasons stated in the foregoing review. He did not review the existing margins. No marginal case was before him. The commissioners did not raise the subject of margins. They said that they wanted the matter to be settled in the public interest. At that point, however, Mr Hall made no reference to the public interest. Instead, he found ways and means of rejecting an agreement which had been reached between the commissioners and the unions. And on that part, neither of the two unions was on strike. But, as a consequence of Hall's attitude, a strike occurred immediately. The Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen referred the matter to its members, and at a stop-work meeting, only 83 out of 2,800 men voted for a return to work. That was the position. The matter was referred again to Hall, not by the unions concerned but by the Railways Commissioners, with an appeal that their request be acceded to in the public interest, and that the award be varied in accordance with the original claim. Government supporters interjecting,",96
236,Mr EJ HARRINSON,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"It is all very well to blame the Australian Railways Union and the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen for the strike. I refer Government supporters to the transcript of the proceedings 'before the conciliation commissioner, H all , on the 17th October last. The men were on strike, and H all was asked this questionWould it not have been better to accept our interpretation of public interest? He repliedNo, I felt convinced you would do what you have done. I am not surprised at what has happened. H all was convinced, when he made his decision, that the men would go on strike as a result of it . That was the second time of review. The next step in the dispute was taken by the Railways Commissioners on an application to have the agreement filed under section 37 of the act. H all said, in the first instance, that he not have jurisdiction in the matter, ancl would refer it to the court. He did not do so. Later, he was convinced that he hacl jurisdiction, but he said, "" If I had the jurisdiction I still would not do it "" . The commissioners then conferred with the unions concerned, and the two parties signed an agreement, which was filed with the court. However, that tribunal declared that it had no jurisdiction, because the matter was one for the conciliation commissioner to determine. On the third occasion on which H all dealt with the matter, he said that it was the la9t time he would do so. During the hearing, two points became apparent that staggered the trade unions in this country.",97

JAMESHARRISON - It is all very well to try to associate me with Brown, but I am dealing with a purely industrial problem. If Government supporters cannot separate such an industrial problem from their party political outlook, they are heading for a good deal of trouble. I shall now deal with a matter that is agitating the minds of railway employees. H all said, in reply to me on the 17th OctoberWe had a conference of Conciliation Commissioners on Monday morning in Sydney over this matter of endorsing consent agreements. There has been a number of matters before Conciliation Commissioners consented to by parties, which the Commissioners have refused to endorse or embody in awards. Tliey have not been given publicity because the parties have been told there that they can pay if they like but it will not be put in an award. That statement affects all railwayemployees. A point was reached when H all was under fire from the railways commissioners, not the unions concerned, and he said to the representative of the commissionersHow did you get into a position of letting yourselves make up your mind in regard to did this matter, when, as late as May, 1949, you agreed with all your brother commissioners in New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia that, in regard to these matters of general principle, you would stand shoulder to shoulder together ? Therefore, railwaymen are confronted with the position that, before they may expect any improvement of their conditions by agreement in future, the railways commissioners of several States must be in agreement on the matter. But even then, a conciliation commissioner may decide that the employees shall not receive an increase of salary or be granted improved conditions. Finally, the stage was reached in the dispute when the door was slammed on the Australian Railways Union by H all . Mr WHEELER' - Shoul d not the honourable member refer to him as "" Mr H all "" ?

239,Mr TRELOAR,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"Socialism breaking down. Mr E. JAME SHARRISO N No. The Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen recognized that the door of conciliation and arbitration had been closed to the Australian Railways Union. We attempted to have the matter placed on a proper basis, so that a settlement could be reached. I made an attempt, on bebalf of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen, to achieve a settlement by conciliation and arbitration. [Extension of time granted']. I was astounded to find that the Eailways Commissioners of Victoria were not prepared to approach the matter - on that basis. I hope, even at this late hour, that common sense will prevail. The Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen is prepared to follow the trail of conciliation and arbitration in order that the dispute may be settled; but, to date, it has not been allowed to proceed in that manner. It is prepared, if the conciliatory approach is made, to do the utmost in its power to start the wheels rolling in Victoria at the earliest possible moment. Government supporters interjecting,",98
240,Mr EJ HARRINSON,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"I shall remind Government supporters of a saying that I heard at my mother's knee, which I hope wil] convey a lesson to them. It wentGive a thing, take a thing, It becomes the devil's own plaything. That has happened in this dispute. The members of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen were not on strike against an agreement that had been reached with the railways commissioners. However, they say that they will not pay the additional money unless they have some authority to give it the official imprimatur. We are prepared to reach a settlement under Part VII . of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, or in any other way that is acceptable to the commissioners. We ask for a settlement, on the basis of the policy enunciated by the Australian Council of Trades Unions, to adjust the difficulty in a proper and orderly way. The only obstacle now is the failure of the conciliation commissioner to give the union the opportunity to reach a settlement in the way in which everybody considers it should be reached, and that is by conciliation and arbitration.",99
241,Mr CHARLES ANDERSON,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"What about the general public, including the farmer ?",99
242,Mr EJ HARRINSON,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"I am just as much appreciative of the needs of the general community, including the farmer, as is the honourable member for Hume (Mr Charles Anderson). But I emphasize that the railwaymen themselves made those conditions possible for the community, and it will be the railwaymen themselves who, at the moment they are granted the treatment which they were promised, will give all the services to the community that they have given in the past. But it is not possible to convince the employees, even at this stage of the dispute, that they have not been tricked. They will not be convinced that they are not entitled to receive the benefits which have been promised to them. We shall strive to the best of our ability, within the laws of conciliation and arbitration, to obtain for them the benefits that they have been promised.",99
243,Mr TRELOAR,STATUTE LAW REVISION,The unions concerned are outside the law now.,99
244,Mr EJ HARRINSON,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"They are not. I challenge that statement. The court and the conciliation commissioners have examined the dispute, and it has not been suggested that the employees should be ordered to return to work. This is a two-way traffic. The Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen will accept whatever decision is reached. The railways commissioners can settle the dispute in a moment by saying, ""Very well, until this thing is determined by conciliation and arbitration we will pay you the money we promised you"". It is just as incumbent upon the commissioners to do that as it is upon the union to say to the men, "" Go back to work without receiving the conditions that you were promised "".",99
245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATUTE LAW REVISION,Order ! The honourable member's extended time has expired.,99
246,Mr TURNBULL,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"Mallee) [1.22 a.m.]. - It seems a very strange thing that a member of the Australian Labour party should speak as we have just heard the honourable member for Blaxland (MT . E. James Harrison) speak. Honourable members will recall that when the Labour Government introduced legislation for the appointment of conciliation commissioners, the Opposition contended that there should be contained in the bill some means by which appeals could be made against decisions made by conciliation commissioners. The then Prime Minister, Mr Chifley, declined to agree to such provision, and no appeals whatever were allowed. A member of the Australian Labour party, who at the same time is the leader of a union, now says in this House that the laws of the country should be upheld, but at the same time he is inciting, without the slightest doubt, the members of his union to continue this strike. Like a dictator, he makes definite statements to the effect that ""We will do this"" and "" We will do that"", and he speaks of "" My union "", which shows that he is the man who, when he desires, can get the men back to work in Victoria. - Only recently in the newspapers there were photographs of the Communist leader, Brown, and of the honourable member for Blaxland. The statements concerning the strike made by the honourable member for Blaxland were far more extreme than those made by the Communist leader. A mass meeting was held in Melbourne today, and a resolution was carried without one dissentient vote to the effect that the members of the union are dissatisfied with their executive and intend to remove them from office. Throughout Victoria some men have returned to work, What has this unfortunate strike already cost the railway men? One has only to look at the newspapers to see that it has cost them between £40 and £50 each in loss of wages and that they will receive only an additional £16 a year if they obtain all that they are fighting for. I remind honourable members that there are thousands of other railway men who, even if this strike is successful, receive nothing extra. Those employees have lost over £1,000,000. No wonder they are now saying that they must get rid of their executive. They are saying, "" We must break Brown before he breaks us"". As far as I can see, that statement also applies to the honourable member for Blaxland, Mr Turnbull. and if the members of the union do not get him out before he drags them down they will regret it. Those who attended the mass meeting in Melbourne today knew that they must get rid of Brown and their leaders; the employees throughout the country know it, and the primary producers who wish to get their wool and wheat transported also know it. It is of national importance that the law should be obeyed. A responsible federal government, of which the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) was a member, appointed the original conciliation commissioners, and honourable members of this Parliament who supported that Government should not now countenance a member of the Australian Labour party, who also'speaks as a member of a union, saying, "" We will not obey the finding of a conciliation commissioner "". I believe that the time has gone when the railway employees in Victoria will accept directions from such men. I also believe that common sense will prevail within the next few days, that there will be new leaders, and that the wheels will be turning again in Victoria. The honourable member for Blaxland has stated that Mr Conciliation Commissioner Hall should have accepted what the Railway Commissioners and the union had agreed to. That would have meant that the strike would have spread throughout Australia, and it is possible that in other States agreements would not have been reached between the railway commissioners concerned and the unions. In the interests of the people, Mr Conciliation Commissioner Hall did not ratify the agreement, and in refusing to do so he performed a great service to the people, not only of Victoria but also of Australia. The strike was engineered by the executive of the union, and if it had will won the day there would have been another strike before very long. Mr Conciliation Commissioner Hall is to be complimented by the people of Australia. I cannot speak for this Government, but I should like it to stand firm, and to ensure that when peace in industry comes to Victoria and to Australia it will be of a permanent nature.",99
247,Mr CLAREY,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"Bendigo) [1.26 a.m.] I would not detain the House at this hour if it were not for the remarkable statements that have been made by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr. Turnbull). Statements such as he has made are not likely to assist in the settlement of the dispute, because he has displayed an entire disregard of the facts and a very grave misconception of the actual position of the men who are involved in the dispute. It should be clearly understood that there is no law in Australia, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, that makes it an offence for men to go on strike. In going on strike men do not break the law. Another matter that must be understood is that those who have had any experience o negotiations between bodies of men and employers will appreciate the importance of the fact that when an agreement is reached between employers and employees those who are affected by the agreement expect that it will be implemented and properly expressed. In the Victorian railways case two agreements were made. One was an agreement made between the Australian Railways Union and the Victorian Railways Commissioners, which I understand the conciliation commissioner afterwards stated was made under duress, and the other was an agreement made between the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen and the commissioners, which was not made under duress, but which was the result of an amicable conference between the parties. In both cases the commissioners were satisfied, in the interests of the railways and of the men, that it was desirable that a principle that is in operation in every sphere of industry today-that overtime rates should be paid after eight hours work-shoul d operate as far as the railways system is concerned. That is no - departure from the principles observed by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Neither is it a departure from decisions which are being made by conciliation commissioners every day - of the week. It is the usual thing in respect of all .awards. It is incomprehensible that it [fll] could be said at this time that it is against the public interests to apply to railway men a principle that is being applied to workers in every other industry in Australia. That is an essential point. It is entirely undemocratic and out of accordance with the methods of conciliation as practised by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and by the State arbitration tribunals, to sav that one section of employees in Australia is a class apart and that it should have inferior conditions in respect of overtime. For years the railwaymen had been endeavouring to have themselves placed in the same position as other employees in industry. Finally, an agreement was reached between the organization and their employers, without the slightest semblance of duress, at least as far as the locomotive enginemen were concerned. However, when an application was made to the court for ratification of the agreement, the conciliation commissioner, who in other spheres grants such applications by employees, adopted the remarkable attitude, which cannot be justified either by precedent or by logic, that the railwaymen were not entitled to enjoy that benefit. Another fact that arises from this situation must be stressed. It is that conciliation has always been regarded by most unions, if . not by all of them, as well as by many employers, as a more satisfactory way of settling disputes than arbitration. _ Conciliation enables both parties to a dispute to come together and reach an agreement to their mutual satisfaction. Consequently, when agreements are made by conciliation, there is greater contentment in industry than there is when matters in dispute are subjected to arbitration and one party or the other loses.",101
248,Mr KENT HUGHES,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"But in a monopoly industry, it might be against the public interests to settle disputes by agreement.",101
249,Mr CLAREY,STATUTE LAW REVISION,"I appreciate the point that has been raised by the honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Kent Hughes) but, as I have already pointed out, the agreement was reached in accordance with practices and principles that had been laid down by the court, and that have been approved ever since the days of the late Mr Justice Higgins. Had the arrangement made by the unions and the commissioners been novel and startling, and had it introduced some new principle in respect of the relations between employers and employees, the objection raised by the honourable gentleman would have had some force and I could appreciate the attitude of the conciliation commissioner. However, nothing new was introduced. A principle as old as the court itself was involved but when the agreement was reached and efforts were made to secure its endorsement by the court, that body, for reasons which I frankly confess that I cannot understand, decided that it should not be put into effect. The unions and the Railways Commissioners have done their best to settle the matter, and the commissioners have declared that the agreement ought to be sanctified by the court. Therefore, I suggest that the parties should now take the stand that, having done all that they can to have the agreement ratified, but having been frustrated through no fault of their own, they should put it into operation. By that means the understanding that was reached in conference could be implemented with, honour and decency and the whole dispute could be quickly ended.",101
