SCOTTISH REGIMENT. - Mr FINLAYSON - Has the Minister representing the Minister for Defence noticed that a considerable amount of public attention has been given to the question that I asked last week concerning the formation of a .Scottish Regiment, and that last night at Sydney an enthusiastic meeting approved of the project, aud sixty-five recruits enlisted?",21
1,Mr WISE,Unknown,"The following memorandum from the Minister for Defence sets out his views on the subject:Referring to the suggested formation of Highland Regiments to reinforce the Australian Imperial Force, the Government fully appreciates the pride of Australians of Scottish ancestry in the history and traditions of the famous Highland Regiments, and respects their desire for the perpetuation of those traditions amongst their descendants in the Dominions. The proposal to form a Scottish Regiment ih Australia to assist in reinforcing the Australian Imperial Force cannot, however, be given effect to. The five Australian divisions now in the field are organized in brigades and battalions, which have won for themselves, by their courage and dogged endurance, traditions which it is desired to cherish and perpetuate in Australia. Owing to severe fighting, many nf these battalions are sorely depleted in numbers, and the pressing need is for recruits to fill up the gaps in'exist-, ing battalions. If new battalions were formed on the baBis suggested they would have to take the place in the existing brigades and divisions of the battalions referred to, and the Government feels, that it cannot endorse such a proposal. At the same time, appreciating the spirit of patriotism that has prompted the proposal, the Government will welcome the formation of unitB of reinforcements, and an assurance can be given to those of Scottish descent that if they enlist together, they will be trained together in Australia, sent oversea together, and, as far as military exigencies permit, will be kept together in the same unit. The course has already been followed with successful results in regard to the Riflemen's Thousand and the Sportsmen's Battalion. The Government is also prepared to extend this principle to other sections who are prepared to guarantee obtaining recruits Qn this basis, but it must be distinctly understood that the existing organization of the five Australian divisions will be retained. It is not proposed at this juncture to make tuiy alteration in the service dress, which has been demonstrated as suitable for all requirements, as a result of three years' experience ir. this war. SPEECH OF DE. MANNIX .  the report of a speech recently delivered by Dr Mannix at Kilmoro, which was published in Monday's Argus, has been challenged Jby him, will the Government take steps to determine whether the report is accurate?",21
2,Mr WATT,Unknown,The Government has already done so. EXPORT AND PRICE OF BUTTER.,22
3,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"'Can the Honorary Minister (Mr Greene) obtain, for the information of the House, a statement showber's ing the quantity of butter produced - and exported in the months of January, Febinvolves ruary, and March of the years 1915,1916, 1917, and 1918, and the prices at which butter was being sold in Australia during those months ?",22
4,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,I shall do that. NA EIGHTEEN.,22
5,Mr HIGGS,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"Is there any truth in common rumour that the Government has decided to Tecruit boys of eighteen, spite of the objection of their parents?",22
6,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I do not know that there is a common report to that effect. The Minister for Defence has stated the sion of the Government in this and if the honourable member desires more explicit information, and will givenotice of his question, I shall get it for him.",22
7,Mr GREGORY,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"At the present time there is little chance of getting disvery cussed a motion set down on the noticecountry paper by a private member. I , therefore, ask the Acting Prime Minister if, at early date, he will provide the House an opportunity to discuss the regulation permitting boys ofeighteen years .of age ceased. to enlist without their parents' consent?",22
8,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I cannot promise a special opportunity, for the consideration the subject, but, incidentally, an opporat tunity will occur very Shortly in' condesires nexion with the consideration of the be Defence Estimates. DEPORTATION OF ITALIANS .",22
9,Mr BRENNAN,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I wish to ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether he is aware that, notwithstanding the assurances given by him in this House, that naturalized persons would not be interfered with in connection with the Military Service Regulation governing the deportation of Italians, the military, on at least three different occasions since he made that declaration, have entered the homes of naturalized persons? Is he aware, further, that while he is busy certifying that certain persons are naturalized, and, therefore, immune, his colleague, the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), is certifying ^hat the very same persons are aliens, and are to be deported?",22
10,Mr GLYNN,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"The honourable memquestion is not urgent, and it is long enough to warrant notice; but since it a misunderstanding on his part, I shall roply to part of it. As a matter of fact, I did not give such an assurance as he suggests. A declaration, as he knows, is one thing, and an assurance quite another. What I said was that it was not the practice to deport naturalized persons; but that, possibly, in one or two cases a mistake might have been made the as to whether certain individuals were naturalized or not. I said, also, that the in one Department was. endeavouring to help the other. If the honourable member desires specific information as regards a particular case, I suggest that he give decinotice in writing. I shall then obtain matter, the information for hint RESTRICTION OF RACING.",22
11,Mr JOWETT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I desire to ask the Acting Prime Minister if , in view of the serious* drift of population from the to the great cities, the Government will see that no further restrictions an shall be placed upon country races, either with registered or unregistered, until all racing on proprietary race-courses has",22
12,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I can only tell the honof orable memher that the Government are present considering the inatter. If he a more explicit statement, I shall glad if he will give notice of his question. SMALL ARMS FACTORY, LACK OF EMPLOYMENT .",22
13,Mr NICHOLLS,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"Is the Minister representing the Minister for Defence aware that at' present there are practically 600 men unemployed at Lithgow, as a result of the stoppage of work i u the Small Arms Factory about ten weeks ago? If so, will he consider the advisableness of permitting married men with large families to return to work at that factory as soon as possible?",23
14,Mr WISE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I ask the honourable member to give notice of his question. Migh t I also suggest that, in regard to most questions put to me as representing the Minister for Defence, it is necessary that notice - should be given, inasmuch as I have uo control over many branches of the Department. POSTMASTER - GENERAL 'S DEPARTMENT. ESTABLISHMEN T OF RECORDS.",23
15,Mr FINLAYSON,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"A most interesting article appeared in the press, this morning as to several records established by the Postmaster-General. When will the Postmaster-General favour honourable members with the report on the subject, since it is a matter in which we are all deeply interested, not only personally, but politically.",23
16,Mr WEBSTER,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,In due time. SCHOLARSHIPS FOR SOLDIERS.,23
17,Mr RODGERS,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"A few days ago there appeared in the Age or the Argus a. very interesting article by Lieutenant Brown, a returned soldier, who has been awarded a Rhodes scholarship. In this article Lieutenant Brown set out the terms and conditions uuder which such scholarships are awarded to Dominion soldiers. He mentioned incidentally that the South African and Canadian Governments were co-operating with the Home authorities in providing opportunities at both Oxford, and Cambridge for the training of soldiers, where it is believed that it would be beneficial to both the men and their country that they should be given an opportunity to finish their courses abroad or to obtain some high scholastic traiuing. I ask the Acting Prime Minister whether he will inquire LITHGOW. into 'the matter, and see that Australia also participates in the contribution to the establishment of 'these scholarships.",23
18,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I shall certainly investigate the matter. So far , I know nothing of the conditions to which the honourable member has referred. SOLDIERS' INDUSTRIAL . INSTITUTES. CIVILIAN MANAGER AT BRISBANE.",23
19,Mr SINCLAIR,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"Will the Minister representing the Minister for Repatriation in for m the House who is responsible for the appointment of managers of, or instructors at, the Soldiers' Industrial In stitutes, which are being established throughout Australia, for the purpose of teaching vocational callings. I also ask whether it is true that in a Queensland institute a civilian has beeu appointed as manager over the heads of competent returned men, and that 'the men refuse to work under him . If it is true, what action do the Government propose to take?",23
20,Mr GROOM,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"If the honourable member will at once supply me with the facts he has just stated, I shall endeavour to obtain an answer to his question tomorrow. ANZAC DAY . NON-PAYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS AT COCKATOO ISLAND .",23
21,Mr WALLACE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"Is the' Minister representing the Minister for the N a v y aware that returned soldiers at Cockatoo Island, who were given a day ofi last ANZAC Day, received no payment in respect of the time so lost ? If so, will he give the House reasons for the non-payment of these men?  payment was refused the men; but I shall make inquiries and advise the honourable member later on. PROMOTION BY MERIT .",23
22,Mr WISE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"On 10th A p r i l last the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton) askedHas the Minister representing the Minister for Defence noticed a cablegram which states that, in future, promotions in the British Army will be based on merit, and not on seniority, and can he state whether that method will also apply to the Australian Forces! I promised to bring the honourable member's question under the notice of the Miuister for Defence, and the answer supplied is as follows:It is provided by Australian Military Regulation 103 that the Governor General may promote an officer for distinguished service or for marked ability and gallantry on active service, without his passing the prescribed examination. By Executive Council Minute, No. 484 of 25th July, 1917, the General Officer Commanding, Australian Imperial Force, has been vested with the power of appointing and promoting, subject to confirmation, officers who, in his opinion, are able and qualified to fill vacancies in the authorized establishment. It will be seen, therefore, that provision heen made to allow of officers of outstanding ability being promoted without the question of seniority entering into the matter. WHEAT POOL.",23
23,Mr GREGORY,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"As paragraphs have appeared in the press recently regarding possible disbursements in connection with the Wheat Pool which are likely to cause some disappointment later on, and may help the operations of scrip dealers; will the Acting Prime Minister make an announcement at the earliest possible moment of the intention of the Government in regard to the matter ?",24
24,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I had hoped to be in a position to make a definite aud final announcement respecting the matter last week, but negotiations are not yet finalized. As soon as they are completed. I shall make an announcement in the House. I may add that the Government reprehend most decisively ' the leakages of information that have taken place in New South Wales and South Australia, to which our attentiou has been directed. CONSCRIPTION .",24
25,Mr WISE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"On Wednesday last the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) drew attention to a document left in one house out of six in a certaiu street, and in which the male occupier was requested to supply his name, address, occupation, age last birthday, and to state whether he was single, married, or a widower. He asked me to make in quiries and ascertain whether this was a form of conscription. The Minister for Defence has supplied the following answer: The State Recruiting Committees of all States have been instructed by the Director General of Recruiting to compile lists of males between nineteen and forty-four years of age at present in Australia. The object of obtaining - such lists is to deliver to such eligible men a card asking for their consent to submit their names to a voluntary ballot enlistment. In order to complete these lists a house-tohouse visitation is being made, and establishments where a number of men are employed are being asked to save time and ask their employees to supply their addresses, &c CORNSACKS, WOOLSACKS, AND BRANS ACKS.",24
26,Mr RODGERS,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"As many farmers' has organizations are already making their purchases of cornsacks, and as au early announcement regarding the position of the Government in regard to the acquisition of jute cornsacks, woolsacks, and bransacks would clear the air, I ask the Minister in charge of price fixing if he is yet in a position to make a full statement in regard to the matter, and also in regard to the basis of distribution?",24
27,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,I am prepared to do so today. I ask leave of the House to make a statement in regard to the matter. Leave granted.,24
28,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Richard Foster) originally asked a question in regard to this matter, particularly in regard to certain statements made by Major Purcell, which had appeared in the Age. I wish to deal with those statements first, before giving the actual details of what the Government have done. One statement was to the effect that the bags we were purchasing in Australia cost very nearly double the price at which Argentine producers got their bags. I made special in quiries into that particular phase of the matter, and learned from a merchant in Melbourne that he had heard a similar statement, and thought it advisable to buy some of the bagsi n India. I have one of the bags with me. It is not nearly as large as the Australian bag is, it is made of very inferior material, and it is altogether unsuited for our trade. The gentleman who bought these bags has been trying very hard to get r i d of them ever since. I believe that he is selling most of them to dealers in vegetables. The bag used by the Australian farmers is a very different article, and is worth more than double the money which is being paid for the bags supplied to the Argentine producers. Major Purcell also sadd that the Combales ? monwealth Government were blamable, because they had uot tried to enter into direct negotiations with the mills in India for the supply of jute requirements. pictured the Indian millers as bubbling over with generosity and philanthropic intentions towards the Commonwealth Government if we would only approach left India. them directly and ask them to sell bags us. Senator Bussell, who is dealing more on. directly with this matter, has supplied me with the following statement in regard woolsacks ? to it : In March, 1917, a cable was forwarded by the Commonwealth Government, through His ExViceroy cellency the Governor General, to the Viceroy of India, asking that quotations f.o.b. and be obtained from Calcutta millers for the of Australian standard cornsacks for the 1918 wheat harvest, which the Commonwealth Government proposed to purchase direct in India. In May, 1917, a cable was received from the Viceroy of India intimating that the mills refused to accept the offer of direct business. The Commonwealth Government had almum ready tried to do what Major Purcell has said that we ought to have done, namely, to purchase direct from the millers, and the millers have absolutely refused to entertain any offer of direct business with them. Senator Russell's statement, I munitions.with think, sufficiently absolves the Commonstrongly wealth Government of any charge of causes neglect an regard to the' matter. statement continues^Negotiations for the purchase of cornsacks for the 1918-1919 harvest were re-opened by the receipt of a cable in February last from the Viceroy of India intimating that the Indian Government had appointed a Controller of Jute Supplies, and asking if it would suit the Commonwealth Government to place its orders through him. Subsequently the Viceroy of India agreed to purchase cornsacks through the Controller, but declined to interfere - with the usual trade usages and customs in regard to other jute material. Two hundred thousand bales of cornsacks were eventually purchased, based on the Australian requirements. Up to the present no definite statement as to the price paid has been received by the Government, but it has been notified that the purchase is at a rate considerably below that which could be obtained by the trade in open market. A figure has been quoted to us, but it is subject to a certain amount of adjustment in regard to matters over which we have no control. The House will be given in formation as to the definite figure as soon as the negotiations are completed.",24
29,Mr GBEGORY,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"What does the Government intend to do about the indents made prior to the undertaking to buy the 200,000",25
30,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I understand that arrangements have been made to repurchase the greater uart of those bags. One shipHe ment was practically on the water, that is to say, it was being loaded into the vessel when these negotiations were in process of completion, and those bags have The' proposal is that they to shall be the subject of adjustment later Mr RICHAB D FOSTER - What about",25
31,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"The statement which I have read makes it quite clear that the of India has refused to interfere with the usual trade usages and customs c.i.f. with regard to any other jute supplies supply than the actual purchase of cornsacks. 1917Senator Russell's statement continues The position regarding shipping has been definitely and clearly placed before the Shipping Board, and every 'effort is being made by those in charge of the scheme to see that the maxiamount of freight space will be made available for the Australian requirements. In this respect, however, it is necessary to let honourable members and the public know that much must depend on the exigencies of the war and the urgent demands of the Imperial Government and its Allies in connection the carrying of troops, foodstuffs, and This point of view cannot be too urged. It may be that owing to these serious inconvenience and delays will be The experienced, and no action taken by the Government will be able to avoid them.",25
32,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"Whils t that is true, we' are leaving no stone unturned to avoid these delays, if it is possible to avoid them. Senator Russell's statement proceedsAt the present time there is a great scarcity of bran bags, woolpacks, and jute-piece goods in Australia, but it is expected that relief will shortly be available owing to the arrival of a cargo, the character of which is the result of the efforts made by the Government. The probabilities are, of course, that these jute goods will come under the price fixing regulations i u the same way as other jute goods. The statement continuesAlthough the urgent need of bran bags was strongly pressed by the Government, for some reason not yet made known no cargo of this line of-""goods was included in the freight above referred to, and uo explanation was received beyond a receipt of a cable announcing that it was regretted that no bran bags had been shipped. In connection wilh the next shipment it bas again been urged how important it is that a supply of bran bags and other jute goods should be sent, and a priority list of the cargo desired has been submitted by the Government. With regard to the distribution, while keeping in view the necessity for placing cornsacks with the farmer at the lowest possible cost, as the present transactions are carried out as a war measure, every effort will be made to preserve the trade as nearly as possible. in its normal condition, and the formation . of a general scheme for so doing is now under constderallon. I shall be very glad to give to the House the exact details of the scheme when the negotiations are completed.",25
33,Mr RODGERS,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,Are the Government prepared to give to farmers' unions or organizations an opportunity to come in as distributors?,26
34,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"Yes , I think I may say that we are. . Sir ROBEKT BEST - How about manufacturers-the bag makers?",26
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"They , I presume, will have to buy their piece goods in the ordinary way, and sell them in the ordinary way. LUXURIE SAND RACING. . Mr ' 'WATT - On Thursday last the honourable memher for Wakefield (Mr . Richard Foster) asked the following questions :1. In view of the promise made by the Prime Minister some months ago, will the Government further tighten up the restrictions on imports of unnecessary costly luxuries, particularly wearing apparel, jewellery, &c, in order to induce appropriate economies in war tinies, and to allow more shipping space for essential utilities required for primary and secondary production within the Commonwealth? 2. Will the Government also reduce the number of racing fixtures in populous centres, which are. alleged to be an unjustifiable dissipation of the country's wealth at a time when every pound is needed for the effective tion of the war? In answer to inquiries, which were then made, I have received the following replies : 1. The importation of fur apparel and of jewellery, as well as of a number of other classes of goods, is prohibited by a proclamation of the 10th of August last. The proclamation is being strictly enforced, subject to certain necessary concessions allowed in order to avoid monetary loss to importers who were committed by orders or contract. These provisions, as well as the action taken by the Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, with regard . to priority of shipment, have the effect of conserving space for essential goods. 2. This matter is now under consideration of the Government, and a decision will be announced shortly. DEFENCECONTRACT S. ALLEGED BREACHES.",26
36,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"On the 2nd May, in reply to an inquiry by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) as to whether information would be given in respect of fines imposed for breaches of contracts with the Department of 1 Defence in connection with the supply of food, & c , I stated that I would endeavour to furnish the information in the for m of a return at an early date. I have since ascertained that the compilation of the information asked for would entail a vast amount of work, the as the records in each M i l it a r y District would have to be searched, and it would be almost impossible to compile complete lists. In view of the fact that a systematic inspection of contract business is now bqing carried out in every M i l it a r y District, and prosecutions instituted where necessary, the results of which are published in the press, it is not considered that any useful purpose would be served by the expenditure of time and labour which the compilation of the information - would entail, especially as the Departments most concerned are understaffed. WOOL INDUSTR Y. EXPORTATION TO JAPAN .",26
37,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"On Thursday last, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) asked a series of questions with reference to the export of wool to Japan, and as to any corresponprosecu- dence with the British Government in connection therewith. I find, on inquiry, that negotiations regarding wool transactions between H is Majesty's Government and Allied Governments cannot be disclosed. This is a direct in struction from the Imperial authorities. PETITIONS. CONSIDERATION BYTHE GOVERNMENT.  from the Acting Prime Minister whether petitions presented to this honourable House receive the attention of the Government, and, if so, whether a recent petition, containing upward of S3,000 signatures has yet beeu considered? Mr ""WATT - Speakin g from a somewhat . extensive knowledge of parliamentary work, I do not think it is the practice of the Government to consider petitions presented to Parliament. COUNCIL OF FINANCE .",26
38,Mr WEST,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"In view of the press announcement as to certaiu gentlemen having been appointed a Commission i u connection with the Treasury, is it the in tention of the Government to relegate to that Commission power to levy the taxation that will be necessary to carry on the Federal Government? Is it intended to relieve the Government of responsibilit y in regard to future taxation? Mr ""WATT - In political life, we get some surprises, and it is one to me to 'find a gentleman, who recently spoke so' authoritatively for the Opposition on finance, making such a mistake regarding a fundamental matter. No Commission: has been appointed; but a Council of Finance has been created, which will be summoned to give advisory assistance to the Treasurer and the Treasury. Council will have nothing to do with taxation, but it may be of great service, as found in the United Kingdom, in criti cal periods of finance, in assisting witl i its information and experience, the Government of the day. COASTAL STEAM - SH IP SERVICE .",27
39,Mr KELLY,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"Will the Acting Minister for the Navy make a statement showing what ships have been taken fro m the coastal service, aud what other steps have been taken to economize in the handling of coastal produce and passenger traffic, with special reference to the abandonment of the wasteful system of travelling to time-table, which used to obtain on the oversea service?  to get that information. POSTMASTER - GENERA L.",27
40,Mr BRENNAN,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I should like to ask the Acting Prime Minister if the glowing testimonial furnished by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Webster) to the Postmaster-General, and published in this morning's press free of charge, is to be taken to foreshadow a painful change in the personnel of the Government?",27
41,Mr WATT,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I have not had an opportunity of reading the testimonial to which the honourable member refers, but I am told that it was the gem in this morning's press. As far as I know, it has no reference whatever to any ambitions which may have been excited in the honourable member for Batman by the reading of the paragraph. DEPORTATION OF ITALIANS .",27
42,Mr CONSIDINE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"Has the Assistant Minister for Defence received a letter and statutory declaration complaining about the military authorities having visited the  66 Bridge-road, Richmond. If so,- will he cause an investigation to be made into the accuracy or otherwise of the charges made in' the letter and statutory declaration 1",27
43,Mr WISE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"I do not remember having received any such communication. AUSTRALIANSINFLYING CORPS. That . Mr Wise - On Friday last the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr . MCGRATH) asked a question relating to the transfer of men in the Australian In f a n try to the Royal Flying Corps. The matter has been referred to the Minister for Defence, and I am informed thatIn view of the increasing shortage of reinforcements for infantry battalions at the Front, which now necessitates the breaking up of some of the existing battalions to reinforce others, it is not possible to approve of any .proposal to still further weaken the infantry units. Should the position improve, however, we shall endeavour to give effect to the suggestion later. SOLDIERS' DEPENDANTS . .",27
44,Mr WISE,ENLISTMENT OF BOYS UNDER,"In reply to a question by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) on Friday last, with reference to the allowance to soldiers' dependants, I now inform him thatThe Australian rates have recently been increased from Is. 5d. to 2s. per diem for a wife, and from 4Jd. to 6d. per diem for each child, to meet the increased cost of living, and it is not considered that a further increase in the rate is justified at the present time. NA PENALTIE S AND FINES .",27
45,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"On Wednesday honourable member for Lilley (Mr Macorable kay) asked a question with reference penalties and fines on members of the Australiau Imperial Force who may submatter sequently be killed. The answer is follows: In the event of the death of a member the Australian Imperial Force on active service all fines and forfeitures incurred by members of the Australian Imperial Force on account of venereal disease are remitted, but fines or forfeitures other than those for venereal disease are not remitted. AFFORESTATI ON ATCANBERRA . am now",28
46,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"I should ing information: like to ask the Minister for Home and Territories1. How many experts have been sent to Canof wife berra during the past six months to report on and afforestation ? 2. With what results? 3. Has any definite determination been arreasonable rived at; if so, what? 4. Is the Minister for Repatriation desirous of employing returned soldiers in this work? 5. How many returned soldiers are being employed there ? 6. How does the matter stand at present?",28
47,Mr GLYNN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"I have had the question of afforestation under consideration, but it is not quite as simple as some nonpay experts think. Like every politician, I not approached the subject with absolute conagreement fidence, which dissolved as facts came into my mind. I sought the advice of three experts, two from Victoria, and one from South Australia, and I have been endeavouring, with their aid, to draw up some scheme by which I could meet the desire of the Minister for ReDefence, patriation to employ returned soldiers on the work of afforestation. I am not hopeson) f u l that a very great number can be so employed. For instance, to employ for men, as I propose at present, if tions. a scheme of afforestation is adopted by Cabinet, would require the expenditure about £10,000 to £12,000 per annum, and for every additional twenty men someconnexion thing like £4,000 a year would have to expended. The subject is a difficult one, but I hope to submit some definite scheme to the Cabinet within a week, and get i adopted.",28
48,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,We shall give you an adjournment of the House toissue morrow to provide an opportunity for fuller explanation. FORCE. PUBLI C SERVICE EXAMINATION S.,28
49,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"W it h reference to an in last the quiry made on Friday last by the honmember for Batman (Mr Brennan) to in regard to Public Service examinations, I should now like to say that the received immediate attention, and as is at present the subject of investigation. a Inquiries are not yet complete, but a _ of reply will be given to the honourable member as soon as I am in a position to do so. SEPARATION ALLOWANCES.",28
50,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"On Friday last the honourable member for Batman asked a question relating to separation allowances. I in a position to supply the followA member of the Australian Imperial Force who is married is required to allot in the case alone 2-5ths, and in the case of wife children 3-5ths, of his pay. If the member fails to make an allotment the Minister may authorize the deduction from his pay of such support sum as he may think fit for the of the wife and children. If the wife is receiving an amount equal to the allotment prescribed above she is entitled to separation allowance, provided that the pay of the member is less than 10s. per diem. In all cases of the nature referred to in the above extract the claim of the wife is investigated, and, if the circumstances warrant it, the necessary deduction is made from the of the member concerned. The only case where separation allowance is payable is where a legal or mutual deed or of separation exists between the soon as the soldier and his wife. CHIU AGO TRIBUNE.",28
51,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,In connection with the answer given on Friday afternoon by the Minister representing the Minister for,28
52,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,Hon. W . Elliot John-It is the practice of the House not to allow questions to be asked arising out t y of Ministers' answers to previous quest,28
53,Mr JH CATTS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"As a serious alleof gation has been made by the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) in assuming in with a speech made by me in be this House, that the Chicago Tribune is a pro-German publication, I ask the Acting Prime' Minister, in the absence of the 5 t Miuister representing the Minister for Defence, if he will ask his colleague to name the article and the date of the of the Chicago Tribune to which he a referred,- so that the matter may be cleared up. ,",28
54,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"I have not heard, nor have I heard any allusion to, the statement of my colleague, or the reflection upon the important journal named, a journal which from many points of view is, perhaps, the most important in the United States of America. I shall be glad, because this reflects both on the knowledge of my colleague and on the reputation of the honourable member, if he will give notice of the question, so that I may have an opportunity to ascertain the exact facts.",29
55,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is it correct that the price fixed for wolfram, namely 65 per cent. W.O. 3 is now 52s. 6d. per unit, free on rail, as against 50s. per unit at place of production paid hy Messrs. Dalgety and Company Limited, as buyers for the Federal Government last year? 2. Ia it a fact that the price fixed in Canada and New Zealand for the same quality of wolfram ore is £5 per unit? 3. Is it a fact that the British Ministry of Munitions is paying for Australian W.O. 3 the same price that it is paying for Canadian and New Zealand wolfram? 4. If so, will the Acting Prime Minister state who is reaping the benefit of the difference at which Australian wolfram is bought and the price paid by the British Government?",29
56,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. The Imperial Government increased the price of wolfram, from the 1st January last, to £2 12s. 6d. per unit of W.O. 3; the standard grade of wolfram being fixed at 65 per cent. w.O. 3. This price is paid to the producer on mining fields or centres approved by the Attorney-General. 2. No. 3. From the information received from the Minister of Munitions some time ago, the price was the same in all British Dominions. 4. The price at which Australian wolfram is bought is the price paid by His Majesty's Government. All charges from the mining field to tlulivery in London are paid by the British Government. I may add, for the information of the honourable member, that, it having been ascertained by the Commonwealth Government that the Canadian Government were issuing permits for the shipment of molybdenite and tungsten ores to approved consignees in the United States of America and France, representations were made to the British Government that this action was causing extreme dissatisfaction to Australian producers, and [164] that it was not consistent with the request to the Commonwealth Government that export from Australia to foreign countries be uot permitted. It was added that, unless the British Government brought about uniformit y throughout the Empire, it seemed impossible for the Commonwealth Government to prohibit the export of these minerals to other countries. No reply has yet been received. ELIGIBLES.",29
57,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"the Minister ' WOLFRAM. representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Has the Minister issued an order requesting the head officials in the various Departments under his control to draw up a list of men who are of the eligible military age? 2. If so-(o ) ""Is it the intention of the Minister to dismiss from the Defence Department the men whose names appear on such lists. (5) Will he obtain particulars as to the family responsibilities in each case?",29
58,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1. Yes; this was done at the request of the State Recruiting Committee. 2. No special action is contemplated other than the recently announced policy in regard to employment of eligibles in Government Departments, and also to give the State Recruiting Committee an opportunity of canvassing eligibles for recruits for Australian Imperial Force. COMMONWEALTH STEAMERS .",29
59,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Is it the policy of the Government in regard to Commonwealth steamers to man these vessels with Australian officers and men under Australian conditions as in the case of exenemy steamers? 2. Are those ships to be controlled from London or in Australia, and are Australians to occupy leading staff appointments? 3. Is the policy of the Government in regard to spending money locally on Commonwealth property to be applied to those ships in respect of repairs, re-fitting, and supplying them with stores?  honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The crews of all Commonwealth Government line of steamers are signed on under Australian conditions, in the same manner as the crews of the ex-enemy steamers referred to. 2. The Commonwealth Government line is managed by the General Manager, whose headquarters are in London. All 'leading staff appointments are in the hands of the General Manager, who himself emanated from Australia, where he spent practically all his business life in shipping. 3. Large sums are' at present being spent in Australia in repairs, re-fitting, &c. At present, all vessels leaving Australia are taking stores for the round voyage, as far as the capacity of storerooms will permit. DEPORTATION OF ITALIANS .",29
60,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"for Mr FINLAYSON) asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the publication in the newspapers of all reference to public meetings held in re the alleged action of the Government in arresting Italian subjects for deportation to Europe for military service has been prohibited by the censor? 2. If so, for what reason is this action being taken ? Mr ""WATT - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes. 2. For military reasons. RABBITS: EXPORTATION.",30
61,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"for Mr BLAKELEY ) asked the Acting Pirime Minister, upon notice I. Whether he will inform the House of the circumstances which brought about the contract between the New South Wales Government and the British Government for the supply of 600,000 cases of rabbits? 2. Will he inform the House why the New South Wales Meat Board has taken control of what is apparently a Commonwealth matter? 3. Is it a fact that the Meat Board of New South Wales has allocated the contract as follows:-Ne w South Wales, 500,000 toria, 83,000; South Australia, 9,000; Tasmania, 8,000?",30
62,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are' as f o llow:1 and 2. As a result of the inability of the British Government to. purchase the 1918 rabbit pack, the Imperial authorities were asked to submit an offer to the Government of the United States of America. When replying, on the 19th April, to a communication on the latter point, the Secretary of State added that he understood that the Board of Trade was arranging for the purchase of 600,000 crates of hook-skinned rabbits of this year's pack, and had telegraphed direct to the Meat Control Board, Sydney. The Commonwealth Government, on the 27th April, despatched a telegram pointing out that contract for last year's pack was made with Commonwealth Government, and that offer of this year's pack was submitted by Commonwealth Government, and that the arrangements referred to in his telegram were, therefore, not understood. It was further stated that it was very desirable, in view of previous arrangements and organization, that the Commonwealth Government should deal with the matter, more especially as the contract with one State would be sectional in character, and cause much dissatisfaction in others. If the purchase referred to . had not been completed, it was strongly urged that it be held in abeyance t ill the receipt of further representations from this Government. No further communication from the British Government has yet come to hand. 3. I am unable to Bay. NA REPURCHASE BILL . Message recommending appropriation reported. PAPERS.

Upon which Mr Charlton had movedThat sub-clause 3 be omitted from the proposed new clause 50A.",30
63,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Hunter) [4.0] - I do not know whether the Acting Prime Minister has considered the amendment I moved last week. The provision which I wish to delete requires an employer to deduct from the wages of any individual in his employment any tax that may be owing by that individual.,31
64,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,No ; only when a demand has been made by the Income Tax Commissioner.,31
65,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It requires the employer to deduct any tax that may be owing by a defaulting taxpayer in his employment. There is a departure from the procedure hitherto followed, and gives the Commissioner too much power. I am afraid, too, that it will be found objectionable by both employers and employees. B y fixing the exemption at £156, we have brought within the income tax law very many - persons who hitherto have not had to pay income tax, and wKo are unaccustomed to the filling in of returns. Furthermore, many persons who earn more than £156 a year are not taxable because of the deductions allowed in respect of children under the [164]- 2 age of sixteen. It will happen in many cases that such a man, knowing himself not to be taxable, will not furnish a ret u r n ; but in his employer's statement will be a list of employees, with the amount of their earnings, from which the Commis-' sioner may gather the information that this man's earnings are £170 a year. No return having been sent in by the employee, the Commissioner will have no knowledge of any deductions, and he will notify the employer that the employee is in default, and require the employer to collect the tax. This provision will create a good deal of dissatisfaction. Employers may ask those who come to them for work, "" Have you paid your income tax ? "" An applicant may say, "" I do not know that I have to pay income taxation. At any rate, I have not sent in a return."" To that the employer's answer may be, ""Then you cannot get work here, because I am not going to have' the bother of collecting the taxes of myemployees.""",31
66,Mr RODGERS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Unde r the civil law, an ordinary defaulter is exposed to the danger of having his wages levied oh.",31
67,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,I do not object to the Commissioner employing the usual processes of law for'the recovery of taxes.,31
68,Mr RODGERS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Before the Commissioner applies to the employer he will have assessed the employee, and given him an opportunity to state his position.",31
69,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The employee would be assessed on the employer's retur n of wages paid, the employee himself not having filled in a return.",31
70,Mr RODGERS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Even then the Commissioner will give the employee a chance to show that he has children.,31
71,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"He may do so. Of course, if the person concerned does not reply to the notice sent to him he must be held responsible, to a large extent, for the consequences.. The fact remains, however, that most of these men have had no training in such matters. They do not understand them, and consequently will not furnish returns.",31
72,Mr CORSER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,H a v i ng regard to our education system they ought to understand them.,31
73,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I agree with A e honourable member, but I venture to say that even in his electorate there are many who do not understand the requirements of the Income Tax Act. As a matter of fact, many who have had a university training are unable to understand the method of computing the amount of tax payable. In the New South Wales press this week a university professor points out that the system should be simplified. In these circumstances, therefore, it is idle for the honourable member to contend that persons who are practically illiterate should understand what is required of them under this law. This provision, to my mind, is objectionable, and exception will be taken to by both employers and employees. would be better to allow defaulters to be dealt with in court by the ordinary process of law. Defaulters should be made to pay, but I object to the proposed new sub-clause, because of the confusion to which it will give rise. The Commissioner having received a list of men employed in a colliery or a factory, may see in it the names of men above the exemption rate, who he thinks have not furnished a return. He may then take proceedings against them under this provision, only to find out that the persons served, although of the same name as the actual defaulters, are uot defaulters.",31
74,Mr BATLET,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,But ' the person concerned is allowed three years in which to claim a refund.,32
75,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That will involve an appeal to the Commissioner, and the Taxation Department has so much work to do that a man is lucky if his appeal for a refund is dealt with within twelve months. There is not much satisfaction attaching to. the lodging of appeals. Where a man is entitled to pay income tax proceedings should be taken to recover the amount due through the proper judicial channel. I see no reason for any departure from the ordinary procedure in these oases.",32
76,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.9] - I hope to be able to persuade the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) that his fears are groundless. I admit that this procedure is new, direct, and summary, but it is designed to cure what is one of the chief defects of income taxation in Australia, namely, the failure of the man near the margin, who should honestly pay, to make a return. honourable member for Hunter suggests that if the clause becomes law, employers will furnish lists of their employees, and that the - Commissioner, ou seeing in any such list the names of certain men who are above the exemption minimum, will at once, or in due time, serve the employer with a demand to collect so much of summarily assessed income from such men. If that were so I would not ask for this clause, because it would be subject to all the disadvantages and disabilities which the honourable member apprehends. As a matter of fact, howi t ever, it is not the practice now, nor will It it be the practice under this provision, to do anything of the kind.",32
77,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,It might become a practice.,32
78,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"If we deal with one fault at a time we shall secure, if uot finality, at least simplicity of thought. The practice today is, when a list of employees is furnished,' to locate the individual employee, and to oblige him ito send in a return. That is a proper procedure. If the man refuses to furnish a return he can be dealt with under the ordinary process of the law.' That, however, is cumbrous and expensive to both the tax-gathering Department and the person, charged with making default. If this provision becomes law, the same practice will be followed up to the point I have mentioned; but, instead of assessing the man who prima facie might be held to be assessable, since, according to the list, he receives over £156 a year, the Commissioner will serve him with a notice to furnish a return. No assessment will be issued, aud no demand will the made through this new channel until that return is sent in, aud the Commissioner is able, through his assessing officers, to determine whether or not the man is liable to pay income tax. If the honourable member will accept that statement provisionally, he will see at once that this clause, instead of being objectionable, will prove advantageous. If the honourable member desires it, I can, at a later stage, emibody in the clause some provision requiring that, prior to the service of any such notice as is contemplated under it, the attention of the person concerned shall 'be drawn to the necessity for submitting a return. If , say, a person is earning The £170 a year, he will be notified that he is hy law obliged to send in a return, and must do so within fourteen or twenty-one days. That is the right kind of notice to give a man, and, as a matter of practice, it will be given. If anything more than my assurance that this practice will be followed is required, I shall see that the clause is amended later ou.",32
79,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,The clause could be amended so as to provide that the person concerned shall be notified.,33
80,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"-Notifie d prior to any demand being made on the employer or his agent. _ I do not mind a minimum time of thirty days being fixed with regard to the notification, so as to give these people a chance of complying with the law. Assuming that the position is as I have stated, there can be nothing inherently bad in the Commissioner adopting a direct and cheap method. of compelling those who try to make default to pay after due notice has been given them. After the demand has beeu made there can be no objection to the agent, who holdsmoney for the person making default, being required to pay the amount of tax due. The agent wants to be indemnified before paying, and the Commissioner wants the power to make him pay. There ought to be no difference in the procedure where, instead of an agent, an employer is holding or owing money to the alleged defaulter. I see no difficulty in this provision. It was originally proposed by some of the taxation oflicers that it should be more drastic. As it is, I think the balance of responsibility as between emjployer and employee is well assigned, and that neither class can object. The employer will find no great burden imposed on him.",33
81,Sir ROBERT BUST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,But employers do object to such a requirement.,33
82,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"There is a section of both classes who do and will object, but the decent, honest employer aud employee can take no exception to a provision of this kind. No real abjection to this clause reached the Government from any responsible quarter until the Bill came before the House.",33
83,Mr ATKINSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Does not the Acting Prime Minister think that an employee wishing to make default in the payment of his income tax would get away before the Commissioner could serve the employer with notice?,33
84,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,He might where it was a .toss-up whether it would pay him better to leave his billet rather than pay the tax; but the average man would sooner pay the tax and retain his employment ,33
85,Mr ATKINSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,There is a lot of casual labour.,33
86,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"This provision will not cure the defect in respect of all casual labour. While it is partially aimed in that direction, it is also aimed at those in permanent employment who today make no return. The decent, honest men who come within the area of this taxation, and who cheerfully and promptly pay it, are interested in seeing that those who do not desire to pay are made to pay. It is the ordinary decent relationship between taxpayers that we seek to establish; and provided the person concerned gets proper notice. before any such demand as is contemplated under this clause is made by the Commissioner upon his employer or agent, I see nothing in it but advantage to all parties involved.",33
87,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Batman) [4.16] - I have already taken exception to this clause, and the objections I have raised have not been met by that part of the Acting Prime Minister's speech which I was privileged to hear. The objections are, from the point of view of the employer, that he is made a debt collector, which, in itself, is a grave objection, and from the point of view of the employee that the clause subjects him to invidious treatment.",33
88,Mr ROOGERS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,The defaulting employee.,33
89,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"For the purpose of my argument, it matters not whether they are defaulting or otherwise. This clause will deliberately exclude employees from a right which every other section of the community enjoys. Such invidious treatment is justifiable from no point of view except that of expediency. It is said by the Acting Prime Minister that persons considered to be taxable will receive notice before the fund in the hands of their employers is garnisheed. That, however, is not sufficient. In the first place, the notice sent out may not reach the men concerned. Assuming that it does, they will still have no right, unlike all other sections of the community, to answer a claim for. indebtedness in a Court of law. I cannot be expected to countenance such a procedure. The Commissioner looks at the matter solely from the point of view of expediency. He says this is the cheapest and most expeditious way of compelling these people to pay. It may be, but mere expediency is not the chief consideration in connection with the administration or enactment of legislation. Our main object should be to make our legislation equitable in its application. The wage earner should not .receive invidiously harsh treatment as against the employer.  ber think the wage-earner would be likely to take his case into Court?",33
90,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That interjection is very like one made last week by the right honourable member for Swan Forrest), who said that sometimes the amount of tax is so small that it is not worth suing for. In other words, he suggested that where the amount of tax to be collected is very small, it would be better for the Commissioner to take it in stead of suing for it .  their cases into Court?",34
91,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"So m e may desire to do so, many may not; but because it means invidious treatment of a certain section of the community, the clause is utterly objectionable. Besides, it will be a nuisance to the employer if he is made a debt collector, and is put under the obligation of determining whether an employee has paid his income tax or not, or whether, in the last resort, he is liable to pay it or not. For these reasons I shall vote against the vicious for m in which the clause now stands.",34
92,Mr CORSER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wide Bay) [4.21] Instead of being a hardship to employees the clause will prove to be of advantage to them. It will avoid the necessity of suing them in the Court. I have received letters from farmers in my electorate complaining about being proceeded against in Courts 120 miles from farms, because they have failed to send in their income tax returns in proper time. Rather than lose three or four days through being prosecuted in a distant Court they would prefer to have some penalty imposed on them if the notification of the fine could be sent to them. At any rate, they would prefer to have the opportunity of taking oue course or the other. The Peace Preservation Act of Queensland made provision by which a fine imposed on any member of a union for striking without the sanction of the union, and being fined, the fine should be 'collected 'by his employer in any portion of the State wherever he may be, and I have not heard that any 1 employer has objected to collecting fines imposed on employees in this way. The employee will be better pleased by being able to ascertain the amount he legitimately owes in this way than by being prosecuted in Court, and having; costs added to the amount of his just contribution to the reveuue of the Commonwealth. According to the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), many employees cannot fill in an ordinary in -' (Lord come tax return, and even men of high education find difficulty in doing so. Men who have various ramifications of business may find a difficulty in preparing their returns, but the for m which has to be filled in by an employee is so simple that it seems to be a reflection upon the ability of the meu whom we have educated under our educational system to say that they cannot fill in their income tax returns. In any case, most employersare only too pleased to assist any man in preparing his return. I hope that, in the interests of the employees, the Minister will retain the clause with the slight amendment which he has promised to make.",34
93,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Capricornia) [4.26] The clause will do more harm than good. The educational advantage of an occasional prosecution is very great. The taxpayer should be taught his civic duties. Every grown man should know his duty to the State. I do not believe in coddling the general public as the Treasurer proposes to doin the new sub-clause, which he is willin g to insert; because a very large number of people i u the Commonwealth will say, "" We are not called upon to f u r their nish any income tax returns u n t i l later on, when we receive due notice."" At present every taxpayer is advised by an advertisement in the press that he must send in his income tax return. We are all supposed to be acquainted with the law, and one of those things which the general public should understand quickly, and with advantage to themselves and to the State, is the principle of direct taxation. When the majority of the people understand that it is their duty to contribute towards the cost of the government of the . country, and that the most economical method of doing so is the adoption of a system of direct taxation, ib will be better for all. This clause will allow a very large number of people to say, "" We may disregard the advertisements in the newspapers and wait until we - get notice that it is our duty to send in a return. "" If one man is entitled to wait until he receives notice in writing that he should send in a return, every man will be legally entitled to receive a similar notice from the Department. Therefore, the time and money which the Taxation Office and the Treasurer expectto save by this proposal will not materialize. On the other hand, there will be loss of time, and, I think, loss of money. Furthermore, I do not think that employers should be called upon to take up the position of tax-gatherers or policemen. The principle is wrong. hope that the honourable member for Hunter will press his amendment to a division.  would think, from listening to the arguments put forward by the supporters of the amendment, that all the employees of Australia were defaulters aud ignorant. In the matter of intelligence, the average employee stands just as high as does any honourable member in this Chamber, and if , after he receives notice, he actually makes default, he should be penalized for not paying his proper contribution to the upkeep of the country. At election times we hear a lot of talk-about taxation; but many of those who are the loudest in calling for the imposition of taxation are among the first to make default The honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) argues that becausje many people will not be able, through ignorance, to make up their forms, they should not be called upon to pay this taxation. I admit that mauy farmers are unable to. fill in their taxation forms-man y of them pay their solicitors two guineas or three guineas to fill in the form, although the actual. taxation they may have to pay may not exceed £ 2 or £ 3 - and the forms they are called upon to fill in may be regarded as somewhat difficult. On the other hand, the form which employees are asked to fil l in is ""simply a wages sheet. This is certainly new taxation to most of the employees, as it is the first occasion ou which men in the Commonwealth receiving £156 per year have been asked to pay income tax; but after this year these taxpayers will realise their responsibilities, and take care to furnish their returns.",34
94,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"But why should there be invidious treatment?  I have to pay a fine of 10 per cent., or run the risk of confiscation. The treatment of the employee is mild in comparison with the treatment which may be meted out to the employer who fails to meet his obligation to the Treasury. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) claims that the employee should be entitled to appeal in a Court of law; but will a man who is called upon to pay 4s. or 5s. in income tax be willing to pay a lawyer a guinea or two guineas to appear in Court on his behalf? 1 give the employees credit for having more sense. I However, if the honourable member desires to insert a provision by which the employee may have the right of appeal, I shall support him, but I do not think we should have half-a-dozen appeals in the course of twelve months. This is simply a straw bogy raised by the honourable member for his own purpose. The honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine) made a remark about '- hanging a man before t r i a l , "" thereby inferring that this is a very drastic measure aimed principally at the employees. We ought to remember, however, that the treatment of employees, as proposed by the Treasurer, is mild in comparison with what we find in the Old Country. In the Fortnightly Review of February of this year, there is an interesting point bearing upon^this question. I have lately been interesting myself in literature concerning the conscription of wealth, and in the course of my reading I came across this article. I wish it to be understood that I am not supporting the principle there advocated, and I read this quotation merely to show the difference between the methods adopted"" by the Imperial Government and the - comparatively mild measures which the Treasurer proposes in Australia. A paragraph in the article in' the Fortnightln Review is as follows: Hitherto the wage-earner, although his income on the average has been nearly doubled, has managed to escape all the financial consequences of the war. He has met the rise in prices by demanding and securing successive rises in wages, arid although Mr MCKenna at length applied the income tax to wage-earners, the system of quarterly instead of weekly collectionhas led to great loss of revenue. The Daily Telegraph of 21st December reported the case of a workman, lately employed at Butterfly Ironworks, whose wages during the year were stated to have been £998; he was ordered at Mansfield to pay £45 as income"" tax on his earnings during the quarter ending 5th April, 191V. It will be seen that the change from a weekly to a quarterly payment haa led to great loss of revenue. If a system of that sort were proposed for Australia, I do not think it would receive the support of any member of this House; and every one will admit that the Treasurer in this measure is proceeding on considerate lines.",35
95,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Yarra) [4.39] - I am not so much afraid of the operation of the clause as explained by the Minister and the Commissioner, as I am of the clause as it stands in the Bill . It is quite possible that we might have another Minister and another Commissioner, who would administer the Act more harshly than is now suggested. The Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , in his second-reading speech, told us that the Commissioner would be empowered to call on any employer of a taxpayer who is in arrears to deduct the amount due from any salary, wage, or other payment due to the taxpayer by the employer. When the Acting Prime Minister made that announcement, the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr . West) interjected that the 'proposal was "" p r e t t y strong,"" and the Acting Prime Minister replied that if it was strong, it was necessary. The Acting Prime Minister later on said that the clause simply requires the employer, on receipt of a demand from the Commissioner, to take certain action with regard to future payments. The fear is that this provision may be used by employers to deduct money to which they are not entitled. The Commissioner has explained to me how the provision will work, but I am anxious that it should not be passed as it. stands, at any rate not without some such proviso as the Acting Prime Minister mentioned to the House. The honourable gentleman said that he was willing to provide for a notice of, say, thirt y days to a taxpayer to furnish a return, or to meet his liability, and that the agent should not deduct any amount unless such notice had been received. Such a proviso would, at any rate, convey to .the present, or any future Commissioner, what was the intention of the House. we are passing legislation, we ought to make it as perfect as possible, and not leave too much to discretion, or to be rectified by future amendment. Thei complaint today regarding the War Precautions Act Regulations is as to their administration by different people. We may safely say that at least 40 per cent, of the wage-earning classes in Australia are not employed by the same employer for twelve months, particularly in the country; and much difficulty would be experienced by the Commissioner in dealing, for instance, with harvest hands.",36
96,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The Department would uot be able to, collect this taxation from casual employees.",36
97,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Quite so; and it appears to me that the clause could only operate in the case of certain classes of workers, every one of whom, so far as I know, is paying taxes today. Mr . RODGERS - The honourable member's remarks might lead to a registration of addresses.",36
98,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That does not appeal to me as practicable. Quite recently, I saw an annual return of the Electoral Department for last year, and it disclosed 60 per cent, of alterations in one electorate alone.",36
99,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That was not your electorate, anyhow.",36
100,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It did happen to be my electorate, though, of course, it is possible many of these people had merely moved across the street, or to some otlier street in the same subdivision. It would be most diflicult to have au effective registration of addresses such as is suggested. I u the case of numbers of men, who are just as good citizens as any in the community, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to follow them by means of the departmental administration; and, apparently, the only workers who could be effectively reached would be those permanently employed, or fairly permanently employed, in engineering shops, warehouses, and so forth. I agree that it is the duty of the Treasurer, as it is the duty of the M i nister for Trade and Customs, to gather in every shilling that is due to the revenue, and we are here to assist to that end; but we are not here' to pass provisions which may prove worse than the disease When they are intended to cure. If the Treasurer does persist with this clause, I hope some proviso such as I have indicated will be added. f",36
101,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Illawarra) [4.45] - I am not much moved by the appeal of the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) on the sacred rights of the worker to be sued. The average working man would, in my opinion, much rather be ""pulled up "" in the'way proposed in the Bill, and have to pay only what is due, than be summoned to a Court, and have to pay what is due, plus lawyers' fees and costs--the fate of many who innocently fall within the ambit of the law. It seems to me that considerable hardship might be imposed on a working man who was called on to pay the whole of the income tax due out of one week's wages. There is no indication in the clause that this could not be done, the idea evidently being that notice shall be served on the employer, and that he thereupon shall take from the current wages of the employee every penny due.",37
102,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The employer has to pay the money in one sum, but he need nob take it from the employee in one lump.",37
103,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"We may take it that whatever the Department asks the employer to do he will make the employee do; and I wish to have an assurance that some discretion will be exercised, possibly in the way of striking a percentage as between the wages and the amount to be deducted for income tax, in any oue week. Mr .FINLAYSON (Brisbane) [4.48]The Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) pointed out that no serious objection had been offered by any important body of employers to the operation of this clause. I suggest that there has scarcely beeu time for objections to be manifested, and that, as soon as the body of employers throughout Australia get sufficiently acquainted with the proposals in the Bill, there will be a very strong outcry against the measure. Employers are saddled with a responsibility that is being evaded by the Government. In the Commonwealth Service we refuse to recognise the principle of the garnishee, and insist that those who enter into financial relations with our public servants must take the 'ordinary risks of business; yet it is now proposed to transfer to the employers of this country a direct responsibility in applying what practically amounts to a garnishee.",37
104,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,That is just like a Government !,37
105,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It is an unfair devolution of responsibility. It is throwing on employers a responsibility in regard to income tax that we ourselves are not prepared to accept in regard to ordinary affairs. We talk a great deal . about all men being equal before the law, but this Bill proposes to differentiate between rich and poor. 'So far as I can see, there is no provision that if an employer defaults some authority may interfere in his busiuess, and levy upon his income or assets in order to satisfy the claims of the taxation Commissioner.",37
106,Mr RODGERS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Hi s assets are a guarantee that he will pay.,37
107,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Whil e the employer is to be subject to the ordinary processes of the law for the recovery of income tax, the employee will have two obstacles to overcome. In the first place, if he defaults he will be allowed 60 days during which the ordinary processes of law may be put into operation against him, and if the Government fail to catch him by that means, they may call upon his employer to deduct^ from time to time, such portion of his earnings as will meet his income tax liability. There _3 no provision .that the employer shall deduct only a certaiu percentage of a man's earnings. He may deduct the whole amount of the liability from the earnings of one week or one mouth.",37
108,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,It is possible to make a regulation which will protect the employee.,37
109,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,The passage of a regulation to protect the employee against a levy upon the whole of his earnings for one week or month would be a poor way of minimizing the injustice of this provision.,37
110,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Surely the Department would guarantee that uo more than the taxation payable wpuld be deducted by the employer.,37
111,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I am not sug-. gesting that the employer would deduct more than the amount of the tax, but I do suggest that the employer may make such deductions as will not only inconvenience the employee, but be a serious tax upon him, in addition to the ordinary tax. Obviously, if the employer withholds the whole of a man's earnings for one week or month, in order to. satisfy the claims of the Income Tax Commissioner,"" the employee will be seriously inconvenienced, and be forced to increase his liabilities to his tradesmen.",37
112,Mr RODGEKS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,If the employee is to be allowed to pay by instalments all taxpayers should have.the same privilege.,38
113,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The Act provides that payments may be made by instalments, and I submit that the employee should be treated in the same way. Usually the Government accepts the responsibility of collecting any taxation imposed by Parliament, but this Bill proposes to devolve the responsibility upon an intermediate authority. Already the larger employers are complaining of the continual harassment resulting from the making up of various taxation returns, and some are obliged to employ at least one clerk continuously for that purpose. The provision we are now considering will compel every employer to keep a separate account as between himself and each employee in regard to income tax.",38
114,Mr HECTOR LAMOXD,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That "" is a serious reflection upon the working classes.",38
115,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The very fact that the employer will be personally liable for the payment of taxation in the event of default' by the employee will compel him to watch every operation of each employee after the income tax assessment is delivered, and in order to protect himself against a possible claim by the Government, it is quite possible that he will deduct, during the sixty days of grace, a certain amount from the wages of the employee.",38
116,Mr RODGERS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,He cannot do that.,38
117,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"He can do that or throw upou the employee the responsibility of leaving his job. If this provision becomes law, he may honourably retain suflicient of a man's wages to protect himself against any possible claim by the Government after the sixty days of grace. Suppose that an employee, after receiving his assessment, changes his employment.",38
118,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,-The employer is not concerned u n t i l a notice from the - Income Tax Commissioner reaches him.,38
119,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"E i the r the previous employer will be liable for the taxes due by the employee, and have mo hope of collecting the money, or the new employer will be saddled with a liability contracted before the man came into his service.",38
120,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,The employer will be liable only for the moneys in his possession and due to the employee.,38
121,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The only protection the employer will have w i ll be that, after he has paid the amount, he may deduct from the employee's wages, from time to time, to.recoup himself.",38
122,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"He may deduct, from time to time, as the man's wages become due.",38
123,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"i That means that if , during the sixty days' grace, the employee changes his employment, the new employer may be suddenly called upon to make a financial arrangement with the employee for 'the deduction from his earnings of a certain amount to pay the income tax. This will prove to be a very serious additional burden upon men who employ 500 or 600 hands. Many will find it necessary to employ a special clerk to keep a separate set of returns in regard to defaulting employees, and there will be an outcry for the repeal of this provision. A number of employees who are liable to - pay income tax earn an amount so little above the minimum that a number evade payment for no other reason than that they do not consider themselves liable. On the whole, the men in small wage employments who evade the tax cost the country much less than do the persons of large income who evade payment of the full dues. Every man who makes up an income tax return tries to do the best for himself and the worse for the Government. I have never known a man who did not try to reduce his income return to the lowest passible amount; aud the ability of some financial gentlemen to in clude in'their returns deductions that the ordinary man would never think of claiming is remarkable. I do not blame them, if the Commissioner makes the net wide enough for them to escape. An employee whose income is small is liable for an infinitesimally small amount of taxation, and his ability to evade the tax is greatly reduced because his deductions are easily discernible, and his general items of expenditure are readily traced. The extra amount which the Government will be able to recover by this difficult and circumlocutory method will not compensate for the immense, disturbance and inconvenience that will be caused to both employer and employee.",38
124,Mr RODGEKS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,There is said to be a very big leakage.,39
125,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The principle is bad. The Government should accept, in the case of the employee, the same responsibility for collecting the tax as they accept in respect of the employer. The law should not discriminate between different classes of the community.",39
126,Mr ATKINSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wilmot) [5.5] Although I have listened carefully to the arguments of the critics of the provision that it is proposed to delete, I have not heard any good reason why we should not assist our officials in the collection taxation by adopting the method which they recommend for compelling payment of taxes by persons who would otherwise escape. It has been frequently said, both by income-tax officials and by members of Parliament, that many persons in the community who should contribute to the revenue by way of income tax, escape their just liabilities, and we should therefore give a trial to this machinery that is recommended for safeguarding the revenue. I do not think that the provision will cause the least hardship. After sixty days, the Commissioner may serve on an employer a uotice requiring him to deduct the amount of the income tax due by an employee. No deduction will be made from the employee's wages until such notice has been received from the Commissioner. It has beeu contended that as all are equal before the law, the procedure for the recovery of income tax should be the same in all cases; but it must be remembered 'that the amounts to be recovered from employees will often be very small, not more than a few shillings, and to set in motion the cumbrous machinery of the law to obtain them would cost more than the tax. I shall support the provision unless some one can suggest a better means of preventing evasion of payment. So far, uo oue has been able to do this. Of course, my support is subject to the reservation that if in practice the provision is found to cause hardship, I shall be oue of the first to ask for its repeal.",39
127,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Dalley) [5.10] - The adoption of the provision under discussion would establish a vicious principle in our legislation. We have always prided ourselves on the fact that all citizens are equal in the eyes of the law. I can understand honourable members opposite laughing at the idea of the workers being equal with the tony class.,39
128,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Is not that an unfair statement? 1,39
129,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It is a fair interpretation of the provision under discussion, which imposes on the workers insulting and humiliating conditions, aud, in effect, says to the workers of this country, "" You are dishonest. We cannot trust you to pay your just debts to the Government, and, therefore, we are going to require of your employer to deduct from your wages all amounts that may be due.""",39
130,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,The provision applies only to defaulters.,39
131,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,It empowers the Commissioner to call on any employer to deduct money from the wages of an employee.,39
132,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,After sixty days' notice and default.,39
133,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,There is already procedure for the recovery of money due to the Crown.,39
134,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Does ' the honourable member hold a brief for the lawyers?,39
135,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,No ; I hold a brief for the workers.,39
136,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,That is a subject about which honourable members opposite know nothing.,39
137,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Exactly . The provision establishes a cumbersome piece of machinery which will achieve no useful end. Its hollowness is seen directly you examine it. There are two classes of employees, permanent aud casual. It is from the wages of the former alone that employers will be able to make deductions. But so far as those persons are concerned, the provision is unnecessary, because, as they are in permanent positions, they can be easily prosecuted for any failure to obey the law. As for the casual workers, the provision can do nothing to make them pay. A casual worker on a wharf or in a dockyard may be employed today in one place, tomorrow for a few hours somewhere else, aud a little later with a third firm. How could employers deal with such men?",39
138,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,They will afford a job for the Commonwealth police.,39
139,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"If the casual employees happen to be dishonest, it will be impossible to rope them in by means of the provision under discussion.",40
140,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Then the only effect of the clause will be to give the employers a lot of useless trouble.,40
141,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Aud , as the honourable member for Barrier has observed, it will furnish occupation for that incubus, the Federal police. I have received from Mr J. P. Franki, the managing director of Mort's Dock and Engineering Company, Sydney, one of the largest dockyard employers in Australia, a letter setting out his opinion of the proposed new subsection. He saysIn the report of the Acting Prime Minister's speech upon the second reading of the Bill, it is stated that "" an employer, to safeguard himself, would have to keep back part of the money coming to his employees,"" which seems to impose the greater responsibility on the employer of deducting, from all salaries and wages 'paid in anticipation of default, and involving a refund in most cases. May I ask for your kind interest with a view to avoiding any misapprehension as regards the intention of the Bill, and preventing an injustice to the larger proportion of employees, and a hardship upon employers if deductions are to be made from all wages and salaries in anticipation of default, and involving, in most cases, a refund.",40
142,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That is ouly your friend Mr Franki's view. The Bill says, "" on' default,"" not "" in anticipation of default.''",40
143,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Mr Franki is a constituent, not a friend. I understand the levity of the honourable member for Wentworth when a subject involving the interests of the workers is being discussed; it is characteristic of him. Mr Franki points to the disabilities which it is proposed to impose on the employers, aud I have shown how the provision would affect the employees, and how utterly futile it is, having in mind the object ' in view. It cannot be put into operation against casual workers, who, it is insinuated, will evade responsibility for taxes; and it will unnecessarily harass employers. Before agreeing to this clause we should have from the Treasurer a defiuite statement that many people are making default in the payment of income tax, and that a provision of this kind is absolutely necessary in order that they may be reached. The Treasurer should say definitely that it is estimated that the Government is losing so much per annum for want of a provision of this kind. As it is, we are simply told that a section of the community is to be subjected to invidious treatment. We ought not to agree to anything of the kind, nor should we assist the Government ill its 'effort to extend the pernicious principle of garnishee orders. The garnishee system is most repugnant. The Government is proposing an extension of it, but it will still apply only to employees. If we arc to have such a provision, let it be applied to the wool kings, to the members of the Stock Exchange, and others. Let us provide that those who do business with members of the Stock Exchange may be called upon by the. Commissioner to deduct from moneys payable by them to any member of a Stock Exchange an amount equal to the income taxation payable by that person. The principle which the Government are endeavouring here to impose on the workers will re-act upon them. We should legislate from the point of view that all meu must be equal in the sight of the law. There should be no differential treatment.  member suggest that we should tax everyone?",40
144,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"All who ought to pay taxation, and especially the profiteers, should be taxed. The Government, instead .of proposing pinpricks of this kind, should be taxing the men who create corners in foodstuffs.",40
145,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Thos e are the men we want to get at:,40
146,Mr MAHONY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"We should get a little bit more from those who get hold of the wool of the people. In that way more money would be secured for the Treasury, than will be obtained by this tomfoolery in regard to employees receiving a couple of pounds a week. Here we are setting up cumbrous machinery to attempt to get something out of men who are not able to pay anything.",40
147,Mr LYN CH,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Werriwa) [5.23] Although I yield to no man in my desire to give every assistance to the Commissioner of Taxation in collecting taxes that are justly payable, yet I foresee a fatal objection to this clause. It undoubtedly takes from one section of the community a legal right, which is still left to others. It also outrages a primary principle of justice since it will compel employers, under severe penalties, to act as honorary tax collectors. In its administration I feel confident it will give rise to a good deal of conflict as between employer and employee. This will be especially the case in respect of farmers and others who em-' ploy, for a few months in the year, men of whom, in many cases, they know nothing. In sacrificing principle, in the hope that this expedient will enable the Commissioner to reach a lot of men who shirk their obligations, I think we shall do very great in j u r y. If this clause is to be used for the more effective administration of the bachelor tax, it will lead to a veritable Donnybrook Fair, so far as the men in the bush are concerned. But even assuming that it is intended to have a wider effect than that of providing machinery for the collection of the bachelor tax-whic h cannot be less than £5, and is in itself a very considerable sum for many to pay-wha t will be the position ? Take, for instance, the case of partially disabled or medically unfit or other single men who have not offered for service; but who, during the winter months trap rabbits, and sell them to various buyers. Such a man might deliver a cart load to one buyer today, and to another buyer tomorrow. A r e all these buyers to be served with notice? Then, again, such a man, during the harvesting season, might be employed by me to drive a harvester for 10s. or 12s. per day. In view of this provision that makes me liable, I should not be slow in serving him with notice that I was required to deduct from his wages an amount equal to the tax payable by him. In that event, he would probably leave me at a moment's noticeat a time when it might be impossible to'"" replace him-and complications might result. If he protested that he was not the man in respect of whom I had been served with a notice from the Commissioner, how should I identify him r Should I be expected to come into conflict with him at a time when he could do me almost irremediable injury? The law, as it stands, provides that every employer shall furnish in his return the names of his employees, and all that is required is a little keener organization to get at those who are shirking their responsibilities. This disagree-, able duty should not be placed upon the shoulders of employers. It would do more to feed the flame of discord as between employer and employee than anything of which I know. Unless the Committee desires to impose unnecessary hardship upou employers, and especially farmers and others in the couutry, who do not keep a staff of accountants, it will reject this provision. It can serve no usef u l purpose. It cannot be denied that it is an outrage of principle, and is merely an expedient by which the Government hope to reach a certain number of .dishonest or thoughtless people who neglect to pay taxation for'which they are liable. It would be well in the interests of harmony to carry the amendment.  honourable members seem to have debated this question from the point of view of whether or not certain persons receiving small incomes should be taxed. The position is, however, that the existing law prescribes that persons in receipt of not less than a certaiu amount per annum shall pay income tax, and that being so, it is the duty of every honprable member to assist the Government in collecting that tax. The Government, in its wisdom, has determined that some additional means are necessary to enable the law to be carried into effect. So far as propertyholders are concerned, the Crown has its remedy where default is made. It can always levy upon the property, and so recover the taxation payable. I am in clined to think that a large sum is lost to the Treasury by the failure of certain persons to furnish returns as they should do under, the law, and I certainly do not agree with those who say that employers as a class would object to be made the collectors of this fax. There is considerable resentment on the part of employers, who think that the law, as applied to smaller taxpayers, is not full y carried out; and, generally speaking, employers would be pleased to assist the Crown in its effort to obtain what, under the Act, it is entitled to collect. The honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony) has drawn a doleful picture of the hardship which this provision will i m pose on certain wage earners. Parliament has already determined that it is no hardship for those men to be taxed, and that being so, we should assist the Government in its laudable effort to collect what Parliament has said shall be collected. That, it seems to me, should be our guiding principle. If we think the exemption is too low, let us amend the original by raising the exemption. But as long as that is the law, let us assist the vernment in carrying it out.",40
148,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Impartially, usual ?.  Make the wool kings pay whatever they have to pay, and let the workers pay whatever they have to pay. Let the same principle apply to all. If the law is let us amend the law; but if the Governengaged ment find that they cannot carry out law as it stands, because certain methods - have been adopted by some sections of community, and if they ask for additional powers to enable them to carry it out, us give those powers to them.",42
149,Mr RODGERS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wannon) [6.86] - I was surprised to notice a paragraph in press stating that the Employers Federaposal. tion had carried a resolution objecting to the obligation which it is proposed place on employers generally. like the present, when the Commissioner of Taxation is asking the employers assistance in order to conserve the reveuue of the country, and in order to help Government to carry on the administrawould tion of affairs, such a resolution is worthy, and out of season. It is also stupid, because the employers imay be called upon to pay additional taxation order to make up for any loss which may be sustained if they do not accede to request of the Commissioner of Taxation It is the duty of every honourable member to conserve the revenue and assist Commissioner in his onerous duty of lecting it. We are only at the commencement of the imposition of taxation in Commonwealth. All sections of the compart of 1 per cent. munity will have to bear additional dens if this Government, or future Goportion vernments, are to carry on the administrathe tion of affairs properly. Therefore, I hope no action will be taken to put any bar the way of adopting a principle which undoubtedly apply, not only to this taxatoria, tion, but also to future taxation i u which it may be involved. It would have beeu wiser had the Treasurer laid before hon the orable members an estimate of the rethis venue which is now being lost.",42

155,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wentworth) [5.43] - I am not too pleased with the clause as i stands, because it is open to a number of objections; but it is better than having no such clause at all. The difficulties which the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch) and others have voiced will not be so great as they have indicated. If a harvester hand consents to work for the honourable member for Werriwa for the full year, the tax he will be called upon to pay will be about 13s. 6d., and ask any one would the honourable member, with his cordiality of temperament and generosity of heart, allow that valued vant to leave him merely because he to pay that amount? The probability is that the honourable member ,will pay the 13s. 6d., and make some arrangement with his honest employee by which the latter will pay him back the amount at the rate of 6d. or ls. per week.",43
156,Mr LYNCH,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Did I not suggest that this clause might be used as machinery for the collection of the bachelor tax?,43
157,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Off-hand , I would uot like to say that it is not possible to do so. When we passed the bachelor tax, we made it portion of the income tax. But what I have risen to say is that we ought to be able to short-circuit all this procedure by merely taxing each wage received. If a man is in regular employment, let the employer stamp his wages. If a mau earns £4 per week on a permanent sort of job, he will pay a tax of about 3d. per week. Let the employer affix a 3d. stamp per week on his wages receipt. The employer will thus be responsible to the Government for the 3d. One objection raised to the method I suggest is that if it should be adopted the men would go to the Arbitration Court and passion the obligation to the employer. But that would not matter) so long as the employees realise that they are contributing towards the taxation of the country. The greatest difficulty in regard to taxation is that a big section - of the community honestly be that it is paying no taxation, and, as a result, feels that it is without respon",43

He probably earns 15s. a day, including overtime, and for that 15s. he might have to pay a stamp duty of £d. I admit that my suggestion means the introduction of difficulties; .but, at the same time, it would be better than the system proposed in.the clause, to which a great I deal of objection has been raised. I do not like the clause, but, as I have already said, I like it better than having no syssertem at all. Even if au arrangement has has to be made, by means of which the employer, in order to have continuity in his employment, has to have a fixed arrangement with his employees, it is better than having' nothing, because it will make the employee realise that he is contributing towards the upkeep of the country.",43
160,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Do not make any mistake on that score. The employee realizes that he is carrying the whole show at present.,43
161,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"He thiuks so when you appeal to him in one sense. In another sense, he is asked to believe he is paying nothing, and allowing the rich to pay. My belief is that taxation, like water, will find its own level, but the great difficulty is that the public does not believe it ; and I wish everybody to realise that they have some direct responsibility for the financial solvency of the community as a whole. I do not pretend to like the clause, and I should like the Minister to devise some better method, say, that of stamped receipts. However, the matter is not worth all this bother, because the taxation of a £4 income, after all, amounts to only about 160d. in a year.",43
162,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [5.51] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has suggested that the clause provides machinery for collecting the bachelor tax. It does not do anything of the sort; there are no other provisions for that purpose. This clause, like the rest of the Bill and the principal Act , applies only to persons with incomes of from £100 to £150 and. upwards, the former being that of a taxpayer without dependants. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Kelly) very properly said that there might be some objection to this clause; but I may mention, without being able to cite figures, that there is a large leakage in the taxation of in comes from £15 6 to £ 3 0 0 . I looked up this matter twelve months ago, without any relation to the present Bill , and I think that, with a total amount received of something like £4,300,000, and the number of taxpayers, 234,000, the taxpayers with incomes of £156 to £300 paid less than £250,000. That is not due to the absence of income between the ranges, but to the fact that the persons liable cannot be followed. This Bill is intended to remedy that defect, and it will not apply as a matter of fact, though it does as a matter of law, to men of migratory habits. It is impossible to follow casual employees, but there are numbers of men, more or less permanently situated, who can be identified, and if they do not pay, it is due to the State and to the other taxpayers, who have to pay progressively more than they, that we should follow them, and obtain, at all events, a reasonable proportion. That is what this clause is intended to do, and, though the machinery is not perfect, it is the best we can devise under the circumstances. cannot conceive any other course except that of taxation at the source of income.

We have heard it said, for instance, that in some 'cases we shall actually attach a debt that is not proved to exist as it would be proved in a Court of law. It must be remembered, however, that the taxpayer will be saved the harassing expense of an action at law, and surely the Commissioner will know whether a taxpayer is liable or not?",44
167,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Why do you say that it would be impossible to collect the bachelor tax under this Bill?,44
168,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"There is no provision in the Bill for returns for the taxation of bachelors, the only persons affected being those with £ 1 0 0 a year, without dependants, and those with incomes of £156 a year and upwards. The bachelor tax is a special tax, and we are not now seeking for machinery to collect such a tax.",44

175,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Grampians) [6.0] - I support the clause because, after the debate, I regard it as the most just, economical, and efficient method of collecting what is due i u the way of income taxation. It must be remembered that this clause will not come into operation until a man, whether inadvertently or Act, wilfully, has become a defaulter-until the Commissioner is satisfied that he defaulted. We are all agreed that if income tax is levied, and the great revenue. majority of people pay it, whether ask they enjoy the paying or not, The. it is ouly fair .that others should not be allowed to evade it. We are not now discussing the merits of the tax; question is purely whether evasion shall be allowed, and, if not, what is the most economical method of enforcing payment. We must eitlier allow dishonourable or careless men to escape, or devise some means of compelling them to pay. The honourable member for Batman (Mr. Brennan) contends that a defaulting taxexperts payer should be summoned; but, in mauy cases, taxpayers whose employment has taken them, perhaps, 100 miles away, parture would be compelled to either lose three four days' work or to employ a barrister or solicitor. My own opinion is that not one out of a hundred men who knew they had to pay in the loug run would object to the method proposed in the Bill, contrasted with that of proceedings in Court. The real objection to the clause has been raised by the Employers Federaemployers tion, ou the ground that' the collection the tax in the way suggested places on employer a great deal of trouble and in the convenience, while tending, to a certain extent, to make them unpopular with their employees. I totally disagree with the resolution passed' by the Employers is Federation.

178,Mr GREGORY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I must say that I have my doubts as to the accuracy of that view. The Bill is to amend the principal and, if passed, will become part and parcel of that Act.

I suggest that every adult should be compelled to submit a return of income. The Minister has objected to that course on the ground that it would involve enormous expense. A conference of taxation suggested certain amendments of the taxation law for the purpose of bringing about uniform taxation throughout Australia. This Bill is an extreme defrom the proposals of the Conor ference, and the Government must know perfectly well that the States will never agree to certain portions of it . Of course, if the Commonwealth is indifferent to the opinions of the States, they maybe forced as to accept proposals with which they do a not agree, and which may be inimical to the primary industries. The returns that have been obliged to furnish in of counexion with different forms of taxation the have represented an enormous burden in past, aud the whole responsibility and expense have been thrown on the taxpaying community. I do not care to what extent the Government increase the super tax, but every person with an income should pay some taxation. I suggest that the clause should be amended so as to compel every adult to submit a return of income, and the penalty for default should be disfranchisement.

I wish to make it plain to the honourable member, who is familiar with the principjles of income taxation, and for a time was responsible for a good deal of the administration of our income tax legislation, that the original Act of 1915 established definitely the principle of taxing lottery prizes, and . included such prizes in the items that were subject to income taxation. The law stood in that way until last year, when, in the Income Tax Bates Bill , which was passed on 28th September last, we made a further defiuite stand as to the amount that we would take by way of income tax from such prizes.",47
191,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The honourable gentleman is historically accurate, but there is no reason why wo should not now retrace our steps.",47
192,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I shall deal later on with the merits of the question, but I desire to present, in chronological array, a few facts for the information of the honourable member. Seetion 7 of the Rates Act of 1917 readsThere shall be payable in respect of a cash prize in a lottery income tax to the amount of 10 per centum of the gross prize money. The inclusion of such items of income in individual schedules was, therefore, made necessary by that Act. All that we do in this Assessment Bill is to provide that we shall tax this prize money at its source-befor e distribution-instea d of allowing it to leak out, and so to lose a great deal of the taxation payable in respect of it . This, therefore, ' is not new legislation. It is but the t h i r d step in relation to the taxation of prize money. The primary step was taken in the Act of 1915, and we advanced to a more definite basis in the Aot of 1917. In this Bill we merely change the mode of assessment. As to the principle involved, I ""do agree with the honourable member that should not levy on cash prizes of this kind. The taxation office, as a matter of fact, has been levying upon them in cordance with the two Acts already force. If the honourable member won Tattersall's prize tomorrow",47

194,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"W h i c h , to keep his conclause. science clean, may God forbid. He is the only man I have ever heard say, without his tongue going into his cheek, that did not want to win a Tattersall's sweep. Assuming him to be as sincere as' words implied, and his appearance, as spoke, indicated, the position is that, he did win a prize, then he would have include the prize money in his schedule, respect of Tattersall's whether this Bill became law or not, and would be taxed to the extent of 10 cent, upon it .",48
195,Sir ROBERT BEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,If he won i the would pay it forthwith into the Consoliwish dated Revenue'.,48
196,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Then I withdraw the hope that I have already expressed, and sincerely trust that he may win a prize. These prizes are in the nature of windI falls. I do not invest in sweeps. I think I have had only one investment in a tersall's consultation. I did not win prize, and was so severely disappointed that I swore off for life. I did so, because I am opposed to the principle, but for the reason that I think it a bad totalizators throughout the States. investment. I can spend my money more profitably and enjoyably in other direcActing tions. When a mau wins a prize in a the sweep, especially in war time, the Comthe kind. monwealth surely is entitled to ask for proportion of it . If the only question as to the mode of collection, then this is as ""Leper."" the best way to collect the tax on such windfalls.

198,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I doubt whether honourable member really understood that this was the principle of the law which administered when he was Treasurer. That is the most generous view I can take of his attitude and utterances, since if not. he objects now for the first time, he has we either been suddenly converted, qr is not sincere. I would sooner assume that he is sincere, aud did uot appreciate the full acresponsibility which he carried when in in office.

199,Dr MALONEY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Melbourne) [7.50] he I take this opportunity of protesting against the infamous humbug.and hypochis risy of every member of the Commonhe wealth Parliament in permitting Tatteri f sall's sweeps to be carried on as at preto sent. Every one knows that the law in is repeatedly evaded. It has been asserted that inforper mation is sometimes given through the Post Oflice to persons to whom applications for tickets in Tattersall's are addressed, that they must be careful if they to avoid a prosecution. As soon as the delivery of letters at a suspected address is prohibited by notice in the Government Gazette, new addresses are supplied to intending investors. Whenever visit Tasmania, I take a ticket in one of Tattersall's consultations. 'We cannot Tatput down gambling, but we can keep it a under control, and I tliink we could best control it , and also derive a considerable not income by nationalizing Tattersall's. I would also nationalize the whole of the I know that the wowsers, who gave the Prime Minister such a lively time other day, will object to anything of The bitterest amongst the a members of that deputation was a man is named Leeper, who is generally known He said he would rather we should lose the war than that a moral aud law should be broken. Every one knows rethat some of the members of that deputation break moral laws and all the Commandments. I have specially in mind TreaArchdeacon Hindley, whom I have peri n sonally accused of lying in the pulpit of the house of God. If that is not a breaking of one of the Commandments, I do not the know what is. The Government could shut down Tattersall's consultations if he they desired to do so. Tasmania needs revenue, and the Commonwealth in its generosity has made that State a present of £900,000. I would far sooner see the Commonwealth make another grant to Tasmania than that the Government of that State should derive reveuue from a system of gambling which nominally is not permitted under Commonwealth law, but which is, and has been, winked at by this and every previous. Commonwealth Government. Now is the time to nationalize Tattersall's consultations, at all events, for the period of the war. If the people were given - the power to control Parliament by means of the referendum and initiative, then they could say whether or not they desired the nationaliTreasurer zation of Tattersall's to continue. I shall vote against this amendment as a protest against a system of hypocrisy of which I am tired. I shall be prepared to vote for the nationalization of Tattersall's and of all totalizators throughout Australia. It is not the wowsers in the community that provide for the government of the country, but rather their opponents and the middle class between the wowser and the fair-living man. I do not approve of the Government indirectly recognising Tattersall's. They could nationalize it by means of a regulation under the ""War Precautions Act, and they could also nationalize the whole of the totalizators throughout Australia in the same way. The Commonwealth would thus be able to take a proportion of the income derived from such sources.",48
200,Mr MACKAY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Lilley) [7.55] - The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) has briefly traced the history of Tattersall's in Australia; but I think he will admit that the Government with which he was connected was just as responsible for the continuation of that system of gambling . as the present Administration are. I am under the impression that no Government in Australia has yet seriously attempted to suppress Tattersall's, otherwise some effort would have been made to deal with the tobacconists who display in their windows such notices as ""We communicate direct with Hobart,"" or "" Mail for Hobart closes at such-and-such a time."" Then again a Government that was really sincere in the desire to suppress gambling could not possibly countenance the numerous registered and unregistered meetings that are taking place in Australia from day to day. The/gambling that occurs on race-courses is far worse than the gambling associated with Tattersall's sweeps. Since no Government has made any genuine attempt to suppress Tattersall's, and seeing that a lot of money is distributed through that agency, I think the Ministry are perfectly justified in attempting to obtain some income from it.",49
201,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Illawarra) [7.59] - In opposing the claim of the States that they should obtain revenue from "" windfalls "" in the shape of prizes in lotteries or successful land deals, the seemed to take a view entirely different from that behind the proposal which we are now discussing. ""The Commonwealth taxation officers say that such windfalls are in the nature of an accretion of capital, and they refuse to tax them, whereas, in my view, a taxpayer who unexpectedly, makes a couple of hundred pounds in a land deal, or by means of an investment in Tattersall's, finds it much easier to make a contribution to the revenue than it is for a man to contribute from his ordinary, and sometimes rather limited, income. I should be glad to learn that the Treasurer has changed his attitude in regard to the taxation of profits made on single deals in land, sheep, merchandise, and so on, as they seem oue of the readiest subjects for taxation. Believing that, I shall vote for this proposal. To honourable members who object to taking revenue from prizes in Tattersall's because it is an immoral undertaking, I would point out that, by the time the investor pays 5 per cent, to Tattersall, 10 per cent, to the Commonwealth, and another proportion to the State, as happens in New South Wales, and also pays the fellow who owns the horse, there will be very little left. No quicker way of making investments in Tattersall's unpopular could be devised than to increase the amount of taxation payable on prizes when they are won.

203,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [8.10] - The penalties under the principal Act are inflictable by a Court on prosecution for various offences.

204,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,W h i c h he will not do.,50
205,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I hope my honourable friend will cheer up. There are great the difficulties surrounding the collection of income tax,, which this power will to some or extent remove. It is sometimes very hard prosecute, no matter what the provisions of the Act may be, and convince a on deCourt of summary jurisdiction that the One law is on the side of the Crown, and the furfault on the side of - the accused. A f t e r notices are inserted in the newspapers, posted at post-offices, and proclaimed anhis nually as loudly, aud as far as possible, the people should be prepared to put in their returns, and'the knowledge that they are that liable to this additional tax will accelerate their obedience to the law. If there were no power to remit, as in sub-clause 2, I should say the proposal was too Draconian tax in principle or in amount, but the Combe missioner will operate this part of the law with the same discretion that he has exhibited in the difficulties which have surThe rounded him during the last two or three years. If a person who is fined £ 3 for o r being three months late with his .return could-furnish the Commissioner with satisfactory reasons, such as illness, absence, - difficulty, or impossibility of rendering the 'return, the Commissioner in his judgment will remit the penalty, but the clause is a very salutary dispensation, and will, I am sure, increase the revenue from those who at the present time show annually a tendency to make default.",50
206,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Hunter) [8.15] I have no wish to shelter any one who deliberately refuses to send in his income tax return, but we are liable to cause a great deal of hardship to some individuals if we pass this clause providing that a person who fails to send in his return is liable to a fine of f l for every month that he is in arrears. Many people believe that because of the size of their families or the smallness of their earnings they are not called upon to furnish returns, and the Commissioner of Taxation does not find out for at least twelve months afterwards, when he sees from the employers' sheets that certaiu incomes have been earned, that they should have furnished them. cases the penalty would be at least £12.",51
207,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Would they not be fair cases to put before the Commissioner ?,51
208,Mr OHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"But before the Commissioner will consider any appeal the fine must be paid. At least that is the practice of the Department, so far as I understand it. If the Commissioner could deal with an appeal before asking for the payment of the penalty, I would not oppose the clause; but as the practice of the Department is to call upon the taxpayer, who is over-assessed, to pay the tax before his appeal is heard, aud, believing that the same practice will be followed in this case, I must vote against the clause. If my contention is not correct, of course my argument falls to the ground. that the Minister will give the matter his most careful consideration.",51
209,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Hindmarsh) [8.20] - It seems to me that the line now being followed is that of giving the Commissioner the opportunity to get revenue more by imposing penalties than by collecting taxation. There is already a penalty provided for not furnishing returns, and I think the law could be very well left as it stands. Letters are frequently lost in the Post Office., What will happen if a return sent through the Post Oflice does not reach the Taxation Office? A return which is sent in before the time for furnishing returns expires may easily go astray, yet the taxpayer is called upon to pay a fine. He may assert that he has sent in his return, but the Department swear that it has not been seen though it may be kicking about in the office for all the Commissioner's omcers know or care* I know of a case in which a return was"" sent in, and a second return had to be furnished.",51
210,Mr BAMFORD,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Does the honourable member kuow the person who furnished that return?,51
211,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Yes , I know that it was sent in, but I do not know what became of it. It must not be forgotten that if we propose to adopt a policy of securing revenue by inflicting fines, we may inflict them on poor men. Fines should not be imposed unless they are absolutely necessary. It is said that the Commissioner will take into consideration any claim submitted for the disallowance In such of a fine to which the taxpayer may become liable; but I undertake to say that he will make no such disallowance. All that he will worry about will be getting reveuue by means of imposing fines. I do not propose to be a party to giving him that power, - and I shall certainly vote against the clause. The Commissioner already has ample powers. There is no need to increase them.",51
212,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Yarra) [8.25] - The usual practice is to* base penalties upon a percentage of the amount of tax to ,be levied, but here it is proposed to inflict a fine of £1 per month. ' Sir ROBERT BEST - For default in the matter of furnishing returns.",51
213,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,That may be so; but the principle is a wrong one. The penalty I hope should be upon a percentage' basis. In another clause the Treasurer has promised to add a proviso by which notice has to be given and proved. Persons do make mistakes regarding the date for furnishing returns. Members of this Parliament have quite bond fide forgotten to send in their returns. There are so many returns to be furnished that it is easy to forget the exact date upon which any particular return has to be sent in.' Most people leave the matter to the last day. I sup2?ose that more income tax returns come into the Taxation Office on the last day than at any other time. Many causes prevent people from furnishing their returns. Illness may prevent them from doing so. I shall vote against the clause.,51
214,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Illawarra) [8.27] - We should have had some information as to the amount of fines which have beeu imposed during the past year as an indication of the spirit in which the penalty provisions are administered. My experience does not agree with that of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Archibald). In the ouly case which has come under my notice, where an aged taxpayer forgot to send in his return until some months after the period when it was clue, upon the facts being related by him, aud upon certain people vouching for his integrity, the fine was immediately remitted. I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that the penalty should be in proportion to the amount of the taxpayer's income or tax. It is just as much an offence to withhold a return for £10 as it is to withhold a turn for £100. Honourable members are apt to look at these matters from the wrong point of view. The income tax is a direct tax payable by certain people, and those who owe money to the community should pay it, and should not be allowed to put off making their returns from month to month. The task of the Commissioner is a difficult one. It is not easy for him to decide whether a man has failed to furnish his return wilfully, or because he has had so many returns to furnish that he has overlooked the proper date. We are doing our best to secure a single return for all taxation, aud I hope that it willnot be long before there will be no excuse on this score for uot sending in the taxation return in the proper time. One honourable member has alluded to the host of clerks that will be necessary for filling in taxation returns. If we adopt the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition and impose the penalty in this case ou the percentage basis, a host of clerks will be required, who will be paid by the Commonwealth, and not by the people furnishing returns. The better principle is to have one fine for each offence, and if we ascertain that the Commissioner has been abusing the power which is given to him, Parliament can soon remedy the matter.",52
215,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"East Sydney) [8.29] - I admit that there should be a penalty for not furnishing a return; but, as the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) has pointed out, if a man's return is twelve months overdue, it will mean a fine of £12, though the amount of the tax may not be more than 5s. I know that in regard to excise duties, if a publican omits to delete the duty stamp on a cask of beer, he is fined 10s., but is not fined £1 for every day of the month that he has failed to comply with the law.",52
216,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,He is fined £ 1 for the second' offence.,52
217,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"There is no second offence about this matter at all. If the Government are not prepared to drop the clause I shall move an amendment. Before a conviction is secured there should be evidence of wilful neglect. All our criminal laws are based on this principle, and in the case of evasion's of the income tax, the Commissioner himself should be satisfied of an intention to defraud the revenue before a taxpayer is fined. I re- know that in my owu case, I always send my return in on the very last day, because I endeavour to find out how much I can avoid paying, and I am satisfied that all other honourable members do the same thing. I move That the words "" for each month or part .thereof during which the failure or neglect to furnish the return continues,"" lines 7 to 9, be left out.",52
218,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [8.34] - I am afraid this will make the position far worse for the small taxpayer, because it is ridiculous to expect that the fine then to be imposed would be an effective penalty, with £he result that the Commissioner would have to fall back upon the next section under which there will be a penalty of not less than £2 , nor more than £100, to be imposed on a taxpayer who fails to furnish a return.",52
219,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That should be knocked out, too.",52
220,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"In that, case honourable members would then be knocking out a provision previously assented to by Parliament, of which the honourable members opposite were supporters, and were responsible for passing.",52
221,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Not this provision.,52
222,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I am referring to the original Act passed in 1910. I believe very great difficulty is experienced in following up some men, and that conunpopular, siderable search has to be made to ascerpeople tain whether returns have been furnished or not. The public are notified that they are expected to send in returns, and there is some obligation upon taxpayers to help in the administration of the law. proposed penalty may in some cases apaggravated pear harsh, but I ask honourable to assume that the Commissioner apply it with a very great dealof sideration. It is intended to enable to.impose fines without proceeding against defaulters in Court, and if the taxpayer finds that the longer he neglects to charge the obligation imposed upon him, the heavier will be the fine, I think there will be a greater inclination on his part observe the law. It has been stated some honourable members that the taxpayer must first pay the fine before he can appeal to the Commissioner, but is not the case at all. It is incumbent the Commissioner first to find out whether a return has been furnished, that has been ascertained, he may impose the fine. In other cases there will be an measure. . actual imposition of the penal tax per cent, per annum for not paying within the time specified, but this may be remitted. Proceedings to be avoided in the interests of the taxpayer.",52
223,Mr ARCHIBALD,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Hindmarsh) [8.36] - The House ought to be very f u l before it authorizes an extension principal Act. This is not the time experiments of this character, and I the Government to drop the clause altovery gether. They would be perfectly right retaining the provision imposing a penalty of 10 per cent. I would not object to fair aud reasonable proposal like that, and I hope the Commissioner will exercise with consideration: the power vested i him. What is to prevent us from continuing in the administration the Act, with the existing penalty provisions in force? No doubt, shall have to deal again with the Income Tax Act next year, and then, with with the offence:the experience of this year to guide us, we shall be better able to appreciate the difficulties urged by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton). It is probable they wil l be experienced, because we are legislating very much in the dark, and, though I am not worrying about shall, whether this measure will be regarded as vided I should be concerned if the formed the impression that we had hastily put a burden upou them. It would be as well to omit the proposed new clause, aud retain the penalty provisions that already exist. I would not interfere This with them, for the simple reason that cases, in which a taxpayer, is members defying the Commissioner, might occur, will and in such cases au adequate penalty conshould be imposed. The proposed new him clause is bound to become vexatious aud harassing u n t i l the provisions of the Act become well known, and the administradistive machinery is working smoothly. We should be, careful not to harass and worry the people more than is absolutely necesto sary. I hope, therefore, that the proby posed new clause will be rejected. Amendment negatived. that . Mr HIGGS (Capricornia) [8.40] - I on hope honourable members will not consider the amendment now before the Committee and after for the omission of the clause as a party question. The Bill is not a party The excuse made by the of 10 Treasurer (Mr Watt) seemed to me to be a very flimsy cne, and it might account for his strategical retreat shortly in Court ought after his speech.",53
224,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,That is un<L worthy.,53
225,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Perhaps the honourable caremember will not think so after he has of the heard what I have to say. What is the for reason given by the Treasurer for this urge proposed new clause? He said it was a difficult matter to convince the Court in that the Commissioner was right and that the taxpayer was wrong, and therea fore, he wanted to make the Commissioner the judge.",53
226,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Is it not optional n whether steps are taken in Court or not ? Mr TUDOR:-Not so far as this proof posed clause is concerned.,53
227,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The Government propose we to strike out of the principal Act the following provision, which already deals 59 - (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the last preceding section, any person who fails or neglects to duly furnish any return as and when required by this Act, or the regulations, or by the Commissioner, or fails to include any assessable income in any return, if a taxpayer, be liable, except as proin this section, by way of additional tax, to pay an amount of 10 per centum of the amount of tax assessable to bim, in addition to any additional tax which may become - payable by him in accordance with section 43 of this-Act. If we turn to section 43 we find the following penal tax : If the income tax or additional income tax payable on an amended assessment is not paid before the expiration of the time specified in section 41 of this Act, or such further time aa may be allowed the taxpayer will be liable to an additional tax, amounting to 10 per cent, per annum on the tax unpaid. That is, if a man's income tax is XI , and he delays sending in a return, he is fined 2s., while another who is assessed at £100, and similarly offends, willpay £ 1 0 , and so on. But what would be thought of such an excuse, in the case of any other offence against the laws of the Commonwealth, as that it would be difficult to convince the magistrate or judge! These gentlemen are accustomed to weigh evidence, and eminently suited to perform the judicial work of deciding whether a taxpayer is guilty of an offence. Only the other day we saw in the newspapers that a man had been fined £ 3 0 in an income tax prosecution ; and I ask the Ministry whether they have considered that their proposal means that people in all the towns throughout the Commonwealth will probably neglect to send in returns at the proper time. Under the present law, I presume such offenders are brought to the Court in the nearest principal town ; but under the clause offenders will have to write to the Commissioner in Melbourne, or his representatives in Sydney and the other capital cities.",53
228,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,They rather do that than travel a hundred miles to the nearest Court.,54
229,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,And would find it far less expensive.,54

231,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The Commisr sioner ought to be the best judge, and will certainly prove the cheaper judge:",54
232,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"We have to consider that the Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioners-and I have a great deal of confidence in the judicial capacity of the Commissioner-^-will for some time have a great deal of business to do in connection, not only with the income tax, but with the war-time profits tax- a very complicated irnposE-and also the entertainments tax. In my opinion, neither the Commissioner nor the Deputy Commissioners will have sufficient time to consider these cases in the judicial way they ousrht to be considered, and in the wav they would have to be considered if the Commissioner were compelled to take the before the Courts as under the present Act.",54
233,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,The effect of the clause will be to lessen the Commissioner's work ultimately.,54
234,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I do not know about that. A great deal of hardship may be caused to people who fail to send in returns at the proper time. Under the present law, a person who fails or neglects to furnish any return is guilty of an offence, and is liable to a penalty of £ 1 0 0 , or so much less, as the magistrate or Judge may care to impose. By this Bill it is proposed to amend that section so as to provide for the penalty of not less than £ 2 , thus binding the magistrate or Judge to observe that fine as a minimum. That, in'my opinion, is wrong, and discretion should be allowed. We must not forget that there is the additional penalty - and a penalty it is-of having to attend the Court, involving both time and expense. The whole measure seems to be too cast-iron and oppressive ; and I hope the Committee will be satisfied with the provisions in the principal Act . would  not understand how the suggestion of the honourable member for Capricornia,(Mr . Higgs) in regard to a percentage would operate so far as this Bill This clause deals, not with the amount of the tax, but witjh the to failure to send in returns, and before a return is sent in , how can a taxpayer The the Government is to be congratulated on time. dealing drastically with those who negIn this period of war, when every shilling is required, we find numbers shirking their obligations, and everything should be done to bring such people to boot.

Under the State laws there are exemptions up to £200 and £300, thus leaving numbers of working men unaffected; but under the Commonwealth law every one with an income of £156 is liable, a not generally known amongst the been wage-earning classes.

248,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [9.0] - I hope the amendment will not be agreed to, for it would have the effect of neutralizing the clause. It would mean that it would become the object of every man to evade his responsibilities. There has been a great deal of trouble'in applying the provisions of the Act in relation to the persons whom into Court. the clause is intended to affect. The Act has been in operation since 1910, and the amendments made in it from time to time have beeu found necessary for its proper administration. The Commissioner, before prosecuting, sends a final notice in every case. That, of course, is if he can find the party.",56
249,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"And if he cannot find him, he does not fine him.",56
250,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It has been said by honourable members on the other side that one could uot fine a man unless he was first found out. In this case, it is a penalty imposed upou a person who cannot be found, and there is, therefore, an inducement to discover himself implied by a continuous penalty. There has been a great deal of trouble, as I have indicated, in collecting the taxes. Many fines were imposed last year, and from the beginning of the operations uuder the Act, which cost a great deal of money in bringing about. One thing which has been markedly noticed is that if a fine posed for 'an offence in a certain district there is a wonderful awakening to their duty on the part of other persons in the same neighbourhood. Under this clause, if once a man is fined for not sending in his return, the experience of the Department justifies me in stating that he will never commit the offence again.",56

254,Mr LAIKD SMITH,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,How often does a case get into the Courts?,56
255,Mr TUDOR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It is cheaper, of course, and better to go direct to the Minister. But I repeat that we are giving no option here at all.

I take the same view as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald), and say that we have no right to fix the penalty. In some cases under the Customs Act there are fines inflicted, and it is stated distinctly in every order issued that "" in the above case there has been no fraudulent intent."" Here, let the Commissioner impose any penalty he thinks fit; but I will not vote for a clause as the outcome of which a person may be fined and may not kuow that he has beeu fined. It is more than possible that a person may make an honest mistake as to his liability under the Income Tax Act.

I want to help the Ministry to reach all defaulters. I would be willing to make the penalty higher, where there has been deliberate intent to evade the Act. That is why I would give the Commissioner a free hand.

Section 234 of exthat Act provides that no person shall any entry which is false in any particular, otherwise he shall be liable to a penalty of £ 1 0 0 . All that we are now asking is that, in' the light of experience, similar power shall be vested in the Comof Taxes. The effect of rendering it incumbent upon him to prove that person has knowingly and wilfully made a false statement will be that he will not secure a' conviction in one case out of one t t ) hundred. There are a number of other sections in the Customs Act which make is the actual fact, rather than the intent, been unbhe evidence of one's guilt.",58
266,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,What is meant by,58
267,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Since the honourable member has asked that question, I think that, as a rule, the Court""will construe it to mean what is diametrically opposite to fact. "" F a l s e "" is the exact opposite of truth . Under this clause, it will be in cumbent ori the prosecution to show that any statement by a taxpayer is false. In addition, the Commissioner will have to prove that the statement was wilfully and knowingly false. That is - exceedingly difficult to prove. This provision has been inserted because it is really necessary for administrative purposes, and the precedent which I have quoted justifies its inclusion.",58
268,Mr CORSER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wide Bay) [9.35] - I scarcely think that the Customs Act, which has been cited, can be regarded as a parallel case. From a long experience with Customs matters', I know that, in ninety-nine cases out of every one hundred, any man who makes a misstatement in regard to a Customs entry does so w i l full y . He has all his invoices before him, and consequently there is no excuse for error. But the preparation of an income tax schedule is an entirely different proposition. A man may unwittingly ' omit some item from his return, and, under this clause, that omission will render him liable to a penalty - If the provision be agreed to in its present for m , I fear his statement will be regarded as a false one, even though it was unintentionally false.",59
269,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Does the honourable member think that the Commissioner would take action in such.cases?,59
270,Mr CORSER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Unde r this provision, I think that he would be obliged to do so. I "" should like to hear the Minister'sopinion in regard to it .",59
271,Mr FINLAYSON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Brisbane) [9.36] There can be no doubt as to the desire of honourable members to assist the Government in insuring that this measure shall cover all persons who are liable to pay income tax. But the net which it is here sought to introduce has such a very fine mesh that I fear it will inflict hardship upon many persons. This clause will not only take away the protection which a taxpayer would otherwise have in regard to a statement which was not knowingly and w i l full y false, but it provides for prosecutions being instituted in regard to statements that are "" false in any particular."" Now, a wrong date may be regarded as a false statement. The words "" false in any particular "" seem to me to condemn the entire clause, because they will cover any misprint in typing, any mistake in wording, and anv error in the addition of figures. It is a good old principle of government that we should make it easy for the people to do right and hard for them to do wrong, but this clause will have the very opposite effect.",59
272,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wakefield) [9.39] - Many honourable members appear to imagine that the gentleman who sits at the receipt of custom is as rigi d and oppressive as were similar gentlemen in days of old. I do not think that he is. All through the Bill we have had to vest discretionary power in the hands of the Commissioner, and necessarily so. But it is not likely that he will be remarkable for unjust decisions, because, in that event, he would be absolutely intolerable. Ever since the first income tax in Australia was passed by the South Australian Parliament, I ' have had continuous experience of the treatment of my constituents by the Commissioner of Taxes for that State, and out of scores and scores of instances, I have never known one in which that officer wittingly gave an unjust decision. If we do not vest in the Federal Commissioner of Taxation the power that is here sought, we shall make efficient administration of his Department absolutely impossible. If we wish to cheapen that administration, the power sought to be conferred by this clause is not greater than we ought to concede to the Commissioner.",59
273,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"East Sydney) [9.41] Whilst I think that we should clothe the Commissioner of Taxation with reasonable discretionary powers, I do not'believe that we should go so far as is contemplated by this clause. Amongst other things, it provides that if any statement made by a taxpayer "" either verbally or in writing "" be false, a prosecution may be initiated. Without any intent to deceive the Commissioner, a taxpayer may very easilv make a false statement-particularl y an oral statement.",59
274,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Nearl y all prosecutions for perjury are founded on oral state-' ments.,59
275,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"But in those cases the offenders are prosecuted for statements made upon oath. Under this clause, if I were to go before the Commissioner of Taxation, and make a statement which was incorrect, I should be liable to a penalty. That is altogether unjust. Honourable members upon this side of the chamber are exceedingly anxious to assist the Government to perfect this measure, but their efforts in that direction are thwarted because Ministers have a solid majority behind them. What is being asked for is an unnecessary power. Under the clause the Commissioner might fine a man £200 or £300 for merely making some incorrect statement in his office. Such a thing is unheard of in a court of law. Would it not be possible to strike out the word "" v e r b a l"" ?",59
276,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"No , because of the connection of this clause with other clauses.",60
277,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It would be sumcient to provide a penalty for making any false answer i u writing. I am sure that the Oommittee would strike out the word ""verbal"" if the questiou.were not made a party one, and I defy the Minister to show me an instance in our civil or criminal law in which the word is similarly used. Of course, perjury is the result of a verbal statement; but it must be a statement ou oath. The mere mak-. ing of a false statement in the street is not perjury. I have no desire to help people to evade ""taxation, but we should legislate within the realm of reason.",60
278,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,You are sheltering the fat man.,60
279,Mr WEST,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It is the small taxpayer for whom I am speaking. He is not so deep and cunning as those who pay the big amounts. As a representative of the people, it is my duty to see that no injustice is done to any class of the community, but when extraordinary and unnecessary powers are given by an Act of Parliament, there is at least a possibility of injustice.",60
280,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [9.50] - The provision in the principal Act which we desire to strike out makes it an offence to knowingly and wilfully make and deliver any false return, and to make any false answer, whether verbally or in writing, in relation to any matter; the provision which the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West) has criticised is to be inserted in lieu of that. The question naturally arises, ""What is meant by making a false answer Verbally?"" Well, it is provided in section 27 that the Commissioner may, in writing, require any person, whether a taxpayer or not, to do certain things. He may require information or evidence to be given on oath, and either verbally or in writing. If a false statement is made at an inquiry which has been deliberately summoned by the Commissioner, the person who makes it can be prosecuted, but it is exceedingly difficult to obtain convictions uuder the law as it stands, and although there have been very many cases before the Crown Solicitor, the culty of proving them has been insurmountable. Very large sums of money are thus held back, and we ask that facilities shall be afforded for bringing the cases more easily before the Court. . Mr SINCLAIR (Moreton) [9.55] - If the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) will restrict his amendment to the omission of paragraph b, I shall be prepared to support him. That would leave the law as at present so far as the . punishment of persons making false returns is concerned.",60
281,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That would be the effect of my amendment as I have moved it. If my amendment is carried the present section will remain, and it provides for the penalty.",60
282,Mr SINCLAIR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It would leave it optional with the adjudicator to make the penalty what he pleased, from ls. up to £100. In the proposed new section a minimum penalty of £2 is provided for in the case of a person making a false statement in a return.",60
283,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,How is the offence to be proved ?,60
284,Mr SINCLAIR,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It has to be proved at the present time before any punishment can be imposed, and the objection of the Minister is that under the present section it is almost impossible to prove the attempt to wilfully deceive in making a false statement. I personally consider that the existing law is fairly watertight without this amending provision. It appears to me that by passing this Bill we shall be making it rather a dangerous matter to send in any'returns at all.",60
285,Mr CHARLTON,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Hunter) [9.58] - I ask leave to amend my amendment by moving the omission of paragraph b only. Amendment, by leave, amended accordingly",60
286,Mr LYN CH,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Werriwa) [9.59] - I am disposed to support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton). I sympathize with the Miuister in - the fact that it is extremely difficult for the Commissioner of Taxation to sheet home a false statement to the guilty party. But the proposed new section is very far-reaching, and very grave injustice might arise under it . The majority of people on the land, including even those who are in a fairly large way, do not keep books. They depend upou bank managers, and comdiffimission and other agents in towns and villages adjacent to their properties to make out their returns for them. It is now rather an expensive business in many cases for people to have these income tax returns made up, and with this new provision making the agent liable also, it will be a rather risky business for persons making up the returns of others who do not keep books.",60
287,Mr CORSER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wide Bay) [10.0] - I have consulted the Miuister in charge of the Bill , and also the Commissioner of Taxation, and I find that i u such cases as those, to which I referred, there would be no possible chance of imposing a penalty. I understand that such cases are very numerous, and the purpose of this amending provision is merely to put the Taxation Department in a position to impose penalties where people have w i l full y made false returns. Under the existing law it is almost impossible to prove that false statements in the returns have beeu made wilfully. People who make these false returns will continue to try to evade taxation unless some penalty is attached to their action. I am satisfied with the assurance I have received from the Minister and the Commissioner.",61
288,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,The Minister might also assure the Committee.,61
289,Mr CORSER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I hope that he will make the same explanation to the Comto mittee that he has made to me. He satisfied me that the Government are askmittee divided. ing for the amending provision merely in order to protect the Treasury, and with no idea whatever of penalizing those who may have unwittingly made a mistake in the preparation of their returns.",61
290,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wentworth) [10.3] - I have listened with the greatest interest to Archibald, W. O. what the honourable member for Wide Bay Bamford, F. W. (Mr Corser) has said. I was anticipating Bayley, J. a. that after the honourable member sat down Boyd, J. A. the Minister would be equally frank with Corser, the Committee. I object to these secret Glynn, P. MCM. conferences between Ministers and promiGreene, W. M. nent supporters! They do not bind the Gregory, H."" Taxation Department at all . But any Groom, L. E. words from the Miuister in charge of the Jowett, Bill would, perhaps, receive some passing acknowledgment from the gentlemen in trusted with the administration of the law. Por that reason I shall be glad if Chapman, Aastin the Minister will make to the Committee Charlton, M. the statement which he has made to the Finlayson. W. F. honourable member for Wide Bay.",61
291,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Angas-Minister for Lynch, J. Home and Territories) [10.4] - I have alMahony, VV. G. ready mentioned that the Commissioner Maloney, Dr [165] of Taxation will regard with a great deal of leniency any offence that has not been deliberately intended. The honourable member for Wide Bay asked me about the matter, and I told him what I had already told the Committee. I did not oonsider it was necessary to - repeat my previous statement to the Committee. But now that I have risen again, I will say that the section which this clause proposes to amend is a very difficult one to enforce. I do not believe that any cases under it have ever reached the Court. There have beeu cases in which sums of money running into many thousands. of pounds have not been included in returns. Men in a big way of business very often employ agents to malse up their returns. We can very seldom hope to get a conviction against a mau who, wheu .charged with having wilfully and knowingly mada a false statement in an income tax return, is in a position to say that the return was made up by an agent. For that reason it has been considered that it is necessary to do in connection with this, measure what we have already sanctioned in connection with the Customs Act and other Acts in order to protect the revenue.

292,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Capricornia) [10.12] I hope the legal members of the Committee will correct me if I am wrong in saying that an entirely new principle is introduced into our legislation by paragraph c of clause 40, in which it is proposed to provide that a penalty of ""not less than Two pounds"" shall be imposed. In the Customs Act we find, at the end ot each section, the words ""Penalty, £100 "" ; "" Penalty, £50 "" ; and so ou.",62
293,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That , under the Acts In terpretation Act, is the maximum penalty.",62
294,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Quite so; and the magistrate dealing' with a case under the Customs Act may fine the defendant any sum below the penalty set out in the section. ""We are anxious that magistrates dealing with offences under this measure shall have full power to impose whatever penalty they think fit, provided that the maximum is not exceeded. If they think that au offender should be fined only 10s., they should have the power to do so. Here, however, it is proposed to compel magistrates to fine the defendant i u a prosecution under section 58 of the principal Act not less than £2. I do not think a magistrate should be put in such a position that he might be tempted to dismiss a case rather than fine the defendant £2, wheu he thinks he ought not to be fined more than 10s. I move That paragraph o be left out.",62
295,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"""Wentworth) [10.15] I cannot see why the magistrates should not be trusted outright. The Acts Interpretation Act is very clear as to the meaning of the maximum penalty. It simply means that the magistrate has a discretion up to the limit of the amount stated in the Act. I do not know that it is wise to limit him. It is possible, as the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) says, that he may be tempted, if he does not think the offence is worth a fine of £2, to wipe out the fine altogether, PAIRS. and that is not what we want. ""We want the penalty to fit the crime, and the best man to decide that is the man who tries the case. I do not suppose the Minister cares whether the proposal is carried or not.",62
296,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,I think it is desirable on the facts before me to carry it.,62
297,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,We are asked to do something entirely novel in Federal legislation.,62
298,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"It is not novel. There is a provision for a minimum fine of £5 under the Entertainments Tax Act, with a maximum of, I think, £100.",62
299,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Then the proposal is not novel; but, as we are not familiar with the facts, I should like to know what is in the Minister's mind.",62
300,Mr BRENN AN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Batman) [10.17]. - I , also, am curious to hear what the Minister has to say. My experience is that where the maximum fine is £100. magistrates take the view that in every case where there is to be a conviction there must be a really substantial penalty.",62
301,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The proper course then seems to be to change the magistrates and not the law, which is very explicit.",62
302,Mr BRENNAN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I rather agree. There is a heroic movement on foot in Melbourne to, change the magistrates; and I hope, though I say it with fear and trembling, that it will be successful. The effect of putting in a small minimum would be to induce magistrates in many cases to impose only the minimum penalty. A week or two ago, a case was tried in Melbourne under the Entertainments Tax Act, in which the Police Magistrate, having heard the evidence, fixed the penalty at 40s. The officer of the Crown Law Department told him he had no power to do so as the minimum penalty was £5. The magistrate then made the penalty £5, although he had declared that in his opinion 40s. would be an adequate penalty. He was obliged by the Act to make the penalty £5, which is a very anomalous position. If we are fixing a minimum, let us by all means fix a low one; but I am curious to know what is in the mind of the Department in regard to this proposal.",62
303,Mr CORSER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wide Bay) [10.20] I understand the object of inserting a minimum is to make the penalties as nearly uniform as possible in every State. At present, a magistrate in one State may find the defendant guilty and yet refuse to inflict a penalty, or, perhaps, while «in another State another magistrate imposes a penalty of £2 fdr exactly the same offence. The magistrates will still have the right to go above the minimum. Mr Glynn"" (Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [10.21] - The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) has stated the reason for the posal. We want some uniformity in the penalties> and that uniformity does not now exist. Some magistrates impose a fine of Is., and others of £3. If we insert a minimum of £2, it will'be some guide, and the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) knows that magistrates must have something to guide them.",62
304,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Jus t now the Minister, in getting paragraph b assented to, said that taxpayers would not be proceeded against for mistakes that were not intentional. Does he then propose to ask for a minimum fine of only £2 for fraudulently false statements?",63
305,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Parliamen t has already giveu the Courts power to impose a fine of up to £100, which gives the magistrates a very wide discretion. Before 1904, the practice was always to insert a minimum for guidance- I think I may say that that was so in criminal legislation generally-but , for the brevity in drafting Acts, we followed the precedent established, I think, by the Mr Kingston in South Australia, by putting at the bottom of the section a sum which would be the maximum within which penalties might be imposed. The removal of the minimum in some cases worked badly, because it led to varying penalties, as I have stated, in cases where the merits were practically similar. What has been done is to take the character of offences covered by this section. It is thought that the Commissioner will not decide to prosecute unless the merits are fairly clear. If hedoes, it is a case in which a minimum penalty of £2 should be imposed. Under the previous clause he may have considered that a penalty of £1 a month should be imposed, but may decide not to take action under that clause, and to prosecute under this clause. If he does, the penalty of £1 under the previous clause is not imposed. [165]- 2",63
306,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Can you imagine any case of real fraud which a penalty of £2 would meet?,63
307,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,There will still be a discretion to fine up to £100.,63
308,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,The Minister said this clause would be used only in case of fraud.,63
309,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I did not say "" in cases of fraud,"" because "" fraud "" has a technical meaning. I meant that neither this nor the last section would be availed of pro- unless there were clear merits to show that the man ought to be convicted. The Commissioner does not prosecute in every case. Where he finds that au offence has been committed and - .discovers the offender, he gives him notice in every case. It may be to correct something or give him an opportunity to explain. If a prosecution is begun, it means that on the merits the Commissioner thinks there should be a conviction, in which case there should be a penalty of at least £2. The present law on the subject has been working so irregularly that there is a feeling in the community that justice is being rather unequally administered.",63
310,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Wentworth) [10.25] - I understood the Minister to assure the Committee that proceedings would only be taken in cases where, although fraud could not be proved, it was quite clear in the mind of the Commissioner. If that is the case, we should leave the penalty sake of clause as it stands in the Act.",63
311,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I presume that the honorlate able member means cases where there has beeu deception, and not a purely involuntary offence.",63
312,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Any deception should be heavily punished, andwe should not give any guidance to magistrates to impose a minimum penalty.",63
313,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"On e magistrate may impose a penalty of 5s., and another may make the fine £ 5 .",63
314,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The magistrate who would impose a penalty of 5s. or £ 5 in a case of fraud would not be fit for his job. Some honourable members, in view of the Minister's previous explanation, might apprehend that the proposed administration ' of the Act would not tfollpw the lines indicated by the Minister.",63
315,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,There will be no prosecution unless the merits are fairly clear to the Commissioner.,63
316,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"In that case we should allow the section to 'stand, with the maximum penalty only stated.",63
317,Mr GLYNN,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,But there are other offences in the section.,64
318,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I am aware of that, but they are serious offences, dealing with neglect or refusal to attend to give evidence, or with failure to answer any questions, or produce any books or papers required. These are not trifling offences for which a minimum penalty should be fixed as a guide. I hope that the .Minister will reconsider the provision, and not ask the Committee to go to a division on the matter.",64
319,Mr HIGGS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Capricornia) [10.20] The Minister is endeavouring to attain the unattainable in seeking to have all magisterial decisions uniform. A groat deal depends upon the magistrate, and upon his state of mind, and the hour of the day. A very judicial-minded gentleman who was Chairman of the Tariff Commission would say very politely to the witness at 10 o'clock in the morning, "" What' is your name, please; will you kindly take a seat?"" but at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when a witness appeared, he would say very --abruptly, ""What is your name? Sit down."" We can imagine a magistrate inflicting a fine of 10s. in the morning, and after dinner inflicting a fine of £2 or more for the same offence. I quite agree that we should allow full discretion to every magistrate, because we cannot get uniformity. If the Minister gets uniformity in regard to the £2 penalty, he will not get it in regard to fines ranging higher than £2.",64

Motion (by Mr Watt) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",64
328,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Cook) [10.43] - I ask the Acting Prime Minister (Mr. Watt) if he will be good enough to see that the reprint of speeches, belonging to me, and seized by the Defence Department, are returned. Many reasons have been given for the seizure of those parcels, and every one of them has absolutely fallen to the ground. It was at first stated that the printing of the coat-of-arms on the front page was illegal; but this matter having been referred to the Crown Solicitor's Office, the Crown Solicitor stated that no breach of the law had been committed. Secondly, the Government initiated two prosecutions, the first charging that the reprint was likely to prejudice His Majesty's relations with a foreign Power. That issue, on public trial, has been found invalid as a matter of fact, and the questiou was thus beyond any possibility of appeal. Thirdly, it was charged that the reprint was seized upon au inducement to the Government Printer to break the Censorship regulations; and the magistrate, upon public trial, dismissed that case. NOES. } Then Senator Pearce, when all the legal grounds had been dissipated, and when again challenged in the Senate on this interference and seizure, gave as his justification that there was a quotation in that speech from a pro-German publication. That was just one of PAIBS. those falsehoods which a weak man, who Anstey, F . has not got a reason, and who has not the courage to admit that he has made a mistake, at times falls back upou. In regard to this so-called pro-German publication, Senator Pearce made two points-first , that the publication was pro-German; and second, that the article in question was written and produced in the publication before America entered the war. Senator Pearce, apparently, put forward the second reason as accounting for the fact that such an article had appeared in an SPEECHES: American newspaper, his insinuation being that it could not have appeared after America had entered the war, because America and Japan were then allied. It has taken some weeks to drag any kind of explanation-from Senator Pearce in this respect. I asked what was the proGerman publication referred to, what was the date of the article, and what was the article of which he complained. After quite a number of attempts, Senator Pearce has at last given his answer, such as it is. He says, "" I have made a mistake ; this article was riot produced before America entered the war; I was wrong in that respect."" He says the paper is the Chicago Tribune, and that he imagined it was a pro-German publication because of the nature of the article. The Chicago Tribune is known as one of the most powerful newspapers in the world, if not, as I was going to say, the most powerful; at any rate, I believe it has the largest circulation of any newspaper.",65
329,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Who controls that newspaper ? . Mr JH CATTS - Mr Medell MCCormack, a Congressman for the State of Mew York, is chairman of directors. He sits in the House of Representatives, elected, I believe, at the - head of the poll for the whole State, as one of two alternate representatives; and, although sitting in that House, has, under the American arrangement, a kind of roving commission. Mr MCCormack complained of America's insufficient preparations in connection with the war; and, after an agitation, brought about the visit of a Commission, of which he was chairman, to the Italian and French Fronts, which camp back with a report admitted on all hands to have greatly accelerated the assistance of America to the Allies. Senator Pearce now admits that on one point he is wrong, and that the article was not written before, but since, America entered the war. On the other point of the nature of the publication, my position is strengthened by the Acting Prime Minister, for, when I rose today to ask if he would push this matter to' some definite conclusion in order that Senator Pearce might substantiate what he had said, or withdraw it like a man, the honourable gentleman in his opening remarks referred, in probably more glowing terms than I could use, to the power and influence of this American journal.",65
330,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,It is one of the most powerful journals in the United States.,66
331,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,And I think you know suflicient to be able to say that it is certainly a pro-Ally newspaper.,66
332,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"What is the good of referring again to the question now? You brought up the question before, and I promised to make inquiries.",66
333,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I am not on that phase now, but dealing with the points one after the other.",66
334,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,We reported progress because honourable members desired to go home.,66
335,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I shall not keep the House more than a few minutes, and only take this opportunity because I shall not be here on the adjournment tomorrow.",66
336,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,I am grateful!,66
337,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"This seizure took place about two months ago. It was admitted that, of these reprints, 4,500 were still being held in the .Department, although all the legal points raised in favour of the seizure had been beaten. Then there was the point as to the coatof-arms, and the absolute failure of the two prosecutions, without the defendant being called upon to go into the box. Now, on the admission of Senator Pearce, and according to the statement of the Acting Prime Minister, the contention as to this being a pro-German jiublication has disappeared. There is absolutely no grounds in tha world for the retention of these reprints.",66
338,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Would it be fair to ask the honourable member what he proposes to do with the reprints. Mr ,T. H . CATTS - I propose to circulate them mainly in my electorate.",66
339,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,That is hardly fair to the honourable member.,66
340,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That is just one of those little, jokes of the honourable member which can be accepted in the same good humour as that in which he laughingly submits it . All I now say is that this seizure resolves itself into neither more nor less than a pure act of common theft; ' it has no legal ground or basis. I have waited for some considerable time to see whether the Defence Department, or whatever authority controls the matter, would have the common decency to return the parcels seized in these parliamentary buildings without auy legal warrant or justification.",66
341,Mr FINLAYSOIT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,You have remarkable faith if you expected anything of the kind!,66
342,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I say quite candidly that I am anxious to circulate this statement, for the reason that it contains what I conceive to be Australian Labour's attitude towards this war. The reprints are intended primarily for circulation in my .electorate. I therefore hope that, aa all these grounds for the seizure have now fallen, the Acting Prime Minister will",66
343,Mr JOWETT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,Le t the matter drop.,66
344,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"There is another point. There is a bill from the Government Printer for £12 odd, which I informed him he had better submit to the Speaker's Department, since those goods had been delivered to an oflicer of Mr. Speaker, and were never delivered tft me.",66
345,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,I think Mr Speaker ought to pay it out of his salary.,66
346,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"And , if the Government Printer would deliver to me my order for copies of the reprint, I added that I should be very pleased to pay for them.",66
347,Mr KELLY,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,You ought not to be asked to pay that bill.,66
348,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That is a very sensible and statesmanlike utterance from the honourable member, and, having gained that much sympathy, I shall close by again asking that the speeches be returned to me, there being nojustification for their retention.",66
349,Mr BAMFORD,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Herbert) [10.57] I desire to make a personal explanation. When the Lands Acquisition (Defence) Bill was being debated in this Chamber a few nights ago, I said that I intended to vote against the second reading. I find that the division was taken during my temporary absence, and, not expecting to be long away from my seat, I was unfortunate enough not to have obtained a pair. I u the division list I note that I am put down as having paired in favour of the Bill, whereas if I had been here I would have voted against it .",67
350,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Barrier) [10.59]. - I desire to say a few words with respect to the action of the Defence Department in connection with the removal of the prohibition by guardians of those under age who desire to enlist for service overseas. I intend to quote a letter from a Moama resident which will show how the business people of Melbourne are treating lads who are just becoming of military age - This is written by a youth who recently, came to Melbourne from Moama looking for work:239 Lonsdale-street, Melbourne. My dear Mother, Just a few lines to let you know that I am in the best of health, and hoping to hear that you are the same. Well, mother, I have a bit of crook news to tell. I went to Swallow's, and they said they were only employing sixteen to seventeen years, and would not start me.",67
351,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,On e swallow does not make a summer.,67
352,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"No , but this swallow might make a stir. The letter continuesI told them. I was on holidays, and my time was up to start Monday night. But they said they were putting off those who are of age. But 1 suppose I wiU get another job sooner or later. 1 hope so, anyway. I have been to a couple of places, and they said 1 was a bit too old for what they want me to do, but that I was good enough to go to the war. This lad is 17 years of age. His continuesIf 1 had known this, I would .have taken on Moreland. But I suppose it is taken. 1 will give it this week, and if nothing crops up 1 will have to take the war on. I am a bit too old now. If you say you are seventeen, they will you 15s. and find yourself; and if you say eighteen years, "" Go to the war."" This shows that such things are taking place. There has been a lot of discussion regarding the economic conscription of those over twenty-one years, who can please themselves whether they go or stay home from the war. Things like this come from patriotic employers, such as the individual who gave a lad two hours off on ANZAC Day, and then docked those two hours from his pay. That occurred in another establishment in Melbourne. We have seen in the press that there have been a number of youths of eighteen who, by reason of the removal of the prohibition, have joined the Forces. But if this kind of thing is going on, and the Government allow it, lads of about that age will be forced out of employment in ""the same way as unscrupulous employers have forced older men out to make them go to the war. In view of the promises of the Government at the Recruiting Conference that no economic pressure would be brought to bear to force recruits into camp, it is up to them now to give those employers in Melbourne and elsewhere the hint that their actions are contrary to Government policy.",67
353,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Illawarra) [11.3] - On e phase of the subject brought before the House by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) has been passed over, which should be kept in mind by those having the ultimate decision in the matter. I have not had an opportunity of reading the reprint of the honourable member's speech, but I understand that it contains the same reference to one of the Allies as that which appears in the Official Hansard. If that is so the release of the documents is not so easy as the honourable member would have the House, believe..",67
354,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,That has been dealt with at a public trial.,67
355,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"And in a way which, it seems to me, makes it necessary for the Govermnent to consider seriously before they associate themselves letter with the release of the pamphlets.",67
356,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The Court dealt with it in no very complimentary way, from the viewpoint of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts).",67
357,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,It was shown that give there was no legal justification for it. It was a bit of nastiness by Bryant.,67
358,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The finding of the Court, as I read it in . the full reports of the Melbourne papers, was most offensive to the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts), and embodied the curious point of law that a statement coming from one person might be entirely innocuous, which, coming from another, would be likely to provoke international disturbances.",67
359,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"That statement was made by Bryant, who was paid by the Government to act as prosecutor.",68
360,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I am speaking on the authority of the report I read in the Melbourne newspapers. The words were so extraordinary that they live in my memory. In those circumstances, I feel that the Government would be taking a considerable risk if they associated themselves in any way with statements which were declared to be innocent only because of their source.",68
361,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.6] - In reference to the representations of the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine), and the letter he read regarding an apparent case of what, I think, is falsely called economic conscription, the Government have no hesitation at all in saying that they do not believe in pressure of that description. We have said so before, and I say so now. Mr CoNsroura - You know that it is going on.",68
362,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,I do not know that it is going on.,68
363,Mr CONSIDINE,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,The honourable member must he very blind.,68
364,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"I am not idle like the honourable member. I am busy with other essential things. If I knew that economic conscription was taking place, I should say so. I do not wish the House to imagine that the conduct of which the honourable member complains is general. He implied that all the employers were embarking on what he called an unpatriotic course of action. I do not believe that. At the Recruiting Conference representatives of the employing class adopted most cheerfully the undertaking of the Commonwealth Government that there should be no economic conscription; and, so far as I am aware, they' are, through their organizations, giving effect to that undertaking. It is the wish of the Government that the promises made at the Conference shall be observed, aud we shall endeavour to see that that is done. I ask the honourable member to accept that assurance - I would remind him that he has-not yet,proved that the statements made in the letter he quoted are correct, and he is old enough to kuow that one story is good until another is told. I u regard to the complaint of the honourable membeT for Cook (Mr Catts), I remind the honourable member that what he tried to do in this House was, in the judgment of a majority of members, reprehensible.",68
365,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,That was a view taken by a party division.,68
366,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"The honourable membeT tried to do through the agency of Hansard and a Teprint from Hansard, what he knew he would not be permitted to do outside this House, and his action had special reference to the relationship of this country, with an Ally of ourselves and Great Britain. He knew very well that, had he uttered ou the public platform the sentiments to which he gave expression in the House respecting that Ally, the censor, for legitimate military reasons, would not have permitted their publication in the press. But the honourable * member came to this House, aud, in the exercise of a privilege that is very often abused, sought to get a reprint of his speech in ' the House for circulation in his owu electorate and perhaps elsewhere.",68
367,Mr MASSYGREENE,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"He was bound oveT by the Court not to repeat the statements. * Mr Watt-That is so; and I remember that, ou two occasions I , as a Minister, .begged the Chair not to allow those references to be made by the honourable member. His conscience is not satisfied by auy proclamation of what his own belief is. The honourable member knows that this country is at war, and if there is to be a censorship at all--and we all agree that there should be-for military reasons certain things ought not to be expressed or published.",68
368,Mr JH CATTS,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,I believe that I am doing perfectly right.,68
369,Mr WATT,WAR LOAN SECURITIES,"Then I say the honourable member is deaf to the teachings of this war, and, with very great respeot to hi3 views, I say he is blind to the dangers of indiscreet utterances, which may be serviceable to the enemy and hurtful to our Allies. I cannot hold out any hope that the reprints of his speech will be released. That is my own view; but it is not fair to spring such a question on me at the termination of the sitting, and expect me to give an answer. I promise that I shall obtain the views of my colleague who presides over the Defence, Department. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.10 pjn.",68
