1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Will you be kind enough, Mr Speaker, to inform the House when the Opposition will have the use of the room in this building that has always been used by Opposition members?",12
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"My desire is, of course, to meet the convenience of every honourable member, as far as practicable, in this matter. It has been represented to me by those who are at present in occupation of the room on the ground floor, usually known as the Opposition room, that they wish to remain there, but I have tried to get the Whips of the two parties to come to an agreement as to the disposition of rooms. The suggestion has been made, and I think it is a very good one, that the members of the Ministerial party might occupy the room on the ground floor which has hitherto been the Opposition room, and of which they are now in possession, and that the members of the Opposition party might retain the room on the floor above, taking in addition the room on the ground floor that was last session used by the Independent party, and which I am informed has generally been regarded, and sometimes used as a Ministerial room, the Independent party being no longer in existence. If it is not agreeable to members of the Opposition to keep the room that they now have, with the smaller, room on the ground floor, the Ministerialists will take the upstairs room, and the smaller room on the lower floor will be allotted to the member for Eden-Monaro - on account oE .his physical disability to move freely up and down so many stairs. I do not propose to disturb the present arrangement if it meets with the general approval of members.",12
3,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"A m I to understand that the members of the Opposition party are not to use the room that has always been known as the Opposition room, unless the members of the Ministerial party consent ? *",13
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"As I have said, it my wish to meet the convenience of honourable members of both sides, but any conflict of opinion on this matter makes it necessary if somewhat difficult for me to come to a decision. If the members of the Opposition desire tli8 ground floor room now in possession of the members of the Ministerial party, they are at liberty to take it , but if they do so, they must give up the small ground floor room occupied for some time by what was known as the Independent party, because there is one member of the Ministerial party, at any rate, who has informed ms that he cannot, on account of severe physical affliction, go up ancl downstairs frequently, and accommodation must be found for him on the lower floor. I propose, in the circumstances, that if the present arrangement is not continued the small room on the floor shall be set aside for him. Later :",13
5,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I desire to thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for the way i u which you have attended to the comfort of honourable members, and especially for your desire to meet the wishes of the Opposition. I wish now to ask whether, if the Opposition desire to have the use of the room on the ground floor, which has always been at their disposal, you will facilitate their getting it?",13
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I shall have no objection, but I wish it to be understood, in that case, that the room adjoining will be reserved for an infirm member of this House, who is unable to go to the upstairs room.",13
7,Mr BAMEORD,Unknown,"I wish to correct a statement that has been made in regard to these rooms. You stated, sir, that you had been informed that a certain room had always been used by members of the Ministerial party. I wish to inform you that when the first Parliament met members of the Labour party had no room at all, save one in the basement which was shown to us. We were then permitted to use the room on the ground floor, to which reference has just been made, and we used to meet in that room. We continued to do so, at least during the life of the first Parliament, if not afterwards. There were only twenty-four of us at that time-sixtee n members in this House and eight in another place - and we held all our meetings there; so that you must have been misinformed, is Mr Speaker, as to that room having been used always by members of the Ministerial party. The Ministerial room was then, as now, upstairs. That being so, there is no precedent for members of the Ministerial party using the room in question on the ground floor. If the room were placed at our disposal, it would be a very great convenience to those members of my party who are not too agile in getting up and down stairs.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"On e honourable member of this House has informed me that it is physically impossible for him to go upstairs owing to the stroke of paralysis he suffered some time ago. I must provide accommodation for him, and, if the present arrangements are unsuitable, and no other accommodation is available, I shall have to retain for him the use of the smaller room to which I have referred. ground Under the existing arrangement there is no necessity for the honourable member for Herbert to have his room upstairs, as the extra room oil the lower floor is at present available for his use.",13
9,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"In view of your reply, sir, have you considered that it is well known that members in another place, and members occupying seats in this Chamber use a room at times for joint deliberation ? And has it been considered that giving the Ministerial side the large room in conjunction with the small room means giving forty-five members larger accommodation, while refusing to sixty-six members that accommodation which had practically been set aside for them by the rules?",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It was precisely fact that those occupying the Opposition benches in conjunction with members of another House required more accommodation that suggested the idea that they should retain' the largest room available. That was the main guiding principle that led me uot to disturb the present arrangement, because I recognised that the large room upstairs was certainly the best for large gatherings. I was desirous of meeting the convenience of honourable members. I recognised that the larger room upstairs was best adapted to meetings such as the present Opposition members were likely to have, and that the room below does not confer anything like the accommodation the room upstairs gives in this respect.",14
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Has not the small room downstairs always been regarded as a Ministerial room ? also like to know, sir, whether you deem it an imperative part of your duty to provide accommodation on this side of the building for senators for purely party purposes ?",14
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"W it h regard to the first part of that question, from inquiry I am informed that the small room below is properly a Ministerial room, and was at one time occupied by the Ministerial party, and that not very long ago.",14
13,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Since Federation?,14
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Yes ; during the Deakin and Reid Administrations, l t has been used for various purposes, but has been used as a Ministerial room. It was almost exclusively used by the late Sir William Lyne as his room for some time; but, by courtesy of Sir William Lyne, other members were permitted to go into it for the purpose of writing their correspondence. I am not laying this down as a statement from my own knowledge, but I have made inquiries on the subject, and, so far as I can learn, it was so. As to the other portion of the Prime Minister's question, as I have said, while it may not be my duty to provide accommodation for members of another place, still it is my desire to meet the convenience of members as far as possible. . PUBLICATION OF STATISTICS.",14
15,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I ask the Minister of Home Affairs whether he has seen the little pocket-book of statistics issued by the Government Statistician of New South Wales, and whether it would be possible the for the Commonwealth Statistician to issue a similar book, but a little larger, say, a book 4 inches by 3^ inches, which would contain in handy form information relating to the whole Commonwealth.",14
16,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall look into the matter and see what can be done. Later :,14
17,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"A d v e r t in g to the question put by the honourable member for Yarra, I desire to ask the Honorary Minister whether, in the event of such a book' being published by the Commonwealth, he will consider the desirableness of furnishing in it statistics relating to the value of the estates of deceased persons in groups, and the same figures in relation to income tax ?",14
18,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall consider the honourable member's request. NA I would LOCOMOTIVE.,14
19,Mr HOWE,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Yesterday I asked if it is the purpose of the Government to import an internal combustion . locomotive for the Federal Territory. I should have asked, Is it intended to import such a locomotive for any of the Commonwealth services? If it is the intention to i m port such a locomotive, will the Minister, in view of our Protectionist policy, consider the advisability of first calling for tenders throughout the Commonwealth ?",14
20,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"The question of getting an experimental internal combustion engine for use on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta line has been under consideration for some time past. The Engineer-in-Chief for Commonwealth Railways has reported that an estimated saving in constructional cost for water conservation of over Â£250,000 can be effected if we can procure a satisfactory type of internal combustion engine. That saving would be apart from the saving that would result from the use of such engines instead of steam engines for the ordinary working of the line over country where there are difficulties in obtaining water for boiler purposes-difficultie s due, not to scarcity of water, but to defects in the water. The question is engaging the serious attention of the Government; but if the honourable member desires fuller information, and will give notice of detailed questions, I sball obtain for him all the information that the Department can give. ELECTOR AL BILL. Bill presented by Mr KELLY .",14
21,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [2.44] - In order to facilitate the consideration of this Bill , I move That the Bill be now read a first time.  Mr SPEAKER,-This motion is formal. The honourable member's right to ask a question will not be interfered with. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a first time. Motion (by Mr KELLY ) proposed - That the second reading be made an Order of the Day for tomorrow.  to make inquiries about this Bill . When we were speaking yesterday in connection with the introduction of the Electoral Bill the Honorary Minister repeatedly told us that if we would sit down he would give us the scope of the Bill .",15
22,Mr HIGGS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Hear , hear ! He misled the House. He grossly deceived us.  but all the members on this side of the House. He sat at the table and flourished the Bill , saying, "" If you will only sit down I will explain the Bill . """,15

I merely wish to assert my rights. When I rose previously you told me that I would have a chance later on. I am accepting that chance. I wish to know, if the Honorary Minister had the information last night, as he said he had, why he did not give ' it to us then, in stead of abusing us ?",15
24,Mr BAMFORD,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"On a point of order, is it not rather irregular, when questions - are being asked, for a Minister to introduce a Bill which evidently will provoke considerable discussion on the issue as to whether it should be read a second time tomorrow ? It may rjrevent us from proceeding with the other business on the notice-paper.",15
25,Mr ARCHIBALD,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"On a point of order, majority ? is it competent at question time for the Government to introduce a Bill and the first reading?",15
26,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"It is in order to do so. There is nothing in the Standing Orders against it , so far as I know, and I am informed by the Clerk that it is in accordance with occasional practice.",15
27,Mr HIGGS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Capricornia) [2.48] - I think this Bill should be made au Order of the Day for today.,15
28,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Unde r our Standing Orders the. second reading must be an Order of the Day for a subsequent day.,15
29,Mr HIGGS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Las t night the Honorary Minister told us that he was bursting with anxiety to give us information. Far be it from me to obstruct business. I merely wish to draw attention to the fact that last night the Minister was evidently not ready. Apparently he and the Attorney-General have been in collaboration since then, and have discovered something that had to be put in the Bill .",15
30,Mr THOMAS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Barrier) [2.49] While I have no objection to this motion, at the same time. I think we should have had au explanation from the Honorary Minister why he did not take the first reading last night when permission was granted by the House. He could also have moved last night to fix the second reading for today. It seems to me, liowever, that he did not have the Bill ready. If that is so, then the Opposition cannot be accused of having obstructed business yesterday.",15
31,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"The honourable member is not now discussing the motion before the Chair, which is that the second reading of the Bill be an Order of the Day for tomorrow.",15
32,Mr THOMAS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"It is a pity that it is not to be proceeded with today. It could have been if the Minister had moved yesterday that it be read a first time. - Mr KELLY - B y leave of the House, sir, could I not bring on the motion for the second reading of the Bill today?",15
33,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Order ! The honourable member must not address the Chair while sitting down.,15
34,Mr THOMAS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,The Government with their majority could so arrange the business,15
35,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Have we a,15
36,Mr THOMAS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I have read that the move honourable gentleman says that he has a majority of one.,15
37,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,And some of Opposition have declared that it is a shameful thing to say.,16
38,Mr THOMAS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I have not, but in the division on the motion of censure the Government had a majority of one. It seems to me that if the Minister had the Bill ready he could have moved the first reading yesterday. If it was not ready, then the Opposition cannot be blamed for debating for some hours, as we did yesterday, the motion for leave to introduce it .",16
39,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"On a point of order, sir, I notice that honourable members opposite express a burning anxiety to proceed with the Bill today, and I wish to know whether, with the consent of the House, the second reading of the Bill could be made an Order of the Day for this day ?",16
40,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,That could certainly be done if the House agreed to the suspension of the Standing Orders and gave leave on the lines suggested by the honourable member.,16
41,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I ask that leave be granted. ,16
42,Mr ROBERTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,It could not be done by leave. The Standing Orders would have to be suspended.,16
43,Mr BOYD,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Now the Opposition have fallen into their own trap.  plenty more traps.,16
44,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Order ! Mr JosE.pn COOK - Hear , hear !",16
45,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I ask of the Ministerial bench particularly to set an example to the rest of the House. I have repeatedly appealed to honourable members to observe the propriety and decorum of debate.,16
46,Mr MCDONALD,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Kennedy) [2.54] It would be much better for the Honorary Minister to fix some day next week for the second reading of this Bill instead of proposing that the House shall proceed with its consideration tomorrow. The honourable gentleman had ample opportunity yesterday to bring the Bill up to the second-reading stage. H a d he done so it would have been distributed this morning, and we could have studied it this afternoon during the consideration of private members' business. It requires to be carefully considered, and had this course been followed we should have been in a position to discuss it tomorrow. As it is the Minister has placed the whole House in a most awkward position. I m the portant matters are set down for consideration after dinner, so that we shall have no time to look through this B i l i before the meeting of the House tomorrow morning.",16
47,Mr LAIRD SMITH,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,This is hasty legislation.,16
48,Mr MCDONALD,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"And hasty legislation is detrimental to the best interests of the country. I trust that the honourable gentleman will allow the further consideration of this Bill to be postponed u n t i l Wednesday or Thursday next. We should then be prepared, to deal with the second reading. If the Prime Minister will agree to that course I shall have nothing more to say.",16
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [2.55] - I am very willing to meet my honourable friends in any reasonable way, but with what object do they suggest postponing this matter t ill Wednesday or Thursday next?",16
50,Mr MCDONALD,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Tuesda y next will do. Our complaint is that we shall not have time to study the Bill before tomorrow.,16
51,Mr THOMAS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,We want to know why it was not laid on the table yesterday?,16
52,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Order !,16
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I think, on consideration, that it is a great pity that we did not move the first reading of the Bill last night, so that the Opposition could have considered it at its caucus this mornoccupants ing.  about that.",16
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Why did not honourable members opposite mention last night what they wanted ?,16
55,Mr ARCHIBALD,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Because the Government did not have the Bill ready last night.,16
56,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,We had it ready yesterday.,16
57,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Will the Prime M in ister resume his seat? Every day I have had to call the attention of the House to the frequency of interjections, and to appeal to honourable members to assist me in carrying out the Standing Orders. I cannot do this without the assistance of the House, and it is not right that I should be compelled continually to interrupt honourable members while addressing the Chair in order to try to get a hearing for them. I hope that it will not be necessary for me to make any further appeal, but that reasonable opportunities will be given every honourable member to make his speech with something' like coherency.",16
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"What took place last night was not at all unusual. The Government did not introduce the Bill last night for reasons of its own, which do not concern in the least my honourable friends opposite. If they want to know these reasons I invite them to come to our next Cabinet meeting. time, may I suggest that a debate of this kind is unprecedented in this Chamber ?",17
59,Mr THOMAS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Not when the honourable gentleman and his party were in Opposition ?,17
60,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Such a thing has never been done in the history of this Parliament.,17
61,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Evidentl y the honourable gentleman did not know everything when he was on this side of the House.,17
62,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I hope I did not know anything of these unworthy tactics.,17
63,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,This is rich from the Prime Minister.,17
64,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Order !,17
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I must ask honourable members opposite to allow busiuess to proceed in the ordinary way, and to extend to the Government the time honoured privilege of shaping its own business in its own way. That, I think, is a reasonable request.",17
66,Mr ROBERTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Adelaide) [2.59] - I am inclined to the view that the Prime Minister is correct when he says there is no precedent for the procedure now being followed. No doubt that is due to the fact that no Minister in the past was so f r i g h t full y inept as to bungle matters the Minister in charge of this Bill has done. It is, perhaps, a matter for regret that the very first Bill which it was his honour to introduce to the House should have been so badly bungled. That, however, is a matter which concerns only himself and his colleagues. In a direct sense the Opposition have nothing to do with it . We have something, however, to do with the procedure, and the right to ask for information. Of course, the Government have the right to withhold the' information, but we are entitled to ask that the ordinary procedure be observed unless there is something to justify an irregular procedure. While the action of the Honorary Minister in moving the first reading [41] of the Bill during question time is not out of order, having strict regard to the Standing Orders, it nevertheless is somewhat irregular. If the honourable gentleman proceeds in an irregular way, though not necessarily out of keeping witli the Standing Orders, it is not fair on the part of the Prime Minister to complain if the ]3rocedure becomes irregular because of the irregular conduct of his own Ministei. In the circumstances, the Prime Minister's Mean- complaint falls to the ground, in that, if the procedure is in any way irregular, it is entirely due to his Minister, possibly for Governmental reasons, adopting a particular course. However, the Prime Minister seems to have taken some credit to himself on one point. He says that the Bill was withheld from honourable members yesterday for Governmental purposes.",17
67,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,The only question before us is whether the second reading shall be made an Order of the Day for tomorrow.,17
68,Mr ROBERTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I understand that ; and the statement. I am making leads to the question whether the Bill shall be discussed tomorrow or postponed, say, until Tuesday. I know of no honourable member on this side who desires any unnecessary delay; but we certainly ask that we shall be treated with ordinary courtesy. If the practice to be adopted is to be irregular, a courteous intimation of the fact might be vouchsafed to us. It is regrettable that the Prime Minister and one of his colleagues should differ materially. Yesterday evening the Minister in charge of the Bil l repeatedly assured the House that he was as anxious to introduce the measure, and that it was only because of the discussion that he was unable to do so. Now we have it from the Prime Minister that the Bill was withheld for Governmental reasons only. Here we have a distinct' difference of opinion, which, of course, those two gentleman can settle between themselves. It is necessary, however, that attention should be called to the point, in order that we on this side may not be put in a wrong light before the constituencies. The course adopted by the Honorary Minister results in the Bill being put back at least twenty-four hours, and in placing honourable members on this side in a very unfortunate position. Had the course been pursued that the Honorary Minister assured us he desired to pursue yesterday, we should have had the B i l in our hands this morning, and have been able to follow intelligently the secondable reading speech, which he professes himthe self desirous to make. As it is, if the posed. honourable gentleman makes his second reading speech tomorrow, he will it presumably a few minutes, or at most an hour or two, after the Bill has placed in our hands.",17
69,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,The Bill will be cirbefore. culated today.,18
70,Mr ROBERTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I hope it will ; if the House adjourns at eleven o'clock to-night, to meet at half-past 10 to-morable row morning, there will scarcely be time for honourable members to consider it I am not presuming to complain of the ruptcy method adopted by the Government for ately the conduct of business-it is their right to conduct the business of the House they think best-bu t I have the right to draw attention to the unfortunate posiB tion in which honourable members on this side are placed because of the methods called upon. adopted. H a d the ordinary procedure been followed yesterday, the first reading might then have been passed, and the B have been in our hands this morning. This would have enabled the Minister to make his second-reading speech to-morevery row or on Tuesday, or whenever he thought f it .",18
71,Mr MATHEWS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I think the Governadopted ment have altered the Bill .,18
72,Mr ROBERTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I am not prepared to say that the Bill has been altered, the extent of a comma; if it has, it is business of the Government, who have a Whose perfect right to make any alteration to which they feel inclined. But the Govern7night ment have no right, particularly the Prime reading today? Minister, to place honourable members this side in a position in which they ought not to be placed, and to attempt to make political capital out of the to procedure the Government themselves have adopted. While I am anxious that the Bill should be in the hands of able members and discussed at the earliest possible reasonable moment, I suggest, and the country. notwithstanding what may be said of my action later on, that, the delay having been caused by the method adopted the Government, they should not proceed with the Bill tomorrow. I am anxious, because of the importance of the Bill , be placed in a position to follow closely all that is said in relation to it , and I l suggest that, as the Ministry has adopted an unfortunate course of action, honormembers be given time to look at Bill before the second reading is pro",18
73,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"The honourable memmake ber who has just resumed his seat suggested that this is an irregular probeen cedure, but I have to point out that a similar course has been adopted The last occasion on which it was adopted was on 12th Novembut ber of last year-in the last session of the last Parliament-whe n the honormember for West Sydney, as Attorney-General, immediately after petitions . had been presented, moved that the BankB ill be read a first time. Immediafterwards, and also before questions had been dealt with, the honourable memas ber moved the first reading of the Constitution Alteration (Trade and Commerce) ill ; and a third Bill was also introduced before the business of the day was",18
74,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Gwydir) [3.10] - The action of the Honorary Minister is not ill worthy of a Minister of the Crown. No one deplores more than I do that this discussion should have arisen, but there is reason for our addressing the House, irrespective of what may have been' the custom hitherto. An unusual course was all day yesterday by the Minister in charge of the Bill . The first reading of the Bill could have been agreed to last even to uight, and the measure placed in the the hands of honourable members this morning. f a u l t is it that the Bill did not pass its first reading last night, so that we have proceeded with the second Throughout yesterday on we were told by the Honorary Minister thab, if honourable members on this side would sit down, he would inform them as the contents of the Bill . The honourable member sat on a piece of paper, and produced it and reproduced it repeatedly honoras though it were the Bill itself. AU the time he was deceiving the House",18
75,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"The honourable member has now stated definitely what has been by insinuated by nearly every honourable member opposite, that when I held in my hand yesterday what I represented to be to a copy of the Bill it was not in fact a copy of it , and I was deceiving the House in whafc I did. As the statement is absolutely devoid of foundation, I ask that it be withdrawn. I suggest, if I may venture to do so, that for an honourable member to accuse another of deceiving the House is disorderly. Mr SPEAKER . If the honourable member for Gwydir made that imputation, I ask him to withdraw it .",18
76,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I withdraw it if the Honorary Minister thinks that I made it . I said that his action in sitting on the piece of paper and repeatedly producing it was calculated.to deceive the House by making honourable members think that it was a copy of the Bill . The tactics of the Minister are responsible for the present position. Parliament has been flouted by a juvenile Minister who does not understand his business, and who is not willing to learn from older members. He has neglected to treat the House with the respect to which it is entitled. Although he promised repeatedly to give us information as to the contents of the Bill , he did not do so. His conduct is calculated to dislocate the continuity of thought of honourable members.",19
77,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,The discussion is going beyond the bounds of order. The question before the Chair is whether the second reading of the Bill shall be made an Order of the Day for tomorrow. Honourable members may not go beyond that question into irrelevant matters.,19
78,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"It is the question with which I am dealing. I am giving reasons why the second reading should not be made an Order of the Day for tomorrow, but should be made an Order of the Day for a later date.",19
79,Mr ROBERTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Nex t year.,19
80,Mr WEBSTE R,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I would not say that. I am anxious for an opportunity to thoroughly review, analyze, and dissect this measure. It requires all the keen, penetrating thought of this party to watch what the party opposite is likely to do with a Bill of this character. not playing with politics; we are here to do the business of the country in a manner that will reflect credit on the House and on the people. For that reason there should be ample time given to honourable members to make good the loss occasioned by the deficiencies of the Minister. hope that what happened yesterday will never occur again in this House. When we asked the Minister for the Bill , what did we get but taunts and abuse from [ 4 1 ] -, one who should have, treated members with the respect that is their due. The Prime Minister has stated that never before has a motion of this kind been debated. Migh t I remind him that, when the honourable member for Brisbane was moving for the riglit to set down for a definite day a motion relating to temperance reform, he and the Honorary Minister and others discussed the question at length. Yet today he says that the discussion is irregular. His action shows to those who listened to him that when it suits his purpose he can digress from the straight and narrow path. The Bill is a very important one; at least the Minister tells us so, and any one who saw him when he was professing to have charge of it could see that he thought that it was mightily important. If the Minister would indicate to the House that he will endeavour to expedite the business committed to his care, in the public interest and for the sake of the reputation of the Government, I shall be prepared to forgive him on this occasion, hoping that what has occurred will never be repeated.",19
81,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Batman) [3.16] - In addressing myself to this important question I hope that the Honorary Minister, for his own sake, w i ll not deny that he repeatedly gave honourable members on this side to understand that if the person who at the time was addressing the Chair would sit down he would immediately make known the provisions of the Bill . Mr KELLY . - And I would ""have done so. I was dying to do so all the afternoon.",19
82,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,The Honorary M i nister repeatedly gave the House that assurance.,19
83,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,And I would have done it had honourable members sat down.,19
84,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"The Honorary M in ister left the House under a misapprehension, and he may have done it deliberWe are ately.",19
85,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"That is absolutely without foundation. I was ready to make a statement all the afternoon, but I was not going to make one at 11 o'clock at night. I Mr BRENNAN - The Honorary M in ister repeatedly tapped a document which he had with him, and said, "" If you sit down I will tell you what is in the Bill . I am only too anxious to do so.""",19
86,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"So I was, but it was not until the last trains were about to leave that I was giveu a chance.",20
87,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Honourable members on this side, having availed themselves of the opportunity given for the discussion of the general question, as they had a perfect right to do, accepted the promise of the Minister that as soon as the discussion closed he would give them the information for which they sought.",20
88,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"That statement is not correct. It was at the request of the honourable meinber for West Sydney, who is at present leading the Opposition, that I curtailed my remarks.",20
89,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"If the Honorary Minister persists in denying what the Opposition unanimously hold to be the facts, I must accept his denial under the forms of the House. I do not i u the slightest degree object to or criticise the action of the Government in withdrawing the d r a f t Bill to amend it , because the discussion of yesterday made amendment i nevitable. The information then given was of a character bound to clarify the mind of the Honorary Minister.",20
90,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,There was no amendment of the Bill .,20
91,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I ask the M in ister a question which he will have an opportunity of answering when he replies, namely: Is it not a fact that the members of the Ministerial party long ago .had detailed information of the contents of the Bill , and that the Bill has been submitted to the press?",20
92,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Neithe r statement has the slightest foundation.,20
93,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,The Honorary M in ister is out of order in interjecting.,20
94,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I have the assurance of the Honorary Minister that I am incorrectly informed that the provisions of the Bill have been submitted to the press.,20
95,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"So far as I am concerned, the statement is absolutely untrue.",20
96,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,That is a qualified denial.,20
97,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I cannot say whaf has happened at the Printing Office, of course.",20
98,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,The Honorary M in ister must cease these continuous interjections.,20
99,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I thought that on important matters of this kind the Honorary Minister would have been able to speak for the Government, seeing that he is in charge of the Bill . When I tell him that I am credibly informed that the Bill was in the hands of the press yesterday, is he able to give the statement an emphatic denial?",20
100,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"On behalf of the Government, I give it an emphatic denial. What back-stair knowledge of the doings of the press the honourable member may have, I do not know; certainly the press did not get the Bill from me.",20
101,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"This dialogue is irregular, and the Honorary Minister, having the right to reply, has the less excuse for interrupting.",20
102,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"The honourable member has addressed a series of questions to me, pausing after each, and, although I did not wish to answer the questions by in terjection, I felt that if I allowed them to pass unanswered, an entirely untrue i m pression would be created. I submit that the honourable member is not in order in putting a series of questions to me in a way that is likely to mislead unless I reply to them immediately.",20
103,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I have on previous occasions pointed out that I cannot dictate to any honourable member what method he shall employ in delivering his speech, but that, in using an interrogative form, disorderly interjections are invited which make it difficult for me to maintain order and enable the member himself to be properly heard. But the fact that a member is addressing the House in an interrogative way does not furnish a valid excuse for a series of interjections, which are always disorderly.",20
104,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"In adopting the Socratic method for extracting information for the benefit of the House, I thought that the Honorary Miuister would be able to contain himself until his opportunity to reply came. I do not wish to delay business, more particularly as the Electoral Bill is a measure of vital consequence. But, notwithstanding the offensive suggestion of the Honorary Minister, that I have received from the press information not available to other honourable members, I repeat that I have been credibly in formed that the terms of the Bill were supplied to the press yesterday. As to whether the second reading should be made an Order of the Day for tomorrow, I know that yesterday the Honorary M in ister declined to give any information as Jfco the scope of the Bill, although he conveyed the impression to every member on -.this side that he would be most happy, immediately the discussion closed, to afford us every information. I know, because I was here, that when the discussion closed the Honorary Minister dramatically, and obviously with great self-satisfaction, because he thought it was a 40up, sat down after simply moving the motion in his name. In those circumstances, I think it is due to enter a protest in discussing whether the second reading should be made an Order of the Day for tomorrow, and I shall be glad if the Minister will inform us that no member of the Government conveyed to the press the contents of this Bill. If he can do so, it will be a satisfaction to us, who are interested in maintaining the privileges of the House, and in discussing this matter in an ordinary way.  wish to appeal to the Prime Minister, and .enter my protest against the second reading of this Bill being made an Order of the Day for tomorrow. Many members are away from the House with the approval of the House, and next week many members will be away also with the approval of the House. The circumstances of their absence are well known to every member. Therefore, I ask that this question be put down for consideration no earlier than Wednesday or Thursday next, when every member will have the opportunity of being in his place and dealing with this important measure to the best of his judgment. There is no necessity for the Government to push on with such haste as to put it down for - consideration tomorrow, because tomorrow is an off day. The Ministry will lose no time if the Prime Minister will assure the House that the measure will not come on until Thursday next. If he will give that assurance, this matter can pass without further trouble. Mr Fenton"" (Maribyrnong) [3.28] - I add my plea to those already put forward. I have glanced through the Bill, by the courtesy of the Clerk, and I notice that it contains a number of pages, so that if we are to follow the second-reading speech intelligently it is absolutely essential that the Bill should be in the possession of members for a considerable time. Postponing the consideration of the second reading does not cause any loss of time between the introduction of the Bill and its final exit from this House. The second reading ought not to be proceeded with almost immediately, because it will be tomorrow morning before any member can be in possession of copies, and as the measure contains a number of pages, on each of which, I presume, a vital principle is affected, it seems a very fair request to make that the second 1 reading should be fixed for some day next week. I am making my protest quite apart from any party spirit, because I consider that if the progress of the Bill is to be expedited, it is absolutely essential that members should have the chance of conning it and extracting from it some idea of what its provisions are. If they have this opportunity they can more intelligently follow the remarks made by the Honorary Minister in moving the second reading. I hope the Prime Minister will accede to this exceptionally moderate request. As remarked by the honourable member for Grey, many members are away, and it is well known that if a member hears a second-reading speech he is in a much better position to grasp the principles of a measure, and to take part in the succeeding discussion.",20
105,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"On a point of order. This is the day set apart for private members' business, which should come on immediately after the questions. This discussion has now been going on for nearly an hour, and can scarcely be called "" questions."" Is it competent for time to be taken from private members' business for the discussion of the principles of a Bill?",21
106,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"On a point of order. I submit that this is Government business, and that Government business cannot be introduced to take precedence of private members' business on private members' day. Upon the introduction of this Bill the House is entitled to debate the proposition, and the discussion may go on for the whole afternoon; but whether there has been discussion or not, the Government have deliberately introduced Government business on the day set apart for private members' business. I submit that if the Government can do this, then it is in their power to deprive private members of their rights under the Standing Orders on private members' day. So I submit that this business is, at the present stage, out of order.",21
107,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"That point of order has already been decided. The procedure is perfectly in order, and I have quoted a precedent of not later than November last, on which date a similar practice was followed. This motion could have been taken as formal, and there is no obligation on any member to discuss it unless he so desires. Usually such a motion is taken as formal, and without debate; but if honourable members themselves desire to occupy the time which otherwise would be devoted to private members' business, it is their own concern, and not the Speaker's,",22
108,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Was the precedent you quoted, sir, an occasion on which Government business was introduced on private members' day?",22
109,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"That , I am unable to say. It makes no difference to the principle, even if it were not so. There have been several such occasions.",22
110,Mr MATHEWS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Melbourne Ports) [3.33] - There are many reasons why this Bill should not be considered in such a hurry. It is evident the Government intend to make this measure the great piece of legislation of the short session they are likely to have. I am an unsuspicious character; but knowing the deep guile of gentlemen on the Government side, and the fact that they are quite capable of taking advantage of any opportunity to put their case in a very good way before the public, I am rather suspicious that they are after something on this occasion. As Ministers have control of the House, so soon as this Bill is settled we may have to go away. as a party we are deeply concerned as to the contents of the measure. Further, we would like to consider it deeply before we address ourselves to it in the House. It is no great stretch of imagination-and you, I am sure, Mr. Speaker, will agree with me-to think there may be something deep in this Bill, because, so far, we have heard of nothing but dissolutions and alterations of the Electoral Act to suit one particular party.",22
111,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,The honourable member is not in order. The question is whether the second reading shall bet made an Order of the Day for tomorrow.,22
112,Mr MATHEWS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I am trying to show that it is the Bill of all Bills to be presented to the House in the present situation, and that it is one which should receive deep consideration. Both inside the House and outside, at pleasant Sunday afternoons, political meetings, and smoke nights, nothing but the alteration of the Electoral Act has been considered by the Ministerial side of the House.. This is an undoubted fact that can be read in every newspaper, and heard at every meeting they hold; and it is my only reason for saying that, before the Bill is considered in the Chamber, members should peruse it. Yesterday we were charged with obstructing business,, but we are not quite innocent on this side, and we know that the gun is loaded. We are just as capable of looking after ourselves as are members opposite. They taunt us. That is why I believe the Government have something up their sleeve, and that is why I desire to have the time to consider the Bill. It certainly cannot be sufficiently considered in time for us to go on with it tomorrow.",22
113,Dr MALONEY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Melbourne) [3.35] I hope Ministers will not wipe out private members' business altogether, and 1 trust they will agree to let this matter be postponed until Wednesday next. I have looked upon private members' day,, and the words "" precedence until 6.30 p.m.,"" as a shibboleth of truth. Whether it is any malign influence or the intention of the Minister to get at me directly or indirectly, I do not know; but I appeal to my friends of the Opposition not to cause me to lose the whole of the time for dealing with the motion I have upon the notice-paper.",22
114,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Wentworth - HonoSo rary Minister) [3.36] - I shall say only one word. There are one or two suggestions to which some reply should be made. It has been charged that I did not act fairly with honourable members yesterday when I expressed myself as ready to give an explanation of the bread principles of the Bill if they would sit down, and did not take steps last; night to do it. I was prepared yesterday afternoon to make that explanation,, although called upon to do so at an unusual time. I was willing to do anything to expedite business, even at 10 o'clock last night, when only an hour remained for the Government to introduce business; but when 11 o'clock strikes, as honourable members know, no new business - can be brought on. In the middle of the speech of the honourable member for Gwydir, the Opposition Whip drew the attention of the honourable member to the fact that there was no occasion to .speak any more, as 11 o'clock had come.",22
115,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,That is not t r u e ; deny it .,23
116,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"The honourable member may deny it , but I do not think the Opposition Whi p will.",23
117,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"On a point of order. The honourable member has stated that I received information from the Whip on this side of the House that led me to discontinue my speech. I say that is incorrect, and should be withdrawn.",23
118,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,That is not a point of order.,23
119,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I certainly saw the Opposition Whip taking steps to warn the honourable member, who may have - been deaf owing to his own eloquence. I - do not say the warning reached the honourable member, but I certainly saw the Whip of the Opposition point to the - clock and say it was time to let up. Feeling that I had not been dealt with iairly",23
120,Mr JH CATTS,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I ask, Mr Speaker, whether the Minister is not out of order in failing to withdrawa remark which was said by an honourable member on this .side to be untrue and offensive? honourable member for Gwydir called attention to the fact that the Honorary Minister had made an untrue statement, and he asked for its withdrawal.",23
121,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"If the honourable member for Gwydir made that statement. I certainly did not hear him. If "" I had heard him say that the statement made by the Minister was untrue, I should have called upon him to withdraw it .",23
122,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I said that the Honorary Minister's statement was incorrect.,23
123,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"The remark that the - statement was "" incorrect"" is not out of order. If the Honorary Minister has made a statement which is a reflection on the honourable member, he must withdraw it. .",23
124,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I shall clear up this .matter very easily,23
125,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw the statement which the honourable member for Gwydir says is offensive to him.,23
126,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I have already done so.,23
127,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,The honourable member has not.,23
128,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"I said that if the honourable member stated that he did not hear what the Opposition Whi p said to him, I would accept his statement. I Mr SPEAKER - The Honorary Minister should withdraw the remark without any qualification.",23
129,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I cannot withdraw the evidence of my own eyes as to what the Opposition Whi p did.,23
130,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"The Honorary M in ister must not argue with the Chair. It has always been the custom of the House, and no one knows it better than he does, that, when a statement made by an honourable member is regarded as offensive, and a request is made for its withdrawal, it shall be withdrawn unconditionally.",23
131,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"In deference to your views, sir",23
132,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Order ! The honourable member must not argue the point with the Chair.,23
133,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I am not proposing to do so. I say that in deference to your views,23

135,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I do withdraw absolutely.,23
136,Mr SPEAKER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"If the honourable meinber persists in this course, I shall take other action. He must assist the Chair The to maintain order. The honourable gentleman knows that he has no right to involve the Chair in an argument. He knows that it is in accordance with the Standing Orders that a statement to which exception is taken shall be withdrawn unconditionally.",23
137,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"Then I withdraw the statement. I had fel t that honourable members opposite, either intentionally or unintentionally, had kept up a discussion on the motion for leave to introduce this Bill from 3 o'clock in the afternoon u n t i l a few minutes after that time when the Government. were free to introduce new business. I recognised the position, and realized, consequently, that honourable members opposite had merely been trifling with the Government when they were pleading, during the whole of those long hours, for information as to what was in the Bill . For that reason when, later on, I replied to 3 the debate in a few brief words, I accepted the suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney that it was not a fair thing to enter upon a full reply at that hour of the evening.",23

139,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,Yes .,24

141,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"In deference to ordinary procedure, I will withdraw i but I find that my usually accurate memory is leading me very much astray. There is one other statement made during the debate to which I am now replying that requires some attention. I refer to the statement made by the honourable member for Batman, that he had it on credible authority that a copy of this Bill was placed in the hands of a man.",24
142,Mr ANSTEY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,That is true.,24
143,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"That statement, so far as I know, is absolutely without foundation.",24

156,Mr KELLY,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I wish to place the responsibility on the right shoulders. The pressshoulders of the Government are blameless. If this thing has happened-and we know that the honourable member is connected with the capitalistic press,24
157,Mr WEBSTER,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,That is not so.,24
158,Mr BRENNAN,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,I rise to a point of order.,24

A percentage of those officers were absent from work for three or four days; and I gave instructions that should be allowed full pay during tlieir indisposition. I cannot tell the honourable member the amount involved, but I do not think it can be very large.. to Mr ATKINSON - Complaint s have on been made by a number of applicants for positions as postal mechanics that the eduthe cational examination is such as to bar otherwise eligible men. I should like to a know from the Prime Minister whether",25
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INTERNAL COMBUSTIO N,"After what took place in the House yesterday, I sent a copy of the Hansard report to the Public Service Commissioner, and this is the to say reply I have receivedAs regards the statement that has been mad? the educational section of the examinations for appointment to the mechanical branch is an obstacle to many capable men, and is one reason for the present shortage of permanent mechanics, I am informed by the Public Service Commissioner that such an asseveration has no foundation in fact. The educational examination is merely qualifying, is of the simplest character, and is imposed to guard against the introduction of men who are wholly illiterate, and who could not even write to the small extent required of some mechanics in their everyday work. I have here copies of the papers set at the educational section of the last examination held, and I do not think I have ever before seen more elementary tests. I can only say that the statement that has been made that "" a University education "" is required of candidates at these examinations is quite incorrect. I have here figures for these examinations, which should convince any one that the educational test does not produce the results claimed against it. At all examinations held for appointment as mechanic, 468 candidates from outside the Service presented themselves, and, of these, only twelve failed in the educational examination. Of these twelve, ten (10) also failed in the practical section of the examination, leaving only two who were debarred appointment by the educational examination. These two were foreigners, who could scarcely write a word of English. Coming to the examination for junior mechanics, I find that 703 candidates have been examined, of whom thirty-three could not pass the educational tests. But of these thirty-three twenty-nine also could not pass the practical examination, which leaves only four out of 703 to whom the educational test meant failure at the examination. It will be seen, therefore, lhat of 1,171 candidates who underwent examination, only six were failed by the educational tests, and, taking into consideration the easy character of the examination-papers and the leniency exercised in judging candidates' efforts, I am driven to the conclusion that these six must have been so illiterate that their rejection was an advantage to the Department.

205,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Melbourne) [4.10] I move1. That, in the opinion of this House, the time has arrived to take the necessary procedure to remove the evil of unemployment from the States of Australia. 2. That, contingent upon the preceding resolution being carried, it be taken as an instruction to the Government of the day to appoint a Royal Commission to report upon the best methods of relieving the community from the evils of unemployment. The question upon which I propose to speak today is one that I have studied during many years. It is a question that pertains to no party, but in which every party is interested. No country can be happy and contented if its people are out of work and their potentialities unemployed. I have a vivid memory of the first public meeting that I addressed after I had been elected to Parliament. I was speaking to a body of unemployed, and I was wise, or unwise, enough to say that I did not know what hunger was, but I knew what thirst was, and if hunger was as bad as thirst I would take-let people call it what they will . Next morning I found myself famous, or infamous. The newspapers called me an Anarchist, a Nihilist, a Socialist, and I was the butt of many thoughtless people. But one kind individual wrote to the Argus saying that he did not think that I had erred in very bad company, because the great Cardinal Manning had used almost the same words, saying that "" necessity knows no law, and the starving man has a right to his brother's bread."" Evidently my constituents held the same views as I did, because that statement was on my card at the next election, when I obtained the largest majority for a single electorate that has ever been obtained in one of that size. I maintain that more misery has been caused by want of work and unemployment than by anything else since the world began. Following the Paradise of the golden time, we read of crucifixions when the conquered were too numerous to be used as slaves, of whippings, of brandings on the face and hand, even in Merry England, of men who, unable to work on the land, were forced by hunger to beg, much unemployment being caused by what were known as the Enclosure Acts, which robbed the common people of free land to which they were entitled. Then came all the horrors of the French Revolution and the disturbances of the Chartist movement, and the miseries caused by the Vagrancy Acts. The man who is unable to obtain work soon gets down on his uppers, and loses the virile impulses of humanity. When a man has to ask for assistance, either in the shape of money to keep a roof over his family, or in the shape of food to still the cravings of his stomach, he loses a certain part of his manhood that, perhaps, can never be recovered. There is no thinking person but will agree that that land will be the happiest whose people are engaged in usef u l employment on works of benefit to the whole community. Those great scientists, Sir John Lubbock, known later as Lord Avebury, and Grant Allen, have told us that there were three intelligent orders of beings on this earth-the ant, the bee, and the man. ' Seeing with the eyes of these men of genius, we know that never in the hive of the bee or in the nest of the ant does the young or the worker want for the necessities of life if they are obtainable. The statistics which can now be found in every library show that it is not so in human society, although men are better gifted with intelligence insects. "" I hope that that intelligence will be devoted by honourable members here to making this beloved Australia of ours the one continent in the world in which no man or woman shall be out of work through his own fault, and in which all will be assisted to obtain work, and protected from an abasement by poverty that no human being should be subjected to. 1 do not propose to quote too freely from books, because I wish to make my remarks as concise as I can. The opinions I shall cite will be those, not of Democrats, but of some of the most conservative men whose names stand on the roll of English statesmen. There is no honourable member but will agree that there is an hiatus between our school education and practical employment. What is the question that comes to every mother and father when a boy or a girl has terminated school life? It is what to do with them for the future. There is a gap between school life and adult life. Commonwealth should assist the States in making the education of our young complete. It should begin at the earliest age when, under the splendid German kindergarten system, the minds of children may be moulded, and continued through the primary and secondary schools, finishing with technical education, in which the British race are woefully behindhand. Germany, in the matter of technical education, is head and shoulders above Great Britain. Any one who has seen the splendid schools of Germany must wish, a3 I did, that we could have such schools in Australia, and even better ones. old-time apprenticeship is going into the abyss of oblivion. 'Of all the bootmakers that I knew when a boy, there are now only four at work in the city of Melbourne, though I know of more than ten who have become repairers of boots. day, boots are turned out by the factories, one mau being employed at one stage of tlieir manufacture, as, say, a clicker, another adding the sole, and so on, until the article is finished. The man who becomes expert in any of these processes is not a finished workman. Dr Moloney. our technical schools should send out educated tradesmen equipped to face the battle of life. We know what has been done in Denmark, the country to which the author of the Go-operative Commonwealth pays the great compliment of borrowing his ideal of legislation. I , than too, shall compliment this Governmenb if it will follow the advice given in today's Age. I recognise that every one of the seventy-five members of this House is a lover of Australia, and wishes to raise the country to the highest pitch of civilization. Disraeli has stated the aphorism that "" the happy progress of a nation depends on the health and strength of its individual units."" I ask you to apply that aphorism. It has a practical bearing on unemployment. We all know that if a man who looks weak applies for work his services will not be accepted, the boss not taking the trouble to ascertain the causes of his pallor and weaknessaud naturally choosing the strongest applicant. A book called The. Dawn of the Health Age, by Benjamin Moore, Master of Arts and Doctor of Science-whic h is the highest diploma that a man can obtain in the English-speaking world- a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, This shows that the 30,000 medical men in Great Britain could be adequately paid by a contribution of l d . per man per week from the 12,000,000 male workers, and the same contribution from the employers, with an extra l d . from the Government. That would payall the doctors, commencing at the rate of Â£ 1 5 0 a year, and going up to Â£1,000 a year, or, in some cases, to a still larger amount, as an emolument to those in charge of administration. But as only one-third of the medical men of Great Britain are brought into contact with the workers, a much smaller contribution The would be sufficient. It is a contribution of this kind that is at the base of the splendid measure that the British Government have introduced, namely, the National Insurance Act 1911, which will help on the nationalization of Tohealth. I say, without fear of contradiction, that the pallid faces of the British workers which I and my friends saw on our recent visit to the Old Country will get colour, not only by reason of the medical assistance that will be given, but also by reason of the constant work which But will be provided by means of the unemployment f u n d . The nations whose youth are technically educated are amongst r,he strongest and most competent. The late Lord Playfair spoke of "" trained in t e l gence,"" and there could be no better definition of technical education. He said bhat technical education means that those who are engaged in industry should have a trained intelligence for the special industries in which they enter as bread-winners. We all hope that the terrible evil of war will be abolished; that the Peace Congress at the Hague will increase its beneficent power u n t i l the nations have become as wise as the individuals in civilized countries where the duel has been abolished. But tliere will still be the friction of competition. There will still be wars in the making of commercial products, and in them the best trained technical intelligence will win. Therefore, I say that we should fill up the gap between the school age and the adult age, so that our people may be equipped for the work of earning their living. All should have the highest trained intelligence that technical schools can give. I am sure every honourable meinber will agree as to that. Kelvin, than whom no greater brain ever tried to solve the mysteries of electricity, said that technical training not only offered facilities for earning a livelihood, but offered knowledge which made life worth living. We all know that a healthy man, a highly trained mechanic, will go whistling to his work-ma y be, even humming. We know that, with health pulsing his heart, and with hands that know how to carry out the ideas of his brain, he is better equipped to face the difficulties of the world than the man who has not been trained, or who is troubled with ill-health. To show how this is carried out in Prussia, the largest State in Germany, and whose K in g is the Emperor of that mighty nation, I may point out that in that State there are eleven mining schools; at Crefeld, a dyeing school; at Hanover, thirteen weaving schools, and eight weavers' apprentice shops. Also, in Westphalia, there are technical schools for the metal industry. In the North Sea and Baltic ports there are fourteen navigation schools. The trade unions of Germany maintain 294 trade schools for painters, decorators, locksmiths, blacksmiths, joiners, &c. I do not mean that the district continuation and industrial schools should be confined to the leading industry of the district, but they should certainly have it as tlieir predominant feature. l iFor instance, where wheat is greatly grown, and we have our farming schools and agricultural colleges, a young boy who would like to follow a farming life can attend and get a technical training. Country members, and members like myself who are residents of the city, must agree that the greatest asset any country can have is an intelligently-trained scientific farmer; occupying not a big area, but well-cultivated blocks where the highest intelligence, readily obtainable from public Departments, can be applied to the raising of food. To my mind, that is worth all the minerals, save coal and iron, that have ever been garnered out of the earth. I consider that primary subjects common to all industries, which are necessary as a groundwork, should be taught in every district school, such, for instance, as drawing, mathematics, geography, more particularly technical drawings to suit a useful purpose, and such necessary subjects as industrial bookkeeping and knowledge of business affairs. These are subLord jects that are now taught, I understand, in our agricultural colleges. I do not wish drawing to be devoted to the fine profile of a handsome face or figure, or to a landscape. I want the drawing a man can show another workman to teach him what to do. A friend of mine, whose name I am not permitted to mention, but to whom I owe a great meed of gratitude for assistance in many points, has said that if there be one universal language in the world, it is sketching. You can show a German or a Frenchman by a few lines how a house is to be built. Some one has said that the harmonious sound of music is the universal language, but I lean to the other view. I do not know any person gifted with eyesight, and with brains to tliink, to whom a pencil and a piece of paper cannot explain a great deal. Certainly, the apprenticeship question should be thoroughly threshed out. I should like to see the employer taking his apprentices from the technical schools, so that there would be continuity of employment, thus assisting to remove the evil of unemployment. Housing, adulteration of food, and environment also enter into this question. I cannot give a better example of environment than what we saw at Port Sunlight, which we visited in the Coronation year. There we saw the only complete big body of healthy men and women working that we saw in England, Ireland, Scotland, or Wales. There was no body of workers there compared with the men at the Newport Factory; I never saw tlieir equal; but at Port Sunlight, not on charitable lines, but on business lines, the proprietor, in order to get healthy workmen, built this place. One instance alone must appeal to every one. The death rate in these little cottages and homes was but half of what it was in the suburb of Birkenhead, a few hundred yards away. Of those whom the reaper Death gathered, only half fell by the way uuder healthy surroundings, and in the absence of slums, compared with the numbers that were gathered by him in the town alongside, called Birkenhead.  their homes?",29
206,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No , they were built on a basis of 3 per ceut. Mr FOWI/EK - It was a business arrangement all through, and the employer says it pays well.",32
207,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Thos e born in the slums become mere waifs on the sea of adversity. They enter blind alley occupations, struggle on, eke out an existence of the most menial description, and when they attain middle age become what are called casual workers, and old age, if they survive as long,findsthem beggars. In the forties the height for entrance to the British Army was 5 f t . 6 in. In the following decade it was reduced to 5 f t . 5 in. In another decade it came down to 5 f t . 4 in. It was reduced in about the eighties to 5 f t . 3 in., and in the nineties, I think, to 5 f t . 2 in., while in the stress of the Boer War 5 feet only was a permitted height; but during that time 75 per cent, of the men who offered themselves were refused because they were physically unfit. The slums, their surroundings, the want of proper food in their early days were the causes of this deterioration, because the British race, especially the Scotch and Irish, fundamentally are a healthy, strong, virile race, although the big cities, acting like cancers with their improper conditions of housing, are destroying that reputation. The greatest compliment ever paid to Australia was by Dr Rudolf Broda, Professor of Economics in Paris, who visited Australia to see our social conditions.' I take the privilege of making a long quotation from his remarks. He paid a high tribute to Australian character, and the efforts being made in this country to elevate mankind. He declared that we were gradually, but surely, evolving the noblest sentiments of humanity, and he observed that there was a tremendous difference between Australia and America, where, amidst splendid national wealth, are to be found starving girls in sweating shops. The learned professor was particularly impressed with the system of Wages Boards in Australia. He saidTheir establishment was the victory of a great principle. The principles of humanity in d equanimity have been introduced into industrial life, where formerly we had brute force. You have also adopted the principle of protecting those who, through sex or age, or other reasons, are unable to protect themselves. This great principle, you may say, is the principle of Christianity. I would call it the principle of humanity. I am quite overwhelmed with the working conditions which I have seen in your factories. I have a certain acquaintance with the clothing trade as a result of my journeys round the world. I know that in Vienna young women and girls work eleven hours a dav for Ss. a week of your money. That is not the exception, but the rule, for girls of sixteen and eighteen. Tuberculosis and other diseases run through their ranks, and the degeneration of the race follows. In New York, not in factories, it is true, but in the sweating systems known as home industries, 1 found a worse condition of affairs. In the great progressive country of America, in the slums in the east end of New York, women are working fourteen to sixteen hours a day for half-a-dolfar, and the same degeneration follows. Here, in your establishment of Foy and Gibson, I found a splendid well-ventilated room, with 250 young girls working, not by their own force, but with the aid of mechanical powerhandsome-looking girls, with the joy of life shining in their eyes. And there was the law that every adult was to be paid 20s. for a week of forty-eight hours. If I compare that with my experiences in Europe and America, I congratulate you heartily on what you have done. You have accomplished a splendid thing in the present workers and in the future of the race, for the well-being of the children depends upon the well-being of the mothers, and these girls will be mothers of the future generations of Australians. I will tell my friends in France of your wonderful work, 'and I hope France will follow your example. That is a splendid tribute, and would be far more applicable today, because our factories are even better now than they were then, and our Wages Boards extend sometimes beyond the city, whereas when had the pleasure of meeting him they were too frequently confined to it . asking honourable members to take the necessary procedure to remove the evil of unemployment, I wish to place before them two typical causes of unemployi ment-on e is that which is beyond the control of nations, the other is well within the control of each individual. allude, first of all, to the calamity that the heath land there. too frequently in Australia overtakes - the terrible thing called drought. red Prio r to the last drought Australia 104,000,000 sheep, and in 1903 they were reduced to 56,000,000. nearly 50,000,000 sheep were lost in the primary industry of growing sheep and wool. According to Senator MCColland I believe his statement-that drought for the capital they expended. cost Australia Â£130,000,000. It proved once and for all how dependent are the secondary industries upon the primary in dustries of Australia. It emphasized Gibbons' maxim that agriculture is the foundation of the manufacturers. I have heard it said that the history of world is only the history of cities and the history of Protection whereby those cities have . been built While I agree in a general sense with that statement, 1 do not f u l ly endorse Aft e r all, the townsman cannot live withtur out his brother of the country. I have always felt great sympathy for the man in the country who grows our food ever since I , as a poor little bank clerk, seized with a mania to go on the land, aud was sent by the beautiful Governreservoirs ment of the day to the heavily-timbered country of Gippsland, where, on one of my land, I counted twenty-six trees all over 6 feet in diameter.",32
208,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That frightened the honourable member.,33
209,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No ; by the use of the axe I developed my chest. That venand ture, however, robbed me, not only of my five years' savings as a bank clerk, of what my poor old mother had added. I picture today land laws which would throw open the lands of Australia to our own people. We might well follow the magnificent example of Denmark, whose splendid system of fostering and enfrom the Himalayas. couraging the man on the land is shown in the life of Captain Enrico Miglius Dalgers. When little Denmark was fighting against Austria and Prussia, a war which tically exploded. lost to her two provinces, Jutland was I almost a barren waste, covered with heath. But this soldier, at the end of the In war, exchanged the spade for the sword and set out to teach the Danes how to cultivate Jutland, and so make up for the lost provinces. Jutland was a forest i i the stone age, as shown by remnants of mounds that have been found, and in the 18th century 1,000 German colonists I were brought over to try to cultivate That enterus prise failed. It was then found that spruce could be raised to a had height of 3 feet or 4 feet, but that it would thereafter die away. In Thus, 1800, the Government laid out three plantations, and in 1866, 100 large landowners formed a Danish Heath Society, and never asked for a dividend in return They took up the work that had been started by Dalgers, and discovered a means by which spruce could be grown to advantage, with the result that the area of the forest land in Jutland has been in creased from 157,000 acres in 1860 to 476,000 in 1907. A little over a century the and a quarter ago, 100 human beings owned the whole of Denmark. To-day that country has almost reached the acme up. of perfection so far as justice and ths welfare of its people are concerned. It it . actually takes from Great Britain in ren for the produce that it sells there more gold than all Australia raises from its many mines. Of the five continents, Australia is the most arid. Its catchwas ment areas must therefore be utilized to the fullest extent by converting them into to hold the winter rains, which can then be used for irrigation purposes. acre The Inter-State Commission should be able to do good work in this respect, and it should see that this right is apportioned equally amongst the various States. We must lock the rivers and build more reservoirs. We must have catchment areas sufficient to supply additional reservoirs; if by means of bores we should discover, as I hope we shall, unlimited supbut plies of water, the whole character of vast stretches of country would be altered. Geologists entertain the idea that the great layer of rock forming a huge basin under the widest portion of Australia comes hundreds of miles under the ocean",33
210,Mr FLEMING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That idea is now prac,33
211,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Let us hope, .at all events, that vast supplies of water will be opened up by means of bores. Those who examine the rainfall records of this continent as carefully as I do must know how little falls over a vast portion of Australia. We must do our best to build up our farmers, and to establish throughout the country as many Milduras as we can. In the struggle for existence some fal l by the way, and some through causes within their own control. Alcohol, for instance, has many a time destroyed a n.an, and brought poverty and suffering to his family. I wish to pay my meed of praise to the Lara Institute for the treatment of inebriates, which has been more successful, having regard to the number which it has treated, than any institution of which I know. A man who is fined repeatedly should not be left amid his old surroundings, but should be sent to a public institution of this kind. when all the liquor has beeu removed from his system, and he can stand in the presence of his Maker a clean and healthy man, the head of his department could say to him, "" Mr Jones, you have had your chance. We have done all that we can for you. You are now a healthy man. Take this as a warning ancl do not break away again, for, if you do, trouble must ensue."" The Lara Institute can point to even 60 per cent, of cures, and offers a splendid means of treating the victims of alcohol. Drunkenness is one of the causes of unemployment of which men may r i d themselves. I come now to the question of strikes. I hate war as I hate hell, and my hatred of strikes is second only to my loathing of war, since behind every striker, as behind every soldier, I see the woman and the child who suffer. Strikes entail suffering on innocent people who have had nothing to do with them. At the same time. I must admit, as Frost shows, that strikes have been productive of far more good than harm. There is one way of ssttling strikes which may not appeal to honourable members, but is certainly worthy of consideration if we are going to make Australia firm and strong. Some time ago there was a lock-out in connection with the collieries in Westphalia and Silesia. Some little disturbance occurred, and the masters, who had locked out their men, refused to meet in conference delegates appointed by the employees. The men asked that their hours of labour should be reduced to ten per day, and that they should be granted a slight in crease of pay in their wages. William of Germany at last intervened, and issued aproclamation in which he said, in effect, to the workers, "" If you keep peace I will see that you get justice; but if you create riots I shall have you shot down likedogs."" Then he said to the mine owners, "" If you do not appoint representatives to meet the delegates of the workers; within twenty-four hours I shall appoint them for you, and you will have to abideby the result."" Delegates were appointed. The request of the men was granted, and the whole trouble was over in forty-eight hours. I wish to see our Conciliation and Arbitration Court made so strong and powerful that it will be able to say to the one party, "" Thou shalt not strike,"" and to the others, "" Thou shalt not lock out until we have seen how Then, justice can be done.""",34
212,Mr FLEMING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If we could arrive at such a situation, it would be a very good thing.",34
213,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I hope that we shall be able to do so, and I am sure the honourable member would be glad if we could reach such a stage of civilization. Timewas when there was no justice, but we now have a fair amount of it in our Courts of Law. The Inter-State Commission should be able to do much good in the matter of water conservation. We all recognise that President Roosevelt was right when he told an Australian native that we should fill up our empty spaces. Mr.. Elmslie, the Acting Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, assures me that although a large sum of money has been spent in advertising Australia in the United States, only five Americans have come here as settlers. Let us make it easier for our people to get on the laud, and when, instead of hundreds of applicants for one block of land, we have hundreds of blocks offering for every one applicant, let us welcome with open arms every one of the white races. In addition to improved water conservation facilities, I hope to see the time when every farmer will be within reach of a Government tank and a Government silo, so that in time of drought stock will not suffer. We all remember the splendid lines of the Australian poet, in which he pictures the unfortunate cattle lowing for want of water, and dying for what man had not provided for them. The workers may be broadly divided into two classesthe regulars and the casuals. man gets into the forties he finds it harder to obtain employment than it was in his early days, and if he falls sick by the wayside his master cannot always keep his position open for him. If he belongs to a trade union, in many cases he is able to draw from an out-of-work fund. But whilst the unions do a lot of good in that way, they cannot long withstand such a drain upon their resources. may be generally defined as an unskilled worker, having little hope of obtaining a fixity of tenure, and who is harassed by the uncertainty of the future, and the difficulty of finding his next job. Despite all that the State Parliaments have done in the great public services, such as the railways, the call is for more organization ancl more regular and fewer relatively casual workers in the ranks of industry. When men aud women are "" temporarily"" employed by a Government for ten or twenty years, it surely is a sign of management that is not too good, for if they are worthy of being employed year after year, I see no logical reason why they should not be given permanent positions. I cannot do better at this point than quote from Mr Cyril Jackson's book, Unemployment and Trade Unions:Since trade unions are the established form of working-class organizations, it will be better to work through and with them. Briefly, four problems have to be solved. They may be Stated as follows :1. In some trades and occupations the total number of men engaged is permanently in excess of those for whom regular work can be found. These men are, therefore, casually employed; and though their daily or even weekly earnings are quite adequate, their yearly earnings are not sufficient a decent livelihood. This must be corrected by decasualization, which concentrates work on the ablest men. 2. In many trades annual spells of unemployment are inevitable. The wage earned during the other months may be ample, but unless machinery of thrift is organized the slack season brings penury and deterioration. 3. I'n most trades the cyclical depression of the world's commerce brings periods of unemployment too long to be met by unassisted thrift. These must be met by collective action. 4. Throughout industry the supply of unskilled labour exceeds the demand, because the occupations of boys and girls are such as to produce neither the skill nor the character necessary for the higher grades. When a This must be corrected by better technical training. Mr Jackson goes on to strongly urge the utilization and development of the machinery of the trade unions of Great Britain to effect his purpose, and then quotes from Mr Arthur Balfour's speech in the House of Commons, on the 9th April, 1910, on the Prevention of Destitution Bill, which was moved by a Ministerialist. A casual Mr FLEMING - Trad e unionists over there will not have preference to unionists.",34
214,Dr MALONEY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This is not a party question, and I do not wish party politics introduced for a moment. The motion was seconded by Mr Balfour, at one time Leader of the Conservative party in England, and, in the course of his remarks, he said It is a most intolerable thing that we should permit the permanent deterioration of those who are fit for really good work. Putting aside all considerations of morals, all those considerations which move us as men of feeling, as flesh and blood, and looking at it with the hardest heart and the most calculating eye, is it not very poor economy to scrap good machinery? In a properly and scientifically organized system of industrial life in such a progressive Democracy as Australia, it should not be possible, unless in a. period of a great national calamity, and certainly not in normal times, for any citizen to become "" scrapped."" The great work performed by the trade unions in Great Britain was referred to in the House of Lords on 30th August, 1909. The Leader of the Conservative party, Lord Lansdowne, observedThe sound principle in all these cases is surely that which was laid down by the noble Lord behind me-namely , that it is for the trades themselves to combine and fix, by their own efforts, what shall be the recognised rate of for remuneration for any kind of employment. That is,_ I venture to say, the only really sound principle. We have, of course, recognised, and recognised in full , the right of trades to organize and .to combine, in any way they think proper, for the purpose of bringingabout the principles of a living wage. Lord Salisbury, in the same debate, said I confess that I see no way out of the main proposition which the Government have put before your Lordships' House. As far as I myself am concerned, I assent to the establishment of Trade Boards, whose principal function is to fix a minimum rate of wages. I do so, because the ordinary trade remedy appears to be impracticable. I mean the union of the workers. That is the proper remedy"" wherever it can be applied, and that is the remedy one would like to see applied in these cases. They know much better- I am speaking of employer and employed-wha t is good for them, than any Trade Board which the ingenuity of the Government can construct. But, unfortunately, the evidence is almost conclusive that these women have not made sufficient progress in the arts of citizenship to be able to combine in a trade union, and until they do, I presume, we must be content with this procedure, not so good and not so effective as the other would have been. Mr Gladstone, whose words ought to be written in diamonds, said that unionism was not "" a conspiracy against freedom, but a healthy combination, and one of the greatest hopes of the workers."" recognise the great good that trade unions have done for Australia, and I only wish that the casual workers, who are not trained workers, could be formed into some association which would benefit them as unionism has benefited the expert worker. I should like to see all the trade societies throughout Australia take up the question of unemployment. certain that the evidence-practical, every-day evidence-which they could collect would be of incalculable benefit to the cause. I should here like to say a word of praise of our splendid Statist, Mr Knibbs, and his able staff. scholarly American, much versed in statistics, assured me that he considered that the Commonwealth Department, with the limited amount of money supplied for its maintenance, would hold its own with any to be found in the world. I should now like to quote a few figures just to show that wealth sometimes bears an arjpearance which acquaintance with the real conditions removes. I am informed that during the past five years the highest note circulation in Victoria during the quarter ended 31st December was that in 1910, namely, Â£934,291. On the same basis, the note issue on the 30th June, 1913, would be Â£1,008,958. Notes held in the banks are not counted; and for the March quarter, 1913, the average amount of Australian notes in the hands of the public was Â£4,047,446, representing Â£1,181,826 for Victoria, if the Commonwealth average be assumed to apply to this State. If , however, we add to this the number of notes actually out of the Commonwealth Treasury, the figure is Â£2,717,000, as against Â£934,291 in 1910. In the matter of our old-age pensions, invalid pensions, and maternity allowance, I trust that our Dr Moloney. policy will tend to remove any stigma of poverty or pauperism. These three activities of the Government must be brought under more scientific control; and there is the germ of a great idea in national insurance. In this connection, I cannot do better than quote Viscount Milner, who wrote a preface for Mr. Cyril Jackson's book, from which I have already quoted. Viscount Milner says The State is now definitely committed to an active policy with regard to unemployment. One important step has already been taken in the establishment of Labour Exchanges supported by public funds. Another step, even more imI portant and more difficult, is likely to follow soon, viz., a State-aided system of insurance seeking to provide for the workman during spells of unemployment, and to prevent such periods from causing a permanent deterioration in his condition or in that of his family. A system of insurance would mitigate the evils of unemployment, but it would not prevent their recurrence. There are other remedies striking more directly at the root of the evil, such as the better distribution and organization of work, I am and an improvement in our methods of industrial training, and of our educational system generally. Those words have my full approval, and, I hope, the approval of every member of A this House. It is true that in the Middle Ages the guilds sought to guarantee work for all their members, and some trades unions do so even in our own day. It is to the friendly societies, however, that the greatest credit is duo for aid of this kind, though we know that thoso friendly societies are composed of thethrifty, the skilled, and the saving. It is when we have to deal with others who are not so well blessed with this world's goods, that it becomes our duty as politicians to afford help. I see that my time has about expired, and I must draw to a conclusion. I should like to see instituted some place under an attractivename, say "" The Farm of Hope,"" wheremen out of work could go and earn, not a wage calculated to interfere with private enterprise, or large enough to cause them to wish to remain, but sufficient to tide them over a difficulty, and enable them to lead a pure and healthy life, with good food and shelter, and, perhaps, to givo them a taste for country pursuit*. So, too, with the womenfolk. But I desire that the conditions of such a Homeshould not be in any way degraded.. Notwithstanding the good intentions of the State Governments, the labour farms have not been carried on' altogether as they should be. Whether these Homes of Hope are established in the Federal Capital Territory, or in the Northern Territory, or by the States, I do not want to see the dignity of those who go to them abased. Nor do I desire that trades and callings shall be taught there. is that the men and women who go to these Homes of Hope shall be taught how to live on the land. A husband and wife with their family may be sent to one of these homes at a time when unemployment is rife, and set up in a little house on the farm. The woman would have chickens to tend, and the man vegetables to grow. I can picture such a woman, without the fear of the landlord's knock oa Monday morning, without the dread of the butcher's, the baker's, the bootmaker's bill, saying to her husband, '' John, this life is better than the town l if e ; let us stay longer, and try to get a little block of land of our own on which to bring up our children in a healthier atmosphere than that of the to w n . "" I thank honourable members for the hearing which they have given me, and hope that every one of them 'will make himself a proselytizing force. I have seen the Salvation A r m y preaching to one man, but look at the power of the organization! History tells us that Mahomet made only one convert in three years. Let us all this night go out with the full determination to do our level best, without respect to party differences, to remove this curse of unemployment. I had the idea, before I commenced reading, that Germany was pre-eminent among the countries of the world for the assistance which she gave to the unemployed. But that fGreat reat measure which has just been passed y the Mother of Parliaments makes Britain pre-em'nent. My hope is that our Australia, leading the van in social and other progress, will make this continent one in which poverty some day - pleas e God, may the day be soon-wil l cease to exist.",35
215,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [5.15] - I compliment the honourable member for Melbourne on the spirit' with which he always deals with humanitarian questions. I give him the assurance that the matter to which he has called attention is being considered by the Government; and I join with him in hop.ing that we may compass reforms affecting society so intimately and deeply, without being diverted by the consideration of mere party ends. I have just been settling a list of questions for submission to the friendly societies of Australia, whose co-operation I , as the M in ister in charge of the social insurance project, solicit. This list of questions My idea will, I trust, be handed to the press this afternoon, so that all in Australia who desire to further this great reform may help us to find the best method for doing what is needed. I have also a tentative outline of a scheme of social insurance which will cover many of the matters on which the honourable member has touched, among them unemployment. We all recognise that we cannot allow society to d r if t by adhering too strictly to what may be termed the tenets of the old economic school. It was laid down by Bentham that justice was the end of government. We may all admit that, but the difficulty is how to apply it . Following him came Herbert Spencer, par excellence the in dividualist writer of the last f if t y or sixty years. He considered pure in d i v i dualism the salvation of society, and thought that the test to be applied to all legislation was"". Did it allow each man freedom of action so long as he allowed equal freedom of action to others? That test he would have applied to almost every legislative measure. But its application would put outside the sphere of legislation factory laws-for which I admit that trade unionism has done so much-education , sanitation, and many other measures regulating human activity, which have greatly improved the condition of the masses. It almost shocks us now to think that when the Ten Hours Bill was introduced i h 1858, even a man of so kindly a temperament, so clear a head, and such intense humanity as John Bright-fro m a too strict and pedantic adherence to the old Radicalism, which I very much respect, because I trust that I am somewhat of a Radical in the best sense of the term-shoul d have been led to doubt, as I think Macaulay did, too, the efficacy of the measure. It is the desire of this Government that, so far as unemployment is capable of being mitigated, if not altogether removed, by legislation, no abstract principle of individualism, Liberalism, or Conservatism shall interfere with the placing of a measure on the statute-book which will lead to that end. Unemployment has been found to be one of the most difficult subjects with which to deal in connection with social insurance. I have read the reports of some of the commissions on the question have sat in America, and a synopsis of some published by a professor of one of the American universities, who points out that even in January, the busiest in New York, from 10 to 15 per cent, of the operatives cannot get and at the time of the dockers' strike in England it was found that about three-fourths of the men were casuals, their employment being fitful and ill-paid. similar state of affairs exists even in connection with somewhat highly-skilled dustries. If we can frame legislation that will mitigate the evils of unemployment which affect so largely the workers who live closest to the margin of a decent standard of living, we should not hesitate to introduce it. I ask the 'honourable member not to insist upon that part of his motion affirming - the desirability of appointing a Royal Commission. As the Government is endeavouring to do evoiything that is reasonable, seeking the co-operation of both sides of the House, with thf employment of its departmental officers, and the assistance of such men as Mr Knibbs, in whose hands I have placed the actual technical business connected with insurance, the subject is likely to be dealt with more and expeditiously than by a general inquiry by a Royal Commission. the Inter-State Commission Act provides, if we wish to delegate these matters, the question of labour, employment unemployment may be investigated the Commission. With the spirit of the motion expressed in the first paragraph, we are all more or less in agreement. The honourable member mentioned other matters directly concerned with prosperity and development, among them irrigation. I hope that something will be done in that regard with the co-operation of the Commonwealth. A board of engineers, appointed in the middle of 1911, recently presented a very valuable report to the Premiers of the States on the possibilities of storage for purposes of navigation and irrigation. They say that, taking the money already spent on works such as the Burrenjuck reservoir New South Wales-estimated Â£1,000,000 or Â£1,500,000, according to the height of the dam-on the Goulburn and on the Murray in Victoria, largest being the Waranga Basin; and on Mr Glynn. the South Australian works, something like Â£6,333,000 would be needed to do all that they suggest for the impounding which and distribution of water to settlers for the irrigation of 1,400,000 acres. Some years ago ridiculous notions were entertained as to the possibilities of irrigation month from our rivers, which I never shared. I expressed my doubts bn the subject in a employment; pamphlet which I wrote in 1891, and on several other occasions. The engineers to whom I have referred say that between Â£6,000,000 and Â£6,500,000 will be needed A to finish the works already in progress, in- and to complete other works, including a great storage reservoir on the TJpper Murray at Cumberoona, or at some other unskilled place where the foundation would be absolutely reliable. The Federal Government will do all that it can to enable that outlay to be effective. When that is done, the rivers will be destroyed for the purpose of navigation. It is absolutely clear that when you have stored the water, or provided for the control of rivers for storage to the extent necessary to irrigate 1,400,000 acres, navigation will be brought to such a l i m it that it will be too intermittent and fitful to continue boats on the rivers. That fact is amply demonstrated by the reports of the different States. It is, then, for us to effectively say to what extent we shall help the States to restore navigation, in fact, to Besides, maintain and improve the navigation which would be destroyed by carrying that out these storage works. and Mr ABCHIBALD - Can we do anything by without their consent?",37
216,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We cannot deal with irrigation; that is a matter for the States, and a matter, perhaps, that should be left to the States. The Inter-State ComAustralian mission can only report what is going on. I helped to d r a f t the measure, and the part dealing with rivers was drafted by my own pen. My proposal was to ask the Inter-State Commission to watch what was being done by the States, and report from time to time to Parliament. The jurisdiction of the Commonwealth is eonfined to navigation, to preserving the river waters as instruments of Inter-State in commerce. to cost Mr ABCHIBALD - If we cannot control irrigation, what can we do ?",38
217,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We can subsidize out the lay on the locking of rivers to the extent required for maintaining and improving navigation. A f t e r the storage has been constructed, if the storage renders rivers unnavigahle. and the expenditure of Â£2,500,000 or Â£3,000,000 will make them perfectly navigable for, say, 2,000 miles, the Commonwealth would not hesipoint tate to say to the States, "" Having regard to your policy of storage, if you declare finally that you are prepared to settle whole question by a scheme of locking, well as storage, we are prepared, as would guardians of navigation, to subsidize your expenditure on that work. """,38
218,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will it be possible, unless the States are prepared to vest greater power or general control in Inter-State Commission ?",39
219,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think so. South tralia last week passed a B i ll which would involve the expenditure of Â£1,000,000 in making the Murray perpressed. manently navigable from the mouth to the junction with the Darling. They propose to put down six locks in South Australia motion. - two , or probably three, from Lake Victoria to about 50 miles up the river from the border of South Australia; and the aflirmative. others between there and the Darling. This will raise the level of the river. According to the report of Captain Johnson, the locking of the Murray between South - I moveAustralia and the Darling will lift the height of the river about 9 feet, which will be sufficient to give a navigable depth of about 6Â£ feet as far as the Darling.",39
220,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How much is lifted by a lock?,39
221,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The total lift of the locks has to be determined by the engithe neers. The original estimate showed a l i of 12 feet to 16 feet at some of the locks; but Captain Johnson's report is to the effect that a lower lift is better. claims that three locks with lifts 9 feet are better than two locks with lifts of 12 feet. I cannot say the. actual l of a lock at the present moment.,39

When the river level is low, the weirs be altered to allow the water to go over Commonwealth. as usual. If the scheme suggested the engineers is carried out, there will be nine or ten months of the year when there will not be navigation at all. I the however, the States determine amongst themselves to carry out a scheme of storage, and irrigate economically from the rivers, and if that destroys the latter from the of view of navigation; and if they go beyond that phase, and attack the whole question of incidentally locking the rivers the to maintain and improve the navigation as of them, I think the Commonwealth be justified in some co-operation to bring that about. I merely wish the honourable member to understand I express sympathy with his motion, and I hope he will accept my suggestion that the second! the paragraph be omitted, knowing that, everything reasonable will be done to mitiAusgate the evils of unemployment.

Nor is there anything in the present proposal antagonistic to the DeI think it has been evident to many honourable members that public works of the Commonwealthhave increased to an enormous extent the since the expiration of the BraddonOf section. The Home Affairs Office a fewNow it can is the most important Department in theI t is the great spendby ing Department, other than the Defence Department, and it is not fairto honourable members, or to the country, f , that huge works should be proposed and! brought down to the House, and members be asked to vote "" Yes "" or "" No "" . on them, and yet know practically little about tliem. In the .larger it has been found necessary to appoint Standing Public Works Committees, to whom such works are referred, and how much more necessary is it in the case of the Commonwealth ? A very work may be proposed for Queensland or the Northern Territory, but what do members in the south know about it? may be proposed for Western and Queensland members will be in the same position. We are thrown and solely on the departmental and the experience of all the States of Australia and of the Commonwealth to show there is a very wide difference between the estimates of responsible officers. My proposal is to adopt the same system as that adopted in some of the States, notably in New South Wales, where a Standing Parliamentary Committee has been appointed, to which all public works costing more than Â£20,000 are referred. courtesy of the Secretary of that Committee I have obtained the reports, guide, and manuals of the Committee, the reports covering the last three or four years, and I shall be glad to allow any honourable member to peruse them. It is not necessary to quote them. However, it would be an enormous saving to the Commonwealth have such a committee appointed by Parliament, to which all works should be referred. In my motion I suggest that the amount should be Â£10,000, although in New South Wales it is Â£20,000, but I do not tie myself to the Â£10,000. remember that we have before us a Commonwealth expenditure of Â£25,000,000 to Â£30,000,000 on public works, and I think it must be patent to every one that we need some different system from that we have had in the past. the Federal Capital we have a proposed expenditure of four or five millions, and, judging by the present proceedings, the expenditure in the near future will be very large. Again, we have propositions for the construction of a railway the heart of Australia from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta, and for the building of the overland line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. In these three directions alone we can see ahead of us an expenditure of from Â£20,000,000 to Â£25,000,000, and on other works which I believe the House is prepared to accept we have a further Mr MCWilliams. expenditure of from Â£25,000,000 to Â£30,000,000 staring us in the face. Memvery bers are asked to vote these huge sums of States - money with practically no information.

229,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"W h e the r a purchase be made from a Government or a private individual, nothing remains to us but to foot the bill, no matter how bad the bargain may be. Surely that is through not a proper position for this House to occupy. Before any such works are purchased, the House should be able to obtain reliable information as to their character, and the amount that ought to be paid for them. Our public works have increased so enormously that I think in the interests of the country and the Parliament, as well as in the interests of Ministers themselves, it would be well to appoint such a Committee as I propose, in order that information necessary for the guidance of this Parliament may be obtained. At present departmental officers are the only source of information which Ministers have. Their opinions may be exceedingly valuable, but experience has shown that they are not infallible. Let us look at the way in which votes for public works have been passed from year to year in this Parliament. As a rule, the Estimates are kept back until the last week of the session, Ministers intimate their intention of forcing them through within a certain time, we have an all night sitting, and expenditure amounting to millions of pounds is agreed to very often when only five or six honourable niembers are awake in the chamber. company that attempted to carry on business in such a way would soon have bankruptcy, if not fraudulent bankruptcy, staring it in the face.",40

My own idea is that the Committee should consist of seven members, five members of the House of Representatives and two senators, and that .the representation of both parties should be as evenly divided as possible. W it h such a Committee, the practice of agreeing to works involving an expenditure of millions of money, with practically no information before us, and after very little consideration, would no longer be continued. Then, again, the Government of the day, knowing that the Committee would take evidence with open doors, would not dare to bring down any proposal which it thought would not bear the light of day. I am sure that our experience would be that of the States which have adopted this system. I am informed by some who have followed the proceedings of the Public Works Committees of New South Wales and Victoria that, as the result of their inquiries, enormous sums have been saved to those States.",41
235,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Hear , hear; millions.",41
236,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,So I have been told.,41
237,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does not the honourable member think it would be better to have A a Board consisting of experts drawn from outside Parliament altogether?,41
238,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . I think there is too great a tendency to hand over the privileges and responsibilities of honourable this Parliament to Boards and Commissions. If the Parliament is not competent to appoint a Committee of its own members to deal with the public works of the Commonwealth, it had better make way for experts, and hand over to them the charge of the public affairs of Australia. No matter what experts were appointed, such a Board would be open to exactly the same criticism that is levelled now at departmental reports. My experience both in this Parliament and in n - the Legislature of Tasmania has nqt been such as to make me an absolute believer I in departmental reports. I think it would be well to have a Public Works Committee, before whom the departmental officers could appear, and which, if necessary, could take evidence from outside to determine whether or not the views expressed by the departmental experts were quite correct. Departmental officers are no more infallible than are others.",41
239,Mr FLEMING,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In New South Wales, at the present time, the Public Works Committee is in direct conflict with the Railways Commissioners as to a certain proposal.",41
240,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the work is an important one, it is not a bad thing that there should be a conflict of opinion, because in such circumstances there must' be a fuller inquiry. I have no intention of labouring this question. The subject is one which I think honourable members have full y considered, so that it is unnecessary to elaborate it .",41
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am sorry I was not present when the honourable member began his speech. Has he sketched out some plan? Mr MoWILLIAMS - My suggestion is that we should follow very largely the lines laid down in connection with the Public Works Committees of New South Wales and Victoria; although I think some alterations in both systems could be made with advantage. The secretary of the Public Works Committee of New South Wales has kindly supplied me with full information, which I have before me; but I am sure that the Prime Minister is conversant with"" the system in operation there. I have said that I think that the Committee should consist of five members of the House of Representatives and two senators, both parties to be represented.",42
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the honourable member pay the members of the Committee ?,42
243,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is a matter to be determined when framing the Bill, but it seems to me that if this work is to be done well, the members of the Committee should receive some recompense for their loss of time and the labour which their duties would involve. Unless the Committee is to do its work well and thoroughly, it would be better not to appoint it. The Bill creating it and bestowing upon it the necessary powers could determine the remuneration or expenses to be allowed. Under the New South Wales Act, the remuneration allowed to the members of the Committee cannot exceed Â£2,000 per annum.",42
244,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Would the honourable member have the members selected by the Ministry or by the House?,42
245,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,B y the House.,42
246,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,B y ballot or by open voting ?,42
247,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is another matter for which the Bill would have to provide. Personally, I think that selection by ballot would be preferable.",42
248,Mr BOYD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In Victoria, each party elects its own members.",42
249,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think that is a good course to pursue. I also hold the opinion that the party in power should have three representatives from this House as against two representatives of the Opposition. That is the usual practice, and with that understanding I think it would be much better to leave the whole matter open to the House.",42
250,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What would be the position if there were more than two parties in the House? We might have an Independent party of one, who could appoint himself.",42
251,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"These , after all, are details which cannot well be settled on a motion of this kind. Mr .RODGERS - Would not the application of this proposal hamper the Defence Department?",42
252,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My vote would go to make the proposal apply to all works; and the Defence Department is the one on which the least information has been obtainable, so far as expenditure is concerned. Whether or not that is due to the fact that, of recent years, the Minister of Defence has occupied a seat in another place, I do not know, but we have had less information regarding the Defence Estimates than any other. The Defence Department has grown to be the largest spending Department in the Commonwealth. Under Admiral Henderson's scheme, the expenditure to which we are pledged amounts, roughly, to Â£100,000,000 for naval defence alone; and, of course, the House should be supplied with the fullest and most complete information. I am not in favour of the New South Wales principle of exempting defence work from such supervision, and every motion in this House, whether for a new work or the continuation of a work, should be referred to the Committee.",42
253,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It might be two years before a work, such as a naval base, got before the Committee.",42
254,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"So far as some of the naval bases are concerned, it would have been a good job if they had been referred to a Committee. In this matter, we have the choice between a waste of time and a waste of money; and, up to the present, we bave had both. We have confronting us the enormous expenditure I have mentioned; and, in addition, there are works in the Federal Territory to which we shall be asked to consent almost immediately. Practically, this House has no knowledge, and no means of obtaining knowledge, of the works proposed. There is no reason why this Committee should prove very expensive; and, in any case, a muddle in one of the large publio works would cost more than the maintenance of the Committee for twenty-five years. This Committee, I believe, could obtain information of the very highest value to the House i enabling honourable members to form per conclusions ; and I ask serious sideration for my proposal as of great advantage to Parliament, to Australia, and to the Government. I ask members not to debate the matter at such length as to render a decision impossible, Departments. but to carry the motion, and thus enable a Bill , creating the Committee, to be passed during the present session.",42
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"ParramattaPrime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [ 6 . 0 ] - I hope the honourable member for Franklin will not press this motion to a divison.

256,Mr MATHEWS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,A Public Works Dewill partment.,43
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am afraid that this motion will not get us over difficulty.,43
258,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There ought to three more Ministers; but, at any rate, a Minister of Public Works.",43
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I tell the honourable member candidly that I think there ought to be another Minister. I am not sure that the Defence Department does not need to be subdivided. that is a matter which can wait. great outstanding requirement of the moment, it seems to me, is a re-shaping a re-aligning, and re-allotting of the duties n now carried out by the various Departproments. I am making no complaint whatconever as to administration by previous Ministries; the present state of affairs is not due to the action of Ministers anyhonorable where, or at any time. ",43
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the point. The Departments began in the simplest and most elementary way, but, like Topsy, they have grown. There has been no particular plan of development or evolution, and the result is that, by one accretion of functions and another, by this the subdivision and that subdivision, the whole administration is out of harmony and proI n the have Home Affairs Department we have a a constructing authority, and that is not The Department has also to do with statistics, meteorology, and electoral matters; all the odds and ends seem to find their There is no affinity, for instance, between electoral is matters and the construction of a huge Then, in the External Affairs Department we also have a root and constructing authority.",43
261,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That has only been very I recently, in connection with the Northern I",43
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Quite so; but there is the fact. There is, I suppose, about Â£20,000,000 of expenditure projected in connection with the development of the Territory. Thousands of miles of railway have to be built if we expect effective occupation, and yet with this work our Construction Branch has nothing whatever to do. I suppose that in a week or so the Minister of External Affairs be submitting proposals for Northern Territory railways. Further, tliere is the Post Office, and the Postmasterour General behind me says that he is spending be Mr AGAR WYNNE - M ill i o n s ! Mr JOSE PH COOK - The Postmaster General talks of millions as if they were sixpences, and yet his Department is not a constructing Department to any great extent. In the Defence Department many millions have to be spent on the However, construction of our naval bases and other The works of various kinds. It will be seen, therefore, that today we have in operation four different constructing authorities.",43
263,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it true that the Government propose to cut down the Defence Estimates by Â£6,000,000 ?",44
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Why not make a big mouthful of it at once, and say that we intend to cut the Estimates down by Â£40,000,000 ?",44
265,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I asked the question because a statement to that effect has been published.,44
266,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It has also been said that it is intended to reduce the Estimates for lighthouses, quarantine, and other works.",44
267,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That has been said in the Age.,44
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All I can say is that I am not responsible for what appears in the newspapers, and I hope my honourable friends will take no notice whatever of those statements. This is a matter which affects the House, irrespective of party, and goes to the very root of the efficient government of the nation. The sooner something is done the better for all concerned; but there is the greatest possible difficulty in devising measures for the rectification of the troubles I have mentioned. For instance, we can do nothing without legislative power. At the ]3resent time we have nothing in the shape of a Supply and Tender Board, except scratch boards got together in the various States and at the Seat of Government in connection with the Departments. have no properly constituted Supply and Tender Board, and the Treasurer is now seeking power, by an amendment of the Audit Act, to bring about that little reform. Further, we have no such thing as a Committee of Public Accounts. There are Estimates for works to cost at least Â£22,000,000, and I defy the most autocratic Minister or the humblest member in the House to say or show that this money is being spent wisely and well. What we require is what is in existence elsewhere- a Committee of Public Accounts to follow those Estimates into the Departments, and see that the money voted gets to its proper destination.  appointed the better.",44
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But here, again, legislation will be required.",44
270,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Non-contentious .,44
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What does the honourable member mean by that?,44
272,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Eithe r of these Bills could be drafted in a couple of days. It would be only scissors and paste work.,44
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not speaking of the drafting of tbem, but of getting them put on the statute-book, which is quite a different thing. I am interested to hear that these are non-contentious measures, and I hope that my honourable friends opposite will make some proposition whereby we can get the Bills through in a few days' time. Then we shall do something. But they make me nervous when they talk of non-contentious measures.",44
274,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Prime Minister brings forward the most contentious business first.,44
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I thought that the Audit Bill would have gone through without debate.,44
276,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Evidentl y delay was necessary, because it is proposed to amend the Bill.",44
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The amendment was not suggested by anything said by honourable members opposite.,44
278,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then the Ministry brings forward measures that are ill-digested.,44
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Her e we have the non-contentious gentlemen shooting contention across the chamber.,44
280,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Has this anything to do with the motion? 0,44
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am speaking We of the possibility of getting through the House a very useful Works measure. Other statutory power is required to enable us to establish a proper constructing Department, an organized, modern, up-to-date Works Office. We have no such thing today, and our officers are struggling along under the greatest disabilities. I am afraid that we are overlapping. I do not speak authoritatively on the point; I only give my impressions, as any honourable member may do. The co-ordination of the works expenditure is a pressing necessity. We needsome expert body to make preliminary investigations, and to present reasoned estimates and forecasts before Parliament is asked to vote huge sums of money. To my way of thinking- I do not say this for party purposes-the manner of the taking over of the Fitzroy Dock was wrong. An obligation amounting to Â£850,000 was incurred by the late Government without reference to Parliament.",44

295,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall have to name the honourable member for Barrier if he persists in wilfully disregarding the author it y of the Chair. I have several times called order, and it is grossly disorderly, when the Speaker is trying to preserve order, for an honourable member to again immediately interject.

298,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I thought so.,45
299,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member's interjection, made immediately after I had asked the House to preserve order, was a direct challenge to me to take action. I name the honourable member for wilfully disregarding the instructions of the Chair.",45
300,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is very disagreeable to me,45
301,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If Mr Speaker is going to p it me, let him do so. If we have a partisan Speaker, let him do it .",45
302,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member has now made a gross reflection on the Chair. Every honourable member must recognise that I try to be as fair as possible. I have tried to defer action like this as much as possible; but, immediately the Deafter I had pointed out the grossness of the disorder of interjecting, when I had but a moment before called for order, and before I had more than resumed my seat, the honourable member interjected again. He had no riglit to impugn my impartiality, because I think I have shown proof of my desire to be fair to every one. The opportunity is still open to him, if he desires f t , to express his regret.",45
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honourable member will not do anything, it will become my painful duty to take action. But I hope that he will do something.",45

310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am afraid that my point has been misunderstood by honourable members opposite.,45
311,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not think that the Prime Minister put things fairly.,45
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,My point is that large public undertakings should be the subject of preliminary inquiry before Parliament is asked to vote money for them.,46

316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Parliamen t knows nothing about what he has been doing, nor does any one else. It cannot, under present circumstances, be known. Parliament votes money in total ignorance of how it will be spent in detail. That is why we need inquiries to follow these votes, and see that they reach their proper destinations. More than that, Parliament should be full y seized of the purposes for which money is asked. That is impossible under present conditions. We have not the requisite expert bodies to inform Parliament, so that honourable members may deal intelligently with the proposals put before them.

318,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"West Sydney) [7.50]. - I desire, very shortly, to put the views which I hold in respect of this measure. To clause 2, as proposed to be amended by the following amendment which the Treasurer has circulatedand the expenditure shall be in accordance with the Appropriation Act for the previous year, and the aggregate amount of expenditure shall not exceed the amount expended in the month of June preceding, as we I take no exception. We shall be glad to facilitate the passing of that part of the Bill as speedily as possible. Clause 3, liowever, deals with au entirely different matter. There is no necessary relation between the two provisions. The one is to provide for contingencies that have arisen, and are likely to arise, in order to enable the public services of the country to be carried on without resort-as the Prime Minister has said-to doubtfully legal expedients. The other proposes to create a Supply and Tender Board, or, as the p.m. clause stands, to give to the Auditor General, under section 71 of the A u d it Act , power to make regulations for regulating the purchase, custody, coutrol, and issue of public stores. That, shortly, is a proposal to create a Supply and Tender Board. I want to make the posiof the Opposition perfectly clear in this matter. We do not take exception to the creation of a Supply and Tender Board. To that, it appears to me, there Dr can be no valid objection. Such a Board, to my knowledge, is in existence in New Soutli Wale3, and, so far as I know, in other States; but the proposal to make provision for it in this measure is, in my opinion, objectionable. There is no necessary relation between the two matters, and it sets up what appears to be a quite vicious principle. The Auditor-General is an independent officer, his sole function being to review the financial expenditure and financial conditions of the other Departments. In himself he does nothing. He, as public auditor, guarantees to the public that everything is as the Ministerial heads declare it to be. - Government are now proposing to make him the head of a Supply and Tender Board.",46
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No .,47
320,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I beg the right honourable member's pardon. That must be the position under the A u d it Act. Such - a position ought not to be created, because if it is, the Auditor-General will have to review the acts of his own officers. He should not do that. His duty is to review the actions of officers of other Departments. The object which the Government have in view can be secured in one of two ways. It is open to them to create - a Departmental Board, such as exists in New South Wales-wher e the Under-Secretary to the Treasury, and two other Departmental heads, are constituted by departmental regulation or arrangement a Supply and Tender Board-o r they can create such a Board by special Statute. To these courses I have no objection. Either course would give the Government what they want, whilst, at the same time, it would give the Auditor-General that power to review, as an independent officer, the actions of this Board, which he will not have if he has to review, as he would have to do under this Bill , his own acts. The right honourable member says, "" No , "" but he will permit me to state my own view of the position. Clause 2 of the Bill is entirely acceptable to the Opposition) but there is a difference of opinion as to whether, under clause 3, there should be created a Supply and Tender Board, or whether that Board should not be created either under a separate measure or by regulation. The Board may be created by Statute- I do not know that there is any particular reason for doing so-o r it may be established by regulation. think the Treasurer would be well advised to withdraw this clause, so that the Bill w i ll deal with one particular matter in stead of two that are entirely unrelated. Clause 2 will really give the Parliament power to grant Supply for thirteen months instead of twelve. The two matters should not be embraced by the one measure. That, shortly put, is our position. The difference of'opinion relates to a matter of procedure rather than of principle, and the desire of the Government toestablish a Board should be carried out in the way I have suggested. - Mr ROBERTS (Adelaide) [7.57] The This Bill was practically thrown at us at the end of last week by the Treasurer, who, for all practical purposes, acknowledged, in the course of his remarks, that he did not understand it . That, perhaps, is not surprising; nevertheless it would have been only ordinary courtesy on the right honourable member's part to make himself acquainted with the provisions of the Bill before presenting it to the House. At the very first breath of reasonable criticism, he admitted that the Bill did not contain a very important provision which should have been embodied in it , and he has since emphasized that admission by himself providing for a substantial amendment. Whilst the right honourable member was moving the motion for the second reading of the Bill , it was interjected that the Bill did not provide that payments made uuder it during the month of July should not be in excess of the appropriation for the previous year. He replied, "" I think there is such a provision in the Bill . "" He did not know, and presumably had not looked at the measure, or taken the trouble to see that it contained such a provision. The right honourable gentleman subsequently found that it did not, and at this early stage we have had circulated by him a very important amendment, which would not have been necessary had the Bill been reasonably considered before being thrown on the table of the House. The Bill , as introduced, and without the amendment that has now been circulated, would have made it possible for a Ministry defeated at the polls to have indulged during the month of July, without calling Parliament together, in an expenditure altogether out of proportion to the appropriation made during the previous year, when the House was in session. That is scarcely I permitted in the case of an ordinary Supply Bill , granted when a Ministry holds office by virtue of even a large majorit y and the House is in session. There is invariably a stipulation, when an ordinary Supply Bill is granted before the Estimates come on, that the payments made shall not be in excess of the previous year's appropriation. How, however, we have the Treasurer throwing a Bill at honourable members which, had they not carefully looked at it-fa r more carefully than did the responsible Minister-woul d have meant that next July, for instance, the Government need not have called the House together, and would have been able to indulge in any form of expenditure which the House would have no opportunity to consider. As a matter of fact, such expenditure would practically have to be condoned, and, doubtless, would have been condonocl.",47
321,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,And the Government complain that the Bill did not go through in one sitting.,48
322,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is another feature worth noting. The Government complain that the Bill was not hurried through in one sitting; but it needed a mere interjection from this side to show the right honourable gentleman the necessity of practically withdrawing the Bill in order to frame an important amendment. It will scarcely be believed by the people outside, who have been misled by those references to the necessity for the Bill going through in one sitting, that in no circumstances can it come into operation until July of next year.",48
323,Sir JOHN EORKEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is all right; we are past July now.,48
324,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then why should the Treasurer, or the Prime Minister, suggest that we on this side wasted time in discussing the Bill for a moment, and urging that it was not a measure of urgency ? Such painful attempts to mislead the community ought to be reprimanded and severely condemned, because they are becoming regular. First of all, the Bill cannot come into operation before next July, and, in all probability, it will not be brought into operation until the July following a general election. It is inconceivable that, unless under the latter circumstances, the Ministry would delay calling the House together until after the first week in July. After an election there might be an excuse for its doing so, and then only would the Bill be of the slightest use, in so far as its main features are concerned. As the Prime Minister dealt with this particular feature of the Bill when speaking at Dandenong a day or two ago, it is permissible to refer to what he there said. Again, we have a direct and deplorable misrepresentation of the situation, as will be seen from the Prime Minister's words, as reported in the Argus of 9 th September. The honourable gentleman saidThe Opposition said, "" Bring along non-contentious Bills, and we will help you: if you will only keep ' preference' out of the way, and the postal vote out of the way."" In the first place, such words were never used by the Opposition, although the Prime Minister quotes them as actual expressions from honourable members on this side. We did invite the Government to bring along non-contentious measures, and promised to help them; and we are prepared now, and always have been, to deal with business of that description. But we made no stipulation about keeping "" preference "" or any other subject out of the way. However, the honourable gentleman proceededLast Friday the Ministry took them at their word, with an Audit Bill and a Bill to provide an agricultural bureau. The last Government hung on to office so long that when the present Government took office it could not get the money to pay salaries, except by a stratagem, not quite legal, and which Parliament would have to indemnify. There, again, the statement is incorrect, and a distinct misrepresentation; no stratagem had to be resorted to. The House met on the 9 th July, and then, practically without discussion, the Government were granted Supply. The Bill was put through the other branch of the Legislature with equal rapidity on 10th July, four or five days before the Public Service salaries were due. There was no necessity for any stratagem, much less one which Parliament, to use the Prime Minister's own words, would have to "" indemnify."" Perhaps honourable members on the Government side are so accustomed to stratagems and methods that many honourable men reject that the idea occurs to the mind of the Prime Minister. The Government had not, and did not, resort to any stratagem, because, in the first place, the necessity never arose, salaries not being payable until the middle of the month; and, in the second place, a Supply Bill passed both Houses long before that time, the Government having been given a clear intimation by the Leader of the Opposition that there would be practically no opposition to Supply before the salaries became due. these statements, puerile in themselves, though of a deceptive character, are made to a public, the members of which, by reason of their various avocations, cannot possibly know the details of the business of this House, and who are likely to accept statements coming from gentlemen holding high and responsible positions, although those gentlemen themselves must know that there is no justification for them. The Prime Minister went on to sayThe Audit Bill was to provide that in year they could get supply without waiting for Parliament, so as to tide over the first few weeks. Mr Hughes said that it was a far-reaching reform, and it was not allowed to pass. Again, in this sentence there is a distinct and deplorable misrepresentation. It is made to appear that the A u d it Bill , in so far as it provides for tiding over the first few weeks of a new financial year, was referred to by the honourable member for West Sydney as a far-reaching measure. What the honourable member did say was that the innovation which the Government endeavoured to make by tacking on a Supply and Tender Board provision was far-reaching. So far as the Bill dealt only with the means of tiding over the first few weeks of a financial year, it was regarded as non-contentious, and we were prepared to pass it practically without a word. In that speech, liowever, it is made to appear that precisely the reverse was the case, and I am justified in calling attention to this deplorable conduct in the hope of having some effect in checking it . The Prime Minister went on to sayThe Agricultural Bureau Bill was a measure to assist the farmers and others. But these two Bills were talked about the whole day, and when the House rose on Friday they were no further forward than when it began. Here is another distinct misrepresentation. Certain speeches had been made on' both Bills, and the discussion of one had been adjourned because, at the first breath of criticism, the Government found that they knew nothing about their own measure, and had to withdraw it in order to submit an important amendment. The debate on the second Bill was adjourned when practically the ordinary hour for the adjournment of the House had arrived, after two speeches had been delivered, one by the Prime Minister, who admitted [42] that he was taken at a disadvantage, for he knew really nothing about it , and anYet other by the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs.",48
325,Mr MCWILLIAMS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member knows that, under ordinary circumstances, the Bill would have been in troduced by the Minister of Trade and Customs.",49
326,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We know that, and it was for that reason that we allowed the Prime Minister, practically without criticism, to wander on in his remarks. We knew that he was taken at a disadvantage, although he is Prime Minister, any and the Government submit this Bill as, according to the honourable member for Wannon, their supreme measure, which is to raise the agricultural community to a standard that could never be reached by the poor members on this side, and which will stamp the present Government as one deserving the permanent occupancy of the Treasury benches. We know why the Minister of Trade and Customs is absent, and on that score no objection can be raised. The notes prepared for that honourable gentleman at the Customs House were sent up to the Prime Minister, who did his best. In view of this predicament of the Government, why should the Prime Minister and others go to Dandenong, or any other place, and make statements intended to convey to the public that we on this side are deliberately delaying measures, and taking undue advantage of the forms of the House to prevent the Ministry getting their business through? When we come to debate the Agricultural Bureau Bill we shall be able to show very clearly that, not only the Prime Minister, but practically the whole of the Ministry, are taken at a disadvantage at the present moment. In reply to a question a day or two ago the Prime Minister had to admit that the Government had not considered the Bill in any shape or form, and really did not know what the financial provisions were to be. However, we shall deal with all this when the Bill is before us. It is reasonable to ask the Treasurer to explain what, stratagem he indulged in in order to paysalaries in the early part of July.",49
327,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I did not use any strategy.,49
328,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I accept the right honourable gentleman's statement. The Prime Minister says that stratagem was indulged in , and, once again, we have a distinct difference of opinion between two responsible officers wben it comes to the facts, and they are brought face to face with honourable members, whose duty it is to give attention to details.",49
329,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I mean that Treasury did not use any stratagem.,50
330,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Treasurer states that his Department, the paying Department, had not to resort to any strategy. But out i u the country, at places like Dandenong, before cheering crowds of Liberal supporters, the present Prime Minister said the opposite. The honourable gentleman has a right to indulge in post-prandial speeches, but he should not use the occasion to slander those on this side, and to mislead the community. Had not the Treasurer told us the truth we should have had to ascertain it by direct inquiry. I take no exception to clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill , the provisions of which are reasonable. In the month of July, particularly after a general election, it may not be convenient to call Parliament together until perhaps ten or twelve days after the beginning of the financial year, and the Ministry, even though defeated at the polls, would be justified in paying salaries for the transaction of the ordinary business of the country. The Bill would permit that, the payments being in accordance with the previous appropriation. But the Acting Leader of the Opposition has properly drawn attention to -,a provision which, in my opinion, should not be retained in the measure. Clause 3 provides for the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board. I do not take exception to the establishment of (not such a Board, but I say that it should be provided for by a separate Bill . should know, too, what the composition of the Board will be, what its functions will be, and whether its members will be new appointments or officers already in the service. Under the Bill the Government could appoint new men at any salaries they chose, and we have just had a message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation for the purposes of the Bill . I do not know what the amount of the appropriation will be.",50
331,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No appropriation is intended, but it was thought that the Bill could not be introduced without a message.",50
332,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No appropriation is possible for last July. The message need not have been brought down until later. Under clause 3 the Government could establish a Supply and Tender Board, and; by regulation give it practically any powers they thought fit, without Parliament having an opportunity to criticisethe what had been done. The deletion of clause 3 is not proposed by way of an attack on the Government, and it can be agreed to without loss of dignity. Honourable members on this side feel that theprovision is not in its right place, and that the Board, if established, should be authorized by a separate Bill . Clause 3 amends section 71 of the principal Act which provides for the making of regulations-by adding a new paragraph; but it is a matter for consideration whether the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board would be consistent with the original Act. The Act deals with the auditing and keeping of accounts and the proper expenditure of the appropriations of Parliament. The establishment of a Supply and Tender Board is an entirely different thing. Section 71 gives power to make regulations "" not inconsistent, with the provisions of this Act "" ; but itmight be found that regulations for the creation of a Supply and Tender Board were inconsistent, and, therefore, they would go for nothing. The Auditor General himself might say, "" Notwithstanding your amendment of the Act to provide for the establishment of this Board by regulations, the regulations are inconsistent with the Act , and, therefore, your action is ultra vires."" Section 71 readsThe Governor General may make regulations, inconsistent with the provisions of this Act) for carrying out the provisions of this Act, and We in particular for(a) the collection, receipt, custody, issue, expenditure, due accounting for, care, and management of all public moneys, and the guidance of all persons concerned therein; (i) the more effectual record, examination, inspection, and audit of all receipts, and expenditure, and the keeping of all necessary books and accounts; (c) prescribing the necessary forms for all books and documents whatever r e quired under the provisions of this. Act or the regulations; (d) requiring omcers, holding positions which in the opinion of the Treasurer ought to be guaranteed, to contribute to the Guarantee Fund; (e) providing for the control and manage- ment of the Guarantee Fund. Those are the special regulations p r o v i d e d ' for in a d d it i o n to others not in c o n s is t e n t. with the Act . The Treasurer should explain to us how regulations for the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board could be consistent with the Act. Failing such explanation, I think that clause. 3 should be struck out, and its provisions embodied in a separate measure.",50
333,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Angas-Minister of External Affairs) [8.27] - The point taken by the honourable members for West Sydney and Adelaide is that the provisions of olause 3, amending section 71, will be invalid because incongruous with the Principal Act . It is assumed that section 71 deals only with regulations congruous with the rest of the Act . It says The Governor General may make regulations (not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act) for carrying out the provisions of this Act, in particular forThe A u d it Act is not merely an Accountancy Act , and there is a great deal of difference between auditing and accounthat. tancy. The Act deals generally with supervision of finance, the methods drawing moneys, when they are to be paid, when accounts lapse, and so forth In many of the State Acts there are special provisions dealing with supplies stores. These provisions are not in our Act, because the Commonwealth has not had, so far , many large transactions connection with stores.",51
334,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does the Minister say that clause 3 is cognate with anything in section 71 ?,51
335,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes ; and it is suffiof ciently explicit as a substantial enactment to authorize what the Treasurer proposes to do.,51
336,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The creation of a Supply and Tender Board.,51
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The clause authorizes that, but it does not mention it .",51
338,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There is a provision the Commonwealth Acts Interpretation Act 1904 that regulations of this kind shall be laid upon the table of the House. Objection may be taken to them. Tliey may be challenged. How can any one Act. say in advance, before a regulation is matter of accountancy. framed, that it must be invalid ? This merely gives power to take custody control of public stores.",51
339,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Can that be dealt with by regulation? ' Mr Glynn - It can if sufficient power is given in the Act ; and whether regulation is within the scope of an or not must depend upon the terms of [ 4 2 ] - *' regulation. Honourable members have not seen any regulation yet. Is it not rather premature to say that a mistake must be made in exercising a power which can b6 exercised with perfect legality ?,51
340,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We may think that too much power is being taken in this case.,51
341,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It cannot be said that this is outside the spirit of the A u d it Act. That Act is for the purpose of controlling public moneys, or stores into which public moneys have been converted.",51
342,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The thing is foreign to the nature of the Auditor-General's duties.,51
343,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not think so. In the first place, I take the point that this and is not a mere matter of accountancy. It is not a mere matter of determining whether a particular set of accounts is correct or not. It is something more than It is a general direction to the the Treasurer and others who have to deal of with public moneys and materials as to how they are to exercise control over . them. It empowers the Auditor-General to check, within the scope of the measure, of the application or use of those moneys and materials. That that is properly provided for is shown, by an examination of in the A u d it Acts of the States. Take the South Australian A u d it Act of 1882. It provides that the Commissioner of A u d it , or any officers appointed by him-and if a separate Tender Board were appointed they would be officers within the meaning the A u d it Act-ar e authorized from time to time to check accounts and goods warehoused in Government stores, and so on.",51
344,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That says nothing about purchase.,51
345,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It alludes to ascertaining the quantity, description, and price in of all stores and supplies.",51
346,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is auditing only.,51
347,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Of course; if it were not auditing it would not be in an A u d it But the auditing is not a mere It involves a general supervision over the financial and operations of the Treasury.,51
348,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is the scope of the duties of the Auditor-General of South Australia the same as in our Act .,51
349,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not say that the a Acts are exactly the same, but they are Act in spirit the same. You can invest the the Auditor-General with any powers you like which are in consonance with his position. You can invest him with the power of supervising the purchasing of goods.",51
350,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The whole virtue of the duty of the Auditor-General is the power of review of all other officers. That is the main thing.,52
351,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Eve n if I accepted what the honourable gentleman says, this provision would be within the scope of the A u d it Act.",52
352,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is it proper Auditor-General to do something that he himself would have to review?,52
353,Sir JOHN FOBREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is not proposed that he shall do that.,52
354,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am prepared to put this view to the honourable member for - West Sydney. I say that it is proper for the Auditor-General to do such a thing, because the Acts of the States contain similar provisions.",52
355,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a lovely idea.,52
356,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There can be only two possible positions set up by honourable members opposite. One is that, assuming we give these powers, they are inconsistent with the spirit of the A u d it Act . The other is that which seems to be taken by the honourable member for Adelaide, that though the proposal may, or may not, be in conformity with the objects of the A u d it Act , we are not attaining the object by the way we are amending section 71.",52
357,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"There poiub-that this hands over power to the Government to make regulations, when we can specify here what we want to be done.",52
358,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why not do it by regulation ? Sureiy the particular machinery to be employed is a matter for the Department concerned.,52
359,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There is more than machinery in this.,52
360,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member will find that in two-thirds of our legislation power is given to do certain things by regulation.,52
361,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,To o much so.,52
362,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Do honourable members want the A u d it Act to contain a provision that only certain classes of persons shall be appointed, and do they want the names of the persons connected with the staff of the Tender Board to appear? That sort of thing has not been the practice in our legislation. It is only when you appoint Railways Commissioners, or some great functionaries of that kind, who are not permanent heads of Departments, that you prescribe their powers in an Act . In other cases, general powers are given. For instance, we hand over to the Public Service Commissioner the power of classification and selection of officers, and so on. Similarly, in this case it is proposed to give to the Treasurer by Act of Parliament power to appoint a Supply and Tender Board. Surely we can entrust him with the constitution of that Board as long as we define the general powers. for the Those powers can extend-and , as a matter of fact, they do extend in the States where they have more of these operations than we do-to the control and purchase of material as well as the disposition of material.",52
363,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will anybody have power to review what the Supply and Tender Board does?,52
364,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , the Auditor General.",52
365,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It will be under him that these functions will be exercised.,52
366,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not at all.,52
367,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a mere question of this provision that is objected to being in keeping with the spirit of the A u d it Act . Of course, if what is intended is not properly achieved by the wording of this measure, it can be amended in Committee. But I do not for a moment think the object is not properly achieved. Whether it should be provided for in an is another A u d it Act is a question upon which there may be a difference of opinion. All that I say is that similar powers are contained in the A u d it Acts of the States. . Mr HUGHES - This thing ought to be under the control of a sub-Department of the Prime Minister's Department, so that he may have a purview of the matter, and so that the Auditor-General can review the Prime Minister's action.",52
368,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I cannot see for the life of me why this matter should be under the Prime Minister's Department. If we say that a regulation may be made affecting, the custody and purchase of public stores, surely that matter can be under the control of the Treasurer, he being the Minister who will have to provide the funds. As a matter of fact, it will be found that in the Acts of the States, in many cases, the audit relates, not merely to money, but to materials-f o materials into which cash' has been converted; and it is a perfectly proper thing to invest a commissioner or a Board with a power of supervision over such matters. There is no doubt about that. The only question is as to whether we are attaining that object by this measure. According to my reading the Bill is ample for the purpose.",52
369,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Kennedy) [8.40] The honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat has devoted his attention to showing that, because there is a provision in some of the Acts of the States which permits of the Auditor-General performing the functions laid down in this Bill , therefore, it is proper that we should provide for them in the Bill . But there is a difference between the Auditor-General of a State and the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth. The Auditor General of no State today has the enormous amount of work to supervise that the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth has. The whole of the time of our Auditor-General is consumed by his present duties. He is in a different position from that which this Tender Board will"" occupy. The Auditor-General presents his report to this House. He is responsible to Parliament, and not to the Government. If the Auditor-General is to be made the head of a Supply and Tender Board, he will not be responsible to this House as he is now.",53
370,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He will only the accounts.,53
371,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The Minister of External Affairs went further than the Treasurer goes when he said that the Auditor-General may exercise control over the purchase of materials, and that he t'o choose and supervise the persons acting on the Tender Board.",53
372,Mr GLYNN,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That will depend upon regulations.,53
373,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is the i m - Auditor-General. pression lef t upon my mind by the honorment able gentleman. Mr Glynn,-That is the power.",53
374,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This Bill gives power to make certain regulations. I gives power to establish a Supply and Tender Board with the Auditor-General Board. as Chairman.,53
375,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It does not say and that was never intended either.,53
376,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If we once pass this Bil l the Government will have ample power to do that, as the Treasurer should know. Of course, I am well aware that he does not know much about the He came down to the House with an i m perfect knowledge of it . But the Minister of External Affairs has put an entirely different complexion upon the matter.",53
377,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,In what way did he do that?,53
378,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If I am to keep on replying to the Treasurer I shall not be able to get in what I want to say.,53
379,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member is offensive in saying that I know nothing about the Bill .,53
380,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The point which I wish to make is that if the Auditor-General is made chairman of this Supply and Tender Board, the result will be that sooner or later he will come into conflict with the members of this House on some action that he has taken. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Why should he be made the chairman ?",53
381,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not know. All that I know is that we are going to give power to the Government to frame a regulation making the Auditor-General chairman if they so desire. Mr W . H . IRVINE - No one suggested making the Auditor-General the chairman.,53
382,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No doubt if the Attorney-General had explained matters audit he would have _put them more clearly. We have been told that he will have complete control over the purchase of the various stores required by the Commonwealth. If that be so, sooner or later he must come into conflict with the memis bers of this House. Now, if there is one man in the Public Service of the Commonwealth who should be placed beyond the the possibility of conflict with either House of this Parliament, that man is the I object to governby regulation. I agree with the Prime Minister, who, upon numerous occasions in this House, has taken strong exception to government by regut lation. We do not know who are to constitute the proposed Supply and Tender This Bill will empower the Treasurer to expend money for one month after so, the close of the financial year, on the basis of the Estimates for the preceding year. I think that the exercise of that power should be limited to the first montb. after a general election. That is the only time that the - Treasurer will be called Bill . upon to exercise it .",53
383,Sir JOHN FOKREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is always wanted.,54
384,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is only required because Governments call Parliament together at the last possible moment. There is a necessity for empowering the Treasurer, after a general election, to expend money for one month on the basis of the Estimates for the preceding year, because if Parliament were called together before the 30th June, the Senaie would have to meet composed of its old members, notwithstanding that the country had elected new members.",54
385,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We can never toll what will happen.,54
386,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I think that the measure will work out in the manner I have suggested, and that, in the future, Governments, instead of calling Parliament together during the first week of July, will probably defer meeting it till the end of July or the beginning of August. I recollect that, on a former occasion, when money was required before the meeting of Parliament, a special Bill was passed to authorize the necessary expenditure. By adopting that course now the public finances would be protected in a way that they cannot be protected under this Bill. To-day I asked the Treasurer whether there had been a proper audit of the public accounts from time to time, and I again ask him whether those accounts have been correctly audited from time to time? Sir JOHN FORREST,-Certainly . Auditor-General's report comes before Parliament every year. What is the honourable member driving at?",54
387,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will tell the Treasurer. The Prime Minister has attended different meetings in the country, and has told his hearers that the public accounts have not been properly audited.",54
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I never said any such thing in my life.,54
389,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then the honor-' able gentleman must fight the matter out with his organ, the Argus.",54
390,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Indeed , I will not. The statement does not appear in the organ either. The honourable member twists everything.",54
391,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I have not the statement here,54
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And the honourable member cannot find it, either.",54
393,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member should have told me what he was up to.,54
394,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Thes e statements are made outside for one purpose-to blacken the reputations of honourable members on this side of the House, and to make it appear that they would not allow the public accounts .to be properly audited. The Prime Minister stated that those accounts were not properly audited. Yet the Government now propose to impose further duties on the Auditor-General",54
395,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He has to do all the work now.,54
396,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Ye t we find the Prime Minister going about the country and declaring that the accounts are not properly audited. I . strongly object to placing this additional burden on the Auditor-General. I do not know what the Government intend to do in this matter. The Treasurer did not tell us. He acted exactly as the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs acted last night. He gave us very little information. I am quite in accord with the idea of establishing a Supply and Tender Board. The sooner we have our supplies regulated under one head the better. But I do not think that the method proposed is the best way of going about that work. A Bil l should be introduced creating a Department expressly to deal with this matter- a Department which should be under the conThe trol of some responsible Minister, and which would leave the Auditor-General free to audit the accounts from time to time.",54
397,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is what is going to be done.,54
398,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the Treasurer is proposing to do it by regulation, when it should be done by means of an Act of Parliament. The Government ask for power to make regulations from time to time, and every honourable member knows the difficulty that we experience in understanding them. They are brought forward in bundles, and I do not believe that there is a single man in this Chamber, from the Prime Minister to the humblest member of it, who ever reads those regulations. I notice that the Prime Minister is very anxious to make a personal explanation. He has had to make so many since the last general elections that the mere making of them is becoming a gift with him. I enter my protest - against the procedure that is being adopted in connection with this Bill. I do not think that the first portion of it will bring about the results anticipated, because it will enable Governments to postpone calling Parliament together until the last jpossible moment. It can be made effective so far as the financial portion of it iis concerned only after a general election.",54

402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The same old game. Mr Speaker has been pulling up honourable members upon this side of the House all day,55
403,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Order ! I have several times called ""Order,"" and only just before the adjournment for dinner I had to remind honourable members that it is very disorderly to interject immediately after I bave called the House to order. I ask the honourable member for Illawarra, as a new member, to remember that.",55
404,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What I object to is the misrepresentation which is contained in the questions put by the honourable member for Kennedy. I will read what I did say, and I will be judged on that.",55
405,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Is this from the Argus ?,55
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"No . Here is what I have said rfiferring to the audit of our accountsIn the case of our Commonwealth transactions there is no such report or signature hy the Auditor-General. Instead, there is a serious complaint and criticism by that gentleman in the following language. Writing on 30th June, 1911, he says:-""The statement of the Honourable the Treasurer relating to the accounts for the year 1909-10 was received by me, complete, this 10th day of March, i g n That is nine months after the end of the year, and after this Parliament had risen and was in recess. The late receipt of the statement and accounts made it impossible for my report to be prepared and presented to Parliament prior to the close of the recent session. My previous eight annual reports had been submitted for the information of Parliament in the first instance."" In s t e a d of the A u d it o r - G e n e r al presenting his report to the P a r l i a m e n t w h i l e it was in session, so that it might be of use to honourable members in the criticism of the accounts of the country, it was not presented until the Parliament had risen, and therefore it was of no use in connection with that criticism. He points out that previously eight Liberal Administrations had always enabled him to present his report 'on the accounts to Parliament while it was sitting.",55
407,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What small accounts they had compared with those of the Labour Administration.,55
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Neve r mind about that. The Auditor-General saysMy previous eight annual reports had been submitted for the information of Parliament in the first instance. In this case he did not present the report to Parliament at all, and the only way of getting it before the country so that the public might estimate the audit was by publication in a special issue of the Gazette.",55
409,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that is a reflection on our public officers.,55
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a fact, whomever it reflects upon.",55
411,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is a reflection on public officers.,55
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In that case it is a reflection by the Auditor-General, and that is the point I want to emphasize. I am not making a reflection. It is the Auditor-General's reflection",55
413,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why publish it?,55
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is the Auditor-General who is making the reflection, if reflection there be. It is he who points out that his report is practically valueless. I go on to sayIn the first year of the present Treasurer it took 9^ months after the close of the year to present the accounts of the year for audit. This was long after Parliament had risenwhen, indeed, it was nearly time for it to reassemble. Despite this protest of the Auditor General, the delay is repeated the following year, leading to is repetition of the protest in the following wordsThat is to say, the year's accounts were not audited until almost the due date for another audit. The whole twelve months had gone i mnd before the accounts were presented complete to the Auditor-General.",55
415,Mr ABCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,How are you going to get over the difficulty ?,56
416,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am not even concerned with that at the present moment.,56
417,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,You are not concerned with anything.,56
418,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am concerned with these facts which are sought to be misrepresented by one of the honourable member's colleagues for political reasons.,56
419,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,You know the cause of that?,56
420,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This is another dialogue. Order!,56
421,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will you answer my question ?,56
422,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What question?,56
423,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I said you stated that the public accounts were not properly audited.,56
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I never said that.,56
425,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It appeared in a commentnewspaper which I can show to the honourable member.,56
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have never rendered said that. What I have said is that the of audit has been useless,. so far as ParliaMinister. ment is concerned.",56
427,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Thos e are not words in the newspaper. Mr W. H . IBVINE - Will you accept the statement of the Prime MinAuditor-General's ister ?,56
428,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I will accept it if denies what is in the newspaper.,56
429,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order !,56
430,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"On its face logical, too.",56
431,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order !,56
432,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,He will explain it away.,56
433,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Agai n I have to make the same complaint as I had to make a few minutes ago. The honourable member for Maribyrnong is the offender on this occasion. Immediately after I called for order he interjected. I inform him that if it occurs again I shall have to take another course.,56
434,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All right, sir.",56
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a pity that honourable members on the other will not let a man defend himself. ""The Right Honourable the Treasurer's statement of accounts for the year i g i o - n was not received by me, complete, until this slay, the 30th of April, 1912""-o r ten months after the close of the financial year- "" when the statement of the Treasury balances was signed by the Treasurer. . . . The late receipt of the Treasury accounts, and the consequent delay in the presentation of this report, has rendered 1 much of the subject-matter of less public in terest than it might otherwise have possessed."" That statement, coming from the Auditor-General, is serious. He himself says that his report is rendered of leBs value than it ought to be by reason of the late presentation of the Treasurer's accounts. These are not my strictures at all; I am merely quoting them from the public records. This is what the Auditor-General says",56
436,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does he say in any part of the report that the accounts have not been properly audited ?,56
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What a. foolish man he would be to make that reflection on his own work !,56
438,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member did it .,56
439,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"What a fool he would be to say, "" I am not doing my work properly 1"" I go on to make this What these strictures mean in plain language is, that the whole of the national audit is being almost valueless by the dilatory methods the Treasury under the control of the PrimeThat is as to two years of Labour control the of the Treasury. Honourable members will recollect that on the last day of the not last session of the last Parliament the report was presented, that is, when it was too late to do anyhe thing, even to look at the document. I remember that we had been asking the Treasurer to facilitate the presentation of it is the report for some days.",56
440,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That was an improvement by five months, at any rate.",56
441,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Of course it was an improvement. We had been asking and pressing the Treasurer to present the audit before the session closed,, and the honourable member will find fromi Hansard, if he looks, that while the honourable member for Wide Bay was telling us, not on one day, but on several days, that he was pressing the Auditor-General to present his report, the fact was that his own statement of accounts had not been side presented complete to the Auditor General.",56
442,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is a nice thing to say.,57
443,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is a fact. - Mr ROBERTS - No .,57
444,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"When it was presented five months after the 30th June, did it get in on the last day of the session?",57
445,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I advise my honourable friend to listen to what I am saying, because he really does not understand the matter.",57
446,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Than k you. I happened to be in the Treasury for about nine months, you know.",57
447,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is a pity then that you make these interjections. I see that the Auditor-General's report on the third occasion was presented to this House on the last day of its sitting.,57
448,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Will you kindly say whether there is in this which will remedy that difficulty ?,57
449,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I do not suplike. pose there is. It is all a matter of the presentation of the accounts by the Treasurer to the Auditor-General.,57
450,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This Bill will practically give more work to the Auditor General, which you admit he cannot carry out.",57
451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does not the should honourable member understand that it not a matter of .the Auditor-General? want to point out, if honourable members will permit me, instead of interjecting, that the Auditor-General said in the port which was put on this table on the last day of the session, "" The statement of accounts from the Treasury was ceived by me complete this day.""",57
452,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But the Auditor General cannot audit the accounts until the end of the financial year, which is 30th June.",57
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is all I have to say in reply to my honourable friend, who put the trick questions on the notice-paper for the purpose of trying to get something to flog me with outside. Let him flog me with the Auditortouch General's reports.",57
454,Mr MCDONALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That Auditor-General's report.,57
455,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is. The honourable member will find this statement in the three reports, if he will look them up. I advise him to get the facts, and publish them broadcast. They show that, whereas previously eight Liberal Administrations had presented their statement of accounts, and got them 'audited, and the audit put before this Parliament during the session, during the three years of Labour rule of the Treasurer the Auditor General could not get the statement of accounts in any one year in time to make his audit of any use to this Parliament.",57
456,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is very dirty, and there is no necessity for it .",57
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"All I have to say is that it is the fact as set out by the Auditor-General. Really, the honourable member must go and criticise that officer.",57
458,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Y o u know the reasons why?,57
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am only quoting what the Auditor-General says.,57
460,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why do you not say the reasons why? You know them.,57
461,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I really do not Bill anything know the reasons.,57
462,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I will tell you, if you",57
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not know now why the accounts cannot be presented to this Parliament just the same as can be done in connection with any big business, perhaps not quite as readily. I am not asking that the report of the Auditor-General and the balance-sheet be presented as is done in the case is of a company; but, making allowance for I the difference between the affairs of a Government and those of a company, I still say that the very purpose and intenretion of an Auditor-General auditing our accounts is that the audit may be of service to this Parliament in reviewing the reaccounts of the year, and that, as he himself points out, is absolutely impos- sible unless he can get the statement of accounts in time to audit them and prethe sent them to this Parliament while it is in session.",57
464,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Kalgoorlie) [9.14] - It is very interesting to hear the Prime M in ister "" stone-wall "" his own Bill for about twenty-five minutes and never at any time anything which is associated with the Bill . is not the Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I did not get up for that purpose.",57
465,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Then the honourable gentleman ought to have stated that he wanted to make a personal explanation.,57
466,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not at all.,57
467,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member ought not to have used the privileges of the House in order to be deceptive to the House. In connection with this matter it is interesting to note that he,57
468,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,! would remind the honourable member that the previous speaker ,58
469,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Yes , sir; bu t if the Prime Minister is allowed to go on for twenty-five minutes in regard to the matter, I ought to be allowed twenty-five seconds to reply to his statements.",58
470,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Prime Minister only spoke for a quarter of an hour.,58
471,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In all probability we shall find that the statements of to-night, which cannot be corrected in three minutes, will be repeated the next time the honourable member gets to Dandenong.",58
472,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,You cannot correct them at all ; they are here.,58
473,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable gentleman is perfectly aware that the Treasury statement includes the accounts of every Department; that these have to be gathered in from every quarter of the Commonwealth, and that they have to be checked by the departmental accountants in the different States after coming from remote parts of the most remote States. This, of necessity, occupies a very considerable time. In the particular year to which the Prime Minister has referred",58
474,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I spoke of three years.,58
475,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable gentleman said that in one year the position was worse than in any other. He knows, however, that that was Coronation year. It was the year in respect of which a special appropriation was made by this Parliament in order that a large party of honourable members might attend the Coronation celebrations in the Old Country. He is well acquainted with the fact that Parliament was deliberately called together very late in that year, and that it was for that reason that at the end of the previous session a Supply Bill was passed authorizing expenditure for the first two months of the next financial year. All these facts are cleverly concealed from the public, and particularly from the residents of Dandenong, when the Prime Minister goes up there with his colleague the Attorney-General to take part in a specially-prepared "" boosting "" function.",58
476,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why Dandenong? The matter was never mentioned there.,58
477,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This is just the sort of thing that the honourable gentleman would talk about up there. Mr W . H . IBVINE - The residents of Dandenong are intelligent enough to understand some things that the honourable member is unable to understand.,58
478,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I understand the honourable member pretty well. We can get a code of honour from the honourable gentleman, who saw fit to vote to keep himself in office and power when a deliberate indictment was made against him.",58
479,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Order !,58
480,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I admit that the remark is slightly irrelevant. Here is another interesting fact which has just been unearthed- a fact which the Prime M in ister did not care to look up, but which we have found out for ourselves-that the report of the Auditor-General for 1907 was presented on the last day that Parliament met. That was during the term of office of the Fusion Government.",58
481,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No . Tbat was the Government which the honourable member helped to keep in office.,58
482,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I believe that it was the Reid-MCLean Administration, which was supported by honourable members opposite. The point that I wish to make is that the Prime Minister said that prior to the advent of the Labour Administration the accounts had been presented in time, whereas in 1907 the Auditor-General did not present his report until the last day of .the session.",58
483,Mr ROBEETS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,So that his statement was incorrect.,58
484,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is it necessary to mention that? I think that the present Treasurer resigned his position in the Deakin Administration about July, 1907.",58
485,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Yes .,58
486,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And left his leader in a nice fix. Coming to the Bill itself, I do not propose to take serious exception to the first part, so far as it is designed to legitimately amend the A u d it Act, although there is associated with it a dangerous feature. I recognise that it is absolutely impossible for the Government of the day to carry on the great Departments of the Commonwealth when they have not a penny at their disposal fro m 1st July u n t i l Parliament meets. The Treasurer knows, however, that whilst that is so, he allows the different Departments under his authority to enter into contractual obligations in connection with the supply of the various stores required by them-obligation s extending into the following financial year. that the money is expended, but the contractual obligation to expend it is undoubtedly authorized by the Treasurer.",58
487,Mr AGAK WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,B y each Department.,59
488,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,W it h the sanction of the Treasurer. Mr AG AK WYNNE - No .,59
489,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If my honourable friend tries, after 1st July, to enter into obligations in connection with the purchase of stores for the great Department which he controls without the authority of the Treasurer, he will find himself up against the Auditor-General.",59
490,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"But if the honourable member were a Minister on, say, 1st January, could he not enter into a contract having a currency of twelve months ?",59
491,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is an entirely different matter. It would be covered by the Appropriation Bills up to 30th June. In the circumstances I have mentioned I know that, when Postmaster-General, I had to get the authority of the Treasurer, and that whilst I was in charge of the Treasury all other Departments had to obtain my authority.",59
492,Mr AGAR WYNNE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is to after the 30th June.,59
493,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Exactly . This Bill does not relieve Ministers from that obligation; but it will give the Government of the day, willy nilly, a month's supply without the express authority of Parliament. It would be. possible, under the Bill as it stands, for a Government situated as the present Administration is, to refrain from calling Parliament together until the second week in August, instead of early in July. Knowing the difficulty which the Treasurer has in ascertaining whether he can meet his expenditure on the exact day on which the books close, namely, 30th June, I shall not take serious exception to this provision, although, under it , a Government defeated at the polls in A p r i l or May could carry on until August, and still have authority to expend public moneys.",59
494,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,No Government would do such a thing.,59
495,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is a question not of what they would do, but what they could do. As to the second part of the Bill , the Prime Minister this afternoon indicated that he was favourable to the apI do not say pointment of a Public Works Committee to supervise public works, and also that he thought it might be necessary to have a Public Accounts Committee. The late the head of Government inherited from their predecessors a legacy which they did not leave for their successors. At the Sydney Post Office it was found that telephone accounts amounting to nearly Â£30,000 had been unaudited for about eighteen months. In the Stores Branch the late Government for nearly two years made efforts to find out exactly what the position was; and at the expiration of that time it was decided by the Treasurer, as the easiest way out of the trouble, to close the books and start again.",59
496,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It was admitted that nothing could be done with the accounts.,59
497,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It was impossible to get out of the entanglement left by the previous Government. A new accountant was appointed, and I believe that the system of book-keeping now in vogue is much better than the one originally adopted, based on the varied systems of the States.",59
498,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,There was practically no system.,59
499,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not going to atsay, tempt to make any political capital out of the position; but I submit that there is danger in clause 12 as submitted. My opinion is that if the suggestion of the honourable member for Kennedy were adopted, and this clause made to apply only to the month of July after a general election, the necessities of the case would be met.",59
500,Mr SAMPSON,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I thought the honourable member was pointing out that there was the greatest danger after a general election?,59
501,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"A f t e r a general election Parliament cannot reasonably be called together in the first week in July, unless, of course, we are content to in clude senators who may have been defeated at the poll. If an election be held late in June, it may be some weeks before the final result is known, as on the last occasion, and the Government returned certainly require a few weeks in which to consider their position before meeting Parliament. It appears to me that the proposal to place on the Auditor General the responsibility for the purchase, custody, control, and issue of public stores is quite foreign to this Bill. Mr W. H . IBVINE - There is no such proposal.",59
502,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Sectio n 71 of the principal Act, which clause 31 of the Bill proposes to amend, gives the Governor General power to make regulations, and that is the Act which controls the Auditor-General, and with the assistance of which he, in turn, controls the accounts of the Departments. Mr W. H . IBVINE - That is right.",60
503,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Unde r section 71 of the principal Act the Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, for carrying out those provisions, and in particular for(a) the collection, receipt, custody, penditure, due accounting for care and management of all public moneys and the guidance of all persons concerned therein; (i) the more effectual record, examination, inspection, and audit of all receipts and expenditure, and the keeping of all necessary books and accounts; {c) prescribing the necessary forms for all books and documents whatever required under the provisions of this Act or the regulations; (d) requiring omcers, holding positions which in the opinion of the Treasurer ought to be guaranteed to contribute to the Guarantee Fund; (e) providing for the control and management of the Guarantee Fund. In my opinion it is dangerous to allow regulations to govern business of that description ; but, in any case, it is now proposed that the Auditor-General shall be empowered to make regulations governing the purchase, custody, control, and issue of public stores, which, I contend, cannot be considered relevant to an Audit Act. Personally, I am not at all opposed to some sort of tribunal to insure a more effective examination of tenders, and exercise control over the purchase of stores made by the Departments, because such a body would be particularly useful. In my opinion, however, this is the wrong Bill in which to provide for such a tribunal. It would be much more satisfactory to provide for this control in a separate Bill, which can be criticised here, and not leave it to regulations. I shall give a general support to the first part of this measure. I have no desire to impede its progress; but I must commend the points I have raised to the attention of the Treasurer.",60
504,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable member say that he will go so far as to support the first clause, which provides, "" This Act may be cited as the Audit Act 1913 ""I",60
505,Mr FRAZER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I should be sorry to commit myself to support anything with which the honourable member might be even conceivably associated.,60
506,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I desire to raise a point of order. It was the practice in the House of Commons, probably hundreds of years ago, to introduce Bills embodying possibly half-a-dozen subjects; but time and experience showed that it was desirable to confine a measure to one purpose only. One might have expected, with a Ministry consisting of five profesissue, exsional lawyers, and the balance bush lawyers",60
507,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I am waiting to hear the point of order.,60
508,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"My point is that the Treasurer got permission to introduce a Bill to amend the Audit Act; and an audit, as honourable members know, is something quite different from the regulation of the purchase, custody, control, and issue of stores. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, kuow that a clause is not in order which exceeds the order of leave, as I submit clause 3 of this Bill does. I direct your attention to May, eleventh edition, page 465, in which we are toldIn preparing Bills, care must be taken that they do not contain provisions which are not authorized by the order of leave, that the prefatory paragraph prefixed to a Bill , which defines the object thereof, known as the title of a Bill , corresponds with the order of leave, and that the Bill itself is prepared pursuant to the order of leave, and in proper for m ; for, if it should appear that these rules have not been observed, the House will order it to be withdrawn. I presume that honourable members are not going, for political purposes",60
509,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,This has surely nothing to do with the point of order.,60
510,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Perhaps it is beyond "" the order of leave."" Honourable members must see that the purchase, control, and issue of stores are things entirely different from those coming within the provisions of the Audit Act. The Standing Orders are quite clear on the subject.",60
511,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I think that the honourable member has stated his point of order.,61
512,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I should like to elaborate it.,61
513,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am in a position to give a ruling on the point. The Bill is one to amend the A u d it Act , and the clause to which the honourable member takes exception is a clause to amend a section of that Act . I can see nothing in the clause inconsistent with the Bill , nor anything in the amendment in consistent with the original Act. Mr W . H . IRVINE (Flinders-Attor ney-General) [9.38] - I wish to address myself shortly to the point raised by honourable members opposite, that the clause referred to is one that ought not to find a place in the Bill . The question is not whether it might not form part of another Bill , or form a Bill by itself, but whether it properly forms part of a B i ll to amend the A u d it Act. The scope of an auditor's duties is pretty well defined at law, and known to men of business. They involve not merely accountancy, but also the investigation of all the affairs and finances of the company, corporation, or government for which the audit is made. Auditin g in volves the examination of vouchers for all payments, the ascertaining of the existence of the property alleged to have been purchased with money spent, and other things. The duties of an auditor are stated clearly in the Encyclo-pcedia of the La vis of EnglandAn auditor may be described as a person whose duty it is to examine the accounts of a, company, firm, or person, so as to ascertain the exact state of affairs financially at a given moment. This involves, not only a scrutiny of the figures, but also an examination of the form and substance of the accounts, in order to see that they truly represent the state of affairs purporting to be represented by them. Although the duties of an auditor are not usually construed to extend to valuation, they include the ascertaining of the existence of the goods for the purchase of which money has been expended. A general supervision of stores, and the ascertaining where they are, what is left of them, what has been issued, and what has come in , fal l within the scope of an auditor's duties.",61
514,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"And depreciation? Mr W . H . IRVINE - On that considerable doubt has been expressed from time to time, but I think it is now the generally conceived opinion that an auditor's duties do not strictly cover valuation, unless there is depreciation such as must be patent to every ordinary man of business. It is not the duty of an auditor, in auditing the accounts of a company holding mortgages on properties extending over a wide area, to visit all those properties, to find out whether they are correctly valued.",61
515,Mr WEBSTER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"1 was thinkin g of the depreciation of stores. Mr W . H . IRVINE - If stores had been destroyed, it would come within the duty of an auditor to ascertain that fact. The auditor must be able to say that money supposed to be represented in goods is so represented; but it is not his duty to make valuations. Among the duties of an auditor is the ascertaining of the existence of, and the supervision of the dealing with , stores. The honourable member for Denison says that we wish to make the Auditor-General .an inspector of stores, but that is expressly provided for by the A u d it Act .",61
516,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Our objection is that the clause mixes up the purchasing of stores with the auditing of stores. Mr W . H . IRVINE - That is not so. Regulations imposing the conditions under which stores may be purchased, used, kept, and controlled are essentially within the purview of the matters over which the Auditor-General ought to have, and has expressly been given, jurisdiction. This is the title of the A u d it Act An Act to make provision for the collection and payment of public moneys, the Audit of Public Accounts, and the Protection and Recovery of Public Property, and for other purposes. The main duties of the Auditor-General are therein set out. He must see that moneys do not go out of the Consolidated Revenue until statutory proof has been brought before him that the authority of Parliament has been complied with ; but he has also to supervise the accounts and affairs of the Government. Under section 45 a number of express duties with regard to vouchers and stores are assigned to him. Among his duties are these: He shall, either by himself or such persons as he may appointAscertain the quantity, description, and price of all stores purchased on account of His Majesty, and of all stores supplied for the use of every Department of the Public Service, and whether any person in the Public Service has requisitioned for or obtained any stores in excess, of the reasonable requirements of his office. That provision relates to the general conditions for the purchase of stores.  purchase stores than I have. Mr W . H . IRVINE - I have not implied that he has the right to purchase stores. I am merely showing that the purchase, issue, and control of stores naturally come within an Act dealing generally with the duties of public accountants, and of the Auditor-General, who is given a particular kind of supervision over these things. Under paragraph e he mustexamine whether the proper quantities of all such stores are remaining in stock in the proper store or building. It is his duty, not merely to supervise and see that conditions imposed by law or regulation are complied with , but also to satisfy himself that stores representing the money that has been paid out are where they ought to be. The general conditions under which public stores may be kept and issued come within the scope of those matters over which the Auditor General is given supervision.",61
517,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Has Auditor-General that supervision at the present time? Mr W . H . IRVINE - Yes ; the powers are contained in the Act from which I am quoting. The first point that I want to make is that the general supervision of stores-no t as a purchaser, not as a M in isterial head-is under the auditorial supervision of the Auditor-General. The next point that has been made is that this measure, if carried, will give the Auditor General power to purchase, control, and issue stores. It will give him nothing of the kind .",62
518,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That has not been contended. The contention merely is that the Government are associating Auditor-General with men who are purchasing stores. Mr W . H*. IRVINE - That is not so, public money can be issued. as I shall show. I am now showing that this is not a regulation which will necessarily, or even probably, any additional powers to the Auditor General. What it will do has to be read in connection with the section to which it is an addition. That section is number 71. What does it provideThe Governor General may make regulations (not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act) for carrying out the provisions of this Act, and in particular, for(a) the collection, receipt, custody, issue, expenditure, due accounting for care and management of all public moneys, and the guidance of all persons concerned therein; (b) the more effectual record, examination, 4 inspection, and audit of all receipt* and expenditure, and the keeping of all necessary books and accounts; (c) prescribing the necessary forms for all' books and documents whatever required under the provisions of this. Act or the regulations; (d) requiring officers holding positions, whichs in the opinion of the Treasurer ought to be guaranteed, to contribute to theGuarantee Fund; (e) providing for the control and management of the Guarantee Fund. None of those duties, except indirectly,, imposes any powers whatever upon theAuditor-General, but some of them mayimpose conditions which he wil l have to see have been complied with before hecan say that a proper audit has been madeof the affairs of the Treasury officers, who are conducting the actual receipt and expenditure of money. It is only incidentally that they affect the Auditor-General.. not the They prescribe matters which the Auditor General will have to see have been complied .with. That is all. This Bill , then, merely imposes another condition. It is not an enabling measure. It does not enable the Auditor-General to do anything. It merely says that the Governor General may make regulations affecting the control and issue of public stores.",62
519,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Dictatin g to theAuditor-General. Mr W . H . IRVINE - D i c t at in g to him certain conditions which he must comply with .,62
520,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The principle is a bad one. Mr W . H . IRVINE - The House must judge of that. I am only explainthe ing what is being done. We have to read the A u d it Act generally. First, there are the provisions for the safety of the public, laying down conditions under which Over all those the Auditor-General is given control. He must find whether the money give has been properly appropriated by Parliament. Those are all provisions relating to his duties. They are ordinary conditions that have to be complied with , and i which he has to certify have been complied with. He has to see that particular moneys which have gone out of the Treasury have received the appropriation of Parliament. But the Governor General may make regulations imposing other conditions affecting the payment of money out of the Treasury, or the receipt of money. Under section 71, if the Governor General does make those regulations, the Auditor-General may have, and probably will have, other duties imposed upon him-namely , to see that these regulations have been complied with. But he is still in exactly the same position of complete independence as a high official charged with the duty of seeing whether the law has been complied with, and whether the money of the Government is intact in the shape of funds or stores. All that falls within his direct province.",62
521,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the gentleman let us know whether it will be possible, under this Bill , to appoint a Supply and Tender Board ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - I must express the best opinion I can. I am inclined to think that it would be possible. It is certainly the intention to do so.",63
522,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Does the honourable gentleman think it was fair not to so in form the House ? Mr W . H . IRVINE - If the honourable member is asking me a question affecting political ethics, I do not want to enter into it now. I am simply endeavouring to explain the legal position. I am inclined to think that there would, under this measure, be authority for the Governor General to issue a certain regulation under which a particular Board might be appointed. At all events, that is the intention of the Government.",63
523,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is candid. Mr W . H . IRVINE - It is the purpose of the Government to appoint a Tender Board.,63
524,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We have had to drag that out like drawing a tooth.,63
525,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Not at all. said the other night that that was the particular purpose.,63
526,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why .should the money. we get into a state of party excitement over a very small security which may required f,63
527,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,We do not object to that.,63
528,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"It is information which we could not get from the Prime M in ister. Mr W . H . IRVINE - What some honourable members opposite are apprehensive of does not exist at all. Assuming, as I do assume, that this Bill does give power to the Governor General to : appoint a Tender Board, that, again, is merely creating a further condition, namely, that the consent of that Tender Board shall be obtained for the purchase of all stores; and that is a condition' which the Auditor-General, in his capacity as Auditor-General, must see has been complied with before issuing his warrant.",63
529,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Does not the Attorney-General think that the Board should be responsible to a Minister?,63
530,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"In one sense it ought to he responsible to a Minister. Of course, it will be a departmental Board, and, personally, I think the Minister would rightly give such a Board as much honourable responsibility as possible:",63
531,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,If it were constituted under a separate Act it would possess greater independence. Mr W . H . IRVINE - Not in the slightest degree.,63
532,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,Unde r the Government proposal it will owe its existence to a regulation which the Minister may alter at any moment.,63
533,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,That is another matter.,63
534,Mr ROBERTS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,It is really the policy against which we are contending.,63
535,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"S e v e r a l honourable members have taken a good deal of exception to the appointment of this Board, because they apprehend that the< Auditor-General will be either the chairman of it or a member of it . Not only will that not be so, but it would be quite inconsistent with the position which he occupies under the Audit Act. TheAuditor-General is the person who has to see whether the conditions imposed by the Supply and Tender Board, as well as all I the other conditions under Statute or regulations, have been complied with, before he can certify to the expenditure of Consequently, it is highly undesirable that he should be connected be with the Board in any way. As a matter of fact, he will not be. Therefore, this provision is a purely restrictive one. Any regulation which may be passed w i l t - merely restrict the power of the Minister to purchase stores.",63
536,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Would it not better if these functions were discharged by an inspector-general of stores? "" Mr WH IRVINE - If we appointed an inspector-general of stores we should be creating a new office, the occupant of which would have to perform many of the functions which have to be performed",64

542,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What is there to be apprehensive about in this Bill? I is essentially a matter for regulation.,64
543,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,What was in the Attorney-General's mind as to the duties Bill. of a Tender Board?,64
544,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If the honour the able member asks me precisely, I should say that a Tender Board would be a small departmental Board, charged with the duty of investigating the prices of stores, and of learning what are most favourable conditions for their purchase. Can there be any practical objection to Â£.,.;ch a self-denying provision as that? No regulation can give the Treasurer more power than he has. I can only limit, his power.",64
545,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"That is all right, but the provision is contained in the wrong Bill.",64
546,Mr WH IRVINE,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have been endeavouring to show that this is an appropropriate Bill in which to incorporate that provision. In Victoria a similar provision is contained in the Public vice Act, but in New South Wales it finds House a place in the Audit Act. Personally, J think that the more appropriate place it is the Audit Act. Because regulations may impose other conditions which the said to-night be Auditor-General will ht.*e to take into consideration in determining whether the public accounts are properly kept, and the public stores are where they ought to be, it seems to me that the most convenient 1 place to insert such a provision is in this Bill.",64

561,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I said that Auditor-General says that his eight previous reports were presented to Parliament in time to be considered during the session. Mr TUDOR, - If the Auditor-General made that statement, let us look at the facts. We have had the same man in the position since the beginning of the Commonwealth. Por the six months ending 30th June, 1901, the report was presented on 26th May, 1903that is nearly two years after the accounts were closed. Por the year ending 30th Juue, 1902, the report was presented on 26th May, 1903. For the year ending 30th June, 1903, the report was presented on 3rd March, 1904.

Mr TUDuR - For the year 30th June, 1907, the report of the Auditor-General was presented December-the last day on which Parliament sat. Except in the first few years of the Federation, when the report was very late in being presented, it has been presented practically on the last day of a session, or tuereabouts. For the year ending 30th June, 1908, the report was presented on 10th December, 1908, the first Fisher Ministry having been in office for about three doubt, the accounts had been along, and anything that vious Treasurer could do, either facilitate them, or keep them back, had been done by him. When the present leader of the Opposition was Treasurer in 1908, the report was presented on the 10th December, that is, four days earlier than the present Treasurer presented his report in 1905. I have objected to these statements which have been made on public platforms for party purposes. the honourable meinber for Gippsland present to-night, I would deal with him on this measure, as he .has criticised the Auditor-General's report, but since he is absent, I will save my criticism for a Supply Bill or a grievance day. He objected to statements which have appeared in one journal called Week. I shall take the statements the Argus and the South Shire Record.",66

590,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I only want you to read that one paragraph.,66
591,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I was pleased to hear the Treasurer state that every audit has been correct, and that all moneys spent by the Fisher Government have been accounted for. I am absolutely in accord with this Bill , except the provision for the inclusion of a Supply and Tender Board, as I consider it out of its proper un- place in this Bill . I believe that the proposal to have the money available in July is a right one, and I approve of the amendment, which the Treasurer had apparently forgotten when he introduced the measure. This is a case of hasty legislation. H a d we passed the B i ll on Friday, when the Government were ending anxious that we should, the right honourable gentleman would have had to get it on 13th altered by his huge majority in the Senate. The whole seven of them would have had to get to work there. I am anxious that the B i ll should go from this Chamber complete.' But I do not think it is right to deal in an A u d it Bill with the creation of a Supply and Tender Board. That should be dealt with in a separate measure, so that people should not have to look up a number of regulaweeks. No tions which have to be altered from time sent to time. Honourable members on the other the pre- side have objected to government by to regulation. It is far better to deal with a question of this kind by a special Act than to leave it to be dealt with by regulations, because any Minister may amend the regulations a week after Parliament is out of session.",66
592,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"We can do it now without any regulations. Were Mr TUDOR - I know that, and that is why I am in favour of the establishment of a Supply and Tender Board, but I think it should be provided for in a special Bill .",66

The Prime Minister casts n reflection upon them when he says that the Auditor-General is unable to f u l f i duties owing to the neglect of some person. The system is responsible for the delay. The financial year closes on the SOth June, and the accounts have to come from, say, Western Australia, or southern Tasmania: or auditors have to be sent to those places. How is it possible for the Auditor-General's officers to audit the accounts more quickly than hitherto? The Departments have grown much within the last few years, owing to the fact that the late Government were a Government who did something, and, in doing that something, they created new work. I question very much whether the present Government will be able to furnish the accounts to the Auditor-General any earlier than did the previous Government. I do not think that the Honorary Minister would intentionally mislead this House; and, in my simplicity, I believe statements made from the other side.",68
624,Mr HIGGS,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The honourable member should wait u n t i l he knows the Honorary Minister better!,68
625,Mr LAIRD SMITH,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I have said that it was in my simplicity, as a young member of the House, that I took it for granted that neither the Honorary M in ister nor the Prime Minister would mislead honourable members. We were told that this was a simple little Bill ; and I had no intention to speak until I heard four honourable members on the Government side give four different interpretations of the measure. The only honourable gentleman opposite who, in my humble opinion, after my twenty-one years' the experience of the making out of requisitions for stores for a big Department, presented the Bill to us in a way that I could grasp was the Attorney-General; and I feel deeply grateful to him for the information he has imparted. I do not know that, after only three years' experience as a member here, I am quite at liberty to adversely criticise the Treasurer, with his many years of parliamentary life behind him,"" and his reputation as a financier; but I must say that, after having listened attentively ifco him when he introduced the Bill . I find the views I then formed as to the object of The the measure entirely changed by the explanation of the Attorney-General. I am in agreement with this Bill up to a certain point, because undoubtedly the A u d it A ct needs amendment; but I fail to see the propriety of imposing on the Auditor-General the duties of an inspecl his tor-general of stores. It is an unfortunate fact that there is a different system of storekeeping in each one of the States, and each Department has its own Stores Branch. The Post Office, the Department of Home Affairs, and the Defence Department, each has a Stores Branch, and the work in this connection must increase as the years go on. My idea is that we ought to have an expert inspector-general of stores, and that the machinery suggested by the Government will, if created, clog before long. An inspectorgeneral would bring about a uniform system throughout the Commonwealth, and this would be of great advantage. I question very much whether it could be ascertained now what stores there are in stock in any one of the Departments, and there is practically no expert supervision over their issue. If the electrical engineer in the Post Office desires stores, the storekeeper cannot Pay whether they are required or not, because he has practical knowledge of electrical engineerappear ing. At the present time, we have the Public Service Commissioner, with no responsibility, selecting and regulating the number of hands who shall be emhad ployed in the Post Office: and now i proposed to saddle the Auditor-General with the extra duty of a stores inspector. There is no doubt that if this Bill be passed as presented, the Auditor-General will have to create an expert branch order to carry out his new duties, because his Department is now admittedly overloaded with work: and this new branch will mean the appointment of a head and disclaimer. a number of officers. The staff of the Auditor-General's Department have had no practical experience of this kind, and cannot keep them in memory. to ask them to undertake expert duties snch as are proposed must prove to the disadvantage of the Commonwealth. am informed that a quantity of German party. insulated wire has been purchased by the Postal Department, although there is preference of about 15 per cent, in favour of British wire of superior quality. The reason given is that the British wire could not be obtained in Australia for work that was urgently required, and the Department had to accept the inferior article which was available. My opinion is that, if these new duties be object of discrediting opponents. imposed on the Auditor-General's partment, the purchase of stores will be still further delayed. The duties of an Auditor-General are to supercial year closed. vise the accounts, compel taking at least once a year, and tration see that the vouchers are all right. He should not be called on to do work altogether outside his proper duties. Who will be responsible to the Minister when stores are purchased ? Will the Auditorexpenditure to remedy that neglect. General be responsible? That would make him subordinate to the Minister, and he should be altogether free from political influence. But the chief officer of a Tender Board should be responsible to a Minister, so that the work of the that statement. Board might be discussed by Parliament. I have no desire to "" stone-wall "" or delay the passing of the Bill , bu t I hope the Prime Minister will see his way to later he had to go to England. agree to an adjournment of the debate.",68

I draw attention to the legal undertaken by the Attorney-General. endeavoured to explain what the duties of the Auditor-General were. He said it was the duty of that official, not only to review the accounts submitted to him, but to see that the stores and other assets were as reported by the officers in whose Departments they were. I asked the honourable gentleman whether depreciation was to be allowed for, and he said that the investigation did not include depreciation. I say unhesitatingly that in Departments such as the Defence ment and the Post and Telegraph ment, where material depreciates and becomes obsolete, if the Auditor-General makes a report without allowing for and estimating depreciation, his report must fail to convey an idea of the true position of affairs for the guidance of the Government and Parliament. Consequently, the Attorney-General's argument falls to the ground. What is the reason for the power to make regulations provided for in this Bill? Is it the outcome of a discovery that there has been no supervision in the past, no person responsible for the duties of purchasing and controlling public stores? Is it that the accounts of the Government of Australia have been so badly kept, and the provision for the custody and purchase of stores has been so ineffective, that Parliament asked to give the Government make these regulations? Personally, am very pleased to find that, at last, some one is going to be made responsible. In travelling through the country the Postal Commission, and in examining the stores of the various States, we found that the officers in charge could not furnish any reliable data as to the property in their custody, nor did their books indicate that they had any reliable accounts to serve as a guarantee to the public. Western Australia, through the lack of system which obtained, an oflicer accumulated copper wire belonging Department to such an extent at length he got suflicient to enable him to fence a selection with it. was not discovered until the Postal Commission investigated matters in that State. There was no system. How could there be a system ? The methods followed in every State varied. We find different degrees of unreliability Mr Webster. His gard to the keeping of public stores. Whilst the Public Service Commissioner exposition has the power of appointing officers to take He charge, and pays little regard to their adaptability, we shall not get that efficient administration which is required. Men are appointed to positions by a rule of seniority, not by a rule of fitness. If you have a man in charge of a store who understands proper methods of stocktaking and bpokkeeping, he may be removed to some other position, where he knows nothing about the duties, and another officer may be brought in to fill his - place who knows nothing about stores. There Departis a constant changing of men and Departputting them into positions for which they have no special fitness. While that system continues, you may give the Auditor-General any powers you like, but you will not obtain that completeness of supervision that is insisted upon by any decent private firm. No business man would take a competent ironmonger and put him into his accounts branch, or would take a good accountant and put him in charge of his ironmongery. Y e t that is what takes place in our Public Service today. We are constantly putting round pegs in square holes, and square pegs in round ones. While that system continues, it will be useless to give extra powers to the Auditor-General. There should be an accountant in each State, who should be made personally reis now sponsible to the Minister, and the power to Auditor-General should be the correcting I officer between the accountant and Parliament. Unless you have some such double check, you will obtain no satisfacwith tion. What is the position in regard to accountancy today? Le t the Postmaster General investigate the matter in his own Department.

Consequently, the relations between the Post Oflice and the Auditor General constitute one of the most striking illustrations of the defective system which next exists today. The Government do not appear to realise that any provision for the creation of a Supply and Tender Board should be contained in a special Bill .

But notwith the statement of the ex-Prime Minister and Treasurer, we find that the present Prime Minister, both in this and in the country, has been mak. ing statements which, in my judgment, cannot conduce to the advancement of the Tn speaking of the finances of the Commonwealth, we need be especially careful, otherwise we do great damage to our country's credit. Yet politicians have been going about country gasconading on this subject. Last session the Prime Minister complained that the Auditor-General's report had been presented to Parliament only in the dying hours of the session. No matter what Government has been in power, it seems to me that the Auditor General's report has always been presented during the closing weeks of the session. I recollect one year in which the Treasurer represented this country in Soutli Africa , and that may have caused some delay, and also in another year this Parliament did not meet until September, because the honourable member for Wide Bay and other members attended the Imperial Conference in London and arrived here late. The Prime Minister ought to realise when he is making these complaints-whethe r he is reading from a report of the Auditor-General or not-that he is throwing a certain amount of odium upon leading public servants of this country, especially tliose who are associated with the making up of our accounts. Last session, after the honourable gentleman had made complaints similar to those which he made here tonight, the ex-Prime Minister spoke as follows: The statement of the honourable member Parramatta is so far from what I sliould a judicial criticism regarding the presentation of the Auditor-General's report as to be of value whatever. To say that there is no control over the finances - because the Auditor-GeneI ral's report has only just been presented within measurable distance of fact or truth. The Auditor-General's report is in the hands honourable members, and the position of the Government can be tested, if not in this House, elsewhere.",71

652,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,The Prime Minister should withdraw the remark that my statement was not within measurable distance of fact or truth. It was most offensive.,72
653,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"If my remark was offensive to the honourable member, I withdraw it, and with all the more pleasure, because his objection indicates that he did not know what his language conveyed. Like other honourable members on this side, I was under the misapprehension that he had made the allegation that the Government had delayed the presentation of the Auditor General's report to prevent the Opposition from criticising. our financial administration, and had conveyed the suggestion that there is no control over the finances.",72
654,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,I did say that.,72
655,Mr FISHER,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Then my remark covers the honourable member's statement. Auditor-General acquits the Treasury of any intention to do other than facilitate the presentation of accounts. He says that the Treasury officials showed every desire to bring matters Mr Fenton. before him. If there is one thing that I should like more than another, it is the presentation to the public of the results of a full investigation of Commonwealth affairs since we took office, and such a statement will be presented to the public. That is a manly, truth f u l statement, which ought to iiave prevented honourable members when seeking election, or trying to secure the election of comrades, making many of these diatribes against the financial conduct of the Commonwealth. That is unpatriotic conduct, in my opinion. I am not here to defend the honourable member for Wide Bay. There is not the slightest doubt that had he been here to-night he would have ably refuted what the Jfrime Minister has said. I think it is about time that we laid aside the reports of the Auditor-General, and ceased to quote them ever and anon, in the hope that in throwing a lot of mud some of it may stick to a poltiical party. While 1 congratulate the Attorney-General upon the lucid exposition he gave of this Bill , for which we are very thankful, I do say that he has wrongly apprehended the duties of an auditor. 1 believe that I am a little at variance with some of my honourable friends on this side. 1 take it for that the duty of the Auditor-General is call to analyze the accounts and vouchers just as any auditor deals with the vouchers, no accounts, and balance-sheet of a company. hold in my hand a certificate as to is not what an auditor does under the Companies Act in Victoria. I take it that of the auditor to a public company or a big concern acts in relation to the company in the same way as the Auditoris General acts in relation to our great ComA n auditor's certincate in this State reads as follows: I report that I have examined the books and accounts of the . . . . company for the year ended 30th April, 1913, and that I have obtained from the officers of the company all the information and explanations I have required. In my opinion the accompanying balance-sheet is properly drawn up, and exhibits a true and correct view of the state of the company's affairs, according to the best of my information, and the explanations given to me, and as shown by the books of the company. If we saddle the Auditor-General with extra duties-the functions of inspectorgeneral of stores in the Commonwealthwe shall take him out of the position for clearly which he was appointed, and charge him The with certain duties which ought to be performed by an expert. What does the Auditor-General know about many of the stores received in the Post and Telegraph Department 1 It would be physicallyimpossible for him to. examine the stores at all.' Is any one prepared to tell me that the Auditor-General would be able to leave his office here, and go over to Western Australia to examine all the stores there, and afterwards in turn go to South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, and Queensland? Such a thing would be physically impossible. I trust that a vote will be taken which wil l confine the Auditor-General to his proper sphere, and so relieve him from the duties of comptroller or inspector of stores. It is quite likely that tomorrow I shall have some observations to make on the S ill in Committee. I trust that the Treasurer, as well as his colleagues and their supporters, will take kindly any hints that may come from this side. The complaint made by the Opposition in the last Parliament was that the Labour Government would never take any hints or suggestions from them, but I sincerely trust that any hints from the present Opposition regarding this measure will receive fair consideration. I hope that when the Bill is brought on for consideration in Committee, one of the first announcements made by the Treasurer will be that he intends'to relieve the Auditor-General of the duties of comptroller of stores. I am in favour of that portion cf the Bill which deals with the expenditure of money on the public services and other items, but I consider that the purchase of stores, and the consideration of tenders, are matters which ought to be dealt with in a separate measure.",72
656,Sir JOHN FORREST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Swan-Trea surer) [11.15] - I do not think that I shall be prepared to take the honourable member's advice and to alter the Bill in the way that he suggests. It seems.to me that if we did nothing, we should have no trouble; but that when we desire to do something that will be of advantage to the Parliament and the country, we are met with a host of objections. A good deal of care has already been exercised in connection with the purchase,-custody, and control of stores. The work has not been allowed to proceed in a haphazard way. We have used, up to the present time, the Tender Boards of the States with great advantage. Victoria has a very complete set of regulations with regard to the purchase, custody, and control of public stores, and, with the concurrence of the State Government, to whom we are much [44] obliged, we have availed ourselves of them. There has been, however, some want of organization on our own part, and we are now trying to perfect the system. Even at the present time it is open to us to make Treasury regulations dealing with the subject, but they would not have the force of law, and, perhaps, would not be as binding on the Auditor-General as regulations are. The reason for the insertion in this Bill of a clause giving the Governor General in Council power to make regulations for the purchase, custody, control, and issue of stores is that we desir9 that regulations having the force of law, instead of Treasury instructions, - shall be framed. I am quite surprised that any exception should have been taken to this Bill . The first part merely makes provision for a convenient arrangement. It will be, no doubt, of assistance to the Government and to their successors. It is a machinery provision, which has been much talked of, and which, it was thought, would readily meet with the concurrence of the House. The only object that we have in view in connection with the second part of the Bill is to try to afford greater security than at present exists. The objection that has been taken that clause 3 is in the wrong place-that such a provision should not be in an A u d it Bill-ha s been shown by the Attorney General to be without foundation. In every State, I think, the purchase, control, and custody of stores is provided for by regulations made by virtue of a section in the A u d it or some other Act. It is not covered by a separate Statute. Nothing but good can result from this proposal. We are not seeking under it to make our path easier. We are really imposing morerestrictions upon .the expenditure of public money, and taking upon ourselves, as administrators, more burdens. Honourable members opposite have been good enough to approve of the principles of the Bill ; but they seem to disapprove of the form it takes. The speeches made to-night should rightly have been made, I think, in Committee, for they have not dealt with the principles of the Bill .",73

What does it provide 1 In the first place, we propose to allow payments to be made during July of each year; and, in the second place, to take power to make regulations to control the purchase, custody, control, and issue of stores. The Departments have been purchasing stores ever since the inception 'of Federation, but because we seek, under this Bill, to improve the control, placing npon ourselves more burdens as administrators, numerous objections have been raised. If the Opposition do not want the stores of the couutry to be controlled, let them say so. No one would suggest that we should introduce a Bill of a hundred clauses, embodying all that is usually provided for by regulation. Honourable members will find a hundred clauses in regulations of the States governing the custody, control, purchase, and issue of stores. What chance would we have of passing a Bill of so many clauses if we had a repetition of the prolonged debate to which we have listened today ?
