75,Mr BRUCE,IS PAYMENTS TO PUBLICSERVANT S,"The statement was made in the House last n i g h t by the honourable member for G w y d i r (Mr C u n n in g h a m ) , in the debate on the m o t i o n of censure, that r u m o u r s were c u r r e n t that a m a n h o l d in g a h i g h official position h a d recently received a present from persons interested from in the negotiations regarding the wool manufac- growers' claims, and suggestions were made that the inatter was one that called for investigation by the C r o w n Prosec u to r. This is a matter w l i i c h concerns the honour of the P u b l i c Service, and I take the first o p p o r t u n it y of in for m in g the House of the facts. It is to be regretted that currency should be 'given bo r u m o u r s w h i c h deal with matters as to w h i c h full in for m at i o n is published in the Commonwealth Gazette. At the incept i o n of the wool scheme a very heavy burden of w o r k in connection with it s constitution and its regulations was t h r o w n on the senior officers of the At to r ney-General's D e p a r t m e n t , for w h i c h the Central W o o l Committee , w h i c h h a d received the benefit of the services, wished to make those officers some recompense.. Through the Government of the day these proposals were submitted for the approval of the Governor General in Council, who authorized the payment of honoraria to certain officers. The notification of the Governor General's consent was published in the Ccriiimcrii/wcaUh Gazette of the 19th February, 1920. As will be seen from the Gazette, the honoraria referred to were as follows:-Si r Robert Garran, Solicitor-General and Secretary, Attorney-General's Department, £ 4 0 0 ; G. S. Knowles, Esq., Chief Clerk, £ 2 5 0 ; W . H . Sharwood, Esq., Chief Clerk, Crown Solicitor's Office, £ 3 5 0 . It will nized, therefore, that these amounts were paid and received with the full sanction of the Executive Government; and there is ' not the slightest' justification for any reflection on the officers concerned. As regards the introduction of the matter into the recent debate, it is worthwhile calling attention to the fact that the 'whole transaction was not only long prior to the matters in issue in that debate, but actually p r i o r to the agreement of March, 1920, out of which those matters arose.

Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended. Resolution adopted. Ordered That Dr Earle Page and Mr Bruce do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoiug resolution. Bill presented by Dr EARLE PAGE, aud read a first time. (SECOND READING.",25
77,Dr EARLE PAGE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"Cowper-Trea surer) [11.43] - I move That the Bill be now read a second time. Last night the honourable member for CBE. Melbourne (Dr Maloney) complained that the services of Mr K i ng O'Malley in connection with the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank had never been properly recogn ized or recorded. I should like to endorse that, for, ever since the inception of Federation, the honourable gentleman named has urged the establishment . of a national bank. When the question of a Commonwealth Bank was first mooted, it was generally expected that a truly national bank woiuct be established- a bank of deposit, issue, discount, exchange and reserve. When the Bill was introduced, however, expectations were not realized, and when the bank began to function, it became perfectly clear that a national bank had not been established, but merely a Governmental institution in competition with the private banks. The Bill the Government PAPERS. now brings forward isdesigned to carry were pre- out the original expectation. As has been generally anticipated, the Government proposes to substitute the management of pura Board for one-man control, but the Bill will do much more than that. It will place the note issue under the control of the General Board of the Bank, and aims at making the Commonwealth Bank the keystone of the financial arch of Australia.. The need for a central bank was sufficiently clear before the war, and sity has been emphasized by Avar experience. The disorganization of the world's finances brought about by the war should warn us of the jjrave dangers resulting from faulty management. The automatic check of gold paynients which was the prop to the pre-war financial systems having been removed, the way was clear for all kinds of interference with sound practice. The world was now subject to conditions of - which the .existing generation had no experience, and even the teachings of the past were found difficult of application, because there never had been an upheaval of such magnitude and complication before. The finances of every country in the world have been disarranged, some of them hopelessly so, and though Australia has been spared the extreme difficulties of many other countries, we, too, have experienced periods of monetary stress. In 1920, money within Australia was not tight, but Australians had large commitments to meet in Britain. They found, not merely that an excessive rate had to be paid to remit money to that country, but also that, in many cases, it was impossible to effect any remittance at all. That was serious, because there were a very great number of old commitments which simply could not be met, and doubts arose in Britain, as to the financial position of many well-established and prosperous Australian businesses. In 1922, the exchange position entirely reversed, and for many months past it has been impossible to transfer to Australia either all the moneys realized by the sale of Australian products overseas, or the moneys which are being raised abroad for Australian development. 'Not only has the exchange difficulty become acute, but money is so tight that it is liilrd to get advances from the banks for most desirable purposes. Even moneys in the hands of private persons are not available for ordinary investments to the same extent as usual, because the State Governments have been forced to borrow on the Australian market for necessary developmental purposes, instead of going on the London market, as they would have doneunder normal conditions. Incidentally there has been a great increase in the rate of interest payable its neces- for Government loans. In troubles such' as these, one would naturally look to banking authorities to find a way out or at least to advise as to the remedies to be applied. But in fact there is no banking body which can be considered representative. Instead, we have n number of banks which, though loosely associated for some purposes, scarcely can express a corporate opinion. Chiefly mindful of their OAvn interests, which is but natural, they can have no such regard for the public welfare as is undoubtedly required. It must not be understood that I think Australian banks inefficient. On the contrary, as individual banks, acting without the guidance and assistance of a central bank, they have done well. During the war, both individually and collectively, they greatly assisted public finance. It ought to be put on record, too, that in the crisis of 1920, when credit facilities in Britain were very difficult to obtain, and remittances were nearly impossible, the restrictive action taken by the banks to prevent the placing of additional orders for goods overseas served a most useful purpose. The conditions under which they work, however, are not suitable for' full control. Their individual outlook and interests render them unsuitable for the exercise of that prevision which is absolutely necessary for the construction of a sound public policy and its wise application during a long period. Banking policy, aimed at the maintenance of the interests of the community often requires sacrifice df, or abstention from profit, and Avithout any reflection upon individual banks, I submit it is too much to ask that the ordinary banker shall exercise the self-denial AA'hich is involved. The important functions of banking can properly be performed only Will the guidance and control of a central bank. Decision and settled policy are essential. Divided counsel and clashing interests of individual bankers must in the end be fatal to good credit management, and banking oan be raised to its greatest perfection only by the action of a central bank working always for the good of all. This is obvious. So much so, that central banking is recognised as a necessity by the leading nations. The excellent banking material which we have already should be strengthened and co-ordinated in order that Australia shall have a symmetrical and well balanced system of central banking. To this end, the Government proposes that the Commonwealth Bank of Australia shall become the pivot of Australian banking- a bank of issue, deposit, discount, exchange, and - reserve - amounted In view of the importance of the issues involved, and the relevance of our past actions to our present difficulties, it will be convenient to honourable members if I givrj some details regarding banking practice in Australia, including a brief history of the Commonwealth Bank, and ihow what has been done with our paper currency. Then I will deal with proposals made for over-coming our currency and exchange difficulties. Also I shall sot out some paniculnrs of central banking in other countrieo, and, finally, from the general survr.y made, shall demonstrate thu advisability of the proposals which the Government now submits to the House. Australian business is carried on by» fourteen principal banks, which have a paid-up capital of £29,000,000. In addition, they have reserved profits of £26,000,000, or a total of £55,000,000. Nine of the banks are registered under the State laws relating to limited liability companies, three have been incorporated by special Acts of the State Legislatures, one has been incorporated by Royal Charter, and one (the Commonwealth Ban];' of Australia) is the creation of an Act of this Parliament. The keeping of an adequate reserve of legal tender against liabilities is of the greatest importance, and it is interesting to note the experience of Australian banks in this regard. Por the purpose I shall use figures relating to the June quarter of years which may be regarded as typical. My starting point will be 1886; then 1SSS, which was the year of culmination of the land boom; then 1892, the year before the banking crisis; 1894, the year after that crisis; 1901, Avhen the Commonwealth was establislied; 1913 and Dr Earle Page. 1914, before the war had disarranged our banking business; 1915, the first full year of war; and the years subsequent to the Armistice. > The figures relate to assets and liabilities in Australia, excluding particulars of the business of the banks outside Australia. The term liabilities is to be understood as meaning all the Australian liabilities, as included in the sworn quarterly averages, after deducting the sums due by the banks to each other. The legal tender holdings of the banks to the following percentages of their liabilities: In 1886 ... 15.1 per cent. In 1888 ... i7.7 ,. ,, In 1892 ... 17.2 „ ,, In 1894 ... 23 „ ,, In 1901 ... 20.7 ., „ "" In 1913 ... 24.2 '., ,, In 1914 ... 25.5 „ ,, In 1915 ... 32.5 ., „ In 1919 ... 24.7 ,, ,, In 1920 22.3 ., ., In 1921 ... 22.4 ,, ., In 1922 ... 20.5 „ ,, In 1923 ... 18.5 ,, „ A comparison of legal tender with total liabilities, however, is not altogether satisfactory, because the nature of the liabilities is an important consideration. The published figures do not divide legal tender holdings into so much for current accounts aud so much for fixed deposits. We may, however, compare the total holdings of legal tender with liabilities not bearing interest. We find the percentages of total legal tender as compared with liabilities not bearing interest have been:- In 1886 ... 46.2 per cent In 1888 ... 48.4 > > y» In 1892 ... 61.1 j » In 1894 ... 81.9 ) ' In 1901 ... 45.6 J) In 1913 ... 56.8 In 1914 ... 55.8 > > J J In 1915 ... 70 ») In 1919 ... 47.2 ) J i j In 1920 ... 40.7 1 S J t In 192*1 ... 43.4 J 1 i 9 In 1922 ... 40.S ) ] »> In 1923 ... 3*8.7 3) 3» A notable feature of the foregoing tables i*3 that, since the first year of war, there has been a steady, decrease in the percentage of legal tender held against liabilities. Though the percentages of. cash resources really have been reduced, the diminution is not so great as.would appear from the published figures, which I have just quoted. The explanation, is that the Government adopted the practice, in connection with' war finance, of giving to the banks lights to demand notes, in consideration of facilities granted by the banks. These rights were equivalent to reserves of notes actually held and have been used by the banks as such for the purpose of building credit. The amount of currency thus at the command of the banks is not disclosed in the published statements. I have not any figures representing these rights of the banks for the years 1915 to 1922, but I shall show later that, on the 30th June, 1923, the legal tender holdings and the value of the rights amounted, together, to 21.4 per cent, of the total liabilities. These rights it is now necessary to. explain, and, as the subject is interwoven' with that of the increase in the paper money of the Commonwealth, the explanation must include a short history of the issue of Australian notes. A tax of 10 per cent, per annum was imposed in 1910, upon all bank notes in circulation. The tax has always been prohibitory, as was intended. In the same year, the banks were forbidden by law to circulate auy paper currency issued by a State, and thus the issue of Treasury notes in Queensland also came to an end. In place of the bank notes and the State paper, the Commonwealth issued Australian notes, and ever since that was done there has. been no other paper currency in Australia. To get the new notes which were needed lent sums in. notes. for banking business, the banks necesquite sarily had to present sovereigns at the Treasury, and, in that way, a gold serve was established. The law required that the gold coin sliould amount to less than a fourth of the issue, and there was added a provision, since repealed, that gold coin, pound for pound, had to be held in respect of notes issued i cess of £7,000,000. The circulation almost immediately sprang to more than seven millions, and the Government was in a position to invest a sum money equal to three-fourths of seven lions. It at once proceeded to some investments. Newly-printed notes were paid into the banks. Out of the current accounts established by that means, the cost of Commonwealth public works was met, and moneys were lent to the State Governments also for works. In respect of the moneys used for public works, formal public debt securities were issued by the Commonwealth and the States, and placed among the assets of the Notes Fund. On the 30th June, 1914, the accounts stood as follows: Circulation ... £9,611,551 Profits ... 495,650 Total £10,107,201 These moneys had been disposed of in the following way: In exchange for gold coin ... £4,144,581 In jrarchase of Commonwealth securities, bearing interest at 3£ per cent. ... 3,076,000 In purchase of State securities, bearing interest at 3^ and 3 f per cent. 2,634,000 ""Balance in banks ... 252,620 Total £10,107,201 The pre-war issue of £9,600,000 seems almost insignificant, when compared with the present circulation of about £57,000,000. It must be remembered, however, that in 1914 the people carried gold as well as paper in their pockets, that large sums formerly held by. the banks in gold are now held»in notes, and that' there is now no gold outside of' the banks. A reliable estimate of the amount of gold coin in use before the war has not been made. Immediately upon the outbreak of war, the banks brought large sums of gold to the Treasury to be exchanged for equivaTheir action was voluntary, and the result of a natural desire to stock their numerous rebranches with the more convenient paper money. Thus began a strengthening of not the gold reserves of the Treasury. Not only was money urgently needed for expenses of war, but also funds had now to be found to continue public works n exin progress. Borrowing in Australia to any considerable extent, seemed impracticable. Therefore, plans vvere formed for meeting the expenses of war, at least of for a time, by increasing the issue of milpaper money, and for meeting the cost of make public works by borrowing in London. Later it wa3 found, however, that money could not be obtained in England for any purpose other than the prosecution of the war. Plans were then changed, and the expenses of the war during a considerable period were paid out of loans granted to the Commonwealth by Great Britain , while the note issue was increased by the amount - of £18,000,000, which was lent to the States for public works. This great addition to the note issue .could not have been faced without a breach of the Australian Notes Act, which requires a gold backing of at least 25 per cent., had arrangements not been made to place more gold in the Treasury strong-room. The necessary addition to the metallic reserve was obtained by inducing the banks to send 10,000,000 sovereigns to the Treasury and to take, in exchange, paper money of equivalent amount. Thus a total of £28,000,000 was paid in notes into the Banks, and out of the banks came £10,000,000 in gold coin. These arrangements would have been futilfe to maintain the legal reserve of gold if restrictions had not been placed upon the use of gold. Therefore, export of gold was forbidden, except by consent. of the Treasurer, .and the banks promised they would not, during the war, present notes at the Treasury for the purpose of getting gold. In these circumstances, the banks ceased to cash cheques in gold. They used paper money in stead, and gold no longer was carried by the general public. Thus large numbers of the additional notes paid in to ' the banks, for the purposes already explained, found their way into the pockets of the people, and did not remain in the cash reseiwes of the banks. At various later dates, further notes moneys were ""lent to the States for woTks, and the amount now due by the States on that account is £22,138,000. Por a short period, the States were given the right to get advances of notes on depositing 25 sovereigns in respect of every £100 of notes. On three-fourths of the amount of notes, the States were charged interest at 4 per cent. right was exercised to a comparatively small extent, the amount on which the States paid interest not exceeding £486,750 at any time, and the whole of the amount was repaid in 1915. At this early stage of war finance, a step was taken which never has been explained fully. I refer to the fact that the Government gave to the banks the right to get three pounds in notes for every sovereign presented by the banks at 'the Treasury. Two out of every three Dr. Earle Page. pounds of notes so issued were treated as a loan to the banks, which were required to pay interest at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum, and to repay the principal not later than twelve months after the end of the war. The reasons for granting these rights to the banks are not recorded, and no good purpose' would now be served by surmising what the reasons were. ""Without beiug unduly critical of action taken during a period of great anxiety, however, I am permitted to say that this three to one arrangement was more doubtful in character than any other act of war finance. The grant by banks of accommodation by way. of overdraft or otherwise makes money available for credit to current accounts and fixed deposits in banks. That is to say, increase of advances entails increase of liabilities. Banks usually keep on lending monej until their liabilities are four or fivo times as much as their cash reserves, but here we see that the banks were given the power, first to multiply their gold reserves by three, and then to keep on lending until the multiplied reserves formed the base of liabilities equal to twelve of fifteen times as much as the original holdings of gold. To the lasting credit of the banks, I am glad to add, however, that they used their power sparingly-so much so, that the loans made to them in accordance with this arrangement never reached as much as £2,000,000. _ Very early in the war period, also, tha practice of issuing sovereigns from the Mints to the persons who had deposited the raw gold was discontinued. Thereafter, the Mints paid for raw gold out of credits established by the issue of notes, and the sovereigns, as soon as coined, were transferred to the Australian Notes Reserve. By the several processes indicated, large stocks of gold were accumulated by the Commonwealth Treasury, but these were The not considered sufficient for making gold payments rendered necessary try the war. The banks were, therefore, induced to part with a further 5,000,000 sovereigns for the purpose of export. In exchange, they were given notes of equal amount, and, in addition, were conceded the right to get loans in notes, up to the amount of gold parted with, provided they deposited war bonds as security. The in terest payable by the 'banks for these loans was at the rate of 41 per c&nt. per annum. The time soon came when the primary products of Australia could not be disposed of readily, and it was necessary to make advances to the producers in anticipation of realization. The banks undertook to make the advances, and were given rights to get paper money by way of loans from the Treasury, up to the amounts of the advances, at the rate of 4 per cent. Similarly, at later dates, arrangements were made separately for advances in relation to wool and wheat, and the interest payable by the banks on the loans of notes varied from 4 to 5$ per cent, per' annum.. The assistance of the banks, according to a new plan, was invoked in connection with the Sixth War Loan. The banks, to enable tlieir customers to subscribe to the war loan, agreed to offer overdrafts up to 90 per cent, of the subscriptions, the rate of interest on the overdrafts to be 4 per cent, per annum. As the war loan carried interest at 4^ or 5 per cent., the acceptance of the overdraft proposal was attractive, and the war loan proved most successful. On its part the Treasury undertook to make to any bank a loan of notes, if needed; up to the-.amount of overdrafts granted to customers and still outstanding. The interest to be paid by the bank for these loans was fixed at 3 per cent. Any bank making a direct investment in the war loan also acquired the right to notes up to the amount of its subscription, the rate of interest to be paid for this accommodation being the same as that payable on the war loan. Similar arrangements, but with different rates of interest, applied to the four subsequent War and Peace Loans raised in Australia. This system of assisted subscriptions was last operated in September, 1920, and the Commonwealth Conversion Loans of 1923 and 1924 - were placed without giving to the banks any rights to get advances. As is within the recollection of all, the Commonwealth Parliament in granted war gratuities. The huge sum required was not immediately available. .Bonds were issued in the majority of cases, payable in the present year, but cash was needed for. immediate payment to widows and to other classes of grantees. The banks agreed to lend £6,000,000 for the purpose, at 5£ per <cent. per annum, and they were given the right to get notes on demand, at 5-\ par cent., up to the. full amount lent. The peak issue of £59,676,000 was. reached on 30th October, 1918. At the present time the total issue is £56,900,000. Here it may be noted that the Bank of England notes and the English Treasury notes amounted to £512,000,000 in December, 1920, and to £437,000,000 i u A p r i l , 1924. The flotation of big war loans in Australia, as in other countries, was rendered possible by the continual inflation of our Note Issue from £9,600,000 to £59,000,000. W it h inflation, price levels rose, as was to be expected, from 100, in 1913, to 247, in 1920. Inflation was spasmodic without any definite plan, simply being prompted by the exigencies of the moment. The question facing Australia today is how to rehabilitate the national finances with the least dislocation of trade and employment. A central system of banking which insures the continuous association of currency control with the banking position must undoubtedly prove of great assistance tc that end. In December, 1920, a first step towards a central banking system for Australia was made by handing over the control od' the issue of Australian Notes to a new Department of the Commonwealth Bank, for which a separate Board of Directors was provided. These Directors are usually known as the Notes Board. They were appointed for terms of years and are. quite independent of Government control. A new provision was now enacted giving power to invest note moneys in trade bills with a currency of not more than 120 days. This provision contains the genn of a rediscounting authority, which is the essential function of a central bank. The failure to associate the Notes Board with the direct-management of the Bank, however, has hitherto prevented the exercise of the function. The Government proposes to correct this weakness by placing the control of 1920 the Note Issue in the hands of the general Board of the Bank, thus directly associating currency and banking. Since the Notes Board has been in charge of the issue, many of the rights of the banks to get advances of notes have expired, because the circumstances in which they were entitled to .the advances have ceased to exist. The Notes - Board, however, has not only shown itself opposed to the grant of new rights, but has withdrawn privileges under this three . to one arrangement, which some of the banks still contend they are entitled to. Quite recently the Board terminated the rights under the war gratuity arrangements, by actually issuing the notes which the banks coiild demand. The Board was convinced that 'the banks had built credits on their rights to get notes, just as freely as-they would have done if the notes actually had been in their own possession, and that the issue in these circumstances did not constitute an act of inflation. ""Unpublished reserves of the nature indicated are certainly not in the best interests of the community. From a return, recently supplied by the banks, it appears' that the rights to get additional notes are now limited to a total of £3,119,000, being the' amount they arc entitled to in respect of war bonds acquired by direct investment. At 30th June last, the banks had the right to get notes from the Note Issue Department up to about £8,000,000. If we add that sum to the actual holdings of legal tender, we find that the cash re-, sources were 21.4 per cent, of the total liabilities,, instead of 18.5 .per cent., as indicated by the published figures. The 1923 figure of 21.4 per cent., as corrected, may be compared with the legal tender of 25.5 per cent, held in 1914. The - changing attitude of the banks with regard to the percentages of cash which they consider desirable in relation to their liabilities is evidenced by their holding 22.4 per cent, of cash in 1921, 20.5 per cent, in 1922, and only 18.5 per cent, in 1923. These percentages represent the actual holdings and have not been corrected so as to include the rights to get notes from the Note Issue Department. As those rights did not increase in that period, but somewhat diminished, the uncorrected figures may without unfairness be compared with each other. A study of the figures shows that the views of the various banks differ widely as to the percentages thought safe. doubt reasons can be given for their differing views, also for the reduction of the aggregate percentages, and it should be pointed out that Australian practice during the last 30 years has leaned towards caution, but the mark""-1 changes .which have occurred suggest that, there is need for a settled policy in re- . gard to holdings of cash. A very greatpower is exercised by banks in the creation of credit, in their control over busier. Earle Page. ness, and in the effect of their policy upon wages, as well as upon other conditions. Changes in banking policy disturb the whole community and, under the divided control of banking which exists now, changes may be made which are not in the best interests of the community. The remedy is to be found in the co-ordination of banking effort by means of a central bank. We may now turn to questions as to the amount of currency which is necessary for Australian trade and development. Some persons hold that ciirrency should be supplied in unlimited quantities as long as it is desired for the "" legitimate requirements of trade."" These overlook the fact that one essential of a currency system is limitation of quantity. An increase of currency not redeemable in gold permits an increase of bank credits up to, say, four or five times the amount of the additional currency; and, unless production has meantime increased to a corresponding extent, the result is an in crease of prices in terms of that currency. The result of such increase in prices is that more currency is required to carry on the same-business, and there is at once, a call for further issues of currency still honestly stated to be for "" legitimate requirements."" Further issues lead to higher prices and further demands. It soon appears that the "" requirements of trade "" are infinite, and to regard this factor as the sole index in regulating currency means entering into, a "" vicious circle."" All countries have at some period in their history had experience pf this sort; the assignats of France and the greenbacks of America have been the classic examples, and recently we have had the example of Russia and Germany. In all these cases the experience was that, even after over-issue had reduced the currency unit to a minute fraction of its original value, the call was for more curNo rency for the requirements of trade. So far the inflation disease has infected us in Australia but slightly. The value banking of our pound in gold is ascertainable by reference to the amounts received by the Australian Gold Producers Association on the sale of sovereigns which they export from time to time* Recent sales show that a sovereign in the world's markets is worth roughly one-ninth more than our paper, pound. Compared with the depreciation in most European countries, the depreciation of our paper currency is slight. Still, *it is unsatisfactory that any depreciation at all should exist; and the danger of further depreciation not only exists, but is not so slight as some think. As many have expressed the view that notes should be issued in connection with the present position of oversea exchange, and, as I propose to demonstrate the importance of the Government's present proposal with regard both to the value of our pound, as. compared with the English pound, and to the difference between the buying and selling rates of exchange, it will be worthwhile to deal with the question of exchange in general. Exchange phenomena follow the operation of the universal laws of supply and demand. ""No miracles can bo expected from Government intervention, either by the issue of notes or in any other way, and stabilization of exchanges generally may not occur until the restoration of the gold standard has been brought about, but a central bank in Australia will help to provide the machinery for an exchange which will modify the two difficulties to which I have just referred. When both the buyer and the seller of goods or services are in one country, no difficulty usually arises in providing for payment, because every modern community has some form of legal-tendei money. Where the buyer is in one country, however, and the seller is in another, payment must be made by a process which, stripped of detail, means simply that goods or services supplied by a seller in one country to a buyer in another are paid for by other goods or services passing between the countries in the reverse direction. Thus, in the long run, the imports and the exports of a country must be of equal value. Wit of man has never yet devised any other method for the settlement of moneys owing to, and moneys owing by, the people of any country To have a proper understanding of exchange, we must know what imports and nxports consist of. They - are of two classes-visibl e and invisible. I shall not dwell upon the nature of visible imports and exports, because the words are self-explanatory, covering all kinds of things which have physical existence, invisible exports include loans raised abroad by the Government or the private people of the country. Such loans are deemed to be "" exports,"" because, like visible exports from the borrowing country, they, make moneys available, in the lending country, to the exchange dealers. What is an invisible export in one country is, of course, an invisible import in the other. Some other invisible exports and imports are earnings of ships, premiums on marine insurance, interest on loans, bankers' commissions, and expenditure of tourists. Some countries, such as' Italy, greatly gain by the expenditure of visitors, but a very large amount of money is spent by Australians abroad, and the cost of very long sea passages represents an immense sum, which, though often paid here, is ultimately transferred to other countries. Sir Charles Addis, at the Imperial Economic Conference, said that differences made by the banks between the buying and selling rates of exchange had been considered by the Committee of which he was chairman, and the Committee had taken an opportunity of discussing the inatter with the managers of the banks concerned, who explained that the charges included various services. There was, for example, the action taken by the banks to prevent undue fluctuations in exchange caused by differences in seasonal demands; the expense incurred by the accumulation of bank balances, alternately at Home and alternately in the Dominions, arising out of these seasonal demands; and the advantages given to the merchant in enabling him, through the relative stability of exchange, to enter more fully than he otherwise could have done, into contracts for forward delivery. An alteration, in cost of exchange, in favour of the importer may be prevented, in whole or in part, by a reduction in the amount of Government borrowing abroad, if such borrowing has been going on; also, that alteration may be prevented if a loan is raised in the country and used for redeeming Government debt abroad. Action by the Government in one or both of these directions, however, may not be practicable. Because Australian experts, visible and invisible, have been in excess, the Australian' hanks .have accumulated in London much more money than they - need there,, and, consequently, exchange rates are favourable to the importer and unment favourable to the exporter. Money i don can be transferred to Australia only at considerable cost, and that has induced Governments and others locally to borrow moneys which might have been obtained and, in London. Both because so much of the assets of the banks are in London and cause Governments are forced to borrow conditions, in Australia, money here is very tight. We may now turn to the remedies which hive been proposed. First, it has suggested that there should be a cessation of loans abroad, except for renewal and conversion purposes; also, that there should be an adjustment of credits due Australia in London by the liquidation of ranged. Government securities there, in lieu of importing goods. I do not think the time has arrived when this young country can depend on local loans for its development. We are only a handful of people, and we have a continent to develop. Our savings are small in comparison with the great work to be done, and development would while be carried on at a painful pace if it pended only on our own additions to wealth. As to the suggestion that existwhich ing London credits should be adjusted by the liquidation of Government debts there, it is necessary to point out that the at credit in London is private money, and its owners are not willin g to hand it to the Government as an investment. deed, in view of the peremptory demands of current business, they cannot afford do so. The only alternative would lie the raising of a loan in Australia, giving the proceeds to the banks here in exchange for their London money, and then redeemin ing Australian Government securities by purchase in the London market. alternative, too, is impracticable, because already public borrowing in Australia proceeded rather too far, and great diffiBoard culty is being experienced in finding money here even for necessary developsaid, ment. Any attempt to carry out these suggestions would raise interest in Australia a prohibitive rate, stagnation would be apparent ' everywhere, and the remedy perial would be worse than the disease The Government recognizes, that both internal and external borrowing should be arranged as judiciously as posaccumulate sible, keeping in view the interests of OUT - ixport business and the need for dcvelopsterling, Dr Earle Page. of our industries. The establishn Lonment of a central bank on the lines proposed will place independent expert advice at the disposal of .the various Governments, and will assist in harmonizing, if necessary, in curtailing their loan operations. The Board, owing to its in t i bemate knowledge of exchange and of local will be in the best possible position to advise as to rates of interest, amounts to be raised, place of raising, and been other terms of loans. Thus diversion of an undue amount of local money from industrial enterprises to Government loans may be avoided, and economic borrowing to for public purposes satisfactorily arI t has been proposed that the difficulties bo met by issuing notes for the purchase of the current production of our gold mines. Those who have put forward this proposal seem to think that it does not matter how much in notes is issued, so long as gold is held. The reply is that, gold is out of action, as it is at predesent, it can have no effect whatever in restraining any increase of price-levels would result from watered currency or over-issue. Of course, if additional notes were issued in exchange for money gold, and the amount happened to coincide with that which was required to meet over natural increase of production, there In - would be no inflation. The next proposal to be noticed is that to notes should be issued to the banks in in Australia by the ""Notes Board, and that the Board should take from the banks, in exchange, an equivalent amount of credit London. ""Now, this proposal is usually put forward in Australia in a somewhat This loose manner. For example, we are not told how long the ""Notes Board is to hold has its credit, and whether or not the Notes is to take the initiative in the disposal of its London money. ""No one has even, how much is to be dealt with in this way. I shall assume, however, that the sugto gestions made in Australia are identical with the resolutions passed by the I m Economic Conference, which - decided that the difficulties of exhowever, change could be ameliorated if the note-issuing authorities were to sterling assets and to undertake to exchange their local currency for and vice versa-. This measure, it was added, might he further'developed and assisted by the creation of a central bank. The Government concurs in that finding of the Imperial Economic Conference There is no reason why the resources of the new Commonwealth Bank should not be distributed between London and Australia, and be put to active service to assist the general financial position, instead of lying dead, which is the present condition of a large portion of the resources of the ""Notes Board. Thus,, the Commonwealth Bank would be in a position to conform fully to the resolution of the Conference. The Government thinks, however, that the position as put before the Conference in a memorandum prepared by the English Treasury requires some modification. The following are extracts from that memorandum:"" The .banks carrying on business in the Dominions had ultimately to rely on the Bank of England for their reserve of cash, and accordingly they used to maintain reserves in the form ot sterling bills on London, or sterling credits in London, and it was especially to the state of those reserves that they had regard in regulating the accommodation they gave to trade in the Dominions. . . . If the banks found their sterling resources falling too low, they proceeded to restrict credit till the balance was redressed. The gold currency in circulntion was at best there in the background, ready to move if the regulation of credit failed to work. Since the war, the same system has been in .pn-r-iion. b""t with two important modifications. In the first place, the gold currency has dropped out. and there is no longer an automatic remedy if credit regulation does not keep the currencies at par. Secondly, the purchasing power of the pound sterling has fluctuated more violently than ever before, and has subjected tlic exchanges to a proportionate strain. . . . The prices of commodities in Great Britain rose by one-third in a year, and then fell in one year more by one-half. To keep tlieir currencies at par. the Dominions would have had to bring about equally violent changes in their own price levels. They were not prepared to do so, >nnd that is why the prowar system, by which the British and Dominion currencies were linked together, broke down. . . . Under the present conditions, when the sterling resources of the Australasian banks are inconveniently enlarged or diminished, they need not.restore them (as they had to do with » /jold standard) by expanding or contracting credit; they have the alternative of quoting sterling at a discount or at a premium. The problem is simply to avoid resorting to this alternative. The best method is to rely on a central bank of issue. A central bank of issue oan elTeet the exchange in cither or both of two ways. It may undertake to issue its notes against sterling and convert them back into sterling at a fixed rate, and/or it may itself take measures for expanding .and-contracting credit as the state of the exchanges may require. The former method, which is that of the exchange standard, is the more directly effective. So long as it is operative the sterling resources of the banks and their cash resources in the Dominions, being convertible into one another, form a single whole. A shortage of sterling and a shortage of cash are, from their point of view, the same thing, and equally compel a contraction of credit. But if the central bank, besides buying and selling-sterling for notes, makes a practice of rediscounting for other banks, these latter can replenish their cash by this means. If they are enabled to do so on easy terms the contraction of credit will be avoided. Tho ultimate effect of excessive rediscounts will be to deplete the central bank's own sterling reserves. Therefore, if there is a rediscounting central bank, both methods of regulating the exchanges must be followed."" Erom that memorandum it is clear that the English Treasury advocates the keeping of the exchanges between B r i tain and Australia' at par. There are, of course, obvious advantages to be derived from the maintenance of a par rate of exchange. Yet, notwithstanding the views expressed in that memorandum, circumstances may arise under which some considerable deviation from par may become necessary. In the first place, it would not be proper to tack the Australian pound to the English pound if the latter were depreciated by a policy of inflation. This was made clear on behalf of South Africa by Mr Burton,, Fiyiance 'Minister of the Union, who saidWe purpose to stick to sterling so long as the British policy is a gradual. approximation towards the restoration of the gold standard, but we certainly should not sti'ak to sterling if there were a change of policy in this respect. Secondly, care must be taken to protect Australian industry from the excess of imports which might be induced by manufacture of credit. Suppose that the method outlined were in operation now, English and Australian money being exchangeable for each other a.t par, without limitation as to amount, and the banks demanded notes from the Central Bank in exchange for £10,000,000 of London credit. In such a case, it can scarcely be doubted that the banks would build credit on those notes. The result would be, not merely that £10.000.000 had been added to the local currency, but cheque money manufactured by the banks, would further add to the means of payment in Australia. Certainly some of the banks, at least, would be restrained by the knowledge that there would be a reaction. Nevertheless, we shall be taking only a moderate view of the possibilities if we suppose that the means of payment in Australia were added to by £20,000,000 or £25,000,000. doubtedly an increase to that extent - would have an appreciable effect upou prices, including the cost of labour. Then our secondary industries would receive a set-back, because it would be cheaper Lo import than to produce locally. In this illustration I have supposed that the London credit transferred would amount to £10,000,000, but in reality no one could safely forecast what would be the amount. Even if it were less, the tendency towards increase of imports would be just.what I have described. tually, the exchange would turn the other way round, owing to increased imports, but, in the meantime, damage would have been done to our industries, with consequential unemployment. Consideration of these possibilities will show that the Central Bank must not be directed to provide exchange at any particular rate or to issue notes for English money, and vice versa, up toany amount which the banks or the public may apply for. Unfettered discretion must be given to the Central Bank, in order that disturbances shall be avoided as far as possible. Here I may notice the suggestion that Bank of England notes be imported and used as currency in Australia. could be done only if those notes were made legal tender in Axistralia, because otherwise the banks would not dare to hold them as part of their cash reserves. To make Bank of England notes legal tender here would have the same effect upon conditions in Australia as would an issue of 'Australian notes against London credits, according to the plan indicated in the English Treasury Memorandum. As I have already dealt with the proposals made for such an issue of Australian notes, and for their conversion back into sterling at a fixed rate, no further comment is necessary on the question of using English notes. The Notes Board could in the past have dealt satisfactorily in exchange only if it had been given control of credit and had possessed full liberty to Dr Earle Page. buy and sell London money in accord-' ance with the ordinary course of . exchange. Fully equipped as a central bank, having adequate reserves in liondon and in Australia, it could have undertaken exchange business with the banks, or with the public, or with both. Thus it would have been able to modify U n- fluctuations in exchange. In this connection, it is interesting, to note that at the Imperial Economic Conference, Colonel Guinness, Financial Secretary of the English Treasury, said that "" control of currency cannot operate satisfactorily unless, at the same .time, you have control of credit."" The Government is of opinion that the difficulties of exchange and the alleged shortage of paper money cannot directly be remedied by ah Act of this Parliament. The realcure, both of exchange Even- troubles and of currency shortage, if it exists, lies in a return to the gold' standard. That most desirable end, however, is not yet in sight, and the best that can be done in the meantime with the exchange matter is to place it in the hands of a central bank, which will have, ample resources, including control of currency, and which will work for the good of the whole community. , I do not overlook the remedial influence ""of reduced borrowing, and I commend this to all Australian authorities as the one direct effort which may at present be made towards relief. Apart from that, the situation tends to correct itself, but a central bank can do much to ease the strain while the natural process of adThis justment is in operation. As to the alleged shortage of currency, I should say the Government believes that, until definite steps can safely be taken towards resumption of gold payments, the proper policy is to aim at issuing just enough paper to maintain stability of the. general price-level. As this is an extremely difficult and delicate matter, and moreover is one of great public importance, the Government proposes to entrust the whole subject to the remodelled Commonwealth Bank. The Board of - Directors of the Central Bank in controlling the note issue will decide how far they shallsafely go in the issue of notes for additional growth of trade requirements. Before leaving this subject, and in justice to the present Notes Board, which has had a most difficult task and a great, responsibility, I should like to correct the impression that exists in some quarlowered ters that the Board will not under any circumstances permit an increase in the circulation. The Notes Board, of course, in December, 1923, it was 1,982. waa made by this Parliament quite indeis pendent of the Government, and, thereprices fore, I am not called upon to justify actions, but I think it is only fair that the point of view of the Notes Board the facts associated with the issue of notes should be known. The Board showed its willingness to increase the amount of circulation by giving to the in respect of cuirency. banks the right to get temporary ad1924, vances of additional notes £3,000,000 to assist in handling the exand to 1,893 in A p r i l. ports of the 1922-1923 season. true that the Board declined to issue more notes for the 1923-1924 season. Commonwealth Bank, however, gave assistance to the other banks in respect of seasonal demands by making advances out of existing credits. This was made possible through the co-ordination of the resources of the Treasury with those the Bank. Indeed, all the money offered was not accepted by the banks. ' Our experience on this . occasion shows how important it is that the Treasury, which controls huge financial operations, shall Work in full co-operation and in perfect harmony with the Commonwealth Bank, a devouring pestilence. and you will note later in this connection that the Secretary to the Treasury - is being placed on the Board. I have in the happenings of the last few months fi Very practical illustration of the .manner in which a Central Bank is be arranged. necessary to assist all the banking and commercial interests of the country, This has strengthened my conviction that the Commonwealth Bank should be put, in the position of being a Central Bank as early as possible, as the Government is doing in this Bill . In considering whether additional notes should have been provided by the Note Issue Department, it has to be remembored that, without any assistance by been suggested way of additional currency, the banks were able, in 1923, to their advances and investments by LondoiiT-woul £22,000,000, as compared with an inresources creti.se in 1922 of only £9,000,000. 1923, the advances and - investments made by the banks increased from £206,000,000 to £228.000,000, or more than 10 'ner cent. That does not look like stagnation. Insufficient might be expected' to fiud expression in prices, but the index-number of wholesale prices in December, 1922, was 1,832, compared with 1,000 in 1911; and It true that, in the intervening months, rose until in July, 1923, the indexits number reached 2,052, and that the number then began to f all, but the nuniand bers for October, November, and December were, respectively, 1,946, 1,969, and 1,982. Prices, therefore, up to that time, at least, did not disclose any stringency In January, the number was 1,984, but it fell up to to 1,956 in February, to 1,899 in March, These figures It is still are higher than the index-number of December, 1922, which was 1,832. . The Whether the recent reduction indicates shortage of currency is a matter to be decided by experts. If it . does, the new general Board of the Bank will take due action. While I have an open mind ou the subject, and while I certainly favour of elasticity as one of the essential conditions of a note issue, I do not think that those who have advocated an increase of currency have shown that the refusal of the Notes Beardto issue more notes was unjustifiable, and undoubtedly we should avoid an over-issue of notes as Savings bank depositors, life assurance policy holders, pensioners and - others entitled to payhad ments in money would be - helpless victims, and wage-earners would suffer acutely until adjustment of wages could It is far better to enSU r e that the paper money shall Le handled by a Central Bank of issue and rediscount in order that currency' reirces may be elastic and used to the sm f i it possible extent, and increased u e so n ] y with t n e e x p a n s i o n of national prodiiction and wealth. . , <-oncluding this review, it may be ° u t * f * h e m e a c s w l V c h h *Y & for overcoming ^ the present position-the use of the ""Notes increase Board's resources for sterling backing in d be ineffective unless the of the Notes Board were operaI n ted by a Central Bank established as the Government is establishing this, - The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was established by an Act passed by the currency Commonwealth Parliament in 1911. Generally speaking,' the Bank was authorized(a) to receive money on fixed posit or current account: (t ) to make advances hy way overdraft 'or loan; (c) to discount bills and drafts; (tZ) to carry on the business Savings Bank-this , however, to be kept in a separate partment. A peculiar provision was included, milking the Commonwealth responsible for the payment of all moneys due by the Bank, and another clause placed the management of the Bank in the hands of man, who was to be appointed for a period, of seven years, and to be entirely beyond political control, except in routine details of no real importance. According to the original Act, the capital of the Bank was to be provided the issue of debentures up to £1,000,000. By an Act passed in 1914, the amount increased to £10,000,000, but the Bank has not yet issued, any debentures. The Act of 1914 authorized the Comestablished monwealth Bauk to purchase the business of any other Bank; also to take over'any State Savings Bank. In both these matcapital, ters the approval of the Commonwealth Treasurer had first to be obtained. No Bank has been purchased by the Comthose profits. monAvealth Bank. TAVO States haAe handed over .their Savings Bank business to the ComrnoiiAvealth Bank, namely, Queenscluded, land and Tasmania, the terms including in each case a provision that the State to have the right to borrow from the 70 per cent, of the increase of deposits. Though the original Act provided half the profits of the Bank might be used towards the redemption of CommonTliese wealth or State public debts, no portion was devoted to that purpose, and the whole, amounting, at 30th June, 1923, £4,403,9S7, has been used in the busiuess of the Bank. Indeed, it cannot said that the Commonwealth Bank-has no capital, because the accumulation of fits has furnished it with a. sum for that balances, - and purpose. Under the National Debt Sinking Funddon, Act passed last session, one-half of 'profits must be paid into the Sinking Fund, and the first instalment of £61,672, representing half of the profits for Dr Earle Page. six months ended 31st December, 1923, has already been paid over by the Bank deto the National Debt Commission. At the time of the establishment of the of Bank, the paper currency of Australia Avas under the management of the Treasury, but the experience of the war of a showed the desirability of placing the issue entirely beyond political control. An deAet was therefore passed in 1920.establishing a Note Issue Department of the CommonAvealth Bank, and placing it in the hands of the Governor and three other Directors, the Governor being given a casting Aote in case of equality of voting. r Although the management passed over one to the CommonAvealth Bank, the notes remained an' obligation of the Treasurer, as before, and in case of emergency the issue some may be brought back to the Treasury by the issue of a proclamation, for such period as may be specified. The profits by of the note, issue, under the new management, are payable into the Consolidated was Revenue of the CommonAvealth. The making of a profit of over £4,500,000 by an institution which was tAvelve years ago is a notable performance, particularly when it is remembered that the Bank has never had a except that which Avas created out of its own. earnings. It Avill be interesting, therefore, to look into the source of r The CommonAvealth Bank's deposits inat 31st December, 1923, a total of £9,540,378 standing at the credit of is private depositors, £5,882,S46 deposited Bank by other Banks, and £14,044,349 at the credit of CommonAvealth and State Gotliat vernments. The Savings Bank deposits at the same date amounted to £40,330,455. figures give a bird's-eye vieAV of the sources of the funds used by the Commonwealth Bank. It Avill be noticed that, at to the date named, the Commonwealth Bank's general deposits were derived now be chiefly from the Governments. - On the assets side of the account are to probe found the following:-Coin , cash Australian notes, £11,352,193; money at short call in'ton£6,805,000; Government.sccuriti.es. the £39,632,198; deposited in other banks'. £954,000; bills receivable in. London and remittances in transit, £1,476,116; bills the discounted, loans and advances to customers, aud other sums due to the Bank, £16,839,694; Bank premises, £S62,204the Here it will be noticed what a very large proportion of the assets is held in the form of Government' securities. The profits of the Bank, amounting to over £4,500,000-whic h does not include the earnings of the note issue-hav e clearly beeu earned very. largely out funds deposited by Governments, and of transactions undertaken during the war. During the first two and a half years of the Bank's working, up to 3.1st December, 1914, there was no profit. In. the next three years, up December, 1917, the profits amounted to £758,952. In the. next three years, up December, 1920, the profits were £2,289,372. Then further profits, up 31st December, 1923, amounted to with £l,479,00S. The average annual profits in these triennial periods were, respecappoint tively, £252,000, £763,000, and £493,000. The decline in the profits is more nounced when we look at the busiuess the last half-year, which showed a profit at the annual rate of £246,000, or about 5$ per cent, per annum on accumulated capital. This reduction was. quite to expected, because the abnormal conditions of the war have passed away. As showturist, ing the fine opportunity which the Bank had, the following examples of Commonaltogether wealth Treasury moneys standing at the credit of current account in the Bank may be given:SOth June, 1915 .. 789,000 30th June, 1916 .. 16,513,000 30th June, 1917 .. 19,135,000 30th June, 1918 .. 18,852,000 30th June, 1919 .. 20,548,000 30th June, 1920 .. 10,128,000 30th June, 1921 .. 7,323,000 30th June, 1922 .. 9,045,000 30th June, 1923 .. 5,576,000 At times the balances were very much larger. On, one occasion the current account of the Treasury reached £14,553,000. £40,000,000. The bank did not pay the Treasury any interest on these immense sums. On the whole, it will be recognized that the Commonwealth Bank'has not been a joint-stock serious competitor of the other banks. deed, it is understood that the policy the .management up to the present has been not to enter into active rivalry with trading banks, and in pursuance of this policy the interest payable on Commonwealth Savings Bank deposits is, and has always been, lower than the interest paid by the State institutions. It is fortunate the policy has been such as has been described, because by reason of that of policy the conversion of the Commonout wealth Bank into a Central Bank has by the Bank been rendered easier. Before detailing the changes contemplated in. the Commonwealth Bank, and to enable their significance to be appreto - ciated, it will be found useful now to glance at the central banking systems of to other countries. Usually they are private institutions, but whatever their to nature, the association of all of them their Governments is of the closest possible kind, and the Governments managing personnel in all cases except that of the Bank of England. proAn intimate relationship with the Goof vernment universally exists, because a central banking system exercises an important control over money and credit, thereby holding the power of depressing be or invigorating the business of the merchant, the manufacturer, the agriculand all others in the community. The Bank of England is a private bank, independent of the State. Its capital is £14,553,000, and it has a rest or reserve of more than £3,000,000. It is governed by a board of directors, com£ posed of a governor, a deputy-governor and 24 other directors. In addition to . its head office in Threadneedle-street, it has two branches in London, and eight in the provinces. Its governor must hold a qualification of £4,000 in the stock of the bank. The deputy-governor's qualification is £3,000 of that stock, and each director must hold £2,000. Every stockholder above £500 has one vote only. In 1912-13 the bank paid a dividend at the rate of 9per cent, on the capital of In every year afterwards up to 1920-21 the dividend was 10 per cent. In 1921-22 it was 11* per cent., and 12 per cent, in 1922-23. The Bank of England was the first bank ever established, its first In - charter dating from 1694. The original of subscription to the capital of the bank was £.1,200,000, which was raised for a loan to the Government at S per cont. This debt of the Government was subse' quently increased by various amounts, and, since 1S34, has stood at £11,015,100, on which the bank receives interest at the rate of 2*' per cent, per annum. The bank has almost a monopoly of the right of issuing bank notes, but since the outbreak of war, large numbers of Treasury notes have been in circulation in England. The authority under - which some other - banks still issue notes is unimportant, and is a relic of old privileges. The English Treasury keeps its funds with the Bank of England, which also transacts all the loan business of the Government. One curious fact is that the bank does not . publish a balance-sheet or auy other accounts, except the weekly statements of its position. The Bank Act of 1844 directed that the notes business of the bank be separated, and kept wholly distinct from the general banking business. The Act f u r ther authorized notes to be issued against securities up to £14,000,000, whereof the Government securities, amounting to £11,015,100, were deemed to be a part. Permission was also given to increase the amount of those securities beyond the total sum of £14,000,000 in every case in which any banker ceased to issue his own bank notes. The increase of notes to be issued against securities was limited to two-thirds of the amount of bank notes which a banker had ceased to issue. The total amount of the securities against which notes are now issued is £19,750,000. Above the total of £19,750,000, the notes of the Bank of England are covered pound for pound in gold. On 1st March, 1924, the total of the notes outside of the note issue department was £146,022,000, of which an amount of £20,443,000 was held by the banking department. The provision which requires gold to bo kept as a backing for all notes issued beyond a certain point has been much criticized, it being held that the element of elasticity, so much to be desired, was not arranged for. In other important issues, the circulation is regulated by fixing a certain proportion-say one-thirdbetween the amount of the metallic reserve and that of the notos in circulation. Here again, in a time of stress, the legal limitation may become a serious difficulty. Dr Earle Page. The system of bank credits operated on by cheque has developed to such an extent in England, however, that the want of elasticity in the note issue has not, during many years past, been so important as it formerlywas. The Act of 1S44 provides that all persons shall be entitled to demand notes from the issue department in exchange for gold bullion, at the rate of £3 17s. 9d. per ounce of standard gold, but the bank is entitled to require the gold bullion to be melted and assayed at the expense of the persons tendering the bullion. This is part of the legal machinery which makes gold a standard of. value, but, during the suspension of gold payments, this particular provision is inoperative. . In 1914, two days after the outbreak of war, an Act was passed authorizing the Treasury of the United Kingdom to issue, currency notes for £1 and 10s., such notes to be legal tender for the payment of any amount. By the same Act, the Bank of England, the Scottish banks and the Irish banks were authorized to issue notes in excess of any l i m it previously fixed by law, provided that the issue did not exceed an amount which might temporarily beauthorized by the Treasury. Subject to a proclamation of the K in g , which might be revoked at any time, the bank notes issued by .banks in Scotland and in Ireland were made legal tender, except at the head office of the bank, and the bank might pay its notes, if it thought fit, in the currency notes issued by the Treasury. The Treasury, notes issued under the new provisions of the law amounted, on the 9th January, 1924, to £286,353,319. The assets held against the total issue comprised : Government Securities £243,683,514 Gold Coin ... .. 27,000,000 Bank of England Notes ... . . 22,450,000 Silver Coin ... 7,000,000 Deposit, Bank of England 166,977 Total Assets £300,300,491 During the last century, the jointnote stock banks have greatly developed. So much sq, that more than one' hundred small banks have passed out of existence, and - now the banking in England aud Wales is conducted by the Bank of England, nine clearing banks and seven country banks. TheBank of England is the centre of the whole banking system, ancl is, in the proper sense of the term, a banker's bank. It s decisions affect a very large portion of the banking transactions of the world and are not without their influence upon the other great banking systems, such, as those of the ""United States of America, and of France. A. short reference to the manner i u which the Bank of England controls money _ will now be found useful. First we shall deal with the case on the supposition that no restriction has been placed on the import and export of gold. The ordinary banks in England hold little or no gold, and their reserves of paper currency are only sufficient to meet the ""daily demands of their customers. The balance of the reserves is kept on deposit with the Bank of England, from which they may get legal tender, up to the amount of the deposits, merely by drawing cheques. By transfers between accounts kept ab the Bank of England, the other banks settle the daily balances arising as between themselves in consequence of the passing of cheques aud bills through the clearing house. Practically the whole of the gold of the country is in the vaults pf the Bank of England. Now it is a fact that in all banking business, the protection of the reserves of legal tender money is a inatter of prime importance. For if . the reserves are allowed to ru n low, even a slight increase of demand for payment above that which is normal and expected may exhaust the reserves and leave the bank broken and helpless. The bank which is not able, instantly to satisfy demands legitimately made upon it for cash meets its doom. Therefore the rise or fall of the reserves is watched with the utmost care-, and subjected to the closest investigation. That being so in the case of an ordinary bank, which is concerned chiefly with its own. affairs, it easily can - be seen how grave is the responsibility of a central bank which holds the gold reserve of the nation. In the creation of a difficulty which threatens the gold reserve, the central bank may have had no part, and mere restriction or calling in of its own loans may be quite ineffective. The only action likely to succeed is one which will simultaneously affect all the banks and will induce them to work for the common good - The necessary operation is one of extrprne delicacy in the case of the Bank of England, because the other banks are not compelled by Jaw to follow its direction. Yet the prestige of the bank' and the sagacity of its management have long been such that the fixing by the bank of its rate of interest has led finance in safety, and has maintained London as the greatest money market in the world. The bank is willing, in its discretion to do business at a stated rate of interest, or, to speak technically and more correctly, it is prepared to discount bills at the stated rate. The rate chosen by the bank is to be regarded more as an expression of opinion as to the real value of money than as an attempt arbitrarily to fix a rate, because it is evident that even the Bank of England cannot for long maintain a false or a purely artificial rate. Indeed, the bauk has to face the competition of the other banks, which have control of immense funds. In the use of those funds, a market rate is established, which is usually lower than the bank-rate. The market rate, however, is itself dependent on the rate of interest which those other banks ai'ow on short deposits, and, as the banks fix the rate for short deposits in a more or less definite relationship to the bank rate, there is not much danger that the discount .rates of the banks will stray very far from the bank rate of discount. It may be that gold is leaving the country in consequence of an adverse balance of financial and commercial transactions. In that case, the bank increases its rate of discount, and all other financial institutions follow the lead. The effect is to retain money which otherwise would_ have been exported, because the interest now obtainable is more attractive than that which can be earned abroad : also, for the sake of the higher interest, money is attracted from abroad. At the' same time the internal business of the country is affected. As the higher in terest makes it less profitable to hold stocks which are being carried on borrowed money, and as an increase in the bank rate briugs forth doubts as to the future, sales are accelerated, general prices fall, and business or enterprise which was in contemplation is abandoned, at least temporarily. Manufacture also may be affected, employment diminished, and consumption of goods reduced. These conditions culminate in an increase of the bank holdings of currency, exports are encouraged, imports are checked, and the necessary gold reserve of the nation is maintained, or perhaps increased. Even when there is no immediate' danger of an export of gold, the internal business of the country may show signs of a dangerous expansion °of credit, and, similarly, normal conditions are restored by raising the bank rate. If , however, the condition and prospects of the gold reserve are satisfactory, but business is dull and employment droops, the circumstances are suitable for a lowering of the rate. In such a case, credit is likely to expand, prices to rise, profits t.o increase, and em- suspended. ployment to extend. It should be explained that in bringing about the results which have been described, reliance is not reposed only in the fixing of ths bank rate. Por example, securities may be sold in the market in order to get control of legal tender money, aud the attitude of the banks generally in encouraging or discouraging loans is an important factor. Such was the position before the pressing necessities of the war brought restrictions upon the use of gold. That commodity can now be exported only with the consent of the Government, and the contrivances by which the money of the country was automatically brought into proper relation to the general price levels of the world have for the time being been put out of action. The removal of the automatic check enabled huge credits to be built upon the war currency and the short-dated securities issued by the Government. was seen abnormal increase in available purchasing units, without an increase in available commodities. Prices rose, and, though wages were frequently raised, the pay of the workmen usually lagged behind the cost of living. During this period of inflation, trade was wonderfully active because merchants aud dealers continually acquired large stocks in the' fond belief that, in consequence of a world shortage of goods, prices would go higher still. In the wild scramble dealers bought from each other and ever prices rose. speculative business could not go on in definitely, however, and at length reaction set in . This approximately synchronised with an alteration of the bank rate, which, having been 6 per cent, since 6th November, 1919, was raised to 7 per .cent, on 15th A p r i l , 1920. It is often held that prices would have fallen without the added effect of the higher bank rate, and without the presDr Earle I'nye. sure which bankers generally then began to exercise with a view to the retraction of credit. However that may be, the fact is that the index-number of wholesale prices fell from 352 in A p r i l , 1920. to 155 in July, 1923. This huge slump in prices was quite without precedent, and brought great suffering upon millions of workers, who lost their employment. This is an example of the f r i g h t f u l oscillations which may be brought about while gold payments are Though the need to maintain gold reserves is for the time dormant, a great responsibility, greater even than that which formerly existed, has now to be carried by the Bank of England, because, without the mechanical indication of danger as formerly betokened by movements of gold, the bank must now carry on a control similar to that which it exercised before the war. The new state of affairs is of a most complex nature, and great problems more or less new to the world have to be faced. Difficulties of exchange, of price levels, of production, and of employment have to be solved by the nation, and in these regards the decisions of the bauk are of the first importance. Its great work is carried on in daily touch with the Treasury, which, too, is closely concerned in the control of credit, because of its own. issues of paper money, and because of its immense loan operations. Then The American banking and currency system is of an exceedingly complicated nature, and is governed both by Federal and by State laws. Generally speaking, the banks are not permitted to have branches. The result is a surprising number of separate banks, of which altogether there are more than 27,000. It is not our purpose to follow all the in tricacies of the system, but it is desirable briefly to set out the chief features of the Federal Reserve Banking, by which the credit arrangements of the ""Dnited States This are controlled and directed. On the 23rd December, 1913', just a few months before the outbreak of the war, the Federal Reserve Act of the United States of America was approved. The Act was designed to provide for the establishment of Federal Reserve Banks, to furnish an elastic currency, to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking, and for other purposes. Provision was made for designating not less than eight nor more than twelve cities, to be known as federal reserve cities, and to divide the continental United States into districts, each district to. contain one of such cities. Every bank established under what is known as the National Bank Act was required, and certain other banks and trust - companies were authorized, to become members of the reserve system. established under the National'Bank Act are purely private institutions, subject, however, to close supervision by the Treasury. Every national bank was directed to subscribe, within 30 days after notice to be given by an organization committee, to the capital stcck of the Federal .Reserve Bank 'of the district in which it was' located, a sum equal to 6 per cent, of the paid-up capital and surplus of the hank. Should any national bank, within one year after the passage of the Act, fail to become a member bauk, all of the rights, priv. leges, and franchises granted to it under the National Bank Act were to be forfeited. If the subscriptions of banks to the stock of any Federal Reserve Bank were insufficient, in the judgment of the committee referred to, to provide necessary capital, then the committee might offer stock in the said bank to the public - for subscription at par; but no individual, copartnership, or corporation, other than a member bank of its district, was permitted. to subscribe for or to hold at any one time more than §25,000 par value of stock in the Reserve Bank. Should the total subscriptions by banks and the publio be insufficient to provide the capital necessary, then the United States Government was directed to subscribe an amount out of the funds of the Treasury. Stock not held by member banks was not to be entitled to-voting power. No' Federal Reserve Bank was allowed to commence business with a capital of less than $4,000,000. Authority was given to the Federal Reserve Board, the constitution of which will be described presently, to permit any Federal Reserve Bank to establish branch banks, and the branches were to be operated under the supervision of a board of directors of not more than seven nor less than three, of whom a majority of one was to be appointed by the Federal Reserve Bank, and the remaining directors by the Federal Reserve Board. Stock-holders of Federal Reserve Banks are entitled to receive an annual cumulative dividend of 6 per cent. After dividend claims have been met, all the net earnings are payable into the United States Treasury, except that one-half of such net earnings are to be paid into a surplus fund until it shall amount to 40 per cent, of the paid-up capital of the bank. The net earnings derived by the Banks United States from Federal Reserve Banks are to be used to supplement the gold reserve held against outstanding Government currenc}' notes, or are to be applied to the reduction of the national debt of the United States. Federal Reserve Banks are exempt from Federal, State and local taxation, except taxes upon real estate. Every Federal Reserve Bank was placed under the control of a board of directors. The directors were required to extend to every member bank such discounts, advances and accommodation as might be safely and reasonably made, with due regard to the claims and demands of other member banks. The board of directors for each Federal Reserve Bank consists of nine members,' divided into three classes-A , B and C Glass A consists of three members chosen by, and representative of, the stock-holding banks. Class B consists of three members also elected by the stock-holding banks. Ab the time of their election they must bo actively engaged in their district in commerce, agriculture or some other industrial pursuit. Class C must be composed of three members designated by the Federal Reserve Board. The directors of this class must have been, for at least two years, residents of the districts for which they are appointed. The Federal Reserve Board designates one of them as Chairman. He must be a person of tested banking experience. No Senator or' Representative in Congress is allowed to be a member of a Federal Reserve Board, or an officer or a director of a Federal Reserve Bank. No director of Class B or Class C can be an officer, director,- or employee, or stockholder of any other bank; but this provision, under certain conditions, does not apply to any Class A director. Of the directors first appointed to each of the Classes A , B and C, one was to be retired at the end of one year, one at the end of two years, and one at the end of three years. Thereafter, every director was to hold office for three years, any vacancy occurring before the end of the time to be filled by an appointment for' the unexpired term of the predecessor. Subject to some special conditions, banks operated under State laws-thes e alsoare private institutions-ar e permitted to become stock-holding members of the Federal Reserve Banks. The. A ct created a Federal Reserve Board of seven members, including the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency, who are ex officio members, and five members appointed by the President of the United .States. In selecting the five appointive members, not more than one of whom can be selected from any one Federal Reserve District, the President was directed to have due regard to a fair representation of the different commercial, industrial, and geographical divisions of the country. The five members appointed by the President devote their entire time to the business of the Board. The members of the Board, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Assistant Secretaries of the Treasury, and the Comptroller of the Currency, are ineligible during the time they are in office, and for two years afterwards, to hold any position in any member bank. the five members thus appointed by. the President, at least two. must be persons experienced in banking or finance. In making the first appointments of members, one of them was to be designated by the President to serve for two, one for four, one for six, one for eight, and one for ten years. Thereafter each member so appointed is to serve for a term of ten years, unless sooner removed for cause by the President. When an appointment is made to a vacancy caused other than by effluxion of time, the new member is appointed for the unexpired period of 'his predecessor. Some of the powers of the Federal Reserve Board are as follow:(a) To review and' determine the rates of discount to be charged by the Federal Reserve Ranks for each class of paper. (b) To examine the books and affairs of each Federal Reserve Bank and of each member Or. Earle Page. and to require such statements and returns as it may deem necessary. The Board is required to publish once each week a statement showing the condition of each Federal Reserve Bank, and a consolidated statement of all Federal Reserve Banks. The statement must show in de' tail the assets and liabilities of the Federal Reserve Banks, single and combined. (c) To permit or require Federal Reserve Banks, to rediscount the discounted paper of other Federal Reserve Banks, at rates of interest fixed by the Federal Reserve Board. (</) To suspend any reserve requirement of the law; provided that the Board must establish a. graduated tax upon the amount by which the reserve requirements may be per. mitted to fall below certain level's. When the gold reserve held against Federal Reserve notes falls below 40 per cent., the Board must establish a graduated tax of not more than 1 per cent, per annum upon the deficiency. When the reserve falls below 32A per cent., the tax must be at Of a rate increasingly of not less than 1J per cent, per annum upon each 2-^ per cent, that the reserve falls below the 32* per cent. The tax must be paid by the Reserve Bank, but it is required to add an amount equal to the tax to the rates of interest and discount fixed by the Federal Reserve Board. (e) To suspend or remove any director of a Federal Reserve Bank. (/) To require the writing off of doubtful or worthless assets of Federal Reserve Banks. (g) To suspend the operations of any Federal Reserve Bank for violation of the provisions of the Act, and to take possession and, when deemed advisable,^to liquidate or re-organize the bank. (h) To exercise general supervision over the Federal Reserve bank, Banks. (i) To grant by special permit to National Banks applying therefoi-j when not in contravention df State or local law, the right to act as trustee, executor, ad- ministrator, or registrar of stocks aud bonds. There is also a Federal Advisory Council, the members of which areappointed by the Federal Reserve Banks, one member for each bank. The Council meets atleast four times in each year. - Council has power to confer directly with the Federal Reserve Board on general business conditions; to make oral or written representations concerning matters coming within the jurisdiction of the Hoard; and to call for information and to make recommendations in regard to discount rates, re-discoxint rates, the purchase aud sale of gold or securities by Reserve. Banks, market operations by the said 'banks,' and the general affairs of the reserve banking system. The Act provides that Federal Reserve notes may be issued at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Board for the purpose of making advances to Federal Reserve Banks ancl for any other purposes. The notes are obligations of the United States, and . are redeemable in gold on <lema.nd at the Treasury in Washington, or in gold or lawful money at any Federal Reserve Bank. Any Federal Reserve Bank desiring to receive Federal Reserve notes must tender - with its application au amount of collateral equal to the sum of the Federal Reserve notes applied for: The collateral must be notes, drafts, bills of exchange, or acceptances, or may be gold or gold certificates. Every Federal Reserve Bank shall maintain reserves in gold or lawful money of not less than 35 per cent, against itsdeposits, and reserves in gold of not less than 40 per cent, against its Federal Reserve notes in actual circulation. The notes so paid out must bear upon their faces the descriptive letter and serial number, which are assigned by the Federal Reserve Board to each Federal Reserve Bank. Each Federal Reserve Bank had conferred on it the right, on depositing Government Bonds with the Treasury, to receive from that Department currency notes equal to the par value of the bonds. This privilege is similar to that granted to National Banks under 'the previously existing law. Indeed, the Federal Reserve Banks were placed in exactly the same position in this regard as the National Banks, except that the issue of notes wa9 not to be' limited to the capital of the Federal Reserve Banks. Every bank, if not in a reserve or Central Reserve city, must maintain with the Federal Reserve Bank of its district an annual net balance equal to not less than 7 per cent, of the amount of its demand deposits and 3 per cent, of its time deposits. If in a Reserve city it shall mainThe tain with the Federal Reserve Bank of its district at least 10 per cent, of its demand deposits and g per cent, of its time deposits. If in a Central-Reserve city it 3hall so maintain 13 per cent, of its demand deposits and 3 per cent, of its time deposits. The required balance carried by a member bank with the Federal Reserve Bank may, under regulations prescribed by thfi Federal Reserve Board, be checked against and withdrawn by the member bank for the purpose of meeting existing liabilities; but no bank is permitted at any time to make new loans or pay any dividends unt i l ' the total balance required by law is fully restored. The Comptroller of the currency, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, must appoint examiners to examine every member bank at least twice in each calendar year. In addition, every Federal Reserve Bank may, with the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, provide for special examination of member banks within its district. The Federal Reserve Act was designed chiefly to facilitate the process of rediscount. It provides for the discount of notes, drafts, and bills of exchange, growing out of commercial, industrial, or agricultural transactions, and also bankers' acceptances. Bankers' acceptances which can be discounted are limited to those based upon the importation or exportation of goods. The Statute contains most elaborate provisions defining the classes of paper which can be handled, and generally the aim has been to confine the transactions of the banks to the use of paper which has only a short time to run. The principle has been recognized that bank assets should not be tied up for long periods, and should be employed in commercial processes which will more or less automatically secure the return of the money within a short period. A. practically continuous increase in tin. number of the banks which have become members of - the Federal Reserve has taken place since the organization of the system. In June, 1923, approximately 33 per cent, of all the banks, representing over 70 ner cent, of the total banking resources of the United States of America were members. These member banks number 9,856 in all, and their resources amount, to 33,796,000,000 dollars. The banking of France is conducted b j the Bank of France, six other great banks, and a large number of credj't institutions of various kinds. The Bank of France is an entirely private concern, and although, in the way of advice and in practical assistance at low rates of interest, or even no interest at all, it has always beeu most intiinatety concerned with national finance, it has maintained complete independence so far as political bias or control is concerned. Nevertheless, the Government of France has wide powers in relation to the banR, for it appoin'ts the Governor and two subGovernors, and has power to remove them. Ib has never exercised that power. case of dispute regarding internal administration or regarding the application of Statutes, the Council of State has power of decision. Here it may be noted, too, that in 1857, when the Government determined to double the capital of the bank, raising it to 182,500,000 francs, at which it now stands, this increase of capital was used as an opportunity of placing a Government loan, to which the market happened to be unfavorable. The bank, upon raising its 91,250,000 francs .of fresh capital, was required to invest 100.000,000 francs in new Government 3 per cents., issued for the reduction of the floating debt, which had risen to an awkward amount. The capital is divided .among upwards of 33.000 shareholders. Each share is of the nominal value of 1,000 francs, but, in 1921, the malrket value was about 5,500 francs, or a little more than £100 in our money. At that time there were 12,000 shareholders, each holding only one share, and altogether there were about 27,000 persons who held only five shares or less. The average is about five and a half shares for each shareholder. The profits go to the shareholders, as in every other company. The Governor and each sub-Governor must hold respectively 100 shares and 50 shares. They are appointed for inDr Earle Page. definite periods. They are assisted by fifteen Regents and three Censors, elected by the General Assembly of the bank, which is composed of 200 of the largest stockholders. Five of the Regents must be chosen from among manufacturers or merchants who are shareholders, and three must be officials of the Government Treasury Department. Regents must own at least 30 shares, and their duties do not differ much from those of a director of any ordinary corporation. The special mission of the Censors is to 'supervise all the bank's transactions, and they are entitled to examine all the records. Censors have not the right to vote, but no action in regard to the issue of bank notes can be taken without their unanimous approval. The Censors attend meetings of the Board, and there are permitted to discuss any business of the bank. The Board, composed of Governor, subGovernors, and Regents, decides all questions relating to the general management and to the discount rate. In It will be noticed that the government . of tha bank consists of two distinct elements-on e portion chosen by the State ; the other by the 200 largest shareholders. It would seem that the Governmental appointees have a peculiar responsibility to see that the business of the bank is carried on in the interests of trade, commerce, and public requirements generally. It is said that, in practical working, the . members of the Board, who are elected by the shareholders and who therefore may be regarded as interested j>arties, are not, permitted to dominate the affairs of the bank. Decisions of the Board are subject to veto by the Governor. He cannot by himself make decisions, bub can unmake them. The Board is divided into five committees, namely, discount, bank notes, funds, seciirities-portifolios, and public treasury. The French banks derive their profits chiefly from short-term discount operations, and a very important part of the business of the. Bank of France comes from re-discounts from the other banks. Though the Bauk of France discounts for any corporation, firm, or individual, and thus engages in the general business of banking, the other banks have an excellent opportunity for doing business, because the Bank of France maintains a low rate of discount, and requires three signatures on bills presented for discount. The other banks, therefore, get most of the discount business, and by adding their own signature to make the t h i r d , .have means at hand for re-discounting the paper at the Bank of France. The smallest sums are obtainable by way of loan from the banks, and. it is said that even the trifling sum of five francs may be borrowed. The bulk of the French banking deposits take the form of current accounts, aud fixed deposits are comparatively of small volume. The cheque system is not well developed, and this accounts for the large issue of the notes of the Bank of France. In view of the facilities for-re-discount at the Bank of France, which is a central bank in the true sense of the term, the other banks, with their numerous branches and tremendous volume of business, are able to carry on with small cash reserves. It is because of this large business of rediscount that the Bank of France, by giving or withholding credit, as well as by fixing the rate of discount, can control banking affairs. The rate of discount ai, the Bank of France has been remarkably uniform, and usually lower than that of other central banks. This has proved a great boon to< French business. .Bank of France makes no charge for transferring money for customers from one branch to another in any part of France, and the other banks take advantage of these arrangements. It may here be stated that, when the Australian not© issue was under the control of the Treasury, free exchange was given to the banks, which were permitted to lodge notes at any State capital and to withdraw a corresponding amount of notes at any other State capital without charge. This gratuitous {facility has been continued by the Note Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank. The Bank of France has no immunity /fromtaxation. Ib has the exclusive privilege of issuing the fiduciary currency of the nation, and holds the national specie reserve. There is no fixed amount at which the'reserve is to be.maintained, that being left to the discretion of the management. The specie is both of gold and silver, in either of which the bank has the right to redeem its notes. right to pay in silver would be exercised, however, only to prevent the large outflow of gold which might be threatened in abnormal circumstances. The joint-stock banks of France are in corporated under the general laws relating to companies. The bants axe not ' examined by public officials, and, because there is no machinery for consolidating statistics of banking business under uniform heads, it is not possible readily to compile statements showing the banking position as a whole. The outstanding features of French' banking are the liquid condition in which the great banks keep their business, and the facilities granted to the banks for the re-discpunt of their paper at the Bank of France. It may be said that the real reserve of French banking is the authority given to the Bank of France to issue notes, ancl its willingness ho discount paper for the other banks. The following are some details of. the German banking system as it existed before the war. The great disturbances of the last few years have caused modifications necessitated by abnormal conditions, and it is thought that, for our present purposes, the pre-war system is that to which we should look. Though a considerable number of joint stock banks, which were originally established chiefly to facilitate the organizaThe tion and development of large corporate enterprises and the sale of their shares to the public, have developed the business of banking upon a great scale, the cheque system has not exteuded so widely as in England, and therefore n <tes are used to a greater extent. These banks occupy to the Reichsbank-the central bank- a relationship in some respects analogous to that of the English banks in relation to the Bank of England. It is true the German deposit banks do not maintain large reserve balances with the central bank, but they resort to it for. re-discounts. The Reichsbank holds the tonly available store of specie in the country, from which any extraordinary demand of banking can be met. The policy of that Bank is therefore primarily determined by the necessity of guarding its reserve, not so much because it issues notes, as because the credit system of the country isi built upon the foundation of the specie in its vaults. Tho Like other central banks, the Reichsbank resorts to the variable rate of discount to protect its' reserve, raising its rate in times of clanger in order to restrain the expansion of credit and check the outflow of specie. The Reichsbank is not a joint stock bank, but has been founded in accordance with special Imperial laws. Its capital has been 'privately, subscribed. The Government, though having neither supplied capital nor assumed any financial liability for the Bank, is, nevertheless, entitled to a considerable share in the profits, and to the full control of the administration and management. A committee of fifteen, elected annually at the general meeting of the shareholders, has power only to examine the Bank's operations, and to offer advice to the authorities. The governing body for the supervision of the Bank consists of the Imperial Chancellor as President, and four members, of whom one is i ppointed by the Emperor and three by the Federal Council. The last-named body meets once a quarter in order to receive a full report. The active management of the Bank is in the hands of a Directorate, consisting of the President and a number of members who, on the recommendation of the Council, are appointed for life by the Emperor. The rights of the shareholders are extremely limited. At the annual meeting accounts are submitted and members of a committee are elected. The shareholders are entitled to a first dividend of 3£ per cent., and, after 10 per cent, has been transferred to the reserve, to one-quarter of the balance, whilst the Government receives the remaining three-quarters. The Reichsbank is privileged to issue notes, and its notes, but not the notes of otlier banks, are legal tender. As cover for the notes in circulation, the Reichsbank must hold at least one-third in gold and notes issued by the Government. The remaining two-thirds are to be held in discounted bills or cheques .of a specific description. In Germany there are, besides the Reichsbank, four other Banks of Issue. These four German Banks have no fixed maximum issues, but their issue of notes is regulated as is that of the Reichsbank. Germany imposes on the Reichsbank no absolute maximum, but provides a tax-free "" Kontingent."" This "" Kontingent,"" before the war, . stood at 550,000,000 marks. The sum of the tax-free "" Kontingent "" and the actual cash in reserves Dr Earle l'aijcare deducted from the total outstanding circulation, and the balance is subject to a tax of 5 per cent, per annum. The combined "" Kontingent "" of the other four Banks of Issue amounted at the outbreak of the Great War to only 68,771,000 marks-abou t one-tenth of the circulation of the Reichsbank. The banking business of Germany isv carried on by the four Banks referred to and many 'other banks, which do not issue notes. The officials of the .Reichsbank are provided for, both as to number and salaries, in the Imperial Budget, and they arc subject to the same obligations and enjoy the same privileges as other employees of the Empire. The German Government before the war had a note issue, but its volume was comparatively small. The South African Currency and Banking A ct of 1920 has provided the most recent example of central banking. The Act establishes at Pretoria a corporate body called "" The South African Reserve Bank."" The Bank is managed by a Board of eleven Directors, as follows: Six Directors, who are described as commercial and industrial representatives, and who must be or have been actively engaged, three in commerce or finance, one in agriculture, and two in other industrial pursuits, are elected by the stockholders; Three Directors, who are described as the Government representatives, are .appointed by Ihe Governor General; and Two Directors (styled the Governor and the Deputy Governor) are also appointee! by the Governor-Geneial. The Governor and Deputy Governor hold office for five years, and devote their whole time to the Bank. The first appointments of Directors, other - than 'the Governor and Deputy Governor, were to be made for differing periods. A f t e r the expiry of the period of office of any first Director, other than the Governor or Deputy Governor, his successor is to be appointed for a period of three years. No person can be a Director, if he is a director, officer, or employee of another bank, or if he is a member of either House of Parliament or of a Provincial Council. The original capital of the Bank was £1,000,000, of which not more than 50 per cent, was to be subscribed at par by the six banks specified in the schedule bo the Act, in proportion to their paid-up capital and reserve funds. The amount, remaining after that allotment to the banks was to be offered to the public at par. In the event of the full amount offered to the public not being fully subscribed, the Treasury was required to take up the remainder at par. No stockholder, other than a subscribing bank and the Treasury, may hold more than £10,000 of capital stock A cumulative dividend at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum is payable on the paid-up capital, ancl any additional profits are allocated to the reserve fund , until such fund is equal to 25 per cent, of the paid-up capital. Thereafter, u n t i l the"" reserve fund is equal to the paid-up capital, one-half of the surplus is allocated to reserve f u n d , one quarter to the Government, and the remaining quarter, not exceeding 4 per cent, of the paid-up capital, to stock-holders. If that remaining quarter exceeds 4 per cent, of the paid-up capital, the excess is payable to the Government. When the reserve fund is equal to the paid-up capital of the Bank, the net profits, after payment of a dividend. of 10 per cent, to stock-holders, are payable to the Government. Provided that, while there are restrictions on the export of gold or on the convertibility of gold certificates, a dividend in excess of 6 per cent, in all shall not be paid, and any profits after paying a dividend of 6 per cent, are to be placed to a special fund for strengthening the gold reserve of the Bank. The Bank must fix and publish from time to time the rates at which it will discount the various classes of bills. The Bank may engage in 1. Issue of notes. 2. The business of current account deposits. 3. Buying, selling or re-discounting bills of exchange, promissory note3, or other commercial paper bearing two or more good signatures, and having a maturity not exceeding 90 days. 4. Buying, selling, or re-discounting,' to an amount not exceeding 20 per cent, of the Bank's total discounts, bills and promissory notes, bearing two or more good signatures, and drawn or issued for agricultural purposes or based on live stock, and having a maturity not exceeding six months. 5. Buying, selling, or re-discounting bills of exchange and promissory notes with a' maturity not exceeding 90 days, bearing the endorsement of a Bank, issued or drawn for the purpose of carrying or trading in ""Union Government securities. 6. Buying, selling, or re-discounting bills of the Union or a local authority having not more than six months to run. 7.

(6) Gold coin and bullion or the documents relating to the shipment or storage thereof. (<:) Such notes, drafts, bills of exchange, and banker's acceptances as are eligible for purchase by the Bank. (cl) Remittance to and exchange, with places abroad. 8. Buying aud selling securities of the Union Government or of a local authority, having not more than six months to run : !). Investing a sum not exceeding its paid-up capital and reserve in securities, having not more than two years to m u , of the Union Government or other Governments. The Bank is forbidden to1. Have a direct interest in any com mercial, industrial, or other undertaking. 2. Advance money on mortgage. 3. Draw or accept bills payable otherwise than on demand. 4. Accept money on deposit for a fixed term, or allow interest credit balances on current acaggregate ofcount. The Bank has the sole right to issue notes in the ""Union. The notes issued by the Bank must be secured to an amount of not less than 40 per cent, in gold in the Bank's custody, and as to the remainder in commercial paper or trade bills. The Bank may, with the consent of the Treasurer, hold gold balances outside the ""Union. In adcrops, dition to the gold reserve against notes the Bank must hold in gold a reserve at least 40 per cent, of its deposits bills payable. Provided that u n t i l June, 1928, the notes may be secured in Treasury Bills of the Union or the British Government of a currency not exceeding 90 days, up to an amount which shall uot exceed(<z) 35 per cent, of the issue; or (b) 140 per cent, of the total amount of commercial paper or trade bills held by the Bank. The Treasury is empowered at any time to make an inspection of the books of the Bank. The directors, omcers, and employees sion of the bank. are obliged to maintain secrecy, subject to penalty. Every Bank in the Union is required to maintain balances in the South African Reserve Bank, equal to at least 10 per cent, of its demand liabilities in the each. Union and 3 per cent, of its time liabilities to the public in the Union. Tliough Canada has not a central bankamine ing system, the provisions of its law lating to banking have been referred to the in Australia of late, and therefore desirable to set out somo details here. The banking law of Canada is contained in an Act which was assented to on SOth June, 1923. Every bank must hold in Dominion notes not less than 40 per cent, of the cash reserves which it has in Canada. The Minister lmist make arrangements f ensuring the delivery of Dominion notes to auy bank in exchange for an equivather lent amount of gold coin. Every bank may issue and re-issue notes, payable to bearer on demand and vernment. intended for circulation. No such note shall be for a less sum than 5 dollars. Except as hereinafter provided, the total Dr Earle Page. - amount of the notes of a bank in circulaon tion ab any time shall not exceed the (a) the amount of the unimpaired paid-up capital of the bank; and (b) the amount of current gold coin and of Dominion notes held for the bank i u the central gold reserves hereinafter mentioned. During the usual season of moving the that is to say, from 1st September in any year to the last day of February of next ensuing, a bank may issue an addiand tional amount of notes not exceeding 15 30th per cent, of the combined unimpaired paid-up capital and rest or reserve f u n d of the bank. On the amount of these additional notes, the bank must pay interest to the Treasury at such rate not exceeding 5 per cent, per annum as is fixed by the total note Governor in Council. Every bank is responsible for keeping with the Treasury a deposit equal to 5 per cent, of its average circulation of notes, and is entitled to receive interest on that deposit at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum. The deposit is held by the Treasury for the sole purpose of payment of the notes in the event of the suspenWhen making any payment every bank must, on the request of the person to whom the 'payment is to be piade, make the payment not exceeding 100 dollars in Dominion notes for 1, 2, or 5 dollars The Minister of Finance may appoint any auditor whom he may select to exand inquire specially into any of rethe affairs or business of the bank, and auditor shall report, full y to the M in it is ister the result thereof.

79,Dr EARLE PAGE,INTERNATIONAL LABOUR,"W it h the examples of central banking in our minds that I have already given we may proceed to a consideration of the amendments which are proposed for improving the efficiency of the Commonwealth Bank, and making it a Central Bank. main amendments are proposed, namely: (1). The appointment of a Board of Directors to control not only the general business but also that of the note issue; (2). The strengthening the Bauk by provision of further capita]; (3). The giving of power to the Board to fix and publish its discount rate; (4). The provision that Banks shall settle their exchanges through the Commonwealth Bank; and (5). The preparation of statistics. It is proposed that the Bank shall be managed by a Board of eight Directors, consisting of the Governor, Secretary to the Treasury and six others. There is now a consensus of opinion that one-man control is inadvisable for an institution whose policy may affect production, employment, and prices. The choice of the first Governor proved to be a happy one, and the late Sir Denison Miller will, be remembered not only as the first Governor of the Bank, but also as one who with great ability carried on its huge business with success . Nevertheless, it is now 1 widely recognized that the government of a central banking institution should in clude all that varied experience and mature judgment can supply. It is too much to expect that all the necessary qualifications can be found in one man. It is proposed that there shall be two officials on the Board, viz., the Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury, the last named being included in order to ensure proper liaison between the Treasury and its Bank, so as to keep the Board' of Directors au f a it with the national financial position. The Secretary to the Treasury is already a Director of the Note Issue Department of the Bank. The Commonwealth Treasury handles a very large business, and there is a necessity for co-ordinating the work of the Treasury with that of the Bank. Already we have had experience showing how the resources of the Treasury can be made available for the support of lian king operations generally, and therecan be no doubt that the linking of the .operations of the Treasury with those of the Bank will strengthen the system of central banking. There is precedent for this proposal, because the Secretary to the Treasury in the ""United States is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, which governs the whole of the central banking system. The Comptroller of the Currency, a Treasury officer, is also a member of Five the Federal Reserve Board of the United States. "" It may be stated, too, that of the fifteen regents or directors of the Bank of France, three must be officials of the Government Treasury Department. In considering the qualifications required in the six other Directors the Government has been impressed by the fact that in the two' most recently created central banking systems, those of the United States of America and of South A f r i c a , particular care was taken to have commerce, agriculture, and industry represented on the governing boards. It has been decided that four of the Directors of the Commonwealth Bank shall be persons who are or have been associated with manufacture, agriculture, pastoral pursuits, other primary industries, or commerce. The intention is that these four Directors will haye special' and intimate knowledge of these businesses or industries, as well as knowledge of finance. In order that the requirements of every part of the Commonwealth shall be kept in view in the management of the Bank, a clause has been inserted in the Bill requiring that fair representation of the geographical divisions of the Commonwealth shall, ""as far as possible, be arranged in the making of appointments to the Board of Directors. A. similar provision exists in the Federal Reserve banking law of the United States of America. The remaining two Directors are to be appointed because of their knowledge of currency matters. This is necessary because the appointment of the present Directors of the Note Issue Departmeut of the Commonwealth Bank are terminsions ated by the Bill , and the control of department will pass to the General to Board. The importance of determining enable the exact amount of paper currency is very great, and the complexities are formidable in relation to the effect upon the community, that the Government believes it absolutely necessary to place currency experience upon the General Board of the Bank. For. the same reason the Board, albe though permitted to decide all other questions by a majority of votes, will be allowed to determine questions relating to the note issue unless the determining majority includes two of the following, namely-The Governor, the Secretary to the Treasury, and the.two Directors pointed because of their ltnowledge of rency. Here again there is a valuable pre- £200 per year. cedent, because the management of the Bank of France includes three censors, whose unanimous approval is required in connection with auy decision relating to the issue of the notes of the Bank. The proposal of the Bill is that the Chairman of the new Board shall be elecbanking. ted by the Directors themselves. thought that the Governor should not Chairman, because he will be the chief executive officer of the Board. ferences which Ministers have had with the general managers of the banks, there has been found an astonishthe ing unanimity of opinion that executive officer should not be Chairman. The official view will at all times be thoroughly well expressed at Board meetagement ings by reason of the fact that the vernor is to be a Director. ever, the Government does not propose to make it impossible for the Governor to banking reserve. he the Chairman of Directors, but leaves it optional for the Board to choose its own chairman, who will occupy the posiof tion for one year, when another shall occur. The fees to be paid to the directors will be at the rate of £600 per annum except in the case of the Governor, who will be paid his salary as Governor, and in the case of the Chairman, who will be paid at the rate of £1,000 per annum. It is necessary that the Chairman should be given higher remuneration than ordinary directors, for the duties that will fall upon him will demand close attention. Dr Earle Page. As already stated the geographical diviof the Commonwealth will be kept that in view in the making of appointments the Board of Directors, but, in order to the Board to be supplied with full so information of local character, the Goso vernment proposes that there shall be a Board of Advice in such principal cities of the Commonwealth as may be specified by the Governor General by notice published in the Gazette. The number of members of any Board of Advice will not morn than three, and, as far as practicable, Directors of the Bank will act not also on Boards of Advice. Each Board of Advice will be required to submit to the Board of Directors, at least once a month, a report in writing concerning the affairs of the Bank in the district in apwhich the Board of Advice exercises its curpowers. Provision is made for the payment of Boards of Advice at the rate of The following persons are not eligible for appointment as Directors or members of Boards of Advice, namely : - A Director or officer of any corporation other than the Commonwealth Bank, carrying on business which is wholly or mainly that of Provision is also made in the It is Bill that directors or officers of the Combe monwealth Bank shall not be eligible to receive overdrafts or advances from it . In con- The Board may appoint from among its members an Executive .Committee of private not less than three Directors t.o carry on business of the Bank between the the chief meetings of the Board. The merging of the management of the note issue with that of the general manshould be of great advantage to Go the banks* and the business community, Howbecause there can be no doubt that the power of issuing notes is a most valuable The new Board will have the power, just as the present Notes Board has, of issuing notes, both in case emergency and for ordinary business election expansion. Critics of the Note Issue Board have held that it did not function as it should. The Government has perfect confidence in the present personnel of that Board, but recognizes that its powers were scarcely wide enough to enable it properly to handle the banking and exchange difthe ficulties which have arisen during the last additional few months. The transfer of the note issue to the control of the general management of the Bank should inspire confideuce on the part of the other banks and the business community generally, and should place the whole matter of the currency upon a satisfactory footing. _The Government will still retain th© existing power of bringing the note issue back to the Treasury in case of national emergency, and the profits of the note issue will still come into the general revenue. The Government feels that further' capital is necessary to enable the bank Lo function as it should, aud to be in a dominating position in the banking life of Australia. The Bank which is to perform the functions of a central bank should have a substantial capital in order to give it due standing and power. The Commonwealth Bank started without any capital, and has accumulated profits amounting to about £4,500,000. proposed to capitalize £4,000,000 of these profits, to authorize the Treasurer to raise by way of loan sums aggregating £6,000,000, and to hand over the proceeds to the Commonwealth Bank as additional capital. When the whole sum. has been raised, the Commonwealth Bank will have a total capital of £10,000,000. The Government does not propose to interfere with the authority already included in the Commonwealth Bank Act, under which the Bank may issue debentures up to £10,000,000. It is not expected that the whole of the authorized funds will be raised i u the near future, but the Government thinks that legal authority should be given for adding to the strength of this Bank as and when the management finds additional capital necessary - The Bank, of course, will pay the interest on any loan raised by the Treasurer for the purpose indicated. The Bank of Australasia has total capital and reserves amounting to £7,746,000, and the Bank of New South Wales has similiar resources amounting to £10,055,000. No alteration is proposed as to the distribution of the profits of the Bank. at present, oue-half of the profits, not including the net earnings of the note issue which, as already stated, are payable into the revenue of the Commonwealth, will be placed to the credit of the Bank Reserve Fund, and the other half paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund. . One of the most important functions of a Central Bank is that of re-discounting, by means of which, under all ordinary circumstances, every other bank is able to convert its bills of exchange into legal tender money. "" During discussions which I recently have had with bankers, they made it clear that the righ t to get cash in case of need is of the greatest value to banking. Though some of them urged that more legal tender notes be issued, they said over and over again that all they really wanted was the right to get notes in case of need. Their attitude is quite understandable, because unexpected demands may reduce the cash reserves of the most prudent banker to an uncomfortable level. Moreover, whenever a slight monetary stringency manifests itself, there is a tendency for bankers to make every effort towards increase of cash reserves. Thus the stringency is aggravated, unless It is there is a Central Bank, and the business world is placed under more restrictions than the case really warrants. There can be no doubt that a strong re-discounting Central Bank exerts a steadying in fluence in this direction, because confidence is inspired by a knowledge that help is at hand, if needed. Of course the right to get cash from a Central Bank must be given with caution. Otherwise there might be undue expansion, followed by inevitable collapse. The safeguard lies in the power of the Central Bank-to increase its rate of discount and the responsibility of the Central Bank management in this regard is very great, because the whole of the business of the country is more or less under the influence of that rate. The Government .believes that it is proposing all that can be done by legislation towards bringing about a tine system of central banking, but recognizes that the success of the Commonwealth Bank, acting as a Central Bank, will depend on the skill and foresight of the new Board of Directors. Our bankers are not used to central banking, and the bill system is not yet highly developed in Australia. The whole matter must be left to the As new Board, which will be required to publish its discount rate only when it finds itself in a position to take up that usual function of a Central Bank. In the meantime, there will be nothing to prevent the making of advances to any bank on such terms and conditions as the Board thinks fit. The Government is satisfied, however, that from the outset the newlyconstituted Commonwealth Bank cannot fai l both to support and to co-ordinate the banking of Australia. Nothing in the P ill has direct reference to the handling of exchange difficulties. All that can be done in this direction is dependent upon the power of the central bank to give'assistance to the other banks, and to arrange, with proper safeguards, for the seasonal fluctuation of the amount of currency. These are matters, not for legislation, but for continuous management by au expert Board, which will from time to time take all necessary action after full consideration of all the circumstances, and which will be continuously studying the situation from the point of view of the public interest, rather than from the point of view of profit making. The Bill proposes that the Commonwealth Bank shall be placed in a position of such strength as will enable its Board of Directors appropriately to handle all banking and exchange questions as a Central Bank should. A provision has been inserted i Bill , requiring the Banks to settle asbetween themselves by cheques drawn the House. on the Commonwealth Bank. necessitate the keeping by each Bank of some funds with the Commonwealth Bank, adjourned. aud will tend to strengthen the central system. There is to be no compulsion as to the amount to be kept by any Bank at credit with the Commonwealth Bank, but it is hoped that confidence in the management will bring about the volunwish tary jnacing of considerable credits with the Commonwealth Bank, just as is the case with the Bank of England, which holds practically all the cash reserves the ordinary banks, and which, in the true sense of the term, is a bankers' bank. It is desired that the Banks shall quired to furnish statistics to a wealth authority. The proposal the details shall be arranged on a basis similar to that which has been used the past for statistics furnished to State authorities. I have now placed before members the proposals of the Governhas ment for the complete transformation the Commonwealth Bank ancl the Board into a Central Bank-a Banks-a Bank of issue, deposit, count, exchange, and reserve. that I have shown the wisdom and the necessity for the cihangcs, in order keep pace with the most modern of banking in other countries, and to enable our present difficulties of currency and of exchange to be overcome. sure that this change is calculated to Dr Earle Page. facilitate the national production and trade as far as that may be done by banking, and, though the proposed new Act will not work miracles, it will permit the ordinary laws of finance and economics to work as smoothly as possible, and without harshness, towards meeting the growing needs of this great Commonwealth. The changes have not been proposed because the Government has any feeling of dissatisfaction with or any lack of confidence in the present management. The Government believes that the in terests of the community have, within the circumscribed powers granted, been well served by the management, both of the General Bank and of the Not© Issue Department. But the time has come to place the Commonwealth Bank in the commanding position which, in the in terests of the whole community, a Central Bank should occupy, and I trust n the that honourable members will give the balances Bill a quick and easy passage through This will Debate (on motion by Mr CHAKLTON) NA REPORTS.",50
80,Mr S PEAKER,ADDITIONS TO HANSAR D,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). new --Before proceeding to other business, I to refer briefly to a request that the Treasurer made, in his speech on the Commonwealth Bank Bill , for the in clusion . in Hansard of certain matter of which was not read by him in extenso. I have been obliged to rule in connection with this subject three times within the be relast three weeks, and, consequently, I Commonhave inspected the records of Paris that liament relating to it . I find that the question of what may be inserted in in Hansard has an interesting and not unimportant history. Although it probably appears to honourable members very simple honourable to add here and there some matter that not been spoken by them, the reof cords of this and of the other House Notes show that past Speakers and Presidents Bank of have guarded .the privilege very jealdisously. I do not propose to detain honI trust orable members by enumerating the rulings that have been given, but I can to state their effect in this way: Broadly systems and generally, all such requests have been refused, except in two classes of cases. Past Speakers, with the apparent apI feel proval of members, have permitted Ministers' answers which are lengthy to questions on notice to go into Hansard unread. They have also permitted Budget tables to be included without being read. But there are' practically no other cases in which the insertion of unread matter has been permitted without the concurrence of the Chair and of the House. It is difficult, as honourable members know, to meet the convenience of either Ministers or members, and yet guard the accuracy of the reports of Hansard; and Parliament has endeavoured, with more or less success, to steer that middle course. There is no standing order dealing with the matter. Consequently we have had to rely, as we do today, on what is loosely termed "" Parliamentary practice."" has been the desire of some Parliaments that the Speaker should regulate the procedure in these cases, but to that course objection has been taken, and on several occasions former Speakers have asked to bo relieved of the responsibility of determining what unread matter should go into Hansard and what should not. They did that obviously to escape responsibility for establishing a system which might, as in some other countries, grow to an abuse. I think there are substantial reasons why the Speaker should not be asked to be the censor of Hansard. I need not enumerate them now. I think this question is one for the House, and not for the Chair, to decide. This House may determine the matter in one of two ways-eithe r by making a standing order, or by determining to continue the practice hitherto adopted, and by leave or by vote, dealing with every application on, its merits. If it were left to me, as Speaker, I would invite the attention of the Standing Orders Committee to the practice, in the hope that a standing order determining and regulating the procedure, would be brought up for the approval of the House. In the meantime, I suggest that in this particular case, without establishing it as a precedent, the request of the Treasurer be agreed to by honourable members, because of the information which the paper which was not read contains. If the House will give leave for the insertion of the unread portion of his speech in Hansard it will be inserted. I think that will be the best way out of the difficulty at this stage. Is it the pleasure of the House that the addition asked for by the Treasurer be made to the Hansard report of his speech? Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear ! NA LANDS BILL . In Committee (Consideration resumed from 4th June, vide page 1096}: The Schedule. Clause 41 agreed to. Clause 42If a new pastoral lease of any lands is gazetted as open for application before the expiry of the existing lease of the said lands the Board shall, other, things being equal, give preference in allotting the lease to the holder of the existing lease, whether that lease is under this Ordinance or under any Act or Ordinance previously in force in the Northern Territory, should he be an applicant for the It new lease:",53
81,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"(Northern Territory ) [2.40] - The House is entitled to some information respecting this clause, which gives a prior claim to the holders of the land at the expiration of the leases in 1965. In another place, Senator PeaTce saidProvision is made for the holder of an existing lease to have preference in respect of a new lease or portion of a lease where such new lease is made available before the expiry of an existing lease, and also in respect of any block for which he elects to be given preference if the existing lease is subdivided on expiry. During my second-reading speech I stated that the Bill would effectively lock up the land in the Northern Territory for the next century. In view of the fact that clause 58 practically gives permission to the holders of the leases to nominate their successors in those portions of land which may be resumed in 1935 or 1945, coupled with the fact that by clause 42 they have a further period of claim after the term of the leases expires, I cannot see how it is possible that any of this land will be made available to the public. The Honourable the Treasurer, whon discussing this question, stated definitely that it was known that the best of the land in the Northern Territory was locked up under the present leases. That being so, and in view of the fact that clause 5S gives a further extension, or right, for the lessees to nominate successors, and as clause 42 gives them a prior preference at the expiry of the leases in 1965, it is obvious that not only do the lessees get an extension after the year 1965, but that an extension is granted also to those persons who nominate successors to take over their leases should they be resumed in 1935 or 1945. I fail to see how the best results can be achieved from measures of this kind, and should like the Minister to explain this clause. The. remarks of Senator Pearce, when introducing this Bill in another place, made it perfectly clear that these people will have a prior claim at the expiration of the term of the leases. I view with alarm the fact that this clause, and clause 58, makes it impossible for any of this land to be made available to other people. I therefore move the following amendment:That the words "" other things being equal, give preference in .allotting the lease to the holder of the existing lease, whether that lease is under this Ordinance or under smy Act or Ordinance previously in.force in the Northern Territory, should .he be an applicant for the new lease"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" submit the land in question to a hallot of applicants."" I contend that in the disposal of these, vast areas which are becoming vacant, both at the expiration of the full term of the leases and also in the years 1935 and 1945, the people seeking land should at least be given the opportunity to participate in the land which will then revert to the Crown. My amendment merely provides that the whole of the land must be balloted for. Land in the Northern Territory must be treated differently from land in Victoria or elsewhere. In the thickly populated States large holdings are not to be found. There are in the Northern Territory blocks containing from 10,000 to 12,000 square miles of country of the very best type. therefore, obvious that only inferior land can now be thrown open for selection. The future residents in the Territory should be given at least a fighting chance to secure a portion of the good land that is contained in those 10,000-square-mileblocks. The acceptance of my amendment would not impose great hardship on the present holders. The Northern Territory is largely sheep country. Speaking on this Bill in another place, the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) saidIf we can transform this from a cattleto raising to a sheep-raising proposition, we immediately add tremendously to the populais tion in the Territory, create a demand for it . labour. . . . It was an eye-opener to me to see the splendid towns-such as Winton and Longreach-in the west of Queensland XiongThis reaeii has a prosperous, thriving population, Hying entirely on the sheep and cattle induslong tries. There are no other industries, no other Mr Nelson. resources, no other cultivation within hundreds of miles of it. The same conditions apply to Winton. If it is desired to .settle the Northern Territory with people of the Britishspeaking race, and make them contented, they should at least be given an opportunity to participate' in the ballots. It is admittedly fine sheep country, capable of settling hundreds of families even if the size of the holdings were limited to 100 square miles. Honourable members must be seized of the possibilities. The amendment is quite reasonable, and if the Minister accepted it , it would go a long way towards solving the problem of settlement in the Northern Territory. Progress reported. NA CUSTOMS.",54

It merely means that when a lease becomes due for resumption, the Board shall give a preferential claim to the existing lessee, other things being equal. The land is not tied up in any way, nor are other persons excluded from the opportunity of securing it . If the lessee is a good tenant, and is doing his duty, what harm can be done by allowing him to have the first refusal ? There can be no detriment the Territory if such a course is shall adopted. I do not think the amendment at all neoessary, and I cannot accept",55
84,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Wakefield) [2.53] provision has been in existence as as there have been Crown leaseholds. All the States have enacted it . It does not debar the Board from securing a more desirable tenant. Other things being equal, surely the man who pioneered the country ought to be given some preference! It is a further inducementand an essential one-to pioneering. hope that the honourable member for the Northern Territory will realise that it does not act disadvantageous^ to a genuine new applicant.",55
85,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Hunter) [2.54] Although I do not entirely agree with the amendment, I do not think it is fair to grant priority of claim to the holder of the lease.",56
86,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,That course would be followed only if other things were equal.,56
87,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"What is the meaning of the phrase "" other things being equal ?"" If the intention were clearly set .out, I could understand it . cannot say what is meant.",56
88,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"If the original lessee is an undesirable man, the Board need not grant him a renewal of the lease.",56
89,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"That right, but there is nothing in black and white to show it . What is a proper in terpretation of the words "" other things being equal "" ?",56
90,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,What would the honourable member suggest?,56
91,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"There should be some discrimination between the man who holds one lease which is expiring, and the man who holds several large leases, one of which is expiring.",56
92,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,In this case the principle of large areas is not involved.,56
93,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Ye s it is. lessee whose lease is expiring may hold half a dozen other leases covering a large area, yet under this clause he will have the right to a renewal of the expiring lease. The question is whether the best interests of the Territory will be served by allowing the holder of half a dozen leases to shut out a genuine applicant for a lease which may be expiring.",56
94,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Othe r things would not be equal in that case. The clause has been inserted to meet a case such as that which the honourable member has mentioned.,56
95,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,My point is that it does not meet such a case.,56
96,Mr MAXWELL,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Would not the same difficulty arise if there were half a dozen applicants, five of whom were entirely new men ? The Board would be obliged to pick out the two they considered would be the most desirable, and one of those two might be the man actually in occupation. The clause provides that in such circumstances he shall be given priority. I Surely that is fair?",56
97,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"If a lessee has half a dozen leases, and one is falling due, and if for that lease there are half a dozen genuine applicants who are not holders of any land in the Territory, but are desirous of settling there, surely they should have the right to go to a ballot with the man who has held the lease for some time along with half a dozen other leases. I cannot see why, in such circumstances, the occupier should have a preference over those who have no land. The phrase "" other things being equal "" does' not cover that aspect of the quesOne tion.",56
98,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"It has been inserted in the clause for the very purpose of covering what the honourable member wants it to cover. is quite Mr Charlton - I do not doubt that, but sometimes the words we insert in a Bill do not cover what we have in mind, and I do not think these words cover what I have in mind. In the near future there may be hundreds of people anxious to settle in the Territory, and it would be unfair to them, and also against the best interests of tha Territory, if they were to find that the land was all held by certain individuals. If the holder of a lease, who already has other leases can continue to hold on to it for a number of years, there will be no chance for other settlers to get land. The In the States the unjustifiable preference which has been given to certain people has practically disqualified others from getting land.",56
99,Mr MAXWELL,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Would the honourable member make a person who already holds a lease ineligible to get another lease so long as there is another applicant for it who has no land already?,56
100,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"I would make a man ineligible if he already holds sufficient land, and is not developing it in the best interests of the Territory. Mr MAXWELL,-That is begging the question.",56
101,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,It is - not. In many parts of Australia the lessees are not developing their land in the best in terests of the country generally. That is very undesirable.,56
102,Mr MAXWELL,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Hear , hear !",56
103,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"In such circumstances, there would be no equality between a new applicant and the present holder.",57
104,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"I quite admit that. This phrase-""Othe r things equal""-crop s up in other legislation, and has not given satisfaction. No one can determine whether or not other things are equal.",57
105,Mr GABB,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"It is a lawyer's phrase. - Mr Charlton - Yes . It has been introduced into industrial arbitration law, but in practice it has been found impossible to carry it out. In the administration of the Repatriation Act, where it occurs it creates a great deal of difficulty. Realizing that it is not likely to give satisfaction in the Northern Territory, the honourable member for the Northern Territory is asking the Committee to have its meaning made clear. If a mau holds large areas of land it is questionable whether he should have preference over any other person, and there is no reason why he should not be compelled to go to a ballot with other applicants for his expiring lease. Le t him take his chance with the others.",57
106,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,The ballot system is the most vicious system conceivable. should be the duty of the Lands Board to eliminate all undesirable applicants. It \ i created for that purpose.,57
107,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"I hope that the .honourable member realizes the difference between the amendment and what I am contending for . The amendment goes too far, to my mind, but at the same time. I regard the words ""other things being equal"" as unsatisfactory. Men who. hold large areas under lease should not have preference over genuine applicants for an expiring lease, but by means of a ballot should be put on the same level as these others. I would certainly give a man who holds one lease only; and has been doing good work on it , the preference for a renewal of his lease, but the case is entirely different when the holder of the expiring lease also holds five or six other leases.",57
108,Mr COOK,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,In such a case other things would not be equal.,57
109,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"That is just the point. Every honourable member agrees with me that in such a case other things would not be equal, but the officials administering the Ordinance would take it that a preference to t i e existing lessee was implied by this phrase.",57
110,Mr HILL,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,That would be quite right if the lessee had looked after his land satisfactorily.,57
111,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"But it would not being be quite righti f he was the holder of live or six other areas, and if a renewal of the expiring lease would prevent some genuine settler from having a chance to settle in the Territory. The man who is a holder o>f several leases should' not be given priority, or, at any rate, should ballot with others who are seeking the opportunity to take up land in the Territory. If the ballot system be not adopted in such cases, the Territory will be left in the hands of a few individuals. We are told that it contains a lot of land suitable for agriculture. If a - few people can lease all that land, provision should be made to give others an opportunity to get in when the existing leases expire. We want thousands of settlers in the Territory.",57
112,Mr MACKAY,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,There is no scarcity of land there.,57
113,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"The Territory contains certainly a large area of land, but the best of it has been taken up in large areas by certain people. If settlers are to be successful they must have a reasonable chance, and that canonly be It ensured to them if they are placed ,on suitable land. This clause would be an instruction to the administration that, in regard to a renewal, the holder of a lease that was expiring should have preference. I do not think that is right.",57
114,Mr MACKAY,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,How would you discriminate between one man who might be quite desirable and others?,57
115,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"That is the difficulty. How will it be possible to discriminate with this provision as to '' other things being equal "" ?",57
116,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"The Board will have, that responsibility.",57
117,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"The Board, interpreting the clause, will give the holder of an expiring lease the preference. Mt. M . CAMERON - And rightly so.",57
118,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"If that man had only one lease, I would have nothing to say against preference being given to him. But I do object to preference to a man who may be holding five or six different leases to the disadvantage of genuine intending settlers. If a man takes up a lease and spends time and money on improving the land, and is the holder of only one lease, he certainly should have preference in a renewal of that lease, or else receive compensation. Mr M . CAMEBON - Does not the honourable member think that the Lands Board would do the right thing?",57
119,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"I have my doubts, because the Lands Board must be guided by the language of-this clause.",58
120,Mr MAXWELL,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"It would be guided not only by the legislation, but by the conditions obtaining at the time as to the number of people looking for land and the land available.",58
121,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"I think the Board would so interpret this clause as to give preference to the man who held an expiring lease. I agree that the Lands Board should be guided by the conditions obtaining at the time, but in practice that is not always done. Wherever these words have appeared in our legislation they have been interpreted to mean preference for those holding existing rights. I want this matter to be put right so that the Board may be in a position to provide for new settlers in the Northern Territory. I believe it is possible, if we provide the necessary facilities, to settle as many people there as have been settled in the other States of the Commonwealth. It is all a question of expenditure. We shall have to spend the money either in the Northern Territory or in the other States. cannot expect people to take up land unless we offer them reasonable inducements. I do not agree with the amendment as drafted. The duty of the Board in regard to expiring leases should be more definitely stated.",58
122,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Wakefield) [3.10] Two distinct conditions are involved in this clause. In the early days of Lands Board administration- I speak of the practice 40 years ago-ther e were, no doubt, many doubtful transactions in land, but for the past 20 or 30 years the position has been quite satisfactory. The first portion of the clause refers to a pastoral lease-on e lease-that is open for application, and the provision that, "" other things being equal,"" preference shall be given to the holder of the existing lease, is an essential safeguard.. If other applicants for the lease had no land, and if the holder of the expiring lease had otlier leases, the Lands Board would quite properly say that the conditions were not equal, and this safeguard 4 in the clause would enable the Board to come to a just decision. All undesirable applicants will be eliminated, and it naturally follows that, if the original holder of a lease is not disqualified by holding enormous areas of other land, he should have the preference. The second portion of the clause deals'with an existing lease which, in the public interest, is being subdivided into several blocks, so as to ensure a large number of desirable settlers. In that event, other things being equal, it is right, from every point of view, that the original holder of the lease should have first choice. I have, never yet known a Lands Board to refuse the original holder of an estate that has been subdivided the right to one block:",58
123,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,I am not complaining of that.,58
124,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"That is what the clause provides. The provision, ""other things being equal,"" has been inserted as a result of experience of land settlement in all the States.",58
125,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Northern Territory) [3.15] - I submitted my amendment with a view to obtaining some information as to the effect of clause 58, about which I am very much concerned, and which deals with matters similar to those dealt with in this clause. The only thing I am concerned about is the making of land We available for settlement. I recognize, with the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) that the man who pioneers a lease is entitled to preference on its renewal, but the matter is not quite so simple in the case of the subdivision of a lease. There are many cases in which men hold five, six, or seven leases, each of an area of from 500 to 1,000 square miles, and in the event of the subdivision of any of those leases, I contend that opportunity should be afforded for the taking up of land by new settlers. This clause, in conjunction with clause 58, has given me great concern. I feel that I can now withdraw my amendment, as it can be more appropriately submitted when we come to deal with clause 58. Some of the best land in the Northern Territory is now locked up, and will remain locked up until 1935 or 1945, and it is doubtful whether some of it will be available for settlement even then.",58
126,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,I hope that many of the leases will be subdivided before then.,58
127,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"The Minister must bear in mind that no improvement conditions are to be imposed in any of these leases. Sub-clause 1 of clause 58 provides thatThe Minister shall, on the request ot a made at least two years before any date of resumption, in lieu of resuming any land held under a lease, permit the lessees to subdivide for closer pastoral settlement purposes(a) An area included in the lease approved by the Board as being equivalent to that which the Minister would be entitled to resume; and (6) Any further area. The clause goe3 on ^to define what the Minister may do in such cases, but in view of the fact that no improvement conditions are imposed, it may be a very simple matter for a pastoralist to find a person whom he can' nominate for the area resumed from his lease. That is the kind of case I want to deal with, and I desired to know whether the clause now under consideration, in conjunction with clause 58, would not have the effect of practically extending the tenure of existing lessees indefinitely. Now that the effect of this clause has been explained, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment with a view to submitting it when we come to consider clause 58. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Clause agreed to. Clauses 43 to 49 agreed to. Clause 50 (Surrender of existing leases in exchange for leases under Ordinance).",59
128,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) [3.20]. - This is the first of a number of clauses which embody the new principles sought to be introduced by this Ordinance. Under this clause holders of existing leases have three years .from the commencement of the Ordinance before being required to surrender their leases for new leases. This will give to Australian representatives of lessees like Vestey Brothers and others, who may have their head offices in somo other country, an opportunity to consult with their principals to see if they wish to apply for new leases."" In sub-clause 2 of the clause provision is made for consolidated leases.",59
129,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Whether the lands covered by the lease are in actual contact Or not.,59
130,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"That is so. In sub-clause 3 there is a definite recognition that improvements on existing leases exchanged for leases under this Ordinance are the property of the lessee. I think lessee (that the clause will offer great inducements to lessees to meet the desire of the Government to bring about some form of closer pastoral settlement, in order that lands in the Northern Territory may be put under sheep, and the productiveness and wealth of the Territory increased. Clause agreed to. Clause 51 agreed to. Clause 52 (Rental of leases exchanged for lease existing at commencement of Ordinance).",59
131,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) [3.22]. - Unde r sub-clause 1 of this clause the rentals of all leases under the new Ordinance issued in exchange for existing leases under both the present Ordinance and the South Australian Acts are fixed for the first period of the lease ending on the SOth June, 1935, the date of the first re-appraisement. As an additional inducement to holders of existing leases to promptly surrender their leases and come under the new Ordinance, it is proposed that the rents now being paid under those leases shall continue unaltered until the 30th June, 192S. After that date the rents determined by paragraphs a and h of the sub-clause will operate. Paragraph a determines-the rentals for each district that shall apply during the period 1st July, 1928, to 30th June, 1935, to all pastoral leases issued under this Ordinance in exchange for leases granted under South Australian Acts. It should be noted that in respect to these leases only a flat-rate rental has been determined. The reasons for that are that the bulk of the leases give absolute tenures ranging from sixteen to twenty years still to run at low rentals, without any reappraisement during thnt period, easy stocking conditions, and lock up large areas of the best pastoral country for the periods mentioned. In order to induce the holders of these leases to come under the provisions of this Ordinance, which provides for the resumption of half the area now held at stated periods, and more frequent re-appraisement of rentals, it wns considered necessary to prescribe a 9 flat-rate rental for each district. minimum rentals so fixed are greater in each district, 'with the exception of No . I V . , the Alice Springs District, than the average annual rental now being received from these leases, as may be gauged from the following figures. In No. I . District the area at present occupied under South Australian leases is 11,325 square miles, which yields an average annual rental of Is. 8d. per square mile. In District No . IT. the area occupied is 40,102 square miles, and the average annual rental is Is. 6d. per square mile. In District III . the area occupied is 28,446 square miles, and the average annual rental Is. 5^d. per square mile. In District IV . , the area occupied is 16,373 square miles, and the average annual rental 2s. 6d. per square mile. The reason for the high average in District IV . is that most of the leases in this district, comprising the tarea mentioned, granted under the South Australian Act of 1899, which provided for reappraisement at the end of the first 21 years. The present rents are the result of the final re-appraisement which was effected about three years ago. This paragraph deals with leases granted under the existing Ordinances, and prescribes that the rentals of leases exchanged for leases under this Ordinance shall be fixed by the Board in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause 2, and within the limits determined in paragraph b of sub-clause 1. The principal reasons governing the determination of these minima and maxima are as follow : 1. The Government is relieving the holders of these leases of a considerable financial liability by waiving certain obligatory improvement conditions attached to the leases, which have been found impracticable of fulfilment. 2. The granting of a fixed tenure on definite terms. 3. Specifying a limit to which the rent may be raised on re-appraisement; and 4. Granting a right of appeal against excessive rent and other conditions of lease. The present position regarding the lands held in each district under leases subject to the existing Ordinance is as foll o w : - In District I . , the area occupied is 19,693 square miles, and yields an average annual rental of 2s. 4d. per square mile. In District II . , the area occupied is 11,009 square miles, and the average annual rental is 2s. 1 per square mile. In District III . , the area occupied The is 28,791 square miles, and the average annual rental is 2s. lOd. per square mile. In District IV . , the area occupied is 23,095 square miles, and the average rental is Is. l i d . per square mile. Itwill be noted that these average rentals approximate generally the prescribed' minima, but it is also pointed out that certain leases in each district are now yielding rentals approximating the prescribed maxima. This occurs notably, in the Barkly Tableland District, and may be explained by the fact that these leases include improvements owned by the Government, necessitating increased rentals. A further concession to holders of leases under the existing Ordinance is contained in the proviso to paragraph 6, which empowers the Board to fix a minimum rental lower than that prescribed in this paragraph, where the quality of the land does not warrant the payment of the prewere scribed minima rates.",59
132,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Northern Territory ) [3.29] - Quite a lot of consideration has been given to the average rentals. It would be interesting to have a comparison of the average rentals under the Commonwealth Ordinances and the South Australian Acts.,60
133,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,I think that informa!tion has already been supplied.,60
134,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"I have not heard of it , and it certainly has not been given in this House. Under the Commonwealth Ordinances rentals of 5s. a square mile are paid, but under the South Australian Acts for similar or even better . land, rentals from 8d. to Is. 6d. per square mile are charged. I . fail to see why this discrimination should be made. Notwithstanding that the Minister emphasized the point that the Government are trying to induce the land-holders to come under the new Ordinance by giving them very attractive terms, I contend that the extension of these leases-which are fast expiring-to the year 1965, gives ample consideration to the lessees. In any case, the consideration meted out to leaseholders under South Australian Acts should not be greater than that given to existing leaseholders under Commonwealth Ordinances, or to subsequent leaseholders. The clause provides that in the case of the lease granted in exchange for a. lease granted under an Act of the State of South Australia, the rental in the Darwin . and Gulf district ahall be 2s. per square mile, and in the case of a lease granted in exchange for a lease granted under the Crown Lands Ordinance 1912-18, the annual rental in i i e Darwin and Gulf district shall be not less than 2s., and not more than 6s. per square mile. The maximum of the former is the minimum of the latter.",60
135,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Does not the honourable member see that in the first instance the clause deals with the leaseholder who has, under the agreement, surrendered portion of his lease.",61
136,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Does the honourable member contend that the Government must offer attractive conditions to induce the leaseholders to surrender their leases? Mr Foster.'-Precisely .,61
137,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Thos e were the best terms that we could secure.,61
138,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,The South Australian Acts are fast expiring.,61

140,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Non e of them have more than 21 years to run.,61
141,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Would you call those fast expiring leases. Mr NELSON.>-Certainly , especially when there is in existence an Act under words which the leaseholders can be forced to South Australia."" improve, their holdings.",61
142,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,The honourable member wants to retard the development of the Territory and the increase of its populasame tion. It is a shocking stand to take,61
143,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"I stand second none in the desire to participate i formation of a constructive policy for the Northern Territory, but I refuse to subare scribe to a stranglehold policy which w i lock up the land indefinitely.",61
144,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"The honourable member is simply doing that, and does not know it.",61
145,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"That is not so. There is a decided, preference shown in this clause. Notwithstanding that leases comprise the best holdings in Northern Territory, and that by surrenTerritory dering them and coming under the new. Ordinance, the lessees can gain an tension to the year 1965, they are also to receive consideration in regard tals. In No. 1 District, for the areas, held under the South Australian Acts, the maximum rental is to be 2s. per the land. square mile, but in respect of land held under the Commonwealth Ordinance lessees 1912-18 the maximum rental is to be 6s. per square ivile. It is not fair to discrirun. minate in that way. Then, in the Victoria River District, the rental in the case of a lease granted in exchange for a lease held under the South Australian Acts is 2s - 6d. per square mile, but in the case of land held under the. Commonwealth Ordinance it is not less than 2s., and not more than 6s. per square mile. There again is a distinction, which becomes greater in the Barkl y Tableland District. There, for leases granted in exchange for those held under the South Australian Acts, the maximum rental is 2s. per square mile, but in respect of land held under the Commonwealth Ordinance, it is not less than 2s., and not more than 8s. per square mile. There is no reason why one of two areas side by side should be rated at 8s, per square mile, and the other at a maximum of 3s. per square mile. The consideration which the lessees have been already given in the for m of an extension of the leases should be sufficient compensation for consenting to come within the scope of this Bill . I move That paragraph (a) of sub-clause (1) be omitted with a view to inserting in paragraph (6) after the figures ""1912-18"" the following :- "" or leases granted in exchange for a lease granted under an Act of the State of My object is to place, the whole of the lands in the Northern Territory on the rental basis. If settlement is to be up. encouraged all land-holders must receive to equal treatment. I have not much hope n the that the amendment will be agreed to because the big interests behind this Bill too strong, and they, will see that the l l party whip is cracked, in order to defeat my proposal. There can be no reasonable objection to an amendment which aims at placing the lessees under the South Australian Act and the Commonwealth Ordinance upon the same, footing.",61
146,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Wilmot-^Vice-Presithese dent of the Executive Council) [3.37] the The honourable member for the Northern is objecting to what he regards as preferential treatment of the lessees exunder the South Australian Act. If the Commonwealth had full control over all to renthe lands every leaseholder would be placed on the same footing, and the rental would be fixed according to the grading of But, unfortunately, that is, not the. position. The South Australian hold large areas of the best land, and. their leases have, still many years to",61
147,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Some of them will expire in eight years.,62
148,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"And other leases covering some of the best land have a currency of a further twenty-one years. We have made as good a bargain as was possible with the South Australian lessees, and if they have fared better than the lessees under Commonwealth Ordinances it is because they were in a position to drive a harder bargain. If the amendment were agreed to, and the lessees under the South Australian Act were obliged to pay higher rentals, they would probably decide that it was better for them to remain under the State laws, and, in that event, they could not be brought under this proposed Ordinance until their leases expired. Is it desirable that by such a policy the land they hold should be locked up for another twenty years, when we have some assurance that if the Ordinance in its present form is enacted they will - transfer, and subdivision and settlement will proceed?",62
149,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,If those lessees refuse to come under the Commonwealth Ordinance the Government can enforce the improvement conditions.,62
150,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Yes , but those conditions are not as stringent under the South Australian Act as under the Commonwealth Ordinance, lessees would have been prepared to make an easier bargain with lis. The Government will be very glad to hear any suggestions as to how a better arrangement could have been made for those lessees to come under the Commonwealth Ordinance, and have their land subdivided.",62
151,Mr FOSTEB,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Wakefield) [ 3 . 4 0 ] resent the insulting reference by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) to big interests and whip cracking. The honourable member would better serve the Northern Territory if he had a proper appreciation of the existing conditions, and did not seek to impose new conditions that would absolutely block development. There has been no whip cracking, and no external influence has been exerted upon honourable members in connection with this Bill . What the people of the Commonwealth most desire is the development and utilization of the Northern Territory. I am satisfied that the residents of the Territory will resent keenly the attitude of their representative when this Parliament is seeking by every means possible to promote settlement and development. In connection with the South Australian leases, the rental fixed is part'of the condition of surrender, and if that is not a sound principle, what is? If we interfere with that basic condition, which is to lead to the surrender of leases and increase the number of settlers, vie might as well tear up the Bill . The honourable member for the Northern Territory is wrong in saying that the South Australian leases are fast expiring. The South Australian Department of Lands, the Surveyor-General of which was formerly Surveyor-General of the Northern Territory, approves of this Ordinance, and the officials are surprised that the conditions offered by the Commonwealth have been accepted by the lessees.",62
152,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Northern Territory) [3.45] - It has been repeatedly stated during the debate that those holding the best land in the Northern Territory are making a sacrifice. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) knows that that is not the case.,62
153,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,That is the interpretation placed upon it by the honourable member.,62
154,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"The fact that the Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr At kinson) has said that something has to be done to make the lessees surrender supports my contention. The bulk, of the otherwise the leases are fast expiring, but under this measure the lessees can continue in possession until 1965. The Minister suggested that the lessees would not come under this Bill unless some inducement were offered, but the Commonwealth should be in) a - position to force them to act in a manner beneficial to the Northern Territory. Th?. - I - Minister is aware that those holding leaser under the South Aiistralian Acts can be compelled to' fence their holdings and comply with other conditions.",62
155,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,There are no improve^ ment conditions.,62
156,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,I say emphatically that there are. The Minister is confusing this question with that of resumptiona under South Australian Acts.,62
157,Mr ATKINSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,Improvemen t conditions are not imposed.,62
158,Mr NELSON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"I am not satisfied with the Minister's statement. Under the South Australian Act there are conditions, qiiite apart from those in relation to stocking, because the Minister stated thaii t was impossible for some of the holders to comply with the conditions imposed. Under the Commonwealth Ordinances the Government have the right to resume and to impose stocking conditions. holders ot the areas mentioned in the Bill will receive a big concession if their leases are extended to 1965. The honourable member for Wakefield said that I did not appreciate the position in the Northern Territory, but I have a fuller appreciation of the situation than has the honourable member. I am not representing the in terests of those in the Northern Territory whose cause the honourable member for Wakefield is advocating. I was sent here by the small pastoralists in the Northern Territory, and not by the Kidman in terests. This clause in its present form will act very harshly upon those who have to carry on under arrangements subsequently made, or who have taken up land under Commonwealth Ordinances. In some cases there is a discrimination representing a difference of 300 per cent, in the rentals to be paid for areas in the Barkly Tableland. The rental under the South Australian Acts is 3s. per square mile, aud under the Commonwealth Ordinance it is to be not less than 3s. and not more than 8s. per square mile. There is, of course, a proviso, which readsProvided that where it appears to the Board that the average quality and capabilities oF any land in any district, do not warrant the payment of a rental as great as the minimum rental prescribed for that district by this paragraph, the Board may fix a rental for that land lower than the minimum so prescribed. That provision refers only to the minimum, and hasno bearing on the maximum rental which may be charged. In ten or twenty years the value of the land may have altered considerably. The M in ister has stated that if the minimum is reduced the maximum is of no consequence; but such is not the case. The maximum under the South Australian Acts is 3s., and under the Commonwealth Ordinance up i o 8s. per square mile, The latter rate could subsequently be enforced if the Board thought f it . The rentals should' be uniform, particularly when the land is situated in the, same district, and is of similar productivity. The measure has been framed in the interests of those who are holding the best of the land in the Northern Territory.",62
159,Mr YATES,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Adelaide) [ 3 . 5 6 ] inclined' to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson), unless the Miuister in charge of the Bill (Mr . Atkinson) 'can give a valid reason for opposing it . It is provided that in the The case of leases granted in exchange under Crown Land Ordinance 1912-1918 the rentals shall range from 2s. to 6s. per square-mile. I should like to know why land in the same locality is not to be leased at a similar rental. I am rather in favour of the higher amount, because I think it is necessary that when the leases expire a higher rental should be fixed, and it is necessary to have a wider range. In sub-paragraph i of paragraph a of sub-clause 1 the rental in the Darwin and Gulf district is fixed at 2s. per square mile, whereas it is provided .in subparagraph i of paragraph b of the same clause that the rental i u the Darwin and Gulf district is to be not less than 2s. and not more than 6s. per square mile. In each instance the land is situated in the Gulf and Darwin district, and it may have the same potential value. Some valid reason ought to be given by the Minister for refusing to accept the amendment. A larger opportunity ought to be retained by the Commonwealth to charge, if necessary, the maximum for rental. In the first portion of the clause, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) has pointed out, the rentals will be fixed on a minimum basis. Why should any distinction be made between similar areas? Why should we specify the Darwin and Gulf District, the Victoria River District, the Barkly Tableland District and the Alice Springs District in one clause in a way that is different from that in which the same areas are dealt with in another clause? An opportunity is now provided to appraise the land at its worth. I do not accept the view of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Foster) that the proposed rentals will be on a bed-rock basis for all such leases.",63
160,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,They will be the bedrock of a bargain that is made for surrender.,63
161,Mr YATES,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,We are proposing to make a new bargain for surrender.,63
162,Mr FOSTER,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"And a good one, if the Committee will accept the clause as it stands.",63
163,Mr YATES,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"I cannot see why there - I am should be any objection to the amendment. I am inclined to think that the 2s. basis is too low. It will give to prior leaseholders, who have had the country for many years, land at the old rate, while new leaseholders will have .to pay up to 8s. per square mile for it .",63
164,Dr MALONEY,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Melbourne) [3.58]. - The discussion on this clause reminds me of th© time when the Mallee district of Victoria was leased for 2s. .6d. a square mile. I endeavoured to secure a provision so that a family could get one square mile.at the same rental, but the Conservatives of that day would not hear of it . The Lascelles group did good work in the Mallee, I admit, but they ought not to have been allowed to hold land at 2s. 6d. a square mile when the head of a family could not get it at the same price. The democrats of the time fought hard on the question, and the Age tried to prevent the unjust aggregation of large areas in the hands of a few people. The clause reads1. Where a pastoral lease existing at the commencement of this Ordinance is surrendered in exchange for a lease granted under this Ordinance, the rental payable in respect of the now lease shall, until the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred ana twenty-eight, be the rental payable under the surrendered lease, and thereafter, the rental, until re-appraised, in accordance with this Ordinance, shall be as follows . . . Here isi where the danger comes in , for the clause proceeds to set out conditions applicable "" in the case of a lease granted in exchange for a lease granted under an Act of the State of Soutli Australia,"" and in the Darwin and Gulf District - the rental is fixed at 2s. per square mile. I maintain that all leases should come under the same rule for reappraisement, and therefore I support the amendment. Every honourable member will admit that the Commonwealth leases are more just to the men who have smaller opportunities than to those who hold 15,000 square miles. rageous that when human beings are overrunning the countries of the earth, combines should be able to obtain, at a small nominal rental, 15,000 square miles of country.

165,Mr CHARLTON,NORTHERNTERRITORY CROWN,"Hunter ) [ 4 . 4 ] - I wish to direct attention to the question referred to by the Prime Minister today. of honorariums paid to certain officers of the Wool Committee. Members of the party sitting on this side of the House hope that the payment of these amounts will not be regarded as a precedent. It. is a dangerous thing for officers who axe paid to do the work of the Government, and are supposed to be adequately paid, to accept from the Wool Committee, or from any other body, a sum: of money for services rendered. I have nothing to say against the officers in question; they are very good officers, but their services should be rendered to the Government alone, not to some body outside the Government, and particularly not to a body like the Wool Pool, which made a clear profit of £30,000,000 over and above the flat rate of 15^d. per lb., which was considered to be a fair price for the wool. It is regrettable that the Government should have countenanced such a payment. That it did so is shown by the Commonwealth Gazette of the 19th February, 1920. - which readsPermission has been given for the undermentioned officers to accept and retain the amounts specified which have been granted by the Central Wool Committee in recognition of services rendered by them in connection with the Commonwealth wool scheme. The details of the payments are then given. It is not in the best interests of good government that officers of our public Departments should do any work for outside bodies, and I think that the Government of the day acted wrongly in permitI t is out- ting those officers to accept these sums. The transaction occurred during the regime of the Hughes Government.
