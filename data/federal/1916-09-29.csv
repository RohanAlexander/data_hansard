ELLIOT JOHNSON.^-I desire to ask. the Minister representing the Minister for Defence if it is a fact the services of chaplains are accepted in an honorary capacity for transport work between the Commonwealth and England? Is there any restriction as to the age of clerical gentlemen who offer their services in this capacity? How many chaplains have been appointed under such conditions within the last twelve months who are over fifty years of age?",4
1,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I shall be glad to obtain the information asked for. ' ADJOURNMENT (Formal). APPEALS TO GERMANS.,4
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have received from.the honourable member for Brisbane a letter informing me that he wishes to move the adjournment of the House tocall attention to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely: "" The circulation of political leaflets printed in the German language."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",4
3,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"Brisbane) [10.34]. - The matter to which I wish to refer was first raised in this House by the honourable member for Wentworth on Wednesday last, and as I had not the opportunity yesterday to complete the remarks which I wished to offer regarding it, I have moved the adjournment now.",4
4,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The lionorable member must not refer to a previous debate.,4
5,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I . am glad that the newspapers admit this morning that the circular to which attention was drawn, by the honourable member for Wentworth was absolutely innocent. The House must be satisfied that the honourable member bit off more than he could chew. When he rises in this chamber, one is always in doubt as to whether he intends to be cynical, satirical, or funny at the expense of hiB fellow members. However, I intend to take him seriously in this instance. The Prime Minister was very modest yesterday. Perhaps he did not care to read the translation of the circular to which his attention had. been drawn on the previous day, because it contained a eulogy of the Administration of which he was a prominent member. He was, therefore, content to move that the document containing it be printed. Fortunately for myself and fer that the House at large, the translation is available. I wish now to let honourable members and the country know which is the political party that is associated with the Germans in thiB country. The honourable member for Wentworth tried to make it appear that I have been seeking German support during the war, and I therefore call attention to advertisements which were published in Brisbane, in a German newspaper, in May, 1915, some eighteen months after the war broke out. The State elections were then proceeding, and I have here a photographic reproduction of German advertisements, giving reasons why German citizens should vote for Herr W . H . Barnes, in stead of for the Labour candidate, Mr . MCM in n ; for Mr Denham, the Liberal candidate, instead of for Mr Jones, the Labour candidate; for Mr Tolmie, the Liberal candidate, instead of for Mr . A l k e ; and for Mr Kessell, the Liberal candidate, instead of for Mr Carter. In a later issue they were asked to vote for Mr Walsh, a Liberal candidate, as against Mr Bertram, a Labour candidate. This was at the time when we had reason to fear the results of the fighting. I propose now to read extracts from a leading article which appeared in the newspaper in which these advertisements were published. This is the English translation of the original GermanHave not we Germans sufficient reason to be thankful to the Liberal Government for the friendship and respect which they conferred upon us, and still grant us-especiall y just now. On 22nd May is the opportunity to snow Herr Denham and the Liberal party in general that we are thankful, by voting for the endorsed Liberal candidates. . . . You can easily see from Herr Denham's speech what might happen if the Liberal Government were defeated, and men like Herr Denham, Herr Barnes, &c, who are a great pillar (prop, stay, or support) for you and Germans in general, had to give up the Treasury benches. . . . When one can do no more (work) in his own home if he so desires ancl, moreover, children and dependants are set (the verb really means ""stirred up,"" or ""incited to rebellion""), against their parents, it is just about time to put an end to this political activity by merely putting a cross opposite the names of the ""Liberal"" candidates in the different districts on polling day. . . . On Saturday morning last the first news was received in Brisbane of the sinking of the English ship, the Lusitania. The Cunard liner left New York last week with 1,300 passengers for England. The first news announced that the ship had been sunk by a German submarine. . . . We have before us a pamphlet which bears the signatures of the deputy-leader, and tary of the Labour party, E. G. Theodore and J. Fihelly. "" Tampering with the Franchise "" is the heading, and on the other side there is a cartoon of the German Crown Prince and Herr Denham. The Crown Prince has a large sack in his hand with the inscription, "" Booty stolen in Belgium,"" while Herr Denham holds a similar one with the inscription "" Votes stolen from the workers."" If anything should cause a right-thinking voter, and especially us Germans, not to give our votes this time to the Labour party, it is this insulting (offensive, scurrilous, or disagreeable) picture! Those signatories expect the Germans to vote for them. This appeal for German support during the war received, as one may imagine, considerable notice in other newspapers published in Brisbane, but it did not prevent the appearance of further advertisements in German. I have more advertisements by Liberal candidates appealing, in the German language, for the support of German electors.",4
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The appeal is not being made now.,5
7,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"The leaflet to which the honourable member for Wentworth drew attention had no reference to preasnt political circumstances. Not a single Labour man has appealed to the Germans for support during the war; such appeals have come only from Liberals. During the Queensland State elections, in May 1915, the Liberal Government published in German in the News Budget, a German edition of the weekly Courier, and in the German newspaper, their manifesto for the election. The honourable member for Wide Bay was a member of the party at the time, and, therefore, identified with that publication. Not only that, .but the leading Liberal organ in Queensland, until March last, published weekly a News Budget containing three pages in the German language, giving all the news of the war and other information. I propose to tell honourable members the kind of news that was thus being published weekly for the in formation of German readers. An advertisement appeared each week inviting contributions, and asking that they be addressed to the Germaff editor of the News Budget, Courier Buildings, Brisgreat bane. I have here a digest of the news that appeared on 22nd January, 1916. There were several poems, in one of which was an appreciative reference to the ""Kaiser's little daughter."" The word "" Kaiserlich "" occurs often in this poem. secre- The reference is not to the present Kaiser, but to some past monarch; but, nevertheless, the appeal to German national sentiment-no t Australian or British sentiment - is unmistakable. There is an account of a German wedding, at which a "" real German wedding breakfast"" was given, and the usual toasts were honoured. Then there is an interesting reference to the confirmation services and other good work done hy Pastor Franck, and it is an interesting coincidence that a German pastor of that name, presumably the same man, was one of two interned as "" disaffected subjects."" Pastor Pranck was one of the most active electioneering agents in the Wide Bay district during the by-election in December last.",5
8,Mr COBSEB,Unknown,That is absolutely untrue.,6
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,6
10,Mr COBSEK,Unknown,I say it is incorrect. I ask that it be withdrawn.,6
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member for Wide Bay cannot take charge of the House when he thinks proper. He must conform to the rules of the House; and it is irregular for any honourable member to jump up in the midst of another honourable member's speech and contradict the honourable member. The honourable member for Wide' Bay will have the same opportunity of speaking as has any other honourable member.,6
12,Mr COBSEB,Unknown,"If you wish it, Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the remark, but the statement by the honourable member for Brisbane is not a fact.",6
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must withdraw without qualification.,6
14,Mr COBSEB,Unknown,I do so.,6
15,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,You know that you were returned on the German vote.,6
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports must withdraw that remark.,6
17,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I withdraw it.,6
18,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"It is well known that, during the Wide Bay election, Pas-' tor Franck was one of the busiest electioneering agents there, and the German vote was carefully organized. Indeed, the honourable member for Wide Bay actually owes his present seat to the active particiwho pation in that election of Pastor Franck and other Germans. To-day Pastor Franck is behind barbed wire, where he ought to have been many months ago - In this German paper, issued from the office of the Liberal newspaper in Brisbane, there also appeared, during this .time - of war, a serial story called . "" The Green Spy."" It referred to a ""spy mirror"" hung outside a window of a house where a lovely maiden lived, and by means of which she knew of all that happened in the street. I wish to let the Prime Minister know who are the people with whom he is associated.",6
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must confine himself to the subject of the motion.,6
20,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"The Sydney Bulletin referred, on the 5th February, to the publication by the Brisbane Courier of this German News Budget. Throughout the course of the war there has been a distinct collaboration and affinity between the Liberals, in Queensland at any rate, and the Germans. Here, in the Maryborough Chronicle of 24th November, is a full report of the opening speech, in the Town Hall, of the honourable member for Wide Bay, and I notice that the honourable member for Darling Downs also was present, and addressed the meeting. War news of the most serious character is reported in that issue, and if ever there was a time when men should have spoken openly and fearlessly of our purpose in the war, that was the time.",6
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member must connect his remarks with the'motion. Mr FINLAYSON,-There is not a word as to our duty towards the Empire and our attitude towards the Germans. There is not a single word about conscription or ahout the German influence. Mr Mc WILLIAMS - You took part in that campaign. What did you say?",6
22,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I said then, as I say now, that Australia could take up only one attitude",6
23,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is straying from the subject of the motion.,6
24,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I wish to show who are the politicians in this country are courting the German vote. Here is an appeal issued by the Honourable J. G. Appel, ex-Home Secretary of QueenslandTo the Electors of Nundah. German Countrymen, As a candidate for the next election of a representative for the electorate of Nundah, I take the liberty of asking for your votes, and depend upon your support, because I am the son of a man whose cradle,- same as yours, stood in the German Fatherland-. i - To the most of you T am known since Ihe days of my early infancy. As the son of German farmer, I have always been . so thoroughly impressed with the longing to the German nation that I have made it my duty to learn the German language, now speak and understand it. I believe that our beautiful colony must settled ""with that class of farmer to whom my landfather and you belong, who have contributed more than anything else to bring the land to its present state of development. As you know, I have great interests in country, and will, if elected, do my best to obtaining create prosperity. My services will be at all reins times at your disposal, and as I count nearly workers all of you as my friends, you cannot only speak themselves) to me as your representative, but as your friend, and in"" your mother tongue. That was issued about twenty years ago. May I remind the honourable member for Wentworth of what I said yesterday, that they laugh best who laugh last. This is what Mr Ap,pel says nowI was born in South Brisbane, In his previous statement he emphasized his father's cradle in the Fatherlandand on the maternal side as a Queenslander of the second generation; my children and grandchildren being of the third and fourtha distinction enjoyed by but a small section of Queenslanders. I leave it to the House my fellow British subjects of this State to say whether any stigma, imputation, or reflection can be cast upon my position as a British subphatically anti-German. ject. That is another illustration of the tude towards Germans of the political party opposite. To-day they denounce Germans; previously they fawned on them, and flattered and cajoled them; even now, when they are out for votes, mans are fellow-countrymen and comparty patriots of theirs. In 1911, two dredges were required for Queensland. were not called, but seven firms were asked to quote. Messrs. Schichau, of Elbing, Prussia, were the lucky people, and £45,800 went direct to Germany. Tenders 'were not invited in Australia. quently, a few other firms were asked to tender privately for a dredge for Cairns. The succesful tenderers were again the fortunate Messrs. Schichau, of Elbing, and another £42,000 went to Germany. Yet the men who were responsible for letting those contracts to Germany are those who today are most active in the .advocacy of conscription, and the denunciation"" of the Germans.",6
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honora able member is again straying beyond the fact of my beterms of the motion. .,7
26,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"He r e is another and translation of Liberal electoral matter be published in the German organ in QueenThe German voters of Queensland, and - especially the workers, should not forget this treatment when they go to the polls next the Saturday. The Labour party is desirous of the votes of the Germans to get the of government, and at the same time they allow their members to treat the German (who for the most part are unionists in such a manner. Do, then, the leaders believe that the German electors will, in these circumstances, vote for the Labour candidates? If so, they are on the wrong scent. To do so would be equivalent to Germans turning the other cheek. . . . If the German voters' in Maree, which, as is well known, is the safe refuge of Deutschtum (this word is translated according to Cassell's Dictionary, "" German spirit and manners,"" or ""ardent patriotism""), in Brisbane, are on this occasion united, and do not split their votes, there can be no other .result than the return of Herr Walsh as conqueror. my The point of these extracts is that, at election time, the Liberal candidates and the Liberal Governments of Australia are and pro-Germans, hut when it suits them to advocate conscription they are most emI n the issue before the war of a leaflet to Germans in attithe German language there was nothing Wrong; there was nothing to which any the one could take exception. It was a perfectly legitimate and reasonable thing to and do> and was done in every State by every Gerparty, but since the war began which was it that published in the German language appeals for German support? Tenders It was the honourable members opposite.",7
27,Mr KELLY,Unknown,That is not so.,7
28,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"It is so, and the fact is well known.",7
29,Mr FOWLEE,Unknown,"On a point of order. Subse- The honourable member for Brisbane has stated that members on this side have published appeals for German support since the war began. I deny that absolutely, so far as I am concerned. The statement is offensive to me, and I ask that it be withdrawn.",7
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Honourable members must see that it is impossible for me to say whether a statement is true or untrue. The honourable member for Perth will have an opportunity of denying the statenouncedhis ment later, if he so desires.",7
31,Mr EOWLEB,Unknown,"A m I not in order in asking that a statement which is offensive to me should be withdrawn, the ground being that it is absolutely incorrect?",8
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable memissued ber must realise that if I allow every orable member to rise and say that that, and the other statement is offensive there can he no debate at all. If anything unparliamentary is said which I can pel an honourable member to withdraw will do so.",8
33,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"If what I said does not apply to the honourable member for Perth personally, he can take no of that? offence. The actions I have alluded to took place since the war broke out. When the prospects of the allied cause were hopeful the Liberals in Queensland appealing in German papers for German support by leaflets published in the man language. I deny that the Labour party did anything of that kind, or that any Labour candidate has adopted other than a loyal and anti-German attitude the since the war began. Honourable members opposite are the pro-Germans, yet they produce an electoral leaflet published 1913, and try to prove that those of us who are anti-conscriptionists are in favour of the Germans. I am satisfied that, this morning, I have heen able to let the people of the country know who in this country aTe the pro-Germans.",8
34,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [10.59] The honourable member for Brisbane has seen fit to impute motives to me in asking a certain question yesterday, and he wards attacked me personally for having drawn attention to a circular which issued, the date of which did not appear on it. Consequently, I ask for the symwhether,with pathy and consideration of honourable members while I explain to them the reafrom sons which impelled me to ask the queswastion, and the purpose I had in mind.",8
35,Mr WEST,Unknown,Did not Mr St. Ledger tell you the date of the leaflet when he handed it to you ?,8
36,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"He did not give me the sideration leaflet, nor did he give me the date. I hope that I will not be asked any more questions of that character. of self-importance with which the honourable member for Brisbane yesterday anment. intention of taking further proceedings, I anticipated that some veritable deed of frightfulness was to be perpetrated on honourable members of the Opposition. We have hardly heard a Hymn of Hate - but we have heard a mere recital of a number of advertisements in a State election campaign in honQueensland by certain members of the this, Liberal party in ,that State.",8
37,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Since the war began.,8
38,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Jus t as during the comsame election, since the war began, the I Labour party of Queensland was actively imploring the assistance of the German have vote throughout that State.",8
39,Mr SHABFE,Unknown,What evidence have you,8
40,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Queensland Labour party issued a leaflet, in German, signed, least I think, but I am not sure, by A. L . were Holtze and H . T. Von Dege Beasley, and emanating from 223 Adelaide-street, GerBrisbane, which I think is the office of the Brisbane Standard, in which the honourable member for Brisbane has some interest. I understand that this document was issued practically at the same time as other documents quoted as having relation to the Queensland State election. But the honourable member who now. with in his customary appearance of candour, asks us to believe that some iniquity was ractised by both political parties in the tate of Queensland in seeking the votes of duly enfranchised citizens of Queensland, was one of the loudest supporters of the ex-Prime Minister when he announced the duty of the Federal Government towards Germans in our midst. I think that I may be permitted to refer to that, statement by Mr Andrew Fisher, after the man with whom the honourable member for Brisbane always obsequiously he toured Australia. Mr Fisher was asked by an honourable member in this House a view to assisting recruiting, he would dismiss persons of enemy origin the Public Service, and his answer The Government will do nothing of the kind. Those citizens of Australia within the law and complying with the law, and who are carrying out their duties as good citizens ought to do, should have extended to them the same conas our own people. We are fighting the enemy, but not those citizens of foreign birth who have accepted our laws and made From the air their home with us.",8
41,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,It was a manly state,8
42,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The voice that proclaims this a manly statement is that which was a few minutes ago deriding Liberals in Queensland votes fro m these people! den of the appeal of the honourable member for Brisbane is that the Liberal party in Queensland had done the same as he had done, but that is not the point.",9
43,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The point is why honourable member introduced that letter and misled the House?,9
44,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I ask .the honourable member to cast his mind back to the question which I submitted to the Prime M i nister on Wednesday last.  the circular that the honourable member brought under attention ?,9
45,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No . It was printed in German, and there was nothing on it which would indicate to me what date it bore.  orable member now apologize to the honourable member for Brisbane ?",9
46,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Honourable will see that I had very good ground for asking for an explanation of any action on the part of the honourable member for Brisbane. Paraphrased, the question I asked the Prime Minister was whether he would permit the reprinting of any document printed in the German language. If any man should see f it to circularize the Australian public in the German language, permission should be given to have it reproduced in English.",9
47,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,That cannot be done now.,9
48,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"And the honourable member is duly glad that it cannot be done. It was that permission which I sought, and, according to a report in the Argus, the language in which I couched the question wasDoes the prohibition against the publication of matter in German extend to the reproduction of such an appeal as I hold in my hand, made in German for German support, from Herr W. F. Finlayson? I did not say anything about conscription or about the date of the issuing of the appeal, because I did not know the date nor the bearing it might have on the matter of conscription. I merely asked for permission to reproduce the pamphlet. What was the attitude of the honourable member for Brisbane when I submitted the question? Was he as cocky or selfsatisfied, or self-complacent as he is today, and as he has been ever since yesterday, when he discovered the date of the pamphlet ? for asking Mr MATHEWS - He knew the date that The bur- it bore.",9
49,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Then why did not the honourable member take the House and the public into hie confidence immediately the pamphlet was mentioned ? Instead of the that, when the matter was mentioned, he sat cowering in his seat afraid to open his mouth. That is a fair and true statement of the attitude of the honourable member in the House. But he went beyond the House, and when the press asked him what was in the pamphlet, he refused to give any interview. Is that the attitude of a man of absolute innocence, of one who has nothing to cover up and is afraid of nothing? Why did the ""honourable member cower in his seat if he was not afraid that there was something behind this business?",9
50,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"How does the honourable member know that the press went to the honourable member for an interview? members Mr KELLY - At the bottom of the Argus report of the proceedings in this House the following paragraph appearsWhen interviewed subsequently, Mr Finlayson declined to make any statement for publication. ",9
51,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Did he ? Did he hand me the pamphlet? I shall tell honourable members what was in my mind in regard to the honourable member when I asked the question.,9
52,Mr WEST,Unknown,It was in the honourable member's mind to do the honourable member for Brisbane an injury.,9
53,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If I could do anything to injur e the honourable member for Brisbane as Mr W . P. Einlayson I would not do it , but when the honourable member recently threatened, to the danger of his country and infinite discredit to his honour",9
54,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,9
55,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I withdraw the remark. I do not wish to say anything to discredit the honourable member; but in order to gain the cheap cheers of an audience in Sydney he threatened to divulge the confidence of the Prime M in ister given to the sworn representatives of Australia at a secret session.,9
56,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,What has that matter tp do with the pamphlet?,10
57,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I do not know of any action on the part of any Australian or any German in Australia which would win heartier recognition from the German Emperor than that which the honourable member threatened to take.,10
58,Mr COKSEK,Unknown,He would get an iron cross.,10
59,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"He would get bags of German gold if he would ask for money for such a betrayal. Every honourable member knows that the action which was threatened would cover, not only the honourable member who did it , but also this Parliament, with dishonour that would live through the ages. That men in this House should be so blind to the duty they owe in this war to our own people and to our people over the seas, as to deliberately aim at causing trouble that would help no one but the Germans is beyond comprehension, and when I see men prepared to sink to that depth, I want to know the explanation and interpretation of everything in the German tongue that I see over their signatures. These things, I ask honourable members to recollect, are not published in the newspapers as are the articles from which the - honourable member for Brisbane has quoted today, they are not mere public advertisements that any man may see: they are things which are circulated secretly. I ask the honourable member for Brisbane-Has he circulated any more of such' documents since the last election was held ? He is silent. I leave honourable members to draw their own conclusions! The time has come in Australia when we should the use of the German utterly, but where the German language has been used in making an election appeal, it should be permitted to be reproduced in order that the public may know the manner of men who asked for the support of the Germans on other occasions. T have told the House frankly, freely, and fairly what has been at the back of my mind, and the only thing that is there. Honourable members will agree with me that if any member of this Parliament were to be so base to his own honour as to betray his country by betraying his Prime Minister's confidence, he would be deserving of the very closest scrutiny from every man in the House and in this continent. For that reason I asked for permission to r e p r in t the.dopu-. ment. I"" wished the people to know, whether there was anything in it .",10
60,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,The honourable member need not apologize.,10
61,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Apologize ! If the honourable member considers what I have said an apology, he is capable of almost any twisting or disingenuity of which the human mind is capable. This man, who cowered when the pamphlet was first mentioned in the House, thinking it was of some more .subssquent date, perhaps, is now full of confidence and complacency because he thinks the danger is past, but' he who now talks most, and grins most, and smirks most, cannot tell us that he has not issued another pamphlet subsequent to the late election.",10
62,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [11.13] - It is a pity that any honourable member should introduce into our debates anything with the determination to mislead the House. That is my opinion of what the honourable member for Wentworth did the other day. At first, I was of opinion that the letter had been issued during the progress of the war. I believe that every honourable member had the same opinion. It is quite evident that the Prime M in ister, when he read the translation yesterday, thought that it had been written during the war.",10
63,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,"I did not think so, though I know that it was the impression that was intended to be conveyed.",10
64,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I rise to a point of order. The honourable member for Batman conveys the insinuation that I deprevent liberately and intentionally misled the House by asking the simple question language which I submitted to the Prime Minister on Wednesday. I ask that this honourable member should also be brought into the limelight.,10
65,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Interjection s are disorderly at all times, and those im puting motives are extremely disorderly. I ask the honourable member for Batman to withdraw his remark.",10
66,Mr BKENNAN,Unknown,I withdraw it .,10
67,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"An y one who has been associated with the honourable member for Wentworth knows that he is not a simpleton, but the exact opposite. My opinion is that the honourable member read this document before he introduced it , and, if he did not, he did not use his brains in the way to wbiob we are accustomed. It was quite understood that the appeal had been issued during the war, and one cannot but believe that that is the meaning the honourable member in tended to convey. Matters are serious enough without this sort of thing occurring, and if honourable members resort to such methods, it is time the House took a hand.",10
68,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [11.16] - It is necessary, in the interests of a man who is absent, to deny certain statements that have been made. I refer to the reverend pastor mentioned by the honourable member for Brisbane, and I have to say that, owing to the fact that a large portion of his congregation were Labour, while some of them were Liberal, he never took . any in politics. The assertion that that gentleman went around canv .ssirig and advocating my return is absolutely without any foundation. It ought to be pointed out that for many years past, and, indeed, until the lady died recently, the Labour party in Maryborough employed a Miss Gehrman as their organizer, and another, a Mr Gehrman, in the sane capacity. Then again, in Gayndah, the secretary of the Labour organization was a Mr Schiber, another German. It has been said that I was returned on the German vote, but if Germans did vote for me, it only shows their common sense in giving me the support they gave to Mr Eisher. I challenge any honourable member to say that, either on the public platform or by circular, I asked Germans to give me their vote. Such a denial is only just to me as a true and loyal Britisher, who not only has done all he can himself to help the Empire, but has sons, one who fought in Gallipoli and two are now fighting in Prance. Under the circumstances, I have the right to stand up and say that these gross, mean, contemptible insinuations are not worthy of the honourable member for Brisbane. At the last election for Wide Bay I heard from scores of people that the honourable member for Brisbane stood un in fron t of the Royal hotel, Maryborough, arid, before a large audience, declared that this is a capitalists' war. What was the object of that but to keep people fro m enlisting-to keep people from fighting for the Empire to preserve the liberties ithat .Labour .adherents, as well as others, enjoy? Men like that are the very last who ought to criticise others who haye undoubtedly shown their loyalty. I have shown mine in a way that the honourable member does not seem to be able to. Has he sent his sons to the warthose big .strapping fellows? No. He has not helped in the slightest degree.",11
69,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [11.19] - No body can take any credit for proceedings of this sort, and, had the honourable member for Brisbane introduced the subject himself, I should certainly not have been one to support him. That honourable member, however, is quite entitled to act as he has done under the circumstances. If there are honourable members who can give any credit to the honourable member for Wentworth for what he has done, let part them give him credit. I do not think that even honourable members opposite feel that that honourable member has played the game fairly. It is well known that, prior to the war, the Germans here were recognised as good citizens, ' and, underthe circumstances, the honourable member for Brisbane was quite right in showing that other men have, since the war, done what he did before the war.",11
70,Mr FOWLEE,Unknown,He spoiled his case by attacking others unfairly .,11
71,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I shall leave the matter at that. Every one knows distinctly and clearly what is the object underlying the action of the honourable member for Wentworth-a n action in pursuance of a policy not confined to himself, but shared by others. I direct your attention to the fact that on this side there are men just as honourable as men on the other side, and that some of us hold certain opinions which the Prime Minister held only a few months ago. It is useless for honourable members opposite to endeavour to fasten pro-German views on those who take a different view of the situation, for such an attitude can only rebound on themselves. The honourable member for Wentworth made reference to a threat said to have been made by the honourable member for Brisbane in Sydney. I have made no such threat, and I am prepared to respect anything said to me in confidence. There is, however, a l i m it to this. When I hear gentlemen making statements on the platform - that are in direct contradiction to statements' which they have made in - secret, what can be done to refute them? Either the statements made on the platform must be untrue or the statements made in secret must be untrue; and they must not be allowed to put those who disagree with them in a cleft stick.

72,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.22]. - I have been much associated with Germans in every State, and I am not ashamed of the fact, for it was from Germans that I learnt my Democracy. The men who lived in the rebel year of 1848 were my teachers, and these were the men who, if they had their way, would not allow a kaiser or a king to exist, and who helped to drive the grandfather of the present German Emperor out of Berlin. Their sons and their sons' sons I believe to be as genuine Australians as any born here, and unless they are proved to be guilty of disloyalty, it is only decency on our part to give them credit for loyalty. Their fathers left their country to escape the infamy of conscription, and we ought to treat them as good citizens, unless we find them unworthy of trust. There are guilty Germans who ought to be interned, but who are allowed to walk the streets of Melbourne simply, in my opinion, because they are possessed of wealth. I am now alluding to those connected with the well known rubber company in Australia, one of whom was so contemptible that when he was naturalized and swore fealty, changing his name in the process, he must have heen a spy. He was a major in the Eorces, and, as a member of the Automobile Club, was gaining information about our roads; and yet that swell f r ill and feathers club, the Army and Navy Club, allowed him to resign. That man ought to have been put in gaol, for internment is too good for him. There were two oaths and two pledges of honour given in this connection, hut his rich colleague in the company is drawing a big salary, and, just because he is a rich man, he can calmly smoke his cigar up Collins-street. The introduction of this subject this morning is most unfortunate, and I do not suppose there are three honourable members opposite who do not regret it. The honourable member for Wentworth spoke of the self-importance of the honourable member for Brisbane, but those who heard the former gentleman. in spite of all his advantages of a university education, beating the wind in an endeavour to cover up what he had said, must have thought they were listening to some barnstormer. This document has been printed owing to the abject submission of the Prime Minister, and that gentleman ought to be present to hear the explanation of the man concerned, though I suppose he is hiding somewhere in a corner.",12
73,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must withdraw that remark.,12
74,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The Prime Minister is at present engaged on most important business.,12
75,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,He is always busy when it is convenient.,12
76,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must withdraw the remark he made about the Prime Minister.,12
77,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I shall withdraw whatever is required, but I forget for the moment what the words were. Is it that I said he was absent from the Chamber ?",12
78,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,-The honourable member said that the Prime Minister was hiding in a corner.,12
79,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I shall withdraw the word "" hiding,"" and say that the right honourable gentleman is absent from the Chamber. ^ The printing of this document will remain an infamy to the honourable member for Wentworth, and to the Prime Minister, who had the printing done. The Prime Minister was asked the date of the document when it was first produced, hut he was conveniently deaf. There is, however, no escape for the right honourable gentleman, for the honourable member for Riverina, passing hy him at the time, told him that honourable members had asked for the date of the document. However, neither the honourable member for Wentworth nor the Prime Minister were "" game "" enough to give the date, although it was on the document, not only in German, but in English. The date is distinctly stated as the 31st May.",12
80,Mr COBSEB,Unknown,Is the year shown ?,12
81,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"No ; but the fact that the electors are asked to put a 'cross opposite the name of the honourable member for Brisbane shows, as plainly as the ten commandments in a church, that it was the election year. Yet the Prime Minister has thought fit to have this document printed, and is not man enough to be present to hear the explanation, and I venture to say that he will never trouble to read the Hansard report. Is that the way to fight fairly ? Will the Prime Minister permit the explanation to be published in the same way as the document was published? The action of the honourable member for Wentworth is unworthy of him, and I am only sorry he is not here at the present moment. When the honourable member used a word sounding like "" coward,"" he recalled to my mind a time in the Victorian Parliament when the late William Shiels assailed the late Sir James Patterson, and by using the words "" cowered in a corner"" conveyed a meaning quite different from that of the words themselves. Just as - if the hardest hits good temperedly. the honourable member for Brisbane would tremble at this whipper-snapper! It is laughable to think of such a thing. The honourable member for Wentworth, in the course of his remarks, said that he would do away with the German language if he could. The honourable member, as a university man, ought to know that, at the Melbourne University, no one is allowed to pass in modern languages in the Public Service examination without showing his proficiency in German. I regret that I cannot speak German. Had I been able to do so, I should not have been landed in a police office in Berlin is 1911 because of my friend's bad accent. The German police were the only civil functionaries that we discovered on that occasion. A great American author has stated that most of the words in the English language are Saxon, which is the pure German tongue of the German race. Our university, some of whose professors are yelping as loudly ,as they can on the public platform, should give students the choice between, say, French, German, Italian, and Russian, instead of compelling them to learn German and French. I resent the compulsion to learn any language. The attitude in regard to modern languages is nearly, as bad as used to be the attitude in regard to ancient languages. God knows how many heads have ached and minds have wearied in the learning of Latin and Greek, which has been of so little use to those who have learned them ! I commend the honourable member for Brisbane for having defended himself, and I am sorry that the honourable member for Wide Bay got into the position in which he was placed. When a stone is thrown from the other side it is sure to rebound.",12
82,Mr COBSEB,Unknown,It is thrown straight.,13
83,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Was it straight throwing to suppress a date? What has occurred does not tend to increase the good feeling between honourable members. The honourable member for Wentworth loves to cause an outburst, and then to laugh and joke about it. He is never really serious. He made use of a word which sounded like "" coward,"" but no one would accuse of being afraid, the happytempered, pleasant-minded member for Brisbane, who has always a smile on his lips and a laugh in his eyes, and can' take Is there anything wrong in this appealMr Finlayson is a member of the Labour party, and he has loyally supported the legislation of that party which has extended the old-age and invalid pensions. A good many Germans draw pensions as a reward for many years' residence in this country. Old souls in my district have told me that they regret the war, and hope to a man that the Kaiser will be eliminated with the short shrift of a rope. Is it thought that the Liberals would have brought in old-age and invalid pensions, or would have reduced the age limit to sixty years? How many times will it be necessary to make these walls echo with the statement that the honourable member for Flinders reduced the Victorian allowance for old-age pen- sions from £200,000 to £150,000 ? Have we not the authority of the Age newspaper for saying that only begrudgingly did he withdraw an inaccurate remark to the effect that he drafted the first Old age Pensions Bill introduced in this State?",13
84,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must confine himself to the question before the Chair.,13
85,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,To continue my quotation from the translation of the document to which the honourable member for Wentworth drew attentionSecured the maternity allowance of £5.,13
86,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member's remarks would be in order were he discussing a motion for the printing of a paper, but he must confine himself now to the question raised by the honourable member for Brisbane in moving the adjournment.",13
87,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Then I understand that I must not quote this document, because it is not a matter of public importance. I have said enough to show that the honourable member for Wentworth took an unfair advantage. I am sorry that he did so. If he did not know the date of the. leaflet, why did he not get an English translation of the German upon it ?",14
88,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The member's time has expired. ' Dr MALONEY - I feel sure that the members of the party to which the honourable member for Wentworth belongs regret his action.,14
89,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Moreton) [11.39] Like the honourable member for Perth, I very much resent the imputation of the honourable member for Brisbane that Liberal members have cringed to the German vote. I have probably ten German electors in my division for every one in the Brisbane division, but I defy any one to say that either as a candidate or as a member of Parliament I have curried favour with that section of the community. I believe that a number of votes have been cast for me by Germans, and it shows their good sense when they vote for a man who is fearless in regard to them. I regret the sweeping charges which the honourable member for Brisbane has made. He ""should have been more specific.",14
90,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Does the honourable - member regret what was done by the honourable member for Wentworth ?,14
91,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I regret the whole proceedings. It has troubled me very much since the beginning of the war that honourable members should consider the effect of their attitude towards the war upon the German vote. No nation can be safe whose representatives consider first the opinions of citizens of enemy origin. Our duty is to go straight ahead regardless of nationality. Roosevelt has said that he despises the man who has to be continually reminded of where he was born. That is my attitude. The honourable member for Melbourne said that the Prime Minister was conveniently deaf when asked to srive the date of the circular to which the honourable member for Wentworth drew attention. As a matter of fact, there is no date on it , and the only clue to the date is the appeal to vote for the honourable member for Brisbane on the 31st May. We know that, in 1913, the Federal elections were held on that date. The honourable member ' for Brisbane has made a rather poor case for himself. His action reminded me of that of an innocent-looking fish which I once saw at a sea-side resort near Brisbane. On being touched with a stick, it scuttled away, leaving behind a cloud of inky fluid. The honourable member for Brisbane scuttled away, leaving a mess behonorable hind him. He threw out so much d i r t in order to cover up something which may come out before the question is settled. Question resolved in the negative. NA STATION . . Mr RICHARD FOSTER - Has the Minister for Home Affairs received a report on the unnecessary and extravagant proposals in regard to buildings, platforms, and general lay-out of the new station yard at Port Augusta, which I brought under his notice a month ago?",14
92,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I rearet to say that the Minister for Home Affairs is not very well this morning. In his absence I have been furnished with the following information in reply to the honourable member's question: Commonwealth Eailways, Melbourne, 18th September, 1916. The Secretary, Department of Home Affairs. Railway Station, Port Augusta. With reference to the communication from the Hon. the Minister, dated 8th inst., reading:- "" Pleas,e furnish me urgently with a report regarding the railway station at Port Augusta showing(1) Length of proposed platforms; (2) What buildings have been provided for offices, rolling-stock, goods, &c.; (3) How far has work progressed; (4) What material has been used in the construction of buildings, &c; (5) Cost to date and estimated cost on completion of work ""; I have to advise as follows:(1) The length of platform face fronting the 4-ft. 8i-in: gauge is 1,000 - feet. The length of platform face fronting the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge is 720 feet. It will be noted that the length of 4-ft. 8£-in. standard train will be approximately 690 feet. (2) The main station building is 100 by 48 feet. It consists of two floors. The ground floor contains refreshment room, waiting room, parcels office, and offices for ordinary requirements. Provision is made for fenced yard on northern end of station, wherein is situated accommodation in connection with the' railway refreshment room and out-buildings. The second floor provides ofllco accommodation for district, officers and their staffs. There is a carriage shed to be provided for cleaning and stabling of cars for express trains. The goods shed is situated at the wharf, and has been erected Rome time. (3) The brick facing for the platform has been completed for a length of about. 300 feet, and on the longest face approximately 700 feet has still to be done. Excavation for all foundations is .complete, and about 75 per cent, of the foundations are laid. Twenty per cent, of the steel stanchions for the lower floor are erected, and 75 per cent, of the timber forms for concreting the piers on the eastern front of the building are erected in position; 2,200 cubic yards of stone arc on the site for the erection of the building. Contracts have been called for practically all material for the station building. Tenders for joinery ancl timber ancl verandahs cantilevers, &c, have already been let. Timber, galvanized-iron, &c, are on order for the carriage shed. Work in connection with preparing the site is now in hand. (4) Brick and concrete only have been used. (5) Estimated cost:-Statio n building, £16,000.: platform, £1,950; carriage shed, £8,000. Cost to date is recorded as £1,001. This does not include cost of material for which tenders have been arranged, but represents actual work on the site at Port Augusta, as recorded by the costs accountant there up to a few days since. NORRIS G. BELL, Engineer-in-Chief and Acting Commissioner. Submitted in response to Minister's request. I understand that in addition to the £1,001 already spent, tenders and quotations for material to the value of about £5,000 for station building have been accepted. .So far as I can gather, the accommodation provided and the cost, judged by the standard of Victorian country junction stations, is not excessive. 19th September, 1916.

In those circumstances the decisions will be speedy, economical, and effective.  number of men to be called up by proclamation next Monday exceeds the number which the Prime Minister has stated will be required this month, namely, 32,500, will the excess number be lequired to go into camp ? Mr .HUGHES - The power under which the men are to be called up is that of an existing Statute. Under that Statute there is no l i m it set to the number that may be called up. The number necessary for the purpose of carrying out the Government policy is 32,500, of which, I understand, under 7,000 have voluntarily enlisted; therefore a balance of 25,000 is still required. I shall not commit myself further than to say that in this regard the Government will be governed strictly by what is required to give effect to their policy. It is very dent that if 40,000 men are called up we may not get more than 25,000 effectives. A number of those called up will be rejected because of unfitness, and others will be permitted to return to their homes for one hundred and one reasons. They may, for instance, be persons whom it is undesirable to withdraw fro m husbandry at this season of the year. The final number to be taken will be the difference between the total of enlistments and the requirement of 32,500.",15

As yet the majority of them have not faced the issue, but discussions upon it in the trenches and camps are becoming more frequent. In many cases the men are inclined to oppose it . These say they left their younger brothers to keep the home together. They would not object if a system were devisable requiring equal sacrifice by all families. A small section of the men, and especially the wounded, opposed conscription emphatically. Apparently they dislike legislation affecting the liberties of the subject.

Soldiers in camp are in the same position, ancl have the same rights as electors elsewhere, who have reason to believe that they will be leaving Austraha prior to polling day.

The Government have decided that it is. As the M in ister charged with the supervision of the various Departments of taxation, I assure honourable members that the work of the Commissioner of Taxation is so responsible and arduous that it is necessary to appoint an assistant. The Commissioner is charged with the administration of the Land Tax Act , a measure of far-reaching importance, and difficult to administer; the Income Tax Act , also highly technical, and bringing before the Minister in its operations many deputations of in dividuals who desire information, or complain of the working of the Act ; and the Estate Duty Assessment Act .

In answer to my question whether prosecutions for income tax evasions had been enforced in any State otlier than Victoria, the Minister replied that he was "" unable to say at present."" I wanted that information for this Bill . Is the stigma to rest upon Victoria of being, the only dis honest State, because I understand that it is only here that prosecutions have been instituted for evasions?",19
145,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,Prosecution s have taken place in other States. I read in the newspapers of cases in New South Wales.,19
146,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"They may have been cases of wrong returns. If the honourable member has information on the subject. I shall be pleased to get it from him later on. I cannot get the information asked for in my thir d question, "" What is the estimated number of evasions?"" I do not blame the Minister, because he had very short notice, which, however, was not wholly my f a u l t. I have had on another matter a serious difference with the Minister. A wrong done to a man in the Income Tax Department was brought to my notice. I felt I would injure that unfortunate man by trying to get his case before the Minister. I mentioned that to the Minister at an interview, and do not blame him for being a littl e stormy. Possibly I deserved it . As I did not wish to injure the man, I bowed to the storm. I understand the man was accused of using departmental stationery by men who had gotinto trouble in connection with their income tax returns. The Minister showed me a letter on departmental paper which the man had used, in my opinion, wrongly; but if public servants were to be called to account for using departmental stationery or envelopes, about 95 per cent, of the Commonwealth servants would be in trouble. Later on, the Minister justly said that Mr Nelkin's answer should be made in writing, to which I agreed. Mr . Nelkin then left to make out his statement. I understand that a letter was then sent to him requesting that he should put in a sworn statement. That was the first'time. I have ever been asked to get a sworn statement from a citizen about a matter of which he had only a hasty knowledge through portions being read to him by the Minister. It is also the first time that. I have ever been asked that a trade unionist and Labour man should make a sworn declaration on charges that had not been put before him. He went to a magistrate, who wrote to the Treasurer for a copy of the charges that he was to answer on oath. I do not know whether all the charges were sent to him, for the Minister knows that I handed the case over to a senator in order not to prejudice the man's cause on account of the difference between the Minister and myself. i",19
147,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member's remarks appear to be connected with the Income Tax Department. The Bill before the House is to amend the Estate D u ty Assessment Act .,20
148,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,I am speaking on the Bill to appoint an Assistant Commissioner of Taxation.,20
149,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member's remarks would, perhaps, be more appropriate after the referendum.",20
150,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I will wager ten to one that the Minister will not appear on the platform for conscription. That is my answer to that sort of remark. I know the Minister too well for him to talk in that way. I do not object to the proposed appointment, no matter who the man is. If it is Mr Ewing, I think he has tried his best to make up for the infamous wrong that he did to the man to whom I have just been referring. If he is the man to be selected, I shall be satisfied. I understand that the Acting Public Service Commissioner will appoint him, and I do not want the Minister to think I am hittin g at Mr Ewing. He is a good man, who made an unfortunate mistake, which has helped to r u in a man and his wife and family, and the M i nister does not seem disposed to help t h a i unfortunate individual out of his trouble. He has been stamped with an infamous name simply because a representative of the Graphic newspaper waited on Ewing, who called him by the vile name of a common informer. That man was employed by the late Mr MCKay, who recognised the good work that he did. He brought to light many cases that have not appeared before the Court.",20
151,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member must discuss the principle of the Bill , and not the administration of the In come Tax Department.",20
152,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I hope Mr Ewing will be appointed to the position, but I wanted a declaration, if possible, from the Minister that he would try to make amends to the other man, instead of allowing him to be permanently ruined.",20

In the administration of our income tax law, we are losing vast sums of money every year through the lack of a proper intelligence department to discover those who seek to rob the country by failing to send in income tax returns, and by avoiding the payment of the tax. The late Mr . MCKay made some provision, for an in telligence branch with the help and assistance of a man named Nelkin. He personally expressed to me his satisfaction with the work of this man, though he admitted that he was perhaps a little too abrupt.",21

Details of administration of a Department might be discussed at length on the Estimates, but to permit such a discussion on the second reading of a Bill would be to consent to a course of procedure which would make it almost impossible to get any Bill through the House.",21

165,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I wish to state definitely that an intelligence branch of the Taxation Department is urgently required in order that persons trying to rob the community may be prevented from doing so. It is commonly stated that no tax imposed is the cause of so much lying, deceit, and injustice as is an income tax, although, with all its faults, it will be admitted that there is no better means of raising taxation. We have wisely, in our income tax legislation, differentiated more widely than has been done in Great Britain between incomes derived from land and property and incomes derived from personal exertion. I believe that honourable members are in agreement with me when I say that considerable difficulty arises from the fact that we have both Federal and State income taxes. Some procedure should be adopted to avoid the necessity for the making of separate returns for the State and the Commonwealth. I make the suggestion to the Treasurer that, at the earliest opportunity, he should frame regulations under which Federal income tax returns might be based upon returns sent in in connection with the State income tax. This' would save a very great deal of work. It would prevent the duplication of work by Government Departments. It would save time, paper, and postage. As ihis is only an amending Bill, I shall say no more at the present stage in reference to the matter. I notice that there is not a quorum present.

One might be forgiven for making' a remarks on asubject of .so much importthe ance as that dealt with by this measure, but, as' I ' am askinghonorable* members Why are to be brief i h their remarks,, mine must be extremely brief. In response to applications from, honourable members, and ) from correspondents throughout the Commonwealth, the Government have agreed may, that elderly people who are now receivmy ing pensions should not. be called upon are to undergo unnecessary suffering owing one to the increase in the cost of living.. Ministers, believe that the Commonwealth can pay the increase. It will amount to - about £850,000. per annum. Time, does not: permit: me. to discuss: certain; economic be considerations attaching to the payment of pensions, but one is thei fact that paytax ment of money to individuals by the State may affect the: positionof wage earners. For instance, whenan allowances was made in Great. Britain, to cover this unemployment,, certain employers took advantage of it to decreasethe rate of wages. An y Government in establishing and, a pensions scheme must takeintoconsideration the possibility of certain, in dividuals in the community taking advantage of the Government grant, in. order (No... 2). to make people work for lower wages..  information that leads him to that cont Mr HIGGSH is to r y is fall, of such cases, as the honourable, member would a Bill findif. he peruses certain Poor.

Old-age pensioners who are unable to look after themselves are taken before a magistrate, who may order them into a benevolent institution or hospital, and to2s. wards the cost of their maintenance the nothing. institution is paid 8s. a week.",24
185,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"That is done only i case of benevolent asylums, not hospitals.",24
186,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The 2s. which is thus saved, it has been suggested, should paid to the pensioner as pocket-money. That suggestion we propose to carry out by means of this Bill .

192,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [1.9] Will the Treasurer, under the Bill , place hospitals in the same position as benevolent asylums, for, if so, any objection I have is removed ? At present, hospitals are the repository for old-age pensioners just at the very time they require most assistance; and it is proposed to compromise the matter by giving each pensioner 2s., leaving the hospital high and dry. There are many hospitals, for example, in old mining districtsthat cannot be conducted without assistance.",24

196,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"That is if he has been in a hospital for over a month. be Hospitals do not desire to have old-age pensioners, especially when beds are needed for accidents and other emergency cases; and I think that such an institution should receive the full amount of pension, less the 2s. per week allowed deas pocket money.

198,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,Yes ; but they are always in debt.  along all right.,25
199,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,That is owing to the kindness of the banks in allowing them overdrafts. An old-age pensioner in a hospital costs more than he dees in a home or benevolent asylum.,25
200,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Most country towns cannot run a benevolent asylum and a hospital, too.",25
201,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"That is so. At Warragul they had often to put old-age pensioners into the hospital, when it was not occupied by patients. I hope that the Minister will do as I suggest. As only one pensioner goes into a hospital to every ten that go into a benevolent asylum, the cost will not be much. I do not wish to interfere with the present arrangement, under which the pensioner gets arrears of four weeks' pension on leaving an institution. I speak on behalf of the hospitals, because I do know the splendid work that they do, and the expenses which they have to meet. As soon as a pensioner has heen treated in a hospital, and is well enough to be removed, he is taken to a convalescent home or benevolent asylum.",25
202,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 1.17 to 2.30 p.m.,25

Those who go to that institution are absolutely without hope of coming out, and it is practically a benevolent asylum. Mi . HIGGS - As I understand that the ; institution named is really a benevolent asylum, I shall he glad to take steps to have it so declared.",25
204,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Wannon) [2.31] - I am sorry that the Treasurer has been unable to make a clear statement regarding the position of hospitals.,25
205,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I must decline, on behalf of the Government, to include all hospitals. The management of hospitals is a State concern.",25
206,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,A hospital may be a benevolent asylum as well. Will not the Treasurer consider that position?,25
207,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Yes .,25
208,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In many places there are no benevolent asylums, and no intermediary hospitals. That is true of the country districts at large. There old age pensioners must go into the ordinary nublic hospitals.",25
209,Mr ABCHIBALD,Unknown,In that case the hospitals become benevolent asylums.,25
210,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"They are not treated as such. Under section 45 of the Act, if a pensioner becomes an inmate of an asylum for the insane, or of a hospital, his pension is suspended. When he is discharged, the payment of the pension is resumed, and he is entitled to four weeks' instalment of pension in respect of the period of suspension, if that period has continued for four weeks. Under another provision, a magistrate may commit a pensioner to an institution, in which case the institution benefits.",25
211,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,That is an act of grace on the part of the Commonwealth.,25
212,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"It is the provision of the law, for which the honourable gentleman was not responsible. In a country district there are only the hospitals for the old-age pensioners to go to, and the Treasurer, by refusing to amend an anomaly in the law, makes a pensioner a beggar when he knocks at the door of such an institution. But the Commonwealth, having undertaken to provide old-age pensions, should not throw a pensioner back on the in- State when he becomes ill. The hospitals willing to take charge of old-age pensioners, and are doing so, but they should be put by the Commonwealth in the same position as other institutions. ""When a pensioner goes into a public hospital, he is deprived of his pension, and nothing is paid to the hospital for his keep. The Government did right in taking over from the State the business of dealing with old-age pensions, and it should not throw pensioners back on the States when they become ill. Our Dublic hospitals are kept going only through the efforts of those who undertake tlieir management without charge, and are supported by public contributions and small State subsidies. What I ask is that hospitals may be placed in the same position as benevolent asylums. Under the present law it is the big centres of population that benefit, because they are able to maintain benevolent asylums in addition to hospitals. Old persons very often hang round poor mining districts because of early .associations, and - when they become ill they must go to the local hospital for treatment. I propose to amend section 45 by adding the following provisoProvided that out of the amounts so suspended and not paid to the pensioner by tliiS section, a sum equal to 10s. 6d. per week shall be paid to the treasurer of any hospital in which such pensioner was an inmate, for the term during which the pension was not paid to the pensioner. Under that provision the pensioner would receive 2s. per week and the 'balance would go to the hospital. The Commonwealth would thus honour its obligations instead of throwing them on the State. The CHAIRMAN:-There amendment (already befor-e the Chair.",25

ELLIOTJOHNSON (Lang) [2.39] - I .support the remarks of the honourable member for Wannon regarding the treatment, in the same way as benevolent asylums, of hospitals which receive as inmates old-age pensioners.

215,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [2.41]. - - I think that we might very well have a promise from the Treasurer regarding the subject-matter of this discussion. understand that the Bill cannot be amended as desired, because the consequent increase of expenditure would not be covered by the appropriation recommended by the Governor General. I trust that the Treasurer will consider the matter seriously during the adjournment.",26
216,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,I shall be glad to do so.,26
217,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"Oxley) [2.42] - I draw the attention of the Treasurer to the fact that in connection with the Dunwich institution there is a hospital to which incurables are sent. That institution might, be looked upon as not having such a branch. 'Will the pensioners who are sent there be entitled to the allowance proposed to be given ?",26
218,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [2.44] - The Treasurer should be aware that most of our public hospitals depend entirely upon public subscriptions and Government subsidies. I ask the Treasurer, therefore, to consider carefully their position in regard to old-age pensioners. The donation from the Government depends upon the amount raised by public subscription, and during this time of war, when every one is being taxed heavily, I am afraid that the voluntary contributions to the hospitals will decrease considerably. The consequence will be that the poorer people w i ll suffer. I hope the Treasurer will give this aspect of the question due consideration. is an Mr HIGGS - I will do so. Amendment agreed to. Motion (by Mr HIGGS) 'agreed toThat the following new clause be inserted:After section 40 of the Invalid and 01d-ag9 Pensions Act 1908-1912, the following section is inserted :-4 0 (A').

Many pensioners have to pay 5s. or 6s. per week for lodgings, and as soon as they attempt to supplement the slender pittance they receive by way of pensions they are penalized. I wish to encourage I persons, who are ahle to do so, to supplement their incomes. Of course, a person in regular employment, and in receipt of a decent salary, would not be entitled to he on the pension list; hut persons in in digent circumstances ought to he allowed to eke out the small sums they receive from the Commonwealth. Amendment agreed to.",26

Thei people whoi provide money for the oldr-age pensioners do not wish them. to. be treated as paupers; but the sending, of them into hospitals, that frequently aro in debt, isplacing, upon, them that very brand which the Old-age.

225,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [3.10] - I object to the adoption of this motion for several reasons, principally because on Monday next a proclamation will be issued calling up all the young men over a certain age, and we have had nesday. from the Governor General no message stating the reasons for taking such a step. Section 46 of the Defence Act provides1. The Governor General may, in time of war, by proclamation, call out the Citizen Forces or any part thereof for active service. 2. The proclamation shall state the reason for calling out the Forces. 3. If the Parliament is sitting the reason for calling out the Forces shall forthwith be communicated by the Governor General to both Hpuses of the Parliament. 4. If the Parliament is not sitting at the the issue of the proclamation, it shall be summoned to meet within ten days after that date. If the House carries this motion it will be deprived of the opportunity of discussing the proclamation and the reasons for it . I believe that the Government do not in tend to call out the men under the Defence Act . I believe that they intend to of use the War Precautions Act for the purpose, and thus avoid submitting to Parliament reasons for their action. They should adhere to the method laid down in the Defence Act , a measure which was passed in times of peace. At any rate, they should be candid enough to tell the House what method they intend to follow. I am raising no factious opposition to the (No. 2). motion, but I feel that Parliament should meet after the proclamation is without issued. We have never had anything like this position in the history of Australia. We know that the peculiar that is to be taken on Monday is (No. 2). disturbing the minds of the people. The Prime Minister has told us that these men are not to be called up for home defence, but are to be prepared to go to o n t if the referendum be in the affir(No. 3). mative. If that be the case, why make any pretence about the proclamation ? In view of the fact that it would be illegal to issue a proclamation with that object under the Defence Act, I am of opinion that the Government intend to resort to the War Precautions Act , and I do not until think that is a fair thing to do in a country like this, when the 'matter might be laid before Parliament. It is a preor cedent which I should very much regret to see followed on a f u t u re occasion. I have approached both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and, while from the latter I could get no definite information, the Prime Minister told me that he did not intend the House to meet next WedMr BRENNAN :-What is the talking? The Government will take no notice.",28
226,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"That may be; but if it means that the Ministry are seeking to ru n the country at their own sweet will - if one man is to be allowed to run the country-the best thing would beand I say this in all earnestness-to shut up Parliament for an indefinite period, and leave legislation and the finances to the Government.",29
227,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,All the Ministers are favour of what is being done?,29
228,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"The member, in asking that question, tries to look very innocent; but, while I am not aware of the opinion of individual M i nisters, I candidly admit I "" hae m ' doots."" The Act distinctly says that the Governor General shall give his reasons, per medium, of course, of the Prime M in ister or Minister in charge at the time; and in the drafting and consideration of the Defence Act , both originally and in the several amendments made since, due consideration was given to the seriousness of issuing a proclamation of the kind. I well remember that, when the Defence Bill was before Parliament, honourable members on both sides were determined that no power should be placed in the hands of any Ministry to do as they thought fit on such occasions, and provision was made for a proper discussion of the matter by Parliament, as is shown by the fact that if Parliament is not sitting at the time it must be called together within ten days. Of course, in other Acts the Ministry very properly have the power to issue proclamations, the time being lef t to their discretion. This was the case in the amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act , when the age of the women pensioners was reduced to sixty, the idea being to allow the Government to issue a proclamation when in their opinion the finances of the country would permit of the change. The same sort of discretion might be left in the case of a Tariff change, it being left to the Government to say when, in their opinion, the inrush of foreign productions was imperilling the industrial life of the country. In the case of the Defence Act , however, that cannot be done, for the reasons I have stated. It would be quite, possible for any Government, when the House was not sitting, to issue a proclamation which use of they knew would result in their overthrow had Parliament been in session. I desire to know from the Government the constitutional reasons they have for their action, for , up to the present, we have had no reasons of the kind . The Prime Minister told us that if , at the end of the month, 32,500 men had not enlisted voluntarily he would act under the sections of the Defence Act relating to home defence; but. as I have already said, he has also told us that the men in are being called up, not for home defence, but in order to be trained for foreign service. That is a reason that could not honourable be given according to the Defence Act. Iu is pretty evident that under the War Precautions Act anything may be done; and there is a case in point in the Government action in fixing prices, which had been declared ultra vires by Mr . Justice Griffith and Mr Justice Barton. If Parliament has no power to do certain things, it certainly has not the power to delegate others to do them. If the Government may resort to the War Precautions Act to do anything they desire, it will not be long before we have martial law, and Parliament will not be necessary. Under martial law, or even under the W a r Precautions Act , the Government could deny the right of Parliament to deal with the finances, and take the management into their own hands. If honourable members permit the introduction of the thin edge of the wedge in this way, they, as caretakers of the people's rights, are running great risks. I , for one, do not intend to take any risks, and, therefore, I voice my objection to the proposal before the House. The Prime Minister ought really to tell the House under what law he intends to make the proclamation on Monday, for it is only just that Parliament and the people should know. It requires ' no stretch of imagination to believe that, after the proclamation is issued on Monday, there may be great unrest in Australia. Indeed, it has come to my knowledge within the last hour that the unrest has already started, although no information of the fact has been made public in Melbourne. On Monday night, at Broken Hill , forty policemen, armed with batons, made a raid on a meeting. They knocked several men senseless, locked up a number of others, and, in the course of the trouble, batoned several women.",29

230,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Honourable members ""may treat sucb matters lightly, 'but I cannot. It may be that those who were batoned were members of a particular association, with all the objects of 'which I 'do not agree, but they certainly have their rights as much as we have.",30

232,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"No ; but every man and woman in this country has the - right to 'say 'what - he 'or she likes. When 'the Government realizes that sane things are not injurious, they will get over their trouble. Those who have studied the history of the world know that -.Coercion Acts, and the {prevention - of free speech, so far from .stifling any .section - Of 'the community., have only given them greater strength, numerically .and otherwise. The objects iof these people .may be foolish and .ridiculous; they .may be faddists, and have an idea of. upsetting the Constitution by argument, but so Jong as they .resort to no methods to bring about personal in j u r y they ought to be allowed to voice their opinions. have said previously, magistrates who fine men £ 1 0 0 , and sentence them to twelve months' imprisonment, instead of inflicting the nominal fine of Is. for a nominal crime, only show their unfitness for their positions Every man knows that if you try to suppress public utterance you strengthen instead of 'weaken those whom you coerce. A Labour Government has no right to allow armed police, for t y strong, to attack a body of men and women who are .merely talking. If sabotage were being in dulged in , if fire-sticks were being carried round, such interference might he justi.fied; but no Government of any sense would use force, as was done in Broken Hill , merely to prevent people from talking. The presence of women at the meeting to which I refer was evidence that there was no .intention to commit a .riot.

236,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.40]. - The House is adjourning, as it has journed on several occasions during this session; it is not going into recess. purpose of the adjournment is a public one, known to every citizen, and I can conceive of no reason which would better justify this adjournment than that which renders it necessary. We are adjourning in order that we may put before the people-the masters of Parliament, whose mouthpieces we are-ou r views on the greatest question ever submitted to citizens of any nation in any age. If cannot be taken to justify the adjournof ment, this Parliament must be regarded as' an undemocratic institution. A demowhich cratic Parliament should always reflect the opinions of the people. That is the essence of Democracy. Although the views of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports differ from mine, he will not that the question for the people to is one upon whose decision the destiny the country may turn. No one will deny that the decision is fraught with grave import to the future of the nation. liament cannot continue to transact ness while its members are addressing electors upon the referendum. The people must have an opportunity to decide question on its merits. We intend to pel the mists of ignorance, prejudice, misrepresentation that have been spread everywhere throughout the land. We are goingto put the case before the people, so that the humblest and most indifferent citizen may know what it is that he is asked to decide. I say, without hesitation or reservation, that we-can best serve interests of parliamentary' government, and prove ourselves worthy to represent a free people, by adjourning in order go. before the electors, who have the right todemand the expression of our views on the great question that is to be referred to them. They are going to hear, those views. Now let me say a word ahout the proclamation. It might be thought from the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the proclamation is being issued without notice, whereas the intention to issue it was announced as part of' the policy of the Government in my statement of the 28th August. It will be issued under powers derived from an Act that has been in force for fifteen years-. We propose to issue a proclamaadtion under a law which for fifteen years, has heen unassailed, and has, indeed, won The the encomiums of every citizen during the-time that it was not necessary to exercise it, but which now, when it is necessaryto show that there is some virtue in it beyond a mere doctrinaire assertion of the right to call upon a man to fight for his country, when it is no longer a mere platitude for use on the platform, but a piece of practicable machinery to the be put intooperation, we are told is a that violation of the fundamental principles Democracy. The nature and scope of this proclamation and the authority from it derives its power are perfectly well known and settled. There remains nothing more to he done, since Parliament has been debating this policy for a month. The intention to issue the proclamation deny was perfectly well known when the Redecide ferendum Bill was before the House, of and it was discussed at length. We hear sinister rumours as to what will take place outside. This is a democratic community; Parthemajority are going to rule, and rule busiin a constitutional manner, and they are the not going to rule in any other fashion. The laws of the country are to be obthe served. This law is no new thing that disis being shoved down the people's throats. and It is a law approved by the general consent of all parties, and it has to be put into force at the most critical juncture in the history of the nation. If any section, in the community endeavours to to be snatch from the hands of the constitutional advisers of the Crown and the rethe presentative Government of the people the reins of authority, it remains to he seen who shall govern the country. But that to is a question which can he settled when the necessity arises. It is an issue which, perhaps, cannot be evaded. But I hope that common sense and loyalty, not only loyalty to the Empire but loyalty to themselves, will inspire the citizens of the Commonwealth at this moment. hope that no man, no matter what his private feelings may be, no matter how much he may oppose the proposals of the Government, will endeavour to take the law into his own hands. I appeal to every person in this country to have respect for the laws for which he or she, as the case may be, is responsible. In this Commonwealth the laws are made, not by some dictator, not by some despot, or by some narrow clique who have snatched to themselves by some means the power to govern the country, but the whole body politic. There is no man whose circumstances are so mean but that he has a vote equal to that of the most powerful and wealthy in the community. Therefore, to revolt against the Government in those circumstances is to revolt against themselves. The citizens of a free country make its laws, and if they make them they must abide by them. When they like those laws no longer let them repeal them in a proper and constitutional manner. That is the position, and upon it this Parliament may safely stand. We are not going into recess. We do not propose to enjoy a period of leisured inactivity, but are going to brave the storms of popular criticism and to speak to the people that which we believe to he right. If there is any man in this House who seeks to stop us, who seeks to debar the people from exercising the fundamental rights of citizenship, let him so declare himself, but unless he does so, he is hound by the principles of Democracy to welcome, and not retard, the motion to allow Parliament to get before the people. So I say the Government have nothing to apologize for. We cannot, and we ought not to, deviate from the course we have laid down. It is a course compatible with the gravity of the situation in which we find ourselves and with principles of government to which all parties in the country have given their adherence. I hope that in this coming campaign members on both sides will remember that they are citizens of a free country, and that they will come to the consideration of this, the gravest question Mr Hughes. that has ever been presented to the citizens of any Democracy, in a spirit of pure reasonableness. I know that I should waste my breath in urging that counsel upon all men, but I do urge it upon I those men who are entitled to he called Democrats and who by their acts prove themselves worthy of the privileges of citizenship in a free country. If we do that, whatever the issue may be, we shall have no cause to reproach ourselves. Whether the country assents or dissents upon this question, we at any rate will have done our duty; but if we endeavour to silence reason by abuse, and to cloud the real question by a thousand and one side issues, and to distract public attention and fill the people's minds with vaguo and misleading ideas, then upon our head will he the responsibility. I , for one, am going to tell the people what I believe to be true and necessary. I have said over and over again that every member of the House has the opportunity to put his views before the public without fear and without favour. There is no restriction upon others, and there is none upon me. When we reassemble the issue will have been settled. Parliament will then have to meet the situation as it exists, and if we fight this battle honestly and fairly I do not think there is any one of us who will need reproach himself with the position as he then finds it , no matter what that position may be.",31
237,Mr BRENNA N,Unknown,"Batman) [3.55] - I appreciate the spirit in which the Prime Minister has spoken, and will endeavour to reciprocate it. So far as concerns the referendum which is to be taken.on the 28th October, I think the position is quite clear. It is in the highest degree unfortunate that the Prime Minister was ever deluded into initiating a policy of violence in this country, a policy which rests upon the violent seizure of Australian citizens for military service abroad. He has done that, and I intensely regret it. I helieve, with other honourable members, that the vast majority of the people in this Commonwealth will repudiate the proposals and reject the referendum by a negative vote. That, however, relates to something which is to occur on the 28th October. What I should like some information upon, and that is a point which the Prime Minister has skilfully evaded, is the proclamation which he says it is proposed to issue at au early date. That proclamation is to be issued under powers which were vested in the Government by a Defence Act for what is well known as home defence. And although there are persons in this chamber now who would have us believe that there is no distinction between home defence carried on in a foreign country and home defence in Australia, there is not one of them but knows well that the Defence Act in its present form would never have been passed if that vital distinction had not been insisted upon.  at the time?",32
238,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"It was raised and insisted upon by the Prime Minister himself times out of number. If the distinction had not been recognised the principle of compulsion in the Defence Act would never have been accepted. Nay, there is scarcely a public man who would not have been hooted off the platform if he had dared to say that conscription under the Defence Act included compulsion of Australian citizens to go 13,000 miles outside the Commonwealth to fight in a foreign country. I have addressed myself at sufficient length already to that aspect of the question. But I wish to know where the Prime Minister stands in regard to this proclamation. Under the Defence Act he has power to call up the citizens of Australia for home defence, and if Parliament is sitting the reasons for that drastic and extraordinary action must be put before the House immediately. If the House is not sitting, so urgent is the matter that members must he called from the four corners of the Commonwealth within ten days to hear the reasons why the proclamation is issued. The Government are under a legal obligation to put their reasons before the House, and that obligation they propose to evade.",33
239,Sir WILLIAM IBVIJTE,Unknown,In what way?,33
240,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"B y not doing what the Act says shall he done. The Prime Minister has told us that the House is to go into recess, and that the proclamation is to be issued ahout the first day of next month.",33
241,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,Unknown,"We are going into recess. Mr BRENNAN' - As the Prime Minister has said, Parliament is not into a recess of leisured ease, but it will adjourn to engage in the referendum campaign. The view I am putting to the House is that the Governor General-and that, I apprehend, means the Government-is under an obligation to state to the House reasons why this very drastic proclamation is to be issued. If I have failed to understand the Act, the least the Prime Minister could have done was to give the House some explanation of the legal position. The Act is clear. Section 46 provides(1) The Governor General may, in time of war, by proclamation, call out the Citizen Forces, or any part thereof, for active service. (2) The proclamation shall state the reason for calling out the Forces. (3) If the Parliament is sitting, the reason for calling out the Forces shall forthwith be communicated by the Governor General to both Houses of the Parliament. (4) If the Parliament is not sitting at the date of the issue of the proclamation, it shall be summoned to meet within ten days after that date.",33
242,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,The Government are playing on the fact that the House is still sitting.,33
243,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Of course they are. That is why the honourable, member insisted that we are not going into recess, and that, technically speaking, the House would still be sitting, ignoring the vital fact that it is not a matter of technicalities, but a matter of duty on the part of the Government to communicate reasons to the House, in order that honourable members may inform their minds as to their sufficiency.",33
244,Mr FENTON,Unknown,This has been a continuous session from the first meeting after the elections.,33
245,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"It has been a continuous session, but that does not affect my point. In regard to this vital matter, it is clearly of importance that the intention pf the provision in the Act is that Parliament should be informed of the reasons, and have an opportunity of deliberating on them. The Prime Minister is not prepared to give those reasons, because he knows that by divulging them he would be put out of court and stand politically convicted of an illegal act; because the proposal is to call up these men not for home service, and not for the defence of Australia.",33
246,Mr ELEMING,Unknown,"Who says that it is not going for the defence of Australia? Mr BRENNAN.:-Le t my honourable friendkeep quiet. I cannot enter into that inflammatory state of mind with whichi he regards all public questions. Mr ""WATT - Yes ; let us talk about the matter quietly.",33
247,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I do not propose to be disturbed in the least by the violent jingoism of the-honourable member. I urge that the importance of this point cannot be over-estimated. The Prime Minister does not wish to submit these reasons to the House, because they will not bear examination. If some special set of circumstances had arisen in Australia, if a state of war within the confines of the Commonwealth of Australia was threatened or impending, or if some special emergency was arising, the Prime Minister would have the right and! the. power to exercise this extraordinary authority; but. on the platform and in the House he has already stated .that the object of exercising this special power, which was given to him for defence-within Australia, is to yard men forthepurpose of sending them outside Australia if , unfortunately, the people of Australia should give himthe authority to' do so. My belief is that the proposed proclamation, is wholly illegal. It is said that the Governor General may, in time of war; issue such a proclamation. What is the definitionof war? As definedin the Defence Act it isAny invasion or apprehended invasion of attack orapprehended attack on the Commonwith wealtli orany Territory, under the control the Commonwealth hy an enemy or armed force.",34

The Prime Minister has leftthe chamber without giving us any explanation of his proposedillegal act, as I conceive it to be. He has urged the people to a condition, of mind of sweet reasonableness ihregard to the whole thing, though he has initiated a policy which, as to the referendum, was conceived in violence and is proposedtobe carried out in violence, and, as to the proclamation, proposes to throw the whole of the Commonwealth into a condition of chaos and confusion. The Prime Minister proposes to withdraw men from their occupations, and to throw industry and production into confusion. He proposes to bustle into camp a body ofmen-, hundredsof whom will be physically unfit, and hundreds of whom will be exempted in other ways, and allow them to' wait there while leisurely tribunals will determine whether they are fit to serve or not. I have never heard amore impracticable policy than that which was put before the House by the Prime Minister this afternoon in soairy a fashion. He asks us to accept it with sweet reasonableness. It is the very antithesisof sweet reasonableness, and, from itsnature, will lead to confusion, chaos, and lossj and is bound to end in disaster.",34

According to the honourable member, every kind of evil under the sun is going to come upon us if we simply ask young manhood, of Australia to stand up to their duty like men in this time of an national crisis. The young men of Ausare not the craven things he tries to picture them. They will stand up to",34

252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not getting excited. My friendis prophesying violence; chaos, and confusion, and all 1 kinds of things. Is it his wish that these",34
253,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,No .,34
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then everything will depend upon, my friend and the those who fight with him as to whether theywill occur; There, will be no chaos and no violence if the honourable member does not encourage it or incite it. The Prinie Minister - has made a careful and calm appeal to reason in this matter. I hope the 'debate will be conducted in that spirit. I have-risen for one purpose only, and it is to deny utterly-and prove itthat the genesis of our defensive preparations had no reference to trouble overseas. The honourable member made the statement, with all the fervour of which he is capable, that the .Bills establishing the Navy and the Australian land Forces would never have passed if there had been any suspicion that the Forces so created were for use overseas. I happen to - have in my hand my second-reading speech - when I *was introducing the Bill - for the compulsory training of the young men of Australia; and'this is what was saidThe Bill will provide us also, if necessaryI hope we may never have to do it, but aim of this.organization .will the-to-.provide'an expeditionary for.ce for immediate idespatch oversea .or elsewhere, whenever the GovernForces ment of the day.feel themselves under .an .obligation to send a force.",34
255,Mr EISHEB,Unknown,Would that .mean re-swearing the men? - Mr. JOSEPH COOK- - I am going to get'the - men ready.' All - these - special matters considered afterwards - facts today. - Mr FOWLER --An .expeditionary force would be required even for some .parts of Australia.,35
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Exactly .,35
257,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"But the Minister spoke of a force ""to be sent outside Australia.",35
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,An expeditionary force in-overy sense of >the term would quired if wo had to send troops up north. Our - the scheme in this respect is.capable of systematic expansion.,35
259,Mr FISHER,Unknown,D.oe s the honourable gentleman mean that the men could be sent abroad without being re-sworn?,35
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I tell the honourable .member candidly that .if these men are for oversea service, in the defence of .pire, no Government of the Commonwealth worthy of the name would hesitate to send them. That was in 1909, when the first proposal .was put through .this .Parliament .compulsory training of :the men - of Australia. T'hen, as to the Naval proposal, which I had the honour to put through the House on the 24th November, - it .was-set out that - we '.were - proposing create:a new Bacific'Fleet,(and I said'That is a plain unvarnished statement fact. That Fleet is, as-honourable members aware, '-to - consist 'df three squadrons, namely, one width its base at Bombay, another with its base at Hong -.Kong .or Singapore, and another with .its base in Australia. Provision was made in that .scheme for these .three divisions of ithe Imperial Fleet to manoeuvje together and to be away from .Australia, either at Bombay or at Hong - Kong, all working and training together for service overseas, and every trainee-entering the Australian Navy was to be - prepared to 'go overseas wherever the ship - was, and do his fighting in other parts of the world than - our own. It is too late today to begin this talk that all our Australian war preparations 'have been for the defence of our-own miserable J skins here. That 'was never the intention of those preparations. On the .contrary, the very genius of them, as well as the genesis of them, was for a quite different .purpose. The training of the Navy was all to be standardized; the training of the one .'land Forces was all to be standardizedman for man, gun for.gun, and organization for organization. 'The whole of o.ur was prepared by .Senator Pearce to be fitted in with the Imperial Army at - any time, and in any place, .and in any circumstances in which the Army was - called for in the defence of the Empire. can be I am afraid that we .are forgetting these Mr JBEENDTAN;-Is the honourable member - giving a legal definition of the .Act ? Mr. JOSEPH .COOK - I am not giving, a legal definition. I am not speaking be reon law points. I .am giving the 'facts of - case. This scheme of :defence, «which - honourable imembers opposite'have gone all over the-country claiming to be their own, provides for Imperial defence, and every - preparation is made - for it . That is a simple statement of the case; .and it is wanted idle for my .honourable friend to be arguthe Eming, as he has done today, that we ;are doing something contrary to the whole igenesis.and basis of our Australian scheme of defence in .now making provision to send those :men overseas when the call of for the - the Empire makes it .necessary.",35
261,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [4.16] - I shall mot discuss 'the ;merits .or - demerits of the - question, for I am satisfied that (the legal 1909, gentlemen will never agree ias ito - to - the. points iraised in connection 'with - the /ID.efence .Act. It ,-idoes not matof ter - whether ithe .action be legal or are illegal-iin . any case, what is wanted will .be ttaken, irrespective of the Constitution. Just now neither law nor Constitution stands in the way. The Prime Minister distinctly told us the other day something which he had previously and repeatedly denied, namely, that the needs of the nation were supreme, and all else subcracy ordinate. However, as I say, I shall discuss the legal points. The question, in tion. my mind, is that, so far as the spirit of the Act is concerned, it was fully intended that Parliament should be able to consider member know ? the reasons for any proclamation, and its Mr Watt - No . terms. I shall not raise the question whether the Prime Minister is right or wrong in his interpretation or action; but no one can read the Act without seeing that what I have saidis distinctly spirit.",35
262,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,The Opposition knows it.,36
263,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"It is very evident, respective of the merits of the case. it be that, as the Prime Minister now nobody can be sure, the Lord knows,' we may be called up ourselves! The Prime Minister told us that no man should take the law into his own hands, but that we ought to appeal to the Demoin cracy. Why not? Why did he not think of it before ? For two years I have been asking that the voice of Democracy should be heard in this country. Before go out to the fight. I wish to draw attenBut tion to the fact that, on the platform the Government, there was one principle to which they were pledged at the last election. This Government came back from the country, backed by the electors, pledged to give the people an opportunity to vote, by referendum, on a question which the Government were definitely committed; but the Government refused to allow the people to vote on that questo tion, although now they are driving them to vote on another, which was not then contemplated. We are face to face with the fact that Democracy has no voice now-that Democracy has no power-an that the laws and conditions under which we exist today are for the most part laws and conditions of which we had no idea lary. at the last election.",36
264,Mr WATT,Unknown,Why have you not moved a motion of want of confidence in the vernment ?,36
265,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Hav e I not been movmethods ing such motions ever since we came back from the last election ? And a miserable failure I have been ! Do not let us - talk of national emergencies and usurpation, when every day of our existence is a usurpation. I do not say that the national necessity does not demand it ; but if usurpation of authority is necessary, 1st us own up to the fact. The days of Demohave gone.

266,Mr WATT,Unknown,Is that so ?,36
267,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Did not the honourable,36
268,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,Then the honourable member can make himself happy !,36
269,Mr WATT,Unknown,"You said the Labour its party were "" marching to their Sedan,"" but they did not get there.",36
270,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"The Labour party did reach its Sedan; but I also proirphesied that it would come back If with a greater majority than ever, says, and it did. When the Government did come back, they were free to use the power which the people had given them; but that power was not used in the manner promised, though it is being used a manner the people never expected. The Prime Minister came down this afternoon and addressed us in a most excellent manner, cooing in sucking-dove tones, and we I shall reciprocate his kindly attitude. honourable members must have noticed of the change in the right honourable gentleman. What Christian influence has been at work to bring about this change in our dear friend? He told us that we are all equal before the law, and that one man's vote is equal to another man's vote. That on is all right if a man gets a vote. However, I know there is no election for me next year, and I am happy. According the Prime Minister, there will be no 'abuse-nothin g but argument and appeal to reason; and I hope honourable members note the fact. So far as. I am concerned, no man shall be able to say that, during d the campaign, I have uttered one word of personal abuse. There was a time, I admit, when that was part of my vocabuLike the honourable member for Balaclava, I was brought up in a school where.it was supposed to be an essential Gopart of the curriculum. Now, however, . I am beginning to think that such do neither oneself nor one's cause any good. If a man is fighting a righteous cause, he has no need to descend into the gutter of abuse, but may rely upon his arguments and the facts as he sees them. At the start of this Parliament, when I , together with the honourable member for Ballarat, was expressing opinions which have since proved to be largely correct, but which were hostile to. the members on this side, who does not remember how the Prime Minister, when he felt himself strong and buttressed, not only by the support of the Opposition, but by the support of men on this side, spoke? Did the right honourable gentleman not travel up and down the country referring, in the most opprobrious terms, to men who, a little minority, held views identical with mine? Who were the "".parasites"" and "" d e v i l s "" to be cast out? The Prime Minister, who now talks of loyalty, with no appeal to violence, and of all men being subject to the law, when he thought he could handle the organizations, urged them to fal l with the ferocity of Bengal tigers on men who held views akin to myself. He went to England and came back to find that, in the meantime, rightly or wrongly, and for good or evil, there had grown up in this country a vast opinion which was not prepared to follow him. The Prime Minister was the first man in this campaign to resort to vituperation, and he has brought strong language upon himself.",36
271,Mr WATT,Unknown,I doubt whether he has really started yet 1,37
272,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"If he has not started, then we know how little reliance can be placed on what he said this afternoon. I , at least, shall endeavour to show that I am not in any way beneath him in the particular method he suggests of carrying on the campaign.",37
273,Mr WATT,Unknown,"We shall lose half our terest in you, then.",37
274,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"I do not think so. I rose to congratulate the Prime Minister on his nice, kindly, gentle manner, and I hope he will stick to it during the campaign. We shall see.

I take this opportunity to announce that I shall lay on the table of the Library the papers relating to the agreement between the Commonwealth and Messrs. in - Dalgety and Co. respecting the export of certain metals.

276,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [4.35] - Earl y this week the electrical mechanics of the Postal Department obtained from the Arbitration Court an alteration of their award, but before it can operate it must lie on the table of this House for a certain time. The Postmaster-General assures me, however, that the necessary documents have not comd from the Court. This is hard on men who had to wait some time before they could BILL. get to the Court. They will not now, be able to benefit by the award u n t i l after Parliament has re-assembled. It seems a pity that some effort .was riot made to give these men their rights earlier. .Just as ithe .House was adjourning some time back, papers regarding another award were laid on the table. I understand that the original award applying to the .postal mechanics did not sufficiently emphasize the payments to certain sections, who were unable to get what they should .have got. The award Ihas 'been, .altered .to. give them their due, and . it is unfair that not benefit by the .alterations - because the necessary papers have not been laid on the table - Some of those who are .hurt by this delay may . Ibe'inclined to think that the Ministry is taking - advantage of the adjournment. It is the duty of Ministers to see that awards .are placed on the table as soon as .possible, in order - that those affected - may ;get - their rights. .

If the campaign is ;to be conducted with fair arguments, and an appeal is to be made ""to reason, nothing should be done - while Parliament is adjourned to impose other - restrictions. I am :most anxious to avoid trouble during - the .campaign. .There ;are present all the elements conducive to'.serious strife and division,'which may'be-provoked df the Prime Minister resorts again to ithe censorship - .of the press - and the interference with free speech that has been so much ,in evidence ' of late. ' I appeal to 'the Treasurer .on this matter. A darge section >of :the - community - looks him and 'to some of - his confreres in the Cabinet to - see - that those who .are opposing the Government's proposals get a fair deal during the campaign. ""If there is a reimposition cof - restrictions on 'free speech and publication, whatever trouble may develop will the at the door of 'the.Brime Minister and this 'Cabinet.

""The case was ably - presented yesterday'by'the honourable-members for Wide Bay - and Darling 'Downs, both of whom are authorities on the subject about whicn - they spdke. and understand it thoroughly. The honourable member for Wide ""Bay, to my 'knowledge, has been associated commercially with the ; sugar industry for 'forty years, and - today represents in this Parliament the - bulk of the sugar growers of Southern Queensland."" If information beyond that contained in the - speeches of those honourable - members is - required, it is to be .found in an in formative article published in yesterday's Age. The existence of the sugar industry 'is now at stake. I 'have they can- here - a telegram from a man who says that - every day that passes means ruinous loss - to 'the Commonwealth and to - the community generally, owing to the <sugar crop - deteriorating. It is hardly fair to put the blame altogether on the 'Queensland 'Government-^that blame must 'be shared by it 'with the Federal Government.",37
277,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,S u r e l y the - blame cannot be put - on this Government ?,38
278,Mr STUMM,Unknown,"H a d it not-been for the continual interference with the industry by this - Government, it would - not be in its present - position. All we ask is to - be treated as the Prime Minister 'has promised to treat the butter industry. The - butter - producers were very >much harassed and injured by the interference : of the Commonwealth and State Governments; but yesterday, in reply to a'deputation, the Prime 'Minister-'showed that a ray of common sense had penetrated, and promised that 'the embargo on the export of butter would be removed on the assurance being given to 'him 'that the ""price charged to Australian-consumers would be on a parity .with the Liondon price. That - assurance was immediately given. Those interested in the s u g a r in to dustry desire a'similarly fair deal. This Government is making a profit out of the Queensland - sugar, as the Treasurer has admitted. He has told us in his financial statement that as it - will be .necessary to again import 'foreign sugar to make up a deficiency in the Australian production, a 'loss - of even more than £ 2 -'a - ton may have to be met out of the profits from the-sale-of Australian-grown sugar. I - did - not iknow that this -'Government .was to play .the - part:of the middleman. Honourable 'members opposite - have always declared themselves in 'favour of the abolition of the middleman and his profits wherever - possible.  ber .say that .this Government is exploiting 'the consumer by increasing the ;pric» of sugar?",38
279,Mr STUMM,Unknown,"The Treasurer admits that it is making a profit from Australian sugar which it is using to cover a loss on the importation of foreign sugar, grown mostly with black, labour. The honourable gentleman has expressed the willingness of the Government that the Inter-State Commission should inquire into the matter, provided that the agreements between the Commonwealth and Queensland Government, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the Millaquin Company are not brought under review. Why tie the hands, of the Inter-State Commission? Why notlet the Commissioners inquire into every phase, of the question? They are able men, and can be trusted tq do their work properly. The fate of the sugar industry in Queensland is at stake. It has had a most potent influence on the settlement of the coastal districts of the State, and we need settlers. The Prime Minister said yesterday that the salvation of the country lies in men on the land. As far as my lights go, the Federal Government have the settlement of this question in their own hands, and in the interests of the industry and the people of Australia, it is their duty to deal with it at once.",39
280,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong ) [4.45].. - I should, like to bring under the notice of the Treasurer certain statements which appeared in the columns of the daily press in. regard, to those who will come within the scope of the proposed new taxation. I notice that those persons are already preparing to evade that taxation, and to pass it on to the masses of the public. fortunately, the. great bulk of taxation in this country in the past has been passed on to the masses, and under the new proposals of the, Government, which I admit to be wise and sane,. I am afraid'that the burden will be transferred to the general body of the public. I do not know whether the Treasurer intends to propose means by which this passing on. of taxation can be prevented. This matter has always presented a problem, and it will have to be solved in some way, because the masses of the people cannot stand f u r ther burdens than they are hearing today. Mr HIGGS:;-Some economists; saythat it is impossible to prevent taxes being passed on to the consumers: I do not quite agree with them.",39
281,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"No doubt economists of the past did say that, because theGovernments in days gone by were not anxious to relieve the people of these burdens.  problem ?",39
282,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I have not a readymade scheme to propound today, but I ask the Treasurer to take into seriousconsideration the devising, of means to. prevent the evil of which I am complaining. Otherwise it seems tome that it will be useless to pass new taxation measures; and, for my own part, unless I am assured that the great body of the people are not to have further burdens placed upon them-, I shall, not support some of the-proposals when the Treasurer introduces them. I hope that the Treasurer will make the meshes of his net so small thatthose upon whom the. tax. is intended to f all shall not escape. Another matter to which I wish to call attention is the peculiar position of some men who are in the service of the Commonwealth. An order was issued by the ex-Prime Minister (Mr Fisher) that no promotions or appointments were to be made in the Public Serviceduring theterm of thewar. On the face of it that instruction appears very fair, because we do not wish to penalize those public servants who have gone to the front. As far as is possible, the positions and promotions of those men must he protected. But we have a large body of men, particularly among telephone mechanics and others asU n - sociated with postal work, who, though qualified for permanent appointment, do not know what day their services will be dispensed with. They have gone to considerable expense in qualifying themselves, and arestill attending technical schools, and today they are asking whether they are to continue doing this, to betold later that their services are no - longer required. Something should be done to give them a sense of security and permanencein regard to their position. They may be preparing themselves for positions that will never be open to them, and then they will be obliged to start life afresh in a new sphere. They are ih an unfortunate position, and ought to he reassured hy the Postmaster-General at the earliest possible date. In addressing the Cliamber on the Referendum Bill, I expressed the hope that in the coming campaign a fair deal will be meted out to every man who takes the platform. Whether a man is a conscriptionist or an anticonscriptionist, he should receive the same treatment from the press, in order that the people may arrive at a fair decision on the all-important question of compulsory service. The press will be acting unfairly to the people if they do not report at least some of the chief speakers on the anti-conscription side. Often it is the cutting down of speeches, and the consequent misrepresentation in the press, that irritates a large numher of men, and makes them feel that they are not receiving that fair treatment which is essential in dealing, with a question like this. I should have liked to have seen the arguments for and against conscription published at equal length in a manifesto to the people, and if that had been done I doubt very much whether it would have been necessary for members of Parliament to take the platform in order to educate the people on the subject. It would have been a good thing if we could have refrained from platform controversy. Unfortunately, that is not possible, and the duty devolves upon all of us to endeavour to impress our convictions upon the public. In doing that I hope that we shall all so comport ourselves on the platform that, after the decision is given, we may return to our places with the feeling that we have done nothing to he ashamed of. We shall have done our best, and, whatever the verdict is, it will be for a Parliament to honour and abide by it.",39
283,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"Wilmot) [4.55] I endorse the wish of the honourable memsomebody ber for Maribyrnong that the referendum campaign shall be conducted with that calm deliberation and thorough exposition of both sides of the question that ought characterize every referendum. I wish bring under the notice of the Treasurer a matter of much importance to the farjection mers. Producers have been under a conceed siderable disability of late years owing the high prices ruling for bags, and i seems to me that steps might be taken permit of the use of the second hand article. I believe that it would be posAustralia sible to treat bags chemically, so as to render their use a second time perfectly safe. If the Treasurer will ask the Minister for Customs to look into this matter, it may he found possible, notwithstanding an answer to the contrary given by the Prime Minister to the honourable member for Calare, to do something in the direction suggested, and so give considerable relief to a numher of producers.",40
284,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Moreton) [4.58] I would urge upon the Treasurer the importance of taking decisive and immediate action with regard to the sugar crisis. The trouble has been dragging on for over five weeks, and the Treasurer must know what a loss is involved to the growers and the Commonwealth as a Avhole. Only a few days ago I noticed that at one mill 400 tons of cane had absolutely gone to waste. That cane would represent at least £500 to the growers. I urge the Minister to submit the question to the Inter-State Commission.",40
285,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Is the honourable member aware whether the majority of people connected with the industry would be agreeable to that course?,40
286,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I am reliably informed that the majority of growers, whilst not accepting a reference to the Inter-State Commission as the best way out of the difficulty, are prepared to accept it as one way out.",40
287,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,And are the raw millers and workers agreeable to that course?,40
288,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I cannot answer for the workers. However, some action must be taken, and if the Treasurer is not prepared to adopt that course, I hope he will us as decide upon some other immediately. Otherwise we shall have a sugar famine in Australia - It is beginning to look as if there is some dilatoriness on the part of in dealing with this matter. I do not know what is in the mind of the Minister in stipulating that the present agreements between the Government and to the Commonwealth, the Government of to Queensland, and the companies shall not come under review; but, whatever the obis, I hope the Minister will proimmediately with the reference of to this question to the Inter-State Commist sion. It is useless saying that the Goto vernment cannot do anything. They can do something, and they must do it, or wili be faced with a crisis that will land it in serious difficulty and financial loss, as well .as in the loss of one of the necessaries of life. Therefore, I urge expedition in regard to the matter. I hope that the Minister will not listen to any side issue, hut will go straight even if he does the wrong thing.  [5.1] - I take this opportunity of stating a position which is very essential in regard to the matter of the referendum. I believe it can he said of the people of this country that they will not back out of the promise to give the "" last man and the last shilling"" in this great crisis, they helieve in the necessity for so doing; but before they come to a decision on the 28th of next month they should know exactly what the Government's proposals mean. There appears to be a conspiracy of silence on the Opposition side with regard to the financial aspect of the case.",40
289,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in debating a matter that has already been decided.  not refer to it further. I merely wish to deal with what will be the financial aspect if the referendum is decided in the affirmative.,41
290,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable member is allowed to proceed on that course every time the adjournment of the House is moved, the whole debate might crop up again, and there would then be no end to discussion.  gard to the proclamation that is to issue on Monday, there has been no clear contradiction from the Ministry of the figures prepared hy Mr Knibbs and summarized in the daily press some three weeks ago, showing that the number of fit men in Australia between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five years is not more than 45,000.",41
291,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is now endeavouring to evade my ruling.,41

293,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Fiddlesticks !  have not been officially contradicted, except by such loose statements as that of my honourable friend opposite, who would contradict anything in order to suit his own purpose. However, that is all I wish to say on that point. The people should on, know that married men will have to be called up within three months.",41
294,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member had ample opportunity of discussing that matter.  all I wish to say on the point. 'Finally, I offer my protest to conscription as we will have it under the if proclamation to be issued on Monday. As the Prime Minister told us today, the provision has been on the statute-book for fifteen years, and it could have been utilized for calling up men for the defence of Australia for home service; but the assumption on which they are to be called up on Monday next is that, if the referendum vote is cast in a certain way, they are to be used for service abroad, and there is no essential difference between that method and calling up men for compulsory service outside the Commonwealth. Men will he called up in a way that is quite antagonistic to the democratic principles of the people of this country, and yet it is being done in the name of Democracy. We have had several dissertations from the Prime Minister, in which he used that glorious word ""Democracy,"" but next month we shall be engaged in a campaign in regard to a matter that violates every principle of Democracy. We are going to ask the people to vote on a matter which affects a section only, and which does not concern a great many of those who will go to the ballot-box. It - will affect the democratic spirit in another way, because if what has taken place so far can be taken as a guide there will be only one side in this great issue that will be able to put its case in an unhampered manner.",41
295,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order !  nothing further to say on that point, particularly as I have finished with it.",41
296,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member must not indulge in any other points in connection with the matter. He has had ample opportunity of discussing it to the fullest extent.  final word in regard to the proclamation on Monday, I wish to draw attention to the ruin and sadness most disastrous floods have brought to many Victorian, homes during the last few days. Many of the young men whose services will be required in the direction of repairing a great deal of the ruin that has been occasioned will have to present themselves to the military authorities on Monday; and, owing to the number of Courts,, tribunals, and places of appeal that they will have to pass through, the war will possibly be over before they can get away again; because, if we are to be guided by the prediction of the Prime Minister, the war will be over by June next. I have already received letters asking me whether young fellows will have vo present themselves on Monday next, and I know that there, is sadness in some of their homes, because, besides sustaining damage to their property, they have lost relatives through the floods. In addition to the injustice of the matter, their positions will be rendered very much worse by their having to present themselves to the military authorities at this particular time-. As a final word, I protest against this most undemocratic thing which is being done in the name of Democracy..",41

We were given to under-stand, in the financial statement, that the Treasurer was prepared to grant an in quiry into the sugar industry by the Inter-State Commission,, provided certain matters, would not be insisted on. These matters, will not be insisted oni f the Treasurer, will: only proceed with the inquiry at once. The honourable member has asked the lionorable member for Moreton whether the mill-owners and the canegrowers will consent to this arrangement. I have in my possession telegrams from the United Cane-growers Association and the Sugar-millers Association, stating that they are prepared to accept the appointment of the Inter-State Commission to hold this inquiry. There remains the third party-the labour employed. I do not see how the Treasurer can be sincere in asking any honourable member what the labourer wants. It is the cane-grower and the sugar-miller who have to provide the means for payingfor the labour. labourer neednot work unless he gets the pay that he wants. The two parties who are interested in this question are. the - sugar-growers and the mill-owners, andi, as they have given their consent, I hope that the Treasurer will not delay this all important matter, and that he will allow the crop to be taken off.",42
298,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [5.14] To paraphrase an old saying of the Romans, "" We who are about to"" die salute y o u , "" I say to the Treasurer, "" Those who are now about to die through the closing of the sittings of the House are going to beat you on the 28th October."" In letters written to me, some of the soldiers at the front have discussed the question of the referendum. I know that they will not vote to compel their fellow men to be slaves instead of free men-. I have inquired fro m twelve mothers who have sons at the front. They havevisitedmy office-, and I have not sought to change their opinions; but out of the twelveofthem, eleven intend to votei against conscription. The twelfth one perfectly justly said, "" I am going to vote to sendthem to help my boy."" Further I have had a talkto many soldiers, and I can say confidently that the Prime Minister will"" get the surprise of his life when hesees how some of the soldiers vote. I hardly know whe - 1 ther to congratulate or condole with the representative of the Government here; but, if reports be true, the Government have already felt the shadow of defeat in anotherplace. It has been decided, in the wisdom of the Chamber, as against the Government, to sit next Tuesday..",42
299,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Why not suggest that we sit. during the whole of the campaign ? "" Dr MALONEY - That is what I should, like to see, because, By means of a question here, you can get that justice which is impossible, by correspondence or interviews. The treatment of the soldiers in withholding their pay will also cause them to vote, against conscription.. These men are waiting for their money,, because their records have not heen sent from the front ; and, in the. meantime those who aro unable to work have tobeg for food in the streets of Melbourne. I must compliment the honourable member for Bourke; on the fact that he was quite right when, in the early part of this sesThe sion, he declared that the Government, under the W a r . Precautions Act; had full power to control prices. This was aontradicted by the Prime Minister and' other members of. the Government; and. on. their assurance I thought the honourable member for Bourke was wrong; and on that account I now tender the - honourable member an apology. The 'Government now tell us that, under that Act, they have power to do anything, even to taking any man's liberty away. I should now like to touch on the infamy and injustice of the censorship. T have - here a numher of sketches, which, though not liaif .as bad .as some that appeared in the Bulletin, have - been censored in .Melbourne; indeed, pictures that are .passed in one .city .are forbidden in another, and vice versa - The wealthy daily papers are allowed to-publish what smaller .newspapers (are - forbidden to publish:;-.and-I - doinot'think that any. 'honourable member would approve 'of Buch - a state of affairs. Any censorship ought to - be'exercised all-along-the line. 'In a leaflet issued - by - the Australian - Peace Alliance, 'the censor - censored the word "" merest"" before the word "" suspicion,"" - and also the - word '"" jingoistic "" 'before the word ""-magistrate.""' Then, again, in the sentence, """"'The suspicion may be baseless, the seizure unwarrantable,'"" the last three words are struck out. The following part of the leaflet was .also censored:FACTS TO FACE . Under this regulation the premises of the Australian Peace Alliance were raided and searched by two officers, and thousands of copies bf two 'leaflets were seized - and taken. aro detained now, and the military authorities .refuse .to return them or to give any information concerning them. One leaflet is by the well-known writer, John A. Hobson, and was - published in 'England ;^;in the Nation), and-in - Victoria, presumably with - the censor's permis-sion. It is a striking article-it deals with .the - question of peace-bu t the military .say that .people shall not see it . The other deals ralso with peace, and was published in the Labour Ijeader. It is called -""'Women and 'Children ifirs't."" But our military authorities will not fallow lit-to be-distributed here, and lthe-public .are at their mercy.

The Argus, and, I think, the Age, piiblished a large portion of this circular, and it seems pitiable that a small newspaper should be confiscated, while others, with circulations in .the neighbourhood - of 100,00.0, are allowed to escape.

The following was permitted:Again the Prime Minister (also according to your columns) insists on but two restrictions as being operative in the censorship. The following was censored:My experience in two papers as recent as this week proves otherwise. The following was permitted:The censorship is a political censorship, applied to purely domestic politics. It is sorship, also, which prohibits any discussion of itself as an institution. It is in operation exasperatingly vexatious The next two words, "" and insolent,"" were censored, but the remainder of the sentence was permittedto any man taught, as I was taught, as an Australian, that it was a good and great national characteristic to think, and to dare to speak what one thought. It ought to be abolished forthwith. The concluding sentence, as follows, was censoredAs a remedy it is worse than the disease. The freedom of our Australia, ease with which we occupy these benches, have caused dry-rot in the great Labour party. There is not the big fighting phalanx in the Commonwealth party in this House that there is in the State House of Victoria, where they know how to fight. But I sincerely hope that an election will come, when we may present ourselves to the people who sent us here. I hope that we shall come back with a number of younger men to take up the work of us veterans, with all the fighting pluck that has heen shown in the past. If the split and break comes, as I can see plainly it will, it may damage us for a little while; but we must remember the man who scored the highest of votes in Australia at a Commonwealth election, and who sought to break up the Labour party in Victoria, is now in political oblivion. If the path of the Prime Minister be directed to England, he wiU never come. back, though God. knows many hearts would not pray for his happy return. If he does go, I do not know any man who could do more good there. It is possible that he bring about some reform in the Conservative ranks, so that the 16,000,000 people who, up to the present, are disfranchised, may find themselves in the possession of votes, and cause the abolition of the odious system of so that the . wealth of the may decently contribute to the common Dr Maloney. weal of Great Britain and Ireland. But he wants to print the brand of slave upon every Australian, and force him to fight. Even in our school days, a boy who would not fight was not compelled to do so. Others might step into his place. I have every appreciation of the efforts of my fellow countrymen, who were sacrificed like cattle at Gallipoli because of the in a cen- eptitude and inability of leaders and generals. For a month or two the fleet was firing at the forts, giving the Turks notice to prepare for an attack, and yet they were not provided with sufficient men when they did attack. That brutal descendant of the traitor Marlborough, who starved his soldiers to put money into his pocket and took bribes from the K in g of France-Winsto n Churchillhas dared to say that the winning of the Dardenelles was a sporting chance. Why did not the cur go himself ? I hope to see him impeached for taking a sporting and the chance with human life. He tried to lull the men of the British Cabinet into a false security, which might have brought about the loss of the British Fleet. My reading Labour of history, the knowledge I have garnered from those older than myself, the lessons I have learned from my teachers, tell me that never in the history of the world has a people put conscription upon itself by popular vote. Does any one think that if they were not compelled by conscription, the Germans would be fighting for l £ d . a day ? Would the German Emperor have been able to make this war had not conscription provided him with millions of soldiers ? Would France, which has led that the world in the arts and sciences, find number men to fight, if it Were not for conscription ? Would not they rather be tillin g the fields, of their beloved country ? So with Italy and with Russia. It is not men who are wanted at the front. An y one with a knowledge of war will tell you that it is big artillery that is wanted. The war will be won, not by men, but by the blasting power of heavy ordnance. On the word of one who has been in three revolutions, and who has seen two Presimight dents elected, a consul now living in Melbourne, I say that the Allies could blast their way to Berlin in two months if they had ten heavy pieces of ordnance to every one possessed by the enemy. Any one who says that I wish to buy Russians to entail, fight for Australia is a liar. country",43
