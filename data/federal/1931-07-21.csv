2,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [3.2]-by leave-After an interview with the Premier of New South Wales yesterday regarding the financial necessities of his State, I sent the following telegram to all members of the Loan Council:Following is summary of letter dated 15th .July, received by Commonwealth Treasurer from Premier and Treasurer of New South Wftles: During recent conference of Premiers it was generally understood that, providing governments reduced deficits £40,000,000 to £15,000,000, banks would carry respective governments during current financial year. Assuming deficits are reduced to £15,000,000, leeway will be greater during first half of year, and, consequently, greater accommodation than £15,0.00,000 w i ll be required between J u l y and December, but accommodation so provided will be lessened during second half of year. I am enclosing estimate of receipts and expenditure of New South Wales for period 1st July to 30th September, from which it will be seen that, apart fro m non-payment of London exchange and interest and the amounts withheld by the Commonwealth from this State, we will require approximately £500,000 during July, furthe r £2,000,000 during August, and further £1,000,000 during September. Amount for August includes local interest amounting to over £750,000 due on 10th August. In order to meet this it will be necessary to obtain substantial proportion of August requirements early during that month. Present position of this State is that unless £500,000 is provided immediately we will be unable to pay salaries and wages next week. Salary pay day falls 23rd July, but wages have to be paid practically every day. I have approached general managers of Bank of New South Wales and Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, but they point out that arrangement is that accommodation required by any government must be dealt with through Commonwealth Bank by issue of Commonwealth treasury-bills. In view of foregoing I shall be glad if you could assist this State by arranging, if possible, for issue of treasury-bills i o the extent of £500,000 within next few davs, and further amount of £2,000,000 in August, of which £1,000,000 will he required before 10th of that month. In regard to debt conversion, over £4,000,000 matures in this State on 10th August. I am inclined to think many holders will seek repayment, and this is a question which will require your earnest consideration as it is impossible for the State to pay off any portion of the loan. To-day, at consultation with Mr Lang, I informed him Commonwealth itself has no moneys available for loan to any State, but is itself borrowing from its bankers. I also pointed out that, as set out in resolutions of Loan Council meeting of 26th February last, provision of funds for advances to any State is a matter for Loan Council and not for Commonwealth Government; also that Loan Council had declared it could not arrange further borrowing on behalf of New South Wales u n t i l it is clear the State is prepared to honour its interest obligations. I undertook to submit present request of New South Wales for funds to Loan Council, together with any information likely to assist members of Loan Council in coming to decision. In regard to plan adopted by Premiers Conference, Premier of New South Wales states he proposes introducing this week legislation coverfro m ing conversion agreement, trustees and private interest, and at earliest possible moment, legislation providing for economies in expenditure. This latter would be on lines indicated' at Premiers Conference, namely, reduction to £500 of all Public Service salaries above that' amount and such further economies as are necessary to secure total economies of 20 per cent. Premier alBO advised he would submit to his Cabinet and party, question of New South Wales rejoining Loan Council, and question of New South Wales assuming responsibility for payment of interest oversea. 1 consider it essential that meeting of Loan Council be held at early date to consider questions arising out of Premier's letter and my conference with him; but, pending that meeting, early decision is desired whether Loan Council will approve issue of treasury-bills for £500,000 to cover immediate requirements of New South Wales. If Loan Council so approved, CommonwealthBank would be approached with view to seeing whether, in conjunction with other banks, it would arrange sale of treasury-bills for £500,000 for Government of New South Wales. Immediately I receive advice from Premier of - New South Wales regarding the two questions on which he is consulting Cabinet and party, I will again communicate with you. This telegram has been seen by Mr Lang. for Chairman, Loan Council. I am now awaiting f u r the r advice from Mr Lang.",10
3,Mr LAZZARINI,Unknown,"In view of the repeated statement that the Premier of New South Wales is asking for assistance from the Commonwealth Government, will the Prime Minister say whether it is not a fact that Mr Lang is merely asking the .Commonwealth to discount treasury bills issued by the Government of New South Wales for which that Government .will be responsible?",11
4,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"That , to some extent, describes the situation, but the treasury bills must be issued in the name of the Commonwealth Government, which will be legally responsible for their payment. The Commonwealth Government will be in exactly the same position in relation to such bills as it is to the consolidated State debts; it will be responsible for the return of the principal and the payment of interest. This Government is not prepared to assume any f u r the r responsibility in regard to New South Wales, u n t i l Mr . Lang indicates his readiness to accept responsibility for past as well as for futur e loans.",11
5,Mr R GREEN,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister assure the House that, as a representative of the Commonwealth on the Loan Council he will not agree to any moneys being made available to New South Wales u n t i l certain' specific legislation has been actually introduced into the Parliament of that State.",11
6,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"I received an assurance from the Premier of New South Wales yesterday that that legislation would be commenced today, and I am now waiting to hear what legislation is to be introduced. I have sent to the other Premiers a telegram today, pointing out that the successful launching of the Conversion Loan will be greatly prejudiced if the legislation for the plan is not proceeded with , and carried immediately. I urged that it was most important that all bills in all State Parliaments should be passed through all stages this week. WHEAT MARKETING BILL.",11
7,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I ask the Minister SCULLIN, for Markets whether the rejection by the farmers of New South Wales of the proposed State wheat pool will affect the Government's intentions regarding the Wheat Marketing Bill?  Wheat Marketing Bill only requires the consent of three States to the establishment of a Commonwealth wheat pool.",11
8,Mr KILLEN,Unknown,"Will the result of the wheat pool ballot in New South Wales be taken by this Government as an expression of the opinion of the farmers of that State in respect to the Commonwealth pool, without a further vote being taken?  honourable member's question shall receive my close consideration. MINISTERIAL TRAVELLING. USE OF GOVERNMENTMOT OB CARS.",11
9,Mr GABB,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Home A f f a i rs if , on the 27th May last, a government motor car from Canberra was waiting at the Blayney railway station to receive the Minister on his return from a visit to the Broken Hill portion of his electorate? Did the Minister, because heavy rain had fallen that day, continue the journey by train , reaching Canberra via Sydney? Is it the practice of the Minister to use motor cars on journeys of this character, involving between 300 and 400 miles of travel, when trains are available?",11
10,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"The incident to which the honourable member refers 'occurred while the House was in session. For several reasons I was desirous of arriving in Canberra on the night of the day mentioned, and, therefore, arranged for a motor car to meet me at Blayney; but the rain made it impossible to travel to Canberra by road. It is not the custom to use cars for long journeys, except on special occasions such as that. NA LEGISLATION. ATTITUDE OF THE OPPOSITION.",12
11,Mr KEANE,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"The following statement appeared in the Melbourne Argus on Friday last:"" During the passing of the economy measures in the Federal Parliament,"" said Mr. Lyons, ""The Opposition had been forced to keep on deck, and act as watchdogs to ensure the presence of a quorum."" I ask the Prime Minister whether that statement is correct, and how often the Leader of the Opposition has been in this chamber since he usurped his position?",12
12,Mr SCULLIN,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"I am not certain whether, as Prime Minister, I should answer that question. I have not seen the paragraph referred to. The Leader of the Opposition, like the leaders of all political parties, no doubt is claiming as much credit as he can for his own party for the passage of legislation. 1 must acknowledge that the Opposition assisted the Government in passing the emergency legislation quite as ably as did the members of my own party. SALES TAX . CANNED FI SH : GOVERNMENT PURCHASES.",12
13,Mr LATHAM,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"Will the Government give consideration to the serious disability imposed under tfhe Sales Tax Assessment Acts, upon houses that are both wholesale and retail-particularl y in South Australia and Western Australia which has been brought about by treating the proprietors of such houses as wholesalers only, where the greater proportion of the trade is wholesale in character? The Prime Minister is aware, doubtless, that in certain cases, severe hardship will follow the imposition of the sales tax at increased rates.",12
14,Mr SCULLIN,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,I shall give consideration to the matter. We shall be able to discuss such details when the bill is at the committee stage.,12
15,Mr BAYLEY,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"Has the Prime Minister yet given consideration to the request of the Fishermen's Co-operative Association, South Brisbane, that canned fish should be exempt from the provisions of the sales tax? On the 28th May last the association wrote asking that consideration be given to this matter.",12
16,Mr SCULLIN,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"Yes ; consideration has been given to this, among 500 other requests which have been dealt with. When one item of canned food is proposed to be exempted, we receive requests for the exemption of many other kinds of canned products.",12
17,Mr WHITE,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"Since exemption is granted under the bill to goods purchased by the Government of the Commonwealth or a government of a State, will the Government consider extending the exemption to purchases by municipal councils? I understand that the Victorian Municipal Association has already written to the Treasurer on this matter.",12
18,Mr SCULLIN,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"All these points will be considered when the bill is before the chamber. A considerable number of exemptions have been granted to both State governments and municipal authorities, and the result has been that we have had to increase the rate of tax by 1 per cent, in order to obtain the required revenue. The greater the exemption we give, the higher must be the rate of tax; or, alternatively, the greater the increase in the income tax. WATERSIDE WORKERS. LICENCES.",12
19,Mr MARTENS,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"Will the Prime Minister have compiled, if it has not already been done, a list showing the number of licences issued since the 30tb June last?",12
20,Mr BRENNAN,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"I think that particulars have been compiled almost to date, showing the licences issued, and the different classes entitled to them, under the new preferential system. I shall make a copy of the particulars available to the honourable member. SOVIET ERUIT DUMPING.",12
21,Mr WHITE,EMERGENCY ECONOMY,"The following statement appeared in the Melbourne Herald yesterday:ELIMINATINGAUSTRALIAN COMPETITION. Encouraged by the success of Australian fruits in the English market, the Soviet, says the Moscow correspondent of the Daily Mail, is preparing to attack with extensive dumping of fresh f r u it and dried fruits from Central Asia. Orders have been issued to the effect, "" that costs and home requirements must be disregarded. F r u it means foreign currencyRussia's most vital need."" The Russians hope that dumping will remove the competition, at least of Australian dried fruits from the market next season. If the Minister has seen that statement, does he intend to ask Cabinet to petition the British Government to place an embargo on such dumping, so that the market for Australian fruits may be safeguarded ?  - paragraph just read by the honourable member is being considered by my department. NA ADJOURNMENT.  members living in distant States will the Prime Minister state when this Government is likely to get through its business and when the House will rise for a recess adjournment? Railway bookings in certain States can be made only twice weekly.",13
22,Mr SCULLIN,PARLIAMENTARY,"It is difficult to make a forecast. When 'we get through the essential emergency legislation, we can, I think, adjourn for four weeks. During most of that time the conversion of the Commonwealth loans will be taking place, and subsequently there will have to be meetings of the Loan Council and a Premiers Conference to consider the result of the conversion, and other matters arising out of it. That will occupy the period for which the House will be adjourned. If we bend our energies to this end, .the House should be able to rise some time towards the end of next week, and it might be possible for honourable members, by throwing greater energy into their work, to so expedite business as to enable it to rise at the end of this week. I do not propose, however, that the work shall be scamped, or that undue pressure shall be put on honourable members by a series of all-night sittings, because the SOVIET DUMPING. legislation that we are passing is important. One all-night sitting is, as a rule, quite enough.",13
23,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,PARLIAMENTARY,What about the tariff?,13
24,Mr SCULLIN,PARLIAMENTARY,"My suggestion is to rise for four weeks, and then to resume to clear up matters arising out of the loan conversion, and afterwards to deal with the tariff. I have received requests from a number of honourable members of every party to make an opportunity for them to visit their homes for at least two or three weeks.",13
25,Mr THOMPSON,PARLIAMENTARY,We should adjourn for two or three months.,13
26,Mr SCULLIN,PARLIAMENTARY,"We shall probably do that later. The session has been long drawn-out, but we are living in abnormal times. The Debt Conversion Bill has to be proclaimed. It cannot be proclaimed until we get the Debt Conversion Agreement, which I hope to bring down today. We are waiting to hear from the Premier of Western Australia before we can go ahead. There are various bills arising out of the budget, the sales tax and income tax legislation particularly, to be passed. There is also a small amendment of the Gold Bounty Act; the bill providing for it will be introduced in a few moments. The Attorney-General has a small amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to introduce, and we have also to pass the Wheat Marketing Bill. - Mr LATHAM - Is the Government going on with that?",13
27,Mr SCULLIN,PARLIAMENTARY,Yes .,13
28,Mr LATHAM,PARLIAMENTARY,Why ?,13
29,Mr SCULLIN,PARLIAMENTARY,"-The Minister for Markets will explain why. The resolution dealing with dominion legislation must be passed. I gave notice today of a small amendment to the Public Service Act, but that should go through in a few minutes. Then we have the Estimates to consider. When we have disposed of all those pieces of legislation, we shall be able to rise for four weeks. NA TIMBER.",13
30,Mr J ONES,IMPORTATION OP RUSSIAN,"I am still receiving protests from my constituents against the importation of Russian timber into Australia, and, as the Minister for Trade and Customs has promised to make a full inquiry into the matter, will he state what stage this inquiry has reached?",14
31,Mr FORDE,IMPORTATION OP RUSSIAN,"The invoices showing the value of timber imported from Russia have not yet arrived. The timber is not being offered for sale, and security to the amount of 10s. per 100 superficial feet has been demanded by the department. Instructions have been issued that delivery of the timber is not to be given until I have been consulted; so that the industry has no reason to be apprehensive. The Government will see that the Australian timber industry is adequately protected. REDUCTIONS OF SALARIES, PENSIONS, ETC. Mr D. CAMERON - In order to remove some uncertainty at present existing, will the Prime Minister, seeing that the Financial Emergency Act has been proclaimed on a - datebetween two pay days, state whether the reduction of salaries, pensions, &c, will apply for the whole of the period covered by the pay, or whether the reduction will be on a pro rata basis from the date of proclamation?",14
32,Mr SCULLIN,IMPORTATION OP RUSSIAN,"The budget was prepared on the assumption that the reduction would be made on the pay day following the proclamation of the act. It is obvious that some of the provisions of the act could not be brought into operation later than others, and a delay of a fortnight would involve a loss of revenue amounting to £200,000. Therefore, the reductions will apply to Public Service salaries, pensions, &c, on the first pay day after the proclamation of the act. In. the case of salaries, the next pay day is Friday, and the reductions will apply to the whole period covered by that pay. NA COMMISSION.",14
33,Mr GREGORY,PERMANENT TARIF F,"Has the Minister for Customs noticed a report in the press of a speech by Mr Baldwin at Hull, in which he said thatHe had made up his mind that he would not be head of a government which was "" to make Great Britain a profiteer's paradise or parliament a crooks' corner,."" ""We must make the tariff ' knave-proof' as far as possible,"" he said. "" Therefore, it is essential that the scientific adjustment and adaption of the tariff should be taken from the hands of politicians by the establishment of a permanent non-political tariff commission, the members of which ought to be lifted as fur above party politics as His Majesty's judges."" In view of this statement will the Minister favourably consider the appointment of a permanent commission, free of party bias? If not, does he consider that Mr. Baldwin has been unduly optimistic in suggesting the possibility of removing tariff questions from political influence.",14
34,Mr FORDE,PERMANENT TARIF F,"I have not read the paragraph quoted by the honourable member; but I have read other newspaper paragraphs purporting to contain the remarks of eminent statesmen of Great Britain-remark s that were to the effect that in their opinion the time had arrived when a little protection would be a good thing for industry in that country. As for the appointment of a tariff commission, I may inform the honourable member that I was so sickened by the multitude of commissions, committees, and boards, numbering 58 in all, which were appointed by the last Government at a cost of £600,000 that I would not consider the appointment of any others. COMMONWEALTH FINANCE . DEFICITS.",14
35,Mr CURTIN,PERMANENT TARIF F,"Is it , in the opinion of the Prime Minister, an essential feature of the rehabilitation plan that the banks shall meet the Government deficits during the current financial year ? If so, does the scheme involve all the banks, the Commonwealth Bank acting in conjunction with them and on their behalf, and is there any limit to the amount of the deficits which the banks will carry?",14
36,Mr SCULLIN,PERMANENT TARIF F,"There is an agreement that the Commonwealth Bank, working in conjunction with the other banks, shall carry the Government deficits for this year; but there is, decidedly, a limit to the amount. We were warned, in the first place, that the limit would be reached by the end of June, when the amount would be £25,000,000. At that time the Commonwealth Bank going was carrying our deficit'- a thing which no other bank was prepared to do, except through the Commonwealth Bank, which traded a portion of the Commonwealth bills to the other institutions, though it carried the bulk of them itself. By the end of June we had reached the limit. During the Premiers Conference in Melbourne the banks agreed that they would continue to carry government deficits if we did not exceed the limit set at that time, which included the £30,000,000 accumulated deficit for last year, which was to be carried until it could be funded as a long-dated loan, and the sum of £14,000,000 or £15,000,000, the estimated deficit for all Australian governments for this financial year. Other conditions were laid down by the banks with regard to the issue of treasury-bills, and there are conditions also to be observed under the Financial Agreement, which is supervised by the Loan Council. CASE OF JACOB JOHNSON.",14
37,Mr LATHAM,PERMANENT TARIF F,"I direct the attention of the Attorney-General to the newspaper report of a meeting of the Trades Hall Council in Melbourne, at which the Jacob Johnson case was considered, which passed the following resolution:That the Argus he informed that its subleader of yesterday is false in substance, apparently designedly prejudicial, inasmuch as there was documentary evidence in the Crown Law Department that Mr Latham, then Federal Attorney-General, withheld very important material facts from Parliament at that time. Is there any evidence at all, or any foundation whatever, for the statement that I , as Attorney-General withheld important material facts, or any material facts, from Parliament at any stage.",15
38,Mr BRENNAIT,PERMANENT TARIF F,"If the honourable member withheld or suppressed material facts, he must have done it very successfully, because I have no information on the subject, and I have no reason to believe that there is the slightest foundation for the allegation said to have been made by Mr Clarke, of the Seamen's TJnion. May I add that the same gentleman has made, and promulgated a series of quite unfounded, wild, and irresponsible statements about myself so that honours are equal between the present Attorney-General and his predecessor in that high office. Relative to the honourable member's question is a statement by the Argus, that the inquiry proposed to be held is likely to be entirely vexatious and useless, or words to that effect. The Argus is not in a position to know what the matters are about which inquiry is to take place, and its judgment in that regard is ill-informed and premature. THE ESTIMATES.",15
39,Mr LAZZARINI,PERMANENT TARIF F,When will the Estimates be printed? Time could be saved if honourable members had an opportunity of perusing them some time before they are considered in committee.,15
40,Mr SCULLIN,PERMANENT TARIF F,"It is hoped that the Estimates will be ready for distribution on Wednesday, and that we shall proceed to consider them onThursday. It has not been possible to have them printed earlier than Wednesday; but as soon as they are to hand, they will be distributed. NA SPEECHES.",15
41,Mr LYONS,BROADCASTING OF POLITICAL,"In the absence of the Postmaster-General (Mr A. Green), I ask the Prime Minister whether he is aware that the Postmaster-General's Department has refused permission to station 5 AD, Adelaide, to broadcast and speeches to be delivered at a meeting to be held in Adelaide to-night under the auspices of the Citizens' League? What are the reasons for this refusal, in view of the fact that permission was given for the broadcasting of speeches made in Adelaide recently by the Premier of New South Wales, or his representative, and by the Treasurer, myself, and others, discussing political topics? Why has this permission been refused to the Citizens' League to broadcast through a "" B "" class station, and is it possible, even at this stage, to give authority for the broadcasting of it?",15
42,Mr SCULLIN,BROADCASTING OF POLITICAL,"I am not acquainted with the facts of the case. I understand that in these matters the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr H . P. Brown, exercises his discretion; but I shall inquire into the question raised by the honourable gentleman. BUFFALO FLY.",15
43,Mr MACKAY,BROADCASTING OF POLITICAL,"Is it a fact that the Government has decided against the proclamation of a buffer area in Queenslaud for checking the spread of the buffalo fly? Will the Minister for Home Affairs make available to honourable members the reports of the Queensland Minister for Agriculture, Mr Walker, and of Dr Mackerras?",15
44,Mr BLAKELEY,BROADCASTING OF POLITICAL,"The Government has decided, in view of all the circumstances, that the proposed buffer area would not be effective in checking the spread of the buffalo fly; but it has determined to continue, so far as possible, the present biological control, and it is continuing the campaign on those lines. Any honourable member desiring to see the reports referred to may do so on giving notice.",16
45,Mr MARTENS,BROADCASTING OF POLITICAL,"I had the good fortune to peruso the reports, and I would like to know if the department has considered the advisability of resorting to the spraying suggested by the experts ?",16
46,Mr BLAKELEY,BROADCASTING OF POLITICAL,"The Government has considered the whole of the recommendations. It was decided that spraying was the responsibility of the State; but the Commonwealth has offered to the Queensland Government the services of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, with the view to the preparation of a suitable spray. The advice of the scientists is available to the Queenslaud Government at any time. PARLIAMENT HOUSE LIFT .",16
47,Mr R GREEN,BROADCASTING OF POLITICAL,"I bring under your notice, Mr Speaker, the fact that a lift in the Opposition corridor has been out of commission for three or four, weeks. Since this is causing great inconvenience to many members who desire to use it, will you take steps to have it put in order as soon as possible?",16
48,Mr SPEAKER,BROADCASTING OF POLITICAL,"Hon. Norman Makin). - I am not aware that one of the lifts is out of order; buti f it is, I shall have it put in order immediately. NA SERVICES.",16
49,Mr MCGRATH,DUPLICATION OF MEDICAL,"the Prime Minister, upon notice In view of the apparent duplication in medical services of the Commonwealth with [142] those of the States, and the recent enormous growth of the Commonwealth Department of Health, will he consider the submission of the question of duplication and overstaffing of medical services to the Public Accounts Committee for full investigation and report, so that honourable members may be in a position to consider such report when the estimates of the Health Department for the present financial year are under review?",16
50,Mr SCULLIN,DUPLICATION OF MEDICAL,The functions of the Health Departments of the Commonwealth aud States are at present the subject of consideration by the committee arranged by the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers to inquire into the question of overlapping in Commonwealth and State departments. NATIONAL FLAG.,16
51,Mr CROUCH,DUPLICATION OF MEDICAL,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether the Canadian Governor General has adopted a special.iiag, which includes the Canadian emblem? 2. Whether the Governor General of the Commonwealth uses on Government House, and generally, the English flag, which already appears as part of the Australian flag? 3. Is the Australian flag recognized as the national emblem by the King? 4. Is the English flag more the King's flag than the Australian flag? 5. Is there any reason why the Australian flag, which shows its British connection by the partial use of the English flag, should not be adopted for Government House use?",16
52,Mr SCULLIN,DUPLICATION OF MEDICAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. His Majesty the K in g has been pleased to approve that the Governor General of Canada shall in future fly his own personal flag. The design of the flag consists of the Royal Crest in gold upon a blue ground with the word "" Canada "" underneath. 2. It is customary for the Governor General of the Commonwealth to fly the Union flag on Government House. Except on Government House, the Governor General uses a personal flag, which includes an Australian emblem in the form of a seven-pointed star. 3. Yes. 4. The Union flag is the flag in general use in the British Commonwealth of Nations. The Australian flag is significant of the fact that the this country is an autonomous nation within, the Commonwealth of Nations. 5. The question . as to what flag should be flown on Government House will receive consideration. FEDERAL CAPITAL. REDUCTION OF RENTS-REN T OF ELECTRIC",16
53,Mr MCGRATH,DUPLICATION OF MEDICAL,"the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice I. In view of the recent large reduction in the salaries of public servants, does the Government intend to extend to officers renting government-owned houses at Canberra the benefit of the reduction of interest rates, by decreasing house rents in respect of houses for which the Government is now paying less interest on the capital cost? 2. If so, what will be the approximate percentage reduction in rent, and will it operate from the date of the salary reduction ? 3. Will a reduction in interest be also made in respect of houses in Melbourne purchased by the Government from officers transferred to Canberra, and sold on terms to other persons ?",17
54,Mr BLAKELEY,DUPLICATION OF MEDICAL,Thes e matters are receiving consideration.,17
55,Mr BLAKELEY,DUPLICATION OF MEDICAL,"On the 17 th July, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro wealth (Mr Cusack) asked me the following questions, upon notice:1. Has he seen the report of the chairman of the Electric Light and Power Supply Corporation Limited, Sydney, reported in the Sydney Horning Herald of the 24th ultimo, wherein it is stated that the directors of that company had decided to dispense with the charge of meter rents, and that the first light and power meter was supplied free to consumers? . 2. What was the contract price for the supply to the Federal Capital Commission of the household type of electric light and power meter now in use in Canberra? 3. What is the estimated life of these meters ? 4. What are the charges made to the house- holder in Canberra for hire of light and power meters ? 5. What proportion of this charge represents capital charge, and what proportion represents annual interest charge? 0. What rate of interest is being charged for the hire of these meters after deduction of capital charge? 7. In view of the decision of the Sydney Electric Light and Power Supply Corporation .Limited, and the general reduction in interest charges, will the Minister be prepared to reconsider the existing high charges made in Canberra for meters? I am now in a position to advise him as follows:1. The report has since been brought to my notice. METERS. 2. £1 13s. Gd. at Canberra. 3. About seven years. , 4. Od. per month. 5. Interest, Is. 9d.; obsolescence, 4s.; ad justments, 3d. per annum. 6. No additional charges are made over and above those shown in answer to question 6 which are necessary to provide for interest and renewal of the meters at the end of their useful life^ 7. In view of answers given to Nos. 5 and 0, the charge for meter rent is not considered high, and it is not proposed to make ami-eduction at present. NA EXPERIMENTAL STATION.",17
56,Mr MACKAY,TOWNSVILLE STOCK,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that the CommonGovernment has decided to take control of the Queensland Government Stock Experimental Station at Townsville, Queensland, foi the purpose of scientific investigation of problems affecting cattle production? 2. If so, will he give particulars Qf the arrangement entered into with the Queensland Government ?",17
57,Mr SCULLIN,TOWNSVILLE STOCK,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are a? follow:1. The Commonwealth Government has arranged with the Queensland Government for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to take over the Stock Experimental Station at Townsville, Queensland, for the purpose of scientific investigation of problems affecting cattle production. This arrangement is conditional upon the Queensland Government providing a sum of £1.000 per annum and private interests, including the Pastoralists Association, meat companies, &c, contributing up to £4,000 per annum. The Empire Marketing Board will contribute for a period of five years up to £5,000 per annum on a £1 for £1 basis to match the money contributed by the Queensland Government and the private interests. 2. See reply to No. 1. RELIE F OF UNEMPLOYED.",17
58,Mr SCULLIN,TOWNSVILLE STOCK,"On the 8th July, the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked me the following vision question, upon notice:VVill the Prime Minister obtain the following information for the House:(a) The allowances made to the ployed single and married women, in the various States, the allowances made for children. (6) Are there any obstacles raised or objections made to claims for unemployed allowances being paid to men and women who have no permanent address through inability to pay rent? Replies have now been received from the State Premiers setting out the position in their respective States, and a summarized statement has been placed on the table of the Library for the information of the honourable member. FINANCI AL EMERGENCY BILL . Assent reported. GOLD BOUNTY BILL (No. 2). SECOND READING.",18
59,Mr FORDE,TOWNSVILLE STOCK,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.40]"" - I the move That the bill be now read a second time. .Towards the close of last year an act was passed for the purpose of providing a bounty to encourage the extension and development of the gold-mining industry in Australia. Shortly afterwards Senaprovision tor Daly, who was then responsible for its administration, called a conference in Melbourne of the Ministers of Mines the various States, and representatives the gold-mining industry. Certain memshall - bers of the conference were appointed a gold council to consider the the industry and advise the Government. The conference made a number of suggestions for the amendment of the act the regulations made pursuant to These suggestions subsequently received the careful consideration of the Governadvising ment, which accepted some of them and rejected others. This bill gives effect all the suggestions which received the approval of the Government. As honourable members are aware, prohas already been made in the Financial Emergency Act to reduce the gold bounty by 50 per cent. It is only right, however, that in this connection I should unemremind honourable members of the followmen and ing observations which I made last and year in moving the second reading of the Gold Bounty Bill : The contention has been raised that if the exchange rate increases the rate of bounty should be reduced. The representatives of the industry - hold the view that, because of the resultant increase in the cost of living, wages, and other charges, an advance in the exchange rate would not improve their position appreciably, but the Government reserves the right to reconsider the matter in the event of an abnormal rise in the exchange rate. An abnormal increase in. the exchange rate did occur, and this was one of the reasons why in these abnormal, times a reduction of the bounty was justified. The reduction was considered by the representatives of the gold-mining industry, who conferred with the Treasurer on the subject at Canberra. I believe that those gentlemen went away completely satisfied that the fair thing had been done. As honourable members know, the bounty is payable only on the excess over the average production over last three years. Bounty will be paid for the first six months of 1931 at the rate of £1 per oz., Australian currency, on the excess production over the average production for the years 1928, 1929, and 1930, and for the second six months of the year, and thereafter' at the rate of 10s. per oz. Australian currency. But has been made that the rate of bounty shall increase at the rate of Is. per oz. in respect of every decrease of of 3 per cent, in the average rate of exof change per cent, below 30 per cent., but not in any case exceed £1 per oz. to These conditions are provided in the welfare of Financial Emergency Act. One of the proposals made at the conand ference presided over by Senator Daly it. was that an Australian gold council should be established for the purpose of the Minister responsible for the administration of the Gold Bounty Act. to It was suggested that the membership and functions of this council should he as follow:1. To consist of sixteen members-The Minister, a member of the Executive Council, the Minister of Mines for each State, the member for the Northern Territory, and seven representatives of the gold-mining industry. 2. To advise the Minister on all questions relating to the industry. 3. To inspect, at request of the Minister, accounts, books and documents of any registered producer. 4. Council to appoint agents for such purposes and in such places as it saw fit. 5. Council to appoint such officers as necessary to assist the council. 0. Council to recommend claims for bounty and claims not recommended not to be paid. 7. Any dispute between the Minister and a gold-producer, as to compliance with his undertaking, to be referred to the council for a recommendation. 8. Council to receive up to 5 per cent, of bounty to cover expenses and for other purposes. 0. Council members to be paid fee for attendance at meeting or when engaged on other bounty business. 10. Council to receive - travelling allowances. 11. An executive committee of the council to be formed from the "" industry"" members with such powers and functions as the council decides. Although some honourable members who arc enthusiastic advocates of the encouragement of the gold-mining industry sincerely believe that such a council should be established, and can, no doubt, advance good reasons in support of their belief, the Government felt that under existing conditions it would not be justified in incurring the heavy expense that would be involved in the setting up of such a body. The Trade and Customs Department, which is responsible for the administration of our bounty legislation, will be able to - do all the necessary work in connection with the payment of the gold bounty and the checking of claims without setting up an outside body to be financed out of the Treasury payments for bounty. The Government has been promised the active co-operation of the Mines Departments of the various States. In these circumstances, it will not be necessary to engage any additional staff to administer this legislation. If a gold council were established and were authorized to retain 5 per cent, of the gold bounty, it would Mr Forde. have an income of £10,000 per annum, assuming that if the payment of gold bounty at the rate of £1 per ounce, involved an expenditure of £200,000, and of £5,000 if it involved an expenditure of £100,000 at the rate of 10s. per ounce. Such a body would doubtless need to call for the assistance of the mining inspectors of the various State Governments. Tho Government has been promised all the assistance that the State Mines Departments can give it in connection with the administration of this legislation, and the State mining inspectors will be available to inspect mines and/ report upon them, and to do anything else that might bo necessary in this direction. The Minister for Trade and Customs, and the Comptroller-General of ^ Customs, will both be able to arrange with the State Governments for the assistance of the State mining officers. [Quorum formed.'] It has been found that several amendments of the act are desirable. The amendments now proposed do not affect the essential substance of the act, but involve matters concerning its practical application. In the first place, it is urgently necessary that the definition of "" licensed gold buyer "" should be extended. The present definition reads "" licensed gold buyer means a person authorized under the law of a State or territory to buy gold "". The effect of this is that in a State where there is no law authorizing persons to buy gold there are no licensed gold buyers for the purposes OJ this act. The only States which, up to the present, have such a law are Victoria and Western Australia, so that in the other States, until the definition is amplified, there can be no licensed gold buyers to whom producers can sell their gold and obtain there for the certificates required to enable bounty to be claimed. This disability could be overcome by the Parliaments of New South Wales and Queensland passing legislation to provide for the licensing of gold buyers, similar to the acts . in Western Australia and Victoria, but as they have not taken that action it is deemed advisable that this Parliament should make the necessary provision. The amendment proposed will overcome this difficulty, as banks and others operating in States to which the present definition does not extend can be specified by the Minister as licensed gold buyers for the purposes of the act. It is because of the urgency for action in this direction that the bill is now brought forward. The words proposed to be added to the definition are:and includes any branch in Australia of His Majesty's Royal Mint and any authority of a State specified by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette, or any person so specified. This will enable a storekeeper or State official if needed to be appointed a gold buyer in a centre where there is no branch of a bank. This matter was brought to my notice by several members, notably the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan), who pointed out that many places in his electorate have no banks, but gold could be sold there if local storekeepers or other reliable persons were appointed licensed gold buyers under the Gold Bounty Act. As to the reference to the branches of the Royal Mint, I may say that specific mention of these in the definition is necessary. There is a branch in Melbourne and one in Perth. They do not, however, come under the present definition, as they are not authorized by the law of the State to buy gold, but operate under British law. It is of course necessary that they should be "" licensed gold buyers"" for bounty purposes. The second amendment is the addition of a definition of a "" tributer"". Later amendments make reference to tributers, and it is therefore desirable that tributers should be defined. The definition reads"" T r i but e r "" means a person who works a mine or portion of a mine under an agreement with the lessee or owner of the mine to pay to, or receive from, the lessee or. owner, a portion or percentage of the product taken from the mine, or of the proceeds of the sale of that product. , The third amendment is to paragraph c of sub-section 3 of section 3. This section how provides that gold contained in material shipped abroad for treatment shall be deemed to have been produced in the year in which it was so shipped. Before such gold can be considered for bounty it is, of course, necessary that isfactory evidence be furnished as to the actual quantity of gold recoverable from the material. Such evidence may not, however, be available in the same year in which the material was shipped; in any such case, it is desirable that there should be authority for the gold to be brought into the accounts of the year in which the evidence is furnished. Otherwise the settlement of the bounty claima promptly after the close of any year might be seriously delayed. To provide for this the addition of the following words to the section is proposed:or, where a shipper has not, in the year in_ which shipment is effected, furnished evidence to the satisfaction of the Minister as to the quantity of the gold commercially recoverable from such matte, concentrates, or other material, as the case may be, the gold shall, if the Minister so directs, be deemed to have been shipped in the year in which such evidence is produced. The next amendment-that to section 7 of the act-is associated with that just mentioned. The proviso to section 7 requires the production of an assay certificate of the value and content of the gold in material shipped abroad for treatment. The quantity of gold in such material is not, however, necessarily the quantity of gold which is commercially recoverable from the material, and bounty should not, of course, be payable on a quantity in excess of that recoverable. The amendment to this section, therefore, is to require an assay certificate as to the gold content of the material, and, in addition, evidence as to the quantity of gold commercially recoverable. The next amendment is to section 8, and is to make clear that bounty will be paid only in respect of gold for which claims for bounty have been lodged, and, so far as gold in material shipped abroad is concerned, in respect of gold commercially recoverable, which may be less than the gold actually contained in the material. A new section-is proposed to be inserted after section 9 for the purpose of ensuring that tributers participate equally with the owners of the mine in any bounty on gold resulting from their labours. According to the nature of the agreement satbetween the tributer and the owner or lessee of the mine the tributer may be entitled to the gold he obtains-in which case he would pay a share to the mineowner or lessee-or , on the other hand, the gold obtained may go to the owner or lessee, who would pay a proportion to the tributer. In the latter case the tributer should receive from the mineowner or lessee a. share of any bounty paid in respect of the gold concerned, and it is to make this clear that the section is added to the act.. The new section provides that where a gold mine or portion of a gold mine is worked by ,a tributer, the owner of the treatment plant at which gold from the ore produced by the tributer is recovered, shall pay to the tributer 50 per cent, of any bounty received in respect of the gold obtained from such ore. This provision is urged by the Tributers Association of Western Australia. The views of the Chamber of Mines, Kalgoorlie, were sought. The chamber, in the first place, raised no objection, but within the last few weeks has advised that the matter has been reconsidered, and that it now opposes legislation on the lines suggested. The chamber states that this decision is in accordance with the cabled views of the London Board of Directors of Western Australian gold-mining companies. Mr de Bernales, who has been most actively interested in the bounty, has all along strongly opposed this amendment to protect the interests of the tributers. The Australian Workers Union of Boulder, Western Australia, which has also been consulted in the matter, agrees with the suggested provision.",18
60,Mr NAIRN,TOWNSVILLE STOCK,-Does that apply irrespective of the proportion the tributers are to receive under agreement?,21
61,Mr FORDE,TOWNSVILLE STOCK,"The agreements will be drawn up independently of this bounty. Some persons have said that, because of this new provision, the mine-owner will drive a harder bargain when letting tributes, but that is not a matter within the purview of this bill. The tributers in Western Australia are responsible for the production of over 100,000 oz. of gold annually, and their interests in the matter are, therefore, considerable. The Postmaster-General (Mr A. Green) knows the circumstances of the tributers Kalgoorlie district very well, and he has represented to me their views. Moreover, the State Mining Act provides that 50 per cent, of any premium on gold is to be paid to tributers, and it is considered equally desirable that their rights in respect of the bounty should be similarly ensured. Minor amendments are made to sections 11 and 18 to cover work done by tributers, and at the end of section 18 an additional sub-section is inserted. Sub-section 6 of section 18 authorizes the Minister to appoint in certain circumstances an authority for determining conditions of labour and rates of wages. It is desirable that the nature of this authority should be defined, to ensure particularly that such authority is representative of both employers and employees. The proposed new sub-section is in the same terms as sub-sections in recent bounty acts, notably those relating to cotton, flax, and linseed, and reads(7.) An authority appointed by the Minister under the last preceding sub-section shall consist of a representative of employers engaged in the production of gold, a representative of employees engaged in such production, and a person, who shall act as chairman, and who shall be appointed by the Minister on the joint nomination of the representatives of employers and employees: Provided that if the representatives of employers and employees fail to make a joint nomination of a chairman within twenty days of being called upon by the Minister to do so, the Governor General may appoint a person to act as chairman. The last amendment is to the schedule to the act, prescribing the form of application for registration as a gold producer. In the application, certain undertakings are given by the applicant, which bind him for ten years-the full term of the operation of the act. It is p'ossible, however, that a producer may at any time desire to withdraw from the operation of the act and participation in bounty, and to be free from compliance with the undertakings he had given as to allowing inspection of the mine, &c. It is reasonable that, this contingency should be provided for, and the suggested amendment of the form of application is for this purpose.

62,Mr SCULLIN,WOULD OTHERWISE BE LESS THAN TEN,"Yarra-Prime Minister) ['4.6] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill provides for these new rates of income tax to be applied in assessments for the present financial year, and will give effect to the Government's proposals1. to increase the normal rates (i.e. the rates exclusive of the special tax on property incomes) of tax payable by companies and individuals by 5 per cent, all round; and 2. to increase the special tax on taxable comes from property from 7 i per cent, to 10 per cent, of the amount of that income. As already announced in the budget speech, the estimated yield of additional tax from the increase of 5 per cent, is £380,000, and that from the increase of the special tax on property incomes is £830,000. The balance of £290,000 necessary to make up the estimated total additional revenue of £1,500,000 is expected to be obtained from the reduction of the general exemption of personal exertion incomes from £300, diminishing by £1 for every £3 of the excess over £300 and vanishing at £1,200, to £250, diminishing by £1 for every £2 of the excess over £250, and vanishing at £750. The reduction in the general exemption of personal exertion incomes will be provided for in the Income Tax Assessment Bill which is to be introduced. A special feature of the Income Tax Bill will be the consolidation of the original schedule rates of 1915 and all the existing super-taxes and additional and further taxes, except the special tax on property incomes, into one rate expressed in a simple formula for personal exertion and property incomes, respectively, and ascertainable in respect of any given amount of taxable income by a simple arithmetical calculation. The confusion resulting from the existing super-taxes and additional and further taxes, and the complexities of the curves of the second and third degrees caused by the existing formulae, has been a source of continual annoyance and trouble to the vast majority of taxpayers, and has, in its practical result, made them completely dependent upon the Taxation Department's ready reckoners for the ascertainment of the extent of their liability for tax. The Government, in its desire to eliminate, where practicable, any complexities in a system of taxation which is inevitably complex in its very nature, instituted inquiries into the possibility of obtaining a more simple rate without materially altering the result obtained under the existing system in the amount of tax assessable in any particular case. For that purpose, the Government obtained the expert advice of Professor Giblin who, on looking into the matter, inexpressed the opinion that the desired result could be obtained. The new consolidated rates are fully explained in Professor Giblin's notes, which have been circulated among honourable members. It should be noted that the consolidated rates have been designed to incorporate all existing rates and super-taxes, &c, plus the proposed increase of 5 per cent. They do not, however, incorporate the proposed special tax of 10 per cent, on property incomes. The rate of tax on income from personal exertion is contained in the first schedule; and that on income from property is contained in the second schedule. To calculate in any particular case the amount to be added for the special tax on property incomes, it is merely necessary to add to the tax calculated under the second schedule 10 per cent, of the amount of the taxable income from property. Honourable members will find attached to the circulated notes of Professor Giblin, two statements-Tabl e "" A "" and Table "" B ""-whic h give a comparison, at stated amounts of taxable income, between the rate which would apply and the tax which would be paid if the old method of calculation were applied to the taxes proposed for the present financial year, and the rates which will apply and the tax which will be paid under the new method. The tables also compare, at stated amounts of taxable income, the taxes which will be paid, for the present financial year, 1931-32, with the taxes which were payable for the last financial year, 1930-31. The tax under the new method, as shown in the tables, has not been worked out to the last decimal point, hence the actual tax payable under the proposed rates may, in some cases, differ to theextent of a few pence from the of The - tax so shown. It will be observed that 'the rates under the old and new methods, - respectively, differ in most cases only small fractions of a penny, although here broken and there they approximate to, and even exceed, Id. for example, at taxable comes from property of £3,001, £5,000, £10,000 and £20,000. would The differences are sometimes against will the taxpayer, for example, at £500 serve and £3,000 taxable income from either source, and sometimes in favour of the For taxpayer, that is at £3,001, £10,000 and £20,000 taxable income from either 30), source. In the case of incomes from pervided sonal exertion the rates under the new and method are, in general, slightly less than the rates under the old method. [Quorum formed.'] The effect of the. proposed rates is illustrated by two graphs which have been drawn up by Professor Giblin for the purpose of comparing, up to a taxable inbut come of about £600 from each source, the graduation of rate under the old and measure, new methods respectively. These graphs from are also circulated for the information of honourable members. Two further statein ments have been circulated, one of which shows the effect of the reduced general demands. exemption of personal exertion-incomes, and also compares at given amounts of net and taxable incomes from personal exertion, the tax payable at existing rates rate for 1930-31, and the tax payable under the rates proposed for 1931-32; and the all the States, except Victoria, where the taxa other similarly compares the tax paytion able on property incomes-including the special tax of 10 per cent - under the existing and proposed rates, respectively. Apart from the excision of the provisions for super-taxes, &c, the new first and ciple second schedules and the other aspects is dealt with, the bill will be practically identical in form and contents with the Income Tax Acts 1930. It is merely tax lincessary to point out that clause 5 of are the bill replaces section 7A of the 1930 act, and that sub-section 3 of that section tion is omitted from clause 5 for the income. reason that it relates specifically 'to income which was actually derived during the year 1929-30, and, therefore, has no legislation, function in any act which applies to avoid income subsequently derived. Mr Scullin. Professor Giblin has supplied these notes on the amended income tax scaleoriginal scale of the federalincome tax 1915 was carefully graduated, so that there were no abrupt differences of tax for incomes differing by a small amount. Successive by amendments to the Income Tax Act have into the original graduation, and introduced marked irregularities. For example, the ta,x on £201 is 10 per cent, greater than in the tax on £200. Again, the tax on £500 £500, is £12 Is. 4d., but an additional £1 of income increase the tax by £1 17s. New formula for the tax have been designed which smooth out these irregularities, but prethe variations in principle which have been introduced by amendments of the act. example, the graduation from £200 on is"" made steeper than in the original scale, us provided by section 6 of the act of 1929 (Nto. and from £500 on steeper again, as proby section 7 of the act of 1930 (No. 51.) ; so on for other variations that have been enacted by Parliament. But the variation is introduced gradually so as to avoid sudden jumps. These formulas consolidate the successive additions to the original scale, namelyAdditional tax; Super-tax; Further tax on higher incomes; Proposed further tax on all incomes; do not cover the further special tax - on incomes from property, an emergency which it is desirable to keep distinct normal taxation. The new consolidated scales make a new starting point for ordinary taxation, which, future years, can be decreased or increased by 5, 10 or 20 per cent., as the situation The new scale for personal exertion is on the same principle as tBe original personal exertion scale. The rate begins at 3d., and increases l/160th of a penny for each additional £ of taxable income, so that the on £160 is 4d., and on £320, is 5d., and ou £1,600 is 13d. A smooth scale of this kind has now been adopted for income tax by 1 scale still retains serious irregularities and anomalies. The principle of the original scale from property was to increase the steepness of graduation between £500 and £000, and case it ofi' gradually for higher incomes as the limits of taxation were approached. This prin(together with the successive amending principles) ,is preserved in the new scale, bill effected by a simpler method, which avoids the mathematical complexities of curves of the 2nd and 3rd degree.

63,Mr LATHAM,CONCILIATION AND,"Kooyong) [4.16] Once again this House is invited to con-, sider the unfortunate subject of federal industrial conciliation and arbitration. This is the fifteenth bill on this subject that has been introduced in this Parliament since 1904. Many of these bills have been introduced with high hopes and confident anticipations of benefits to follow for the community as a whole, and again and again those hopes and anticipations have been disappointed until many people are wondering whether the power of this Parliament, as expressed in the Constitution, to legislate in respect of arbitration and conciliation has not, in practice, had a result exactly opposite to that was expected by those who were responsible for the early legislation on this subject. The last amending act was passed as recently as August last, and now we have a further amendment before us. The legislation as finally passed by both Houses last year was in terms which represented a compromise between conflicting views. A conference was held between representatives of this House NA (STATUTORY EXEMPTION IS UNCHANGED). Present Tax Proposed Tax (including Super-tax).

This bill deals with what was represented by the Commonwealth to be one of the principal features of its industrial policythe extension of opportunity for conciliation as distinct from arbitration. The Government stated that the last amending bill was introduced with a bona fide desire on its part to provide a further means of conciliation as distinct from arbitration. In fact, as was pointed out at the time, there was already in the act ample provision for conciliation. Every opportunity that could be or had ever been suggested for applying what might be called the conciliation jurisdiction of the court was available under then existing legislation. The registrar, the judges, the conciliation commissioners and committees were all available to perform the function of conciliation. When the last legislation was passing through Parliament, it was suspected by some honourable members on this side of the House that the real object of .the. Government was not to extend the, ^conciliation powers of the court, but to provide a means of preventing thecourt from functioning whenever the Government desired. The suggestion, however, was repudiated by the Government, and the legislation was passed, so far as this part of it was concerned, in a form that was considered satisfactory by the Government. Section 33 of the act, as amended by and the last legislation, provided that whenever a conciliation committee was appointed by the Government of the day, the Arbitration Court should cease to function in relation to that matter during the period in respect of which the conciliation committee was appointed. Therefore, it was possible under the act as passed last year for the Government to prevent the Arbitration Court from functioning in relation to some of its most important duties. The bill was accepted as a promise, and it passed this House. As soon as it was through there arose an agitation among certain of the trade unions for the appointment of conciliation committees. The Government was urged to appoint such committees in order to prevent the Arbitration Court from dealing with applications for the reduction of wages. Of course, one can readily understand any man, or any body of men, adopting that attitude. In Australia today we have to recognize that we are passing through a period of economic adjustment, and I think one might not unfairly say that every section of the community is interested in one way or another, and every section is, to some extent at least, resisting the re-adjustment insofar as it affects their private interests. That is quite natural. We, however, in this Parliament represent all the people, and we ought to consider legislation, not from the point of view of this section or of that, but of the community as a whole. We should not accept legislation which is designed to enable one party to industry, whether employers or employees, to hold up the operations of the Arbitration Court whenever it suits them. That, unfortunately, was the effect, and the intended effect, of the last arbitration legislation. After the last amending bill was passed through Parliament, it was not disguised that the hope and expectation of the unions was that the Government of the day, being amenable to their influence, would appoint conciliation committees so as to prevent the Arbitration Court from bringing about a re-adjustment of wages under federal awards.",28
64,Mr BBENWAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The honourable member must admit that the Government made fairly effective resistance to the demand for the appointment of commissioners. Mr Latham.,29
65,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"- I am speaking now of conciliation committees, of which no fewer than seventeen were appointed. There was no real pretence that any dispute existed between employers and employees in the industries affected, except this matter of economic re-adjustment. Nevertheless, the conciliation committees were appointed, and it cannot be seriously denied, I think, that the object of their appointment was to prevent the com- Arbitration Court from functioning. When applications were made by the railway commissioners of various Statesincluding States in which Labour governments were finding it impossible to balance their budgets, because of railways rendered unprofitable largely by arbitration awards-the industrial unions raised the point that, owing to the appointment of conciliation committees, the Arbitration Court was unable to function. The matter went to the High Court, and the point at issue was whether the appointment of so-called conciliation committees prevented the Arbitration Court from functioning in, respect to applications for a reduction of the basic wage. The High Court found, in the railways case, that the provision relating to conciliation committees was invalid for the reason that the act purported to confer on them arbitral powers, but did not effectively provide for arbitration, for the hearing of parties and for such procedure as would bind all parties to a dispute. It was held, therefore, that the provision in section 34 being invalid, the other provision in section 33 preventing the Arbitration Court from dealing with matters during the period of office of conciliation committees, was itself ineffective. Therefore, the bar to the action of the Arbitration Court was removed, and the court had jurisdiction to hear applications in respect of the basic wage. The result is that, although the conciliation committees appointed under the existing act are able to perform all their functions of conciliation, the Arbitration Court cannot be prevented from hearing applications. The bill now before us is intended to remedy that result of the act, and - represents another attempt by the Goa vernment to maim the Arbitration Court, and prevent it from functioning whenever the Government is of opinion that, for any reason, it should not function. If this bill is passed,, it will be possible the Government to remove any matter from the Arbitration Court-wit h some negligible exceptions to which I shall refer later-wheneve r it suits the Government, or those behind the Government, to follow that course.. Until section 34 was inserted in the act last year, there was no. power in any government to affect the proceedings of the Arbitration Couri. The conciliation committees, provided for under the legislation passed in 1928, were appointed by the Chief Judge, not by the Government, and the whole of the proceeding was under the control of the court, subject to the conciliation committees discharging their functions of conciliation in their own way. There was no possibility of interference with the eourt by the Government. The last amending act provided for this interference, in the sense of preventing the court, at the will of the Government, from discharging its functions in cases in which it was possible to appoint conciliation committees, which means in practically all cases.",29
66,Mr CHIFLEY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Were not the conciliation committees to deal with a matter at the wish of one of the parties?,30
67,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"In part, the Minister is right; but, in fact, conciliation committees can be appointed without any application by either party. Moreover, whenever either party wanted to prevent the court from acting, it would apply for the appoiritment of a conciliation committee, and its application would be granted if the Government so desired. In any event, it depended on the will of the Government. The undesirable feature of the arrangement is that powers of arbitration are conferred ou these conciliation committees, and it is the Government which determines the industry in relation to which they are appointed, the period they are appointed for, and their personnel. Those concerned in the dispute may make a recommendation regarding the personnel, but there is no provision that such recommendation shall be taken into consideration.",30
68,Mr HOLLOWAY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The industry itself appoints its representatives.,30
69,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That is not so, as the honourable member will see if he reads act. It is laid down in the act that the for Governor General shall appoint the committees, of which one-half shall consist of the representatives of the employers, and one-half of representatives of organizations of employees.",30
70,Mr HOLLOWAY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,But that is merely the formal wording of the act.,30
71,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I am quoting from sub-section 6 of section 34, which states that, before appointing representatives of the employers and the organizations of employees, the Governor General may take into consideration any recommendation made by, or on behalf of the employers or organizations of employees. The Government, however, is not bound to take that into consideration, and the Governor General has a free hand. Mr. Curtin' - That same provision was inserted in the Maritime Industries Bill.",30
72,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"No . If the honourable member looks it up, he will see that in that bill . it was provided that the Governor General "" shall "" take into consideration auy recommendation made. The object of the present measure, is to enable the Government to select anyarbitral tribunal it likes, and prevent the judges of the Arbitration Court from operating whenever the Government desires. Therefore, I oppose the bill. It appears to me to be radically unsound.",30
73,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,This is precisely the bill to which the honourable member agreed. I thought that he was hungry for it.,30
74,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I have already explained that, when the existing legislation was before the House, the Government - disclaimed any intention to use it for the purpose of ham-stringing the Arbitration Court. It stated that the provisions of the bill were to be used in a bona fide manner for the benefit of industry. We have had experience of its operations since then, and have seeu that, as soon as the bill was passed, certain sections outside the House did uot even attempt to disguise its real object, namely, to enable the Government to carry out the desire of certain organizations that their cases should not be heard by judges of the Arbitration Court, who have independent tenure of office, but by the bodies selected by the Government itself.",30
75,Mr BKENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The wishes of the vernment have nothing to do with it. movers in the matter were the representapowers, tives of the organizations. able member is merely repeating what he said before.",31
76,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Since then, I have had my suspicions abundantly confirmed.",31
77,Mr BKENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,But the honourable gentleman was sure before.,31
78,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"No ; experience has shown that the object of the Government, under this proposal, is not to bring about further conciliation, but merely to vent the Arbitration Court judges from acting.",31
79,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Can the Governmeut do that?,31
80,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"If the bill is passed, yes. The fourth clause contains a set of visions with respect to the appointment important, of conciliation committees, and constitutes an endeavour to get over the decision the High Court in the Railways Union case. Mr E. RILEY - The High Court wants us to do that now.",31
81,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Parliamen t makes up its mind, independent of the High Court. If the court bad made any such intimaing, tion, it would have been highly improper. I do not think that the Attorney-General would suggest for a moment that the court had intimated any desire as to legislation that should be passed, except in non-contentious matters of procedure. before. Mr E. RILEY - This bill is non-conCentious.",31
82,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Bot h sides agreed to it.,31
83,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"We have now had committees. experience of this legislation. This clause has been drawn up to get rid the decision in the Railways Union and is designed to confer every conceivOpposition able power upon the so-called conciliaagreed tion committes, which are really tion committees. The only exception is to be found in proposed new sub-section 11, which provides:For tluj purposes of this section, a tion committee shall have all the powers which arc conferred by this act upon court or a judge thereof, other than(a) judicial powers: and (ft) powers which, by reason of the protwo branches of the legislature. visions of section eighteen A or section eighteen AA, are"" not exercisable by a single judge. GoThat is to say, a conciliation committee The is to have all powers, except judicial which can be conferred only upon The honorjudges appointed for life, and, secondly, powers with respect to the modification of the basic wage and the standard hours. Existing judicial powers fall under two headings-the imposition of fines and penalties, and the granting of injunctions in certain cases, and the interpretation of awards. From a practical point of view, there are now practically no fines and penalties provided for under the Arbitrapretion Act. The penalties in regard to lock-outs and strikes have been repealed, and there will be few, if any, cases in which the court, or anybody else will be asked to exercise judicial powers. The power to grant injunctions against, say, a State industrial authority, still exists. proThe interpretation of power is not very at present, because there is full power to vary awards, and matters of of interpretation can readily, in effect, be determined by applying for a variation in order to express an award in terms in which it is desired to be interpreted by the parties. Consequently, these bodies, under this bill, will have the power of making awards by a majority, of suspendcancelling and varying awards, and, indeed, all the normal powers of a court.",31
84,Mr BKENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,All the powers which the the honourable member thought that they had when he agreed to this legislation,31
85,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I point out to the Minister that, when the previous bill was going through, I strongly objected to the conferring of arbitral powers on these",31
86,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I was not here when of the honourable member actually agreed to case, the passage of the bill and when the managers from both Houses to it precisely as it is now proarbitraposed to be passed into law.",31
87,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The Minister is going a little beyond the facts, since this is a new bill to which nobody has ever conciliaagreed. I have already stated the facts. the I have said that the last measure was agreed to as a compromise between the two sides of the House, and between the I reminded members of that at the beginning of my remarks. I then pointed out that certain provisions had been held to be invalid, and that this measure is designed to cure that invalidity.",31
88,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Since the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Lyons) others have gone over to the Opposition, the honourable gentleman is becoming less compromising.",32
89,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The Minister is now introducing politics. There should be no political observations, because honourable members opposite are all non-party men. all",32
90,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Will the honourable ber help to cure the invalidity?,32
91,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I am not concerned about helping in that direction, after experience I have had of the manner in elaboration. which the Government has used this legislation, or attempted to use it, in the past, and in view of certain other provisions to which I intend to refer.",32
92,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The Arbitration Act has been used only for cutting wages 10 not per cent.; the working classes have not the Arbitration got sixpence out of it.,32
93,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Clause 3 provides that wherever a conciliation committee appointed-and that depends on the will of the Goverument under clause 4-th court shall have no jurisdiction to act in relation to the industry, or the dispute in respect of which the committee is appointed, during the period for which had not been validly appointed. it has been appointed. Therefore, power is sought, under the present bill, to prement vent the Arbitration Court from acting at all. When the last measure was before us, we were assured that that intention of the Government. I repeat that experience has satisfied me that it was the intention of the Government the time, or that the Government has changed its intentions since those reprethatsentations were made in this House. I point, out, also, that now it is proposed to confer on the conciliation committees to power to suspend or vary awards, and effectually every other power that the court has or can have. These are not to be conciliaBy tion committees in substance; they are to bo new arbitration tribunals. The last clause of the bill must be in conjunction with the previous clauses. It is a most remarkable provision. I am sure that it must have occasioned the Attorney-General and his officers great mental contortion to produce it. honourable gentleman states that he case, drafted it without any trouble. I congratulate him. I do not know whether he thought it was so unintelligible that nobody would venture to ask what it and meant, that somehow it would be accepted by this House, and that it might be interpreted in a particular way. The clause readsEvery conciliation committee purporting to have been appointed before the commencement of this act shall be deemed to have been to intents and purposes as validly .and effectually appointed as if this act had been in memforce at the date of the appointment. What is the object of that clause?",32
94,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,It is so simple and the consequential that it should not require,32
95,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I propose to elaborate it. The attempt to prevent the Arbitration Court from reconsidering wages failed because the seventeen or more conciliation committees had been validly appointed, and Court made certain reductions in the basic wage. The Arbitration Court heard the is basic wage case, arid reduced the wage by 10 per cent. That was neither a pleasant e nor a popular thing to do. It was held by the High Court that the Arbitration Court had jurisdiction to hear the case only because the conciliation committees It is now proposed to validate the appoint of those particular conciliation committees, and, doubtless, it is intended thereby to invalidate the decision of the was not the Arbitration Court.",32
96,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Nonsense ; I do not at think the honourable member is serious.,32
97,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Clause 7 provides Every conciliation committee purporting to have been appointed before the commencement of this act shall be deemed to have been all intents and purposes as validly and appointed as if this act had been in force at the date of the appointment. this means an effort is being made to remove the foundation of the decision of the High Court that, as the conread ciliation committees were not validly appointed, the Arbitration Court had jurisdiction to hear the basic wage case. If the intention of the Government is not to render invalid the decision of the The Arbitration Court in the basic wage let it say so clearly. We shall then know exactly where we stand. If the intention of the clause is merely to remove a certain amount of inconvenience, I suggest that that could be done by an issue of the Government Gazette. We must face the fact that the sooner there is an economic re-adjustment in this country the better it will be for everybody. The Government has informed us that the national income has fallen from £650,000,000 three years ago to approximately £450,000,000, a reduction of 30 per cent. In a speech which the Treasurer broadcast a few nights ago he said that any one who thought that old wage rates could continue in present circumstances, was living in a world of illusion. It is unpleasant to have one's income reduced, but no service, will be done to the workers of this country by allowing them to think that wages can be maintained at the old rates. Some honourable members opposite appear to r.hink that honourable members on this side of the chamber like reducing wages. That is pure nonsense. But from considerations of common sense, as well as of humanity and patriotism, it is wise thai the people should be told clearly that a [though it is desirable to maintain wages a i the highest possible point, they cannot be maintained at the old rates. To pass legislation to provide that the wages of every person in the community should be £500 per annum would be - just as foolish, and would be fraught with at l^ast as much danger to the community, as to pass legislation to provide that no wages should exceed a rate of £500 per annum. In our wage-fixing legislation we must have regard for economic realities. Wages come from the proceeds of industry, and from nowhere else. Government is foolish if it hopes that by the enactment of this provision it will render inoperative the 10 per cent, reduction which the Arbitration Court has ordered in the basic wage. If 'this clause is passed there may be a disastrous and devastating increase in unemployment. We are considering this bill at a time when the Government has, at the eleventh hour, recognized that unless real weight Labour is given to economic considerations that proposal. Australia will be ruined. Yet this provision will prevent the Arbitration Court, and other federal industrial Itfr. Latham. authorities, from having regard to economic considerations. Section 38 D of the principal act provides. (1.) If it appears to the court on the application of any organization or person interested or of the Registrar(a) that an organization entitled to the benefit of an order or award has conimitted any other breach or nonobservance of the act or of an order or award; (6) that any number of members of an organization, sufficiently large . to form a substantial part of the organization, refuses to accept employment either at all or in accordance with existing orders or awards; or (c) that for any other reason an order «r award ought to be suspended or cancelled in whole or in part, the court may, by order, subject to such conditions as it thinks f it , suspend or cancel for such period as it thinks fit, all or any of the terms of any order or award in force so far as the order or award applies to, or is in favour of, the organization or its members. The effect of clause 6 is to strike out from paragraph c the words "" from reason "", and so prevent the Arbitration Coun from having regard to the circumstances of an industry or the economic condition of the community. Honourable members who pay close attention to industrial matters will remember that the employees' representatives who appeared in the recent basic wage case argued thai the court should not pay any regard whatever to the economic condition of the community. That, of course, would amount to economic and social lunacy.",32
98,Mr BKENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"- I do not think thai any honourable member of this party, OJ of this Government, has adopted thai attitude. The Mr LATHAM - I remind the Attorney-General that the Labour members of the last Parliament strenuously resisted the Bruce-Page Government's proposal to amend the existing' arbitra- tion legislation to provide specifically that the Arbitration Court should pay attention to the economic effects of its proposed awards. A bitter controversy raged round that very point.",33
99,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Every member of the party, including the present Attorney-General (Mr Brennan) resisted",33
100,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That is true. Under section 38 D as it now stands, the Arbitration Court may "" suspend or can cel for such period as it tbinks fit, all or any of the terms of any order or award in.force "" for any ""reason"". If , for example, it is shown that an industry cannot continue to pay the wages provided in any award or order the court may suspend or cancel any such award or order. By the removal of the word "" reason"" the court would be deprived of the power to take into consideration the economic condition of the industry, or of the community as a whole. It is also proposed to add two paragraphs to the section, namely(d) that all the parties bound by the order or award have consented to its suspension, cancellation or setting aside in whole or in part; or (e) that it is desirable, by the reason of the making of a further order or award binding on all or any of those parties, that the order or award should be cancelled. In effect, paragraph d provides that the court may act by consent, which it can do at present; and paragraph e provides that it may cancel an award or order only in the event of a new order or award being made. Honourable members may think that that provision adequately meets the situation. - Mr. Curtin - Hear , hear!",33
101,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) knows better than his interjection suggests.,34
102,Mr CTJBTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,I think it is far preferable for the court to vary an order or award than for it to wipe it out altogether.,34
103,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The court may only make a new award in the case of a new dispute. We are working under one of the most remarkable systems of industrial legislation in the world. Many years ago it was enacted in section 24 of the Arbitration Act that in the event of an industrial dispute occurring and the parties being unable to reach an agreement, the court or a conciliation committee could, by an order, "" determine the dispute"". That was all right as far as it went; but, unfortunately, it was subsequently held by the High Court that during the currency of the original term of an award there could be no dispute upon any matter which was at issue prior to the making of the award. Consequently, men might be at one another's throats, and there might be widespread lockouts and strikes, but there could be no dispute if the matter at issue between the parties was one which the Arbitration Court had dealt with in the making of the award in question. That, of course, is a consequence of the queer industrial power of this Parliament. All the matters dealt with in an award, made in pursuance of the provisions of section 34 of the act, were presumed to have been settled in a friendly manner; yet the country might actually be torn asunder because some of these matters had not actually been settled. If honourable members desire further light on this subject. I refer them to the gas-workers' case.",34
104,Mr HOLLOWAY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The honourable member himself was responsible for the setting up of conciliation committees.,34
105,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That is true. As conciliation committees they are all right, but as arbitration authorities they are seriously defective.",34
106,Mr BKENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,What are the defects?,34
107,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"There are so many that it would take me a long time to state them. But I repeat that the object is to prevent the Arbitration Court, or the so-calledi cotociliation committees, from taking into account the general economic condition of the community-in this instance, in relation to the suspension or cancellation of awards. We hear much talk about the maintenance of standards. I repeat, that I believe in the highest economic standards that we can maintain, but honourable members are aware of what is happening all over the Commonwealth. Even where awards apply they are being evaded wholesale, and no action is being taken by the organizations that are aware of these unfortunate facts. Work cannot possibly be given in the terms of some awards, and, if we have any common sense or reason, we shall realise that there must - be a reconsideration of wages in many industries, and of labour conditions in nearly all, and the sooner the better for the unemployed. Too often employers and employees are ready to agree in the court to any new condition if the burdeD can be passed on to the community. It might be worthwhile to allow counsel for the unemployed to appear in every case. It is useless to pass legislation to maintain standards which are necessarily related to the economic position of the community while prohibiting the tribunals concerned from taking into account existing economic circumstances.",34
108,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Why should the honourable gentleman repeat the statement that we are prohibiting them from doing that; surely he knows that that is not so?,35
109,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"At the present time the court, or a conciliation committee, can suspend or cancel an award for any reason which seems sufficient to it, but that provision is to be struck out, and another provision substituted to authorize the suspension or cancellation of au award by consent or in the event of a new award being made. "" B y consent"" means nothing, and I have pointed out that a new award cannot be made, during the currency of an existing award, in relation to any matter within the ambit of the original award. Eor mauy years we have been livingin a very uureal world in regard to industrial affairs. We have been able to maintain our outlook only because of the extraordinary prosperity we have enjoyed owing to the high prices of wool and wheat, and to the expenditure of a large amount of borrowed money. It will, be to the advantage of every worthy element in the community to bring about, as quickly as possible, that economic re-adjustment which the reduction of the national income makes inevitable, and not to set up any artificial obstacles such as this bill proposes to create. In all the circumstances I cannot support the measure.",35
110,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Werriwa) [5.10] The speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) was much ado about nothing. Apparently, when agreeing to the existing provisions relating to the conciliation committees, the honourable gentleman anticipated that the High Court would declare them invalid. He supported the appointment of committees then, and he opposes the system now. I opposed those provisions then, and I oppose them now, because the defects in them will not be improved one iota by the bill. All the talk about conciliation committees is futile. The act does not do what it was intended to do, and the bill does not repeal the appeal section, in respect of which the Government made such a cowardly surrender to the Senate. Nobody can question that the Labour party had a mandate from the people to go right ahead with its industrial policy, but the Government surrendered at the first onslaught by the Senate. The provisions in the act relating to conciliation committees is mere camouflage and humbug. They purported to give to the committees arbitral powers, so that they could rectify or prevent unfair decisions by other bodies. The Senate provided for a right of appeal from the decisions of the committee to the Arbitration Court, and thereby rendered nugatory the Government's policy.",35
111,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Hear , hear!",35
112,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Apparently , the Attorney-General wanted those provisions to be rendered nugatory, because the present bill does not repeal them. Was all the talk in which we indulged when we were in opposition and on the hustings, simply eyewash ? Were we simply tickling the ears of the electors with the object of getting into power and staying there at any sacrifice of them and our. principles? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the Arbitration Coiu-t should take into consideration the probable economic effect of a proposed award. To that the Attorney-General said, "" Hear, hear!"" When we were in opposition we fought with all our might against that provision, and the Attorney General was one of the strongest opponents of it.",35
113,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"What I said was that that special duty should not be enjoined on a judge; his discretion should not be hampered. I contend that that provision shotild not have been inserted, and I stand by that.",35
114,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,But the bill does not propose to remove it.,35
115,Mr MARR,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Does the honourable member agree that the judge should consider economic circumstances ?,35
116,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I do not, and the Labour party was definitely against such a provision. ' The industrial and political branches of the Labour movement have stood foursquare for the principle enunciated by Mr Justice Higgins in his Harvester judgment, when he declared, unambiguously, that an industry which could not pay a living wage should be allowed to die. That was the attitude which the Labour party declared on the public platform, and to which it claimed it would have the courage to give legislative effect if it was returned to power.",35
117,Mr BELL,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Does the honourable member propose to allow all industries to die ?,36

119,Mr BELL,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The honourable member's policy would kill all industries.,36
120,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"If an industry can be carried on only by paying what one party to it says it can afford to pay, there is no end to the economic degradation that will be imposed upon the workers. They will be reduced to a bare subsistence that. and to the economic slavery that exists in the sweating hells of Europe, India, Japan, and other eastern countries. Women still work in the coal-mines of British India under British governlast ment. If the argument of honourable members opposite were carried to its logical conclusion, female labour should be allowed in the coal-mines of Australia. When little children worked in the coalthe mines of Britain and never saw daylight the doctrine of the employers was that which honourable members opposite preach today; they pleaded the economic necespolicy sities of industry, and said that if children were taken from the factories and womeu from the coal-pits, industry would die. Those honourable gentlemen who talk so much and so loudly about the economic effect on industry of workers'wages say thing about the economic effect of the fiteering charges of the employers. They do not clamour for an inquiry as to prices are too high to enable our products to be sold in other countries, or as obsolete machinery, watered capital, and excessive overhead costs including direcby tors' fees that cannot be justified. Not a power to do more than that. word is said about the effect of profiteerhave ing prices on the purchasing power of the community.

The members of the so-called Oivnosition spend their time throwing bouquets at the Government. If the arbitration law is to be effective we must discontinue the eye-wash about conciliation committees. noThe court must have power to inquire proexhaustively into industry. It is not sufficient that the court shall crosswhy examine the wives and daughters of the workers regarding what they pay for the to most intimate articles of their apparel, sometimes to the' accompaniment of gibes learned counsel. The court must have It must power to inquire into the conditions and ramifications of industry. As there a basic wage, so there should be a basic Any company that approaches the court, and pleads poverty, declaring that it cannot afford to pay the wage fixed the in the industry in which it is engaged, should have the onus placed upon it of proving its statements. The court should have power to make searching investigations in regard to the capital and assets of-a company and the extent to which it has watered its capital or issued bonus shares. '",36
127,Mr THOMPSON,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"""What does the honourable member mean by basic profits?",37
128,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The honourable member is not capable of understanding what that means. The court should have power to make an exhaustive inquiry into the conditions of labour. It should be able to ascertain the extent to which industry suffers because of the numerous hangers-on of capitalism-the boards of directors, who draw high fees though perhaps sitting no more than once a month. Some companies have been divided into two or three sections. That has happened at Port Kembla, in my electorate, and the company concerned is always howling for higher protection and pleadiug poverty. The court should have power to inquire into the methods of industry-whethe r they are up to date or obsolete. These things should be adjusted on a proper economic basis before any attempt is made to reduce the wages of the workers. An arbitration court which has no power to investigate the conditions of industry is of no use to the worker. Why have the awards of the court been rendered nugatory? What was the spectacle that we had during the war ?",37

132,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The honourable country member has frequently referred to strikes on the coal-fields. He has quoted statisindustry tics from the Year-Booh showing the number of working days and the amount of wages lost because of strikes. Let tell him that in one coal-pit in my elecbers torate there was no strike for two years, yet. the men, because of their intermittent employment, did not work on more an average of three days a fortnight ing that period. Had the strikes on coal-fields not occurred, the mines would have closed down because of there being no demand for coal. The statistics in Year-Book relating to the coal industry are absolutely misleading. I commend to the honourable member for Warringah this old saying, ""Figures do not lie, but liars figure"". It is well known that figures can be turned and twisted to prove anything.",37
133,Mr GREGORY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Why has New South Wales lost its coal trade?,37
134,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Every child in the community knows that we lost our coal trade because of the operation of the War Precautions Act, which prevented the export of coal from Australia during the war. In addition, the increasing use of oil fuel and hydro-electric power has led to a considerable decrease in the consumption of coal. No arbitration award has ever been effective in this country. Immediately an award is made in favour of the employee, the employer nullifies it by increasing his prices to the consumer. The court, when fixing wages should have the power to fix prices in the industry concerned. Unless the court can assure to the worker the continuation of the conditions existing at the time of its award being made, arbitration is useless to the worker. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) harped all the time on the necessity for economic reconstruction. By economic reconstruction he means further wage reductions. He cannot think of economic reconstruction without associating it with the reduction of wages. He has an open mind in regard to wages, but it is closed like a clam when there is any suggestion to force companies to de-water capital or to divulge their profits. Honourable members opposite desire this to revert to the conditions of the 'nineties, to the conditions of the rural when the boss of the shearing board raddled the sheep, - and claimed it was not sufficiently shorn, the shearer conme cerned receiving no pay. Honourable memopposite want to return to the vicious conditions which at one time applied to the white-workers, in regard to whom the than honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. durMaxwell) once said that a wage of 12s. the a week was sufficient; when the big departmental stores employed girls for a six-months' probationary period at no the pay, allegedly to teach them the trade, and at the end of that period dismissed them in order to employ other probationers. Then, an employee in those stores worked for a miserable wage from 7 a.m. till 10 p.m., from Monday to Friday inclusive, and from 7 a.m. to midnight on Saturdays. Under those conditions Grace Brothers, Anthony Hordern, and other big departmental stores built up their trade. The directors of those firms are now living in palatial suburban dwellings, which have been built put of the sweat, tears, misery and slavery of their employees. The honourable member 1 for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) can supply illuminating information on that subject, because at one time, when a member of the Arbitration Court, he was instrumental in proving that the representatives of these big establishments had perjured themselves in court. In my electorate, before I was its member, the representatives of the coal-owners had their perjured experts at Wollongong Swearing that there was no gas in the Mount Kembla mine. While their evidence was being given an explosion took place, while the miners were at work, actually caused by the gas in that mine. These facts are on record, and cannot be gainsaid by honourable members opposite. The Arbitration Court was established to get rid of conditions such as those, and for that reason the Labour movement, the industrial organizations, and the workers accepted the principle of arbitration. When Mr Justice Higgins, in the Harvester case, laid down the famous principle that industry, in order to live, must pay a progressive living wage, the Labour movement, on the industrial and political sides, accepted the principle of arbitration, knowing that when they were able to show, by means of data supplied to the court, exactly what the cost of living was, the court could not fix the basic wage at anything less thau that. On that understanding only did the Labour movement accept arbitration, and on that basis, the super-structure of arbitration awards was to be built up. There was to be an extra margin for skill, technical knowledge, danger of the occupation, &c. Now, according to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Arbitration Court, when fixing the basic wage, is to consider, not the cost of living, but what industry can afford to pay. If that policy be followed to its logical conclusion, the Arbitration Court can be used to re-institute all the evils of the sweating system which it was created to destroy. This bill will . not give to the workers anything for which they are asking. It will not prevent the Arbitration Court from reducing wages by 10 per cent, or 20 per cent, if it likes. I desire to place on record my opinion that the arbitration system as now administered is utterly futile. It is lop-sided, and results in the victimization of the workers. When an application is being heard before the court, the business secrets of the employers must be scrupulously respected, even though the country itself is crumbling to decay. In this very Arbitration Act there is a provision that if an industrial representative discloses any business secrets which he may hear in court he may be fined £500. In my opinion, the fact that the employers are so jealous of these business secrets is the very reason why they should be dragged out into the light of day. It is time this-.humbug *was ended. The court does not hesitate to make the most searching inquiry into the lives of citizens if they happen to be workers. They are made to disclose how much beer they drink, how much tobacco they smoke, how much rent they pay, and what clothes they wear. Even the women are dragged into court, and made to give evidence as to the cost of their most intimate articles of clothing.",37
135,Mr MARR,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,They volunteer that information.,38
136,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"They do not. If these inquisitorial methods can be applied to the wives and daughters of workers, they should be applied also to the wives and daughters of the employers. If the worker is made to disclose his income and all the details of his expenditure, then the employer should be made to disclose his profits, and other relevant details of his business. So long as arbitration - is being employed, as it now is, to drive the workers back to the old sweating conditions, it is only a delusion and a snare, and the sooner it is thrown overboard the better.",38
137,Mr NAIRN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Perth) [5.41] - I opposed the Government's amending bill last year, and, in view of subsequent events, I have much pleasure in opposing this bill as well. I find pleasure also in the prospect of receiving the co-Operation of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini), and if at a later stage there should be an opportunity of moving for the suspension of Arbitration Court awards, at any rate during the present period of distress, I hope that the honourable member for Werriwa will support me. I understood him to say that the arbitration system was of no use to the workers, and of no use to him. There are many other people also who believe that the system is of no use to the country at this time, and that its suspension is desirable. When the Labour party came into power in 1929 it had before it one important task-the amendment of the Arbitration Act. Eor twenty years or more arbitration courts had been consistently raising wages, and the workers as a whole were eminently satisfied with the system. The Labour party came into power with a mandate, as it was called, to improve the arbitration law so that the process of pushing wages ever upwards might be continued.",38
138,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"We came in with a mandate, but did not have the machinery.",39
139,Mr NAIRN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The Government found that already the process of raising wages had gone too far. The arbitration courts, which in the past had yielded to the pressure of the unions, had called a halt, and were inclined to bring about some reductions. The Government thereupon changed its tactics, and by means of the amending bill introduced last year, so altered the arbitration system as to make it possible, it believed, to peg wages at their existing level. The scheme was astute in its conception, and simple in design. It set out to substitute for the Arbitration Court a series of conciliation committees, so-called, though their powers went far beyond conciliation. It was intended to paralyse the Arbitration Court by giving power to either party to a dispute to make application for the appointment of a conciliation committee. During the operation of this committee, the Arbitration Court was to be powerless to vary the existing award. That was a very good scheme from the Government's point of view if it had worked, but it proved to be ineffective. The High Court has held that the whole provision is invalid. Now the Attorney-General comes before Parliament and asks us to remedy the mistakes he made in drafting the last bill, and, in addition, to grant further powers to the conciliation committees. For my part, I refuse, not only to help in remedying the mistakes, but to grant any further powers. Indeed, if 1 had the opportunity, I would go further, and take action to suspend the operation of the Arbitration Court for at least three years, or until the country had made sufficient progress towards"" recovery. I have not the slightest doubt that the arbitration courts have been a most important factor in hampering industry in Australia. When the amending bill was brought down last year, there was' much talk about the industrial disputes which these conciliation committees were to settle. We see now that, although the committees have been utterly inoperative, there has been an almost entire cessation of strikes. The reason, of course, is the general shortage of money. It is the ' absence of prosperity that is responsible for the absence of strikes, and I have no doubt that, if we ever get back to the old prosperous' conditions again, strikes will be just as numerous as ever, whether we have an arbitration court or conciliation committees. I believe that the arbitration courts, coupled with the operation of the tariff, have been, to a large extent, responsible for the lamentable position in which Australia finds itself today. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) advanced one of the soundest reasons for the abolition of the arbitration system. He, and other honourable members opposite, have shown that the effect of the arbitration system is to produce a steady upward movement in the cost of living, and that wages are for ever chasing this increase. Therefore, even though the courts grant increased wages, the workers do not derive any real benefit. There was a time when things were flush with us-whe n we were living beyond our means, on borrowed moneywhen we could afford to keep pushing wages steadily upwards; but that time has gone, and I believe that the majority of honourable members opposite recognize that. For that reason, it would be better, I think, if the Government refrained from introducing controversial measures of this kind, and devoted itself to the more important financial measures for the rehabilitation of the country. Whatever the arbitration system has done for Australia in the past, we have nothing to hope for it in the future. Measures such as this and the Wheat Marketing Bill serve only to create a maelstrom of contention. Parliament has already devoted too much of its time to the consideration of the arbitration legislation.",39
140,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"We could not proceed any quicker with the finance bills. Mr NAIRN"" - I do not believe that the Government is serious in bringing in this bill; it is merely making a gesture to its supporters. I cannot believe that it has any reasonable expectation of seeing the bill passed, and I have a good deal of satisfaction in opposing it.",40
141,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Bendigo) [5.49] - I am glad that there are some honourable members' on the opposite benches who candidly, and even brutally, declare that their object is the destruction of the arbitration system. I do not know whether the honourable member for Perth (Mr. Nairn), and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen), have expressed the views of their own party. The wages of 771,000 men registered under federal arbitration awards have been wrongfully cut by the judges of the Arbitration Court. That tribunal, in the Railways Union case, said that it was necessary, in the interests of employment in Australia, to decrease the cost of production by reducing wages. Members of the Opposition declare that that was a sound pronouncement, but I suggest that there has been a marked increase in unemployment, since that cut was made. In the industrial history of Australia, no man has proved a greater curse to the working people than the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham).

145,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Despit e the fact that, in practising his profession, he obtained a lot of money by way of legal fees from trade unions, I admit that, as an industrial lawyer, he was the best man available, but he was not the right person to regulate industrial conditions with which he was unfamiliar. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also had a tilt at the Transport Workers Act, another abomination, which has caused more trouble than any other measure passed by this Parliament. It put 11,000 men out of work for three years, and included among them were 8,000 returned soldiers.",40
146,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,s-The honourable membor has no foundation for that statement.,40
147,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The honourable member has shown his interest of late in those who pay the income tax and sales tax, but he has done nothing for the benefit of the toilers. Every honourable member knows that the abolition of arbitration awards, or wage reductions, would bring about a reduction of .the cost of production, but what honourable members opposite really want is that the employers should not be policed by any arbitration laws. The amendment sought under this bill is desired on behalf of the whole of the Eederated Unions of Australia, including the Australian Workers Union. I have no delusions about arbitration. From practical experience of it, I claim that it still has some advantages, though not many. Although it admittedly ensures a minimum wage and a maximum number of hours, when a depression occurs, or when there has been some muddling of industry, the employers can induce the court to cancel or vary an award. [Quorum formed.] The employers of Australia, and the Opposition in this chamber, contend that the cost of production must be reduced, and I think that they would admit that all they have in mind is the reduction of wages. There is never a suggestion for an improvement in the organization of industry.",40
148,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I have denied that again and again, and yet the honourable member has the effrontery to make that unjust charge.",41
149,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The federal arbitration laws at least guarantee to the workers some protection. Honourable members know that, when he was Attorney General, he "" put the boot into "" every union whenever he got a chance, whether he was dealing with coal-miners, seamen, waterside workers, or any others. Following upon every action taken by the organizations to protect their own interests, he brought down a new bill to crush them by imposing imprisonment or heavy fines for breaches of the law.",41
150,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,That is a deliberate untruth.,41
151,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I have said that the honourable member is the best industrial lawyer I have known; but, as a maker of industrial laws, he is a colossal failure. Arbitration has not inflicted on the employers of Australia the hardships that it is .alleged to have caused. A perusal of the awards will disclose that they have provided a basic wage, at the most, of about £4 6s. a week for a worker in auy industry that may be mentioned. Mr WHITE.:-Of course, there is a margin for skill.",41
152,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That basic wage is subthe ject to quarterly adjustments in accordmeasure ance with variations in certain commodity prices, but those figures are not a real index to the cost of living. Although allowance is made for food, clothing, - housing, and a few other items of' extheless, penditure, there is no provision for expenditure that is incurred in every home, such as medical fees, subscriptions to societies, legal fees, school fees, fees, insurance premiums, tram and bus fession. fares, and cost of school books, amusements, firewood, gas, coal, and electric light. The basic wage, whether Federal or trust me. State, has proved insufficient to cover all the ordinary expenses of the worker. The highest margin allowed for skill 4s. a day, or 24s. a week, and only worker in about every 90 .employed advice. under federal awards receives a marginal rate. No award makes provision for sick, holiday, or accident pay. Thereand fore, this much discussed arbitration has not been the great boon to the workers that the employers continually claim. The present members of the Arbitration Court, who were appointed by the late Government, may have excellent legal qualifications, but they are not fitted to arbitrate on industrial matters. The present Government has decided that the court should be freed from legal entanglements, and, to that end, conciliation committees, which were provided for under the last amending bill, are to be authorized in an improved form under the present measure. They are to be composed of representatives of both employers and employees, who, after all, are the only persons who are familiar with the industrial conditions that will be investigated. .They will be qualified to decide what wage an industry can afford.",41
153,Mr MABK,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Does the honourable member agree that the power of an industry to pay should be considered by the court?,41
154,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Whether I do or not, that matter has always been taken into consideration, and always will be. It has been claimed by both employers and employees that only by the appointment of conciliation committees can. peace in industry be secured. I admit that the trade union movement has not yet taken advantage of the provision of the appointment of conciliation committees under last amending bill; but, if the present is passed, I believe that it will result in good progress in dealing with the industrial problems of this country. I have always recognized the right of employers to fair consideration. Neverin this age of improved arbitrathe tion, we should adopt new methods, and, if possible, appoint new.men as arbitrators. I say, frankly, that I have no conunion fidence in members of the legal pro",41
155,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,I think that if the honourable member consulted me he would,41
156,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"As a legal adviser, yes; but, if I wished to settle an industrial is dispute, the honourable member is about one the last man from whom I would seek If I did so, the honourable gentleman would at once say that the men engaged in the dispute were in the wrong, that something must be done to get them back to work. He would then prooeed to do something in accordance with the views of the organizations which assisted to secure his return to this Parliament. Those organizations expect something from him, just as the organizations which sent me here expect something from me. I shall support this bill because I believe that the trade unions favour it, and that it provides for the handling of industrial problems in a practical way by practical men. It appears to me that-the views of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) have changed since the previous Arbitration Bill was before us.. On the former occasion he said that there was nothing wrong with the legality of conciliation committees; but he has now changed his opinion.",41
157,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,I did not discuss the legality of the committees.,42
158,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"In my opinion, the honourable member has reversed - his opinion on many aspects of this subject. We should do our best to protect the interests of the workers. It was stated in this House last month that in consequence of variations and cancellations of arbitration awards, the workers of Australia had already lost £24,000,000. I believe that they have lost six times that amount in consequence of the prevailing unemployment. The workers rightly expect this Government to do something to protect their interests, and they are giving the Government every opportunity in this regard. It was indicated in an official statement in the House recently that in the last twelve months there had not been a strike or a hold-up in a single-Australian industry. I believe that if conciliation committees are constituted for all our major industries industrial peace will continue, for legal complications, which do a great deal to foment industrial strife, are not likely to arise. When I need meat I go to a butcher; when I need a haircut I go to a hairdresser. I go to the practical man every time. So, when I want to ensure the smooth working of our industrial machinery, I go to those who should control it, namely, the employers and the employees. Our union lenders have, in most cases, been engaged in this highly specialized work for many years, and are well acquainted with the practical problems of industry. There is no reason why legal gentlemen should interfere in this matter. I do not suggest that it is the ordinary thing for absurd awards to be made; but I assert, without hesitation, that the machinery of courts is clumsy and cumbersome. If disputes could be referred without delay to thoroughly competent representatives of employers and employees, they could, in most cases, be promptly settled. We ought to do everything that we possibly can do to stop the landslide in wage reductions. If a conservative institution like the Bank of England believes that a policy of drastic wage reduction would be calamitous to Australia, surely Labour members of this Parliament are entitled to express the same opinion. I regret that although wages have already been reduced there is no sign of interest on bank overdrafts and advances being reduced, although we have been told that this is a vital part of the rehabilitation plan. Everything was to be reduced, but, as usual, wages have been reduced first. The trade unionists of Australia have every right to expect this Government to take all possible steps to see that wages are not reduced except by constitutional means. Already the arbitration awards governing 36 different groups of workers in the Victorian Railway Department have been cancelled. This is a most serious thing for the workers, who were not given any opportunity to show how overhead and other expenses in the operation of the railways could have been reduced. There was no need for the ruthless sweeping aside of all our wage standards by persons who do not know the "" ABO "" of railway management.",42
159,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"It is only fair to say that the court has not been exercising arbitration powers, but has been imposing compulsory sacrifice.",42
160,Mr MARR,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,That is a nice statement for the Commonwealth Attorney-General to make.,42
161,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,It is a fact.,42
162,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"It is also a fact that 21,000 persons have been dismissed from the Railway Department of Victoria, although we were told that by reducing wages it would be possible to provide more employment. That argument is just as irrational, to my mind, as the argument that by increasing the hours of work it would bo possible to increase employment. The remedy in each case simply aggravates the trouble. How on earth is it possible to provide more work by making the weekly working hours 48 instead of 44? If that can be done, black is not black.",42
163,Unknown,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.,43
164,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The use of conciliation committees in lieu of legal arbitrators, is essential, because legal men, having no knowledge of industry, cannot be expected to be able to settle disputes between employers and employees. have shown that the Opposition complaint that arbitration has been a burden to industry is not justified. The general result of arbitration has been an inadequate basic wage with some slight margins. Awards have not provided for sickness, injury, or holiday pay. To-day we read that the private banks, which have made a profit of £13,000,000 in nine years, have joined in the wage slash. A court of legal judges has granted their application despite the fact that they have not reduced interest on advances and overdrafts as this House was led to believe they would. A job is done well only when it is handled by men who understand it. An inquiry into the sugar industry should be conducted by sugar experts. Similarly, industrial disputes should be settled by experts-by the representatives of employers and. employees. The object of this bill is to validate tions 33 and 34 which this Parliament believed to be sound when it enacted them, but which the High Court ruled otherwise. The necessity for arbitration policing is greater now than at any time during the last eight or ten years, because men are being driven by economic necessity to work for any rates the employers choose to offer. That is a condition of affairs to which those who are opposed to this bill would like Australia to They 'consider that the suspension of arbitration awards is a corollary of the financial rehabilitation plan. I have no great faith in the arbitration law, but at' least it provides for reasonable rate3 of 'pay and working hours. If the restraint which it 'exercises were removed many employers would revert to the conditions so graphically described by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) this afternoon. I too recollect those dark days that preceded the judicial regulation of industry. The employers are still making large profits. The legal gentlemen on the arbitration bench, before all of whom I have appeared, introduced, in connection with the recent basic wage case, three considerations entirely new to the procedure of the court. I am not prepared to allow the court to exercise its powers without restraint. The conciliation committees will do a great deal of good; they will eliminate legal jargon and prevent I lawyers from meddling in things they do not understand, stringing out/Cases in order to collect big fees, and too often making a shocking mess of the business they have in hand. Lawyers are necessary for the drawing up of wills, but that is about the only purpose for which I would employ them. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) and his followers are always stressing the need to reduce the cost of production. This bill is a measure to help the people who supported the Labour party at the polls. Nationalists do not vote for me; I Avas elected by Labour votes, and I intend to state the views of the Labour movement. Although the Arbitration Act has not achieved the success that we hoped of it, it is the only policeman that can today protect the workers. Wage slashing is in progress, and the sec- proper functioning of conciliation committees will give to those men in jobs at least the satisfaction of knowing that if a reduction does take place it will be only after an exhaustive hearing by a tribunal on which they, as well as the employers, are represented. I find no fault with the act. When the amending bill was agreed to some months ago, members of the Opposition were agreed that conciliation committees were revert. necessary. The bill is not loaded; it represents the desires of many thousands of registered trade unionists. Moreover, it is in accord with the oft expressed desires of the employers. They have urged that employers and employees should meet at the conference table and discuss their grievances without the doubtful aid of shorthand writers and lawyers. This bill will enable the parties to come together as experts in their ownindustry and settle their differences. The measure should have the support of every member of the Opposition, especially having regard to the audacious attitude of the Senate towards the previous arbitration bill introduced by this Government. I am just awakening to the fact that, instead of accepting the Senate's dictation in this matter, we should have referred the issue to a general election. The senators were guilty of political bushranging. A few old gentlemen who had not been before the people for three years had the audacity to reject the legislation of this House, which represented the recent choice of the electors.",43
165,Mr SPEAKER,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Order ! The honourable member is not in order in reflecting on members of the other branch of the legislature.,44
166,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I bow to your ruling, Mr Speaker. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham), when Leader of the Opposition, agreed that sections 33 and 34 were sound. The honourable member possesses oue of the best industrial legal minds in the Commonwealth, and, if his views were right last year, he must, to bo consistent, support the bill. The measure will have my support for the paramount reason that it is wanted by the trade union movement. It is equitable, and will make for amicable relations between employers and employees.",44
167,Mr GREGORY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Swan) [8.10] - If the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. Keane) is so much in favour of conciliation committees as he professes to be, why does he want to retain the Arbitration Court with all its panoply and expense? Why not agree at once to the abolition of the court and allow industrial conditions to be settled by conciliation committees representative of employers and employees? The natural deduction to be drawn from his attitude is that he desires to get ""rid of the Arbitration Court; so do I . After a long observation of its operations, I am convinced that nothing has doue more injury to Australia,, created more antagonism between the partiesto industry, and rendered worse service to the community. When the arbitration system was first introduced, people were delighted with the knowledge that in future industrial strife and ill-feeling would be obviated by recourse to a tribunal presided over by a judge, which would decide between the parties. For a time employers and employees alike went confidently before the courts, loyally accepted their decisions, and were well satisfied; but, in the course of time, it became apparent that the party which swore hardest scored most. It was obvious also that a legal president, no matter how learned in the law, might know very little about industrial conditions. Then the tug-o'-war started. Both employers and employees formed organizations, and prepared for the next appeal to the court. Antagonism between the parties increased, and honourable members will recollect that the Scottish commissioners who visited Australia reported that in no country in the world had they seen evidence of such bitterness between employers and employees as existed in Australia.",44
168,Mr LAZZARINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Who said that?,44
169,Mr GREGORY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The honourable, member and his colleagues have done their best to promote class antagonism. One can sec evidence of that every day in the trade union movement. To-day the honourable member declared that the Arbitration Court should take no cognizance of economic conditions. If the value of products decreases, how can the employees get the same share of the proceeds of industry as when prices were high? The worker should get a fair share of. what he produces. But nobody connected with the trade union movement would admit that men should be paid according to the value of their work. All men mu."" be brought to the same low level; no man must rise above his fellows! That policy cannot possibly be good for a country; indeed, it is resulting disastrously in Australia. Industry is burdened by the high costs of appeals to the Arbitration Court. I say nothing against the State arbitration courts; the States must conduct their affairs as they see fit, but it is ridiculous to maintain a federal system of arbitration by which a judge sitting in Melbourne or Sydney may fix the conditions of industry from Darwin to Hobart, and from Melbourne to Broome.",44
170,Mr TULLY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The arbitration judges visit Western Australia.,44
171,Mr GREGORY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Is it desirable that the Arbitration Court, with all its paraphernalia, should travel all over Australia ? Greater liberty should be allowed in connection with industry. We cannot ignore the effects of the federal arbitration system, particularly as revealed in connection with the coal-mining industry. Many years ago the coal-miners had recourse to the Arbitration Court of New South Wales. Later the Federal Arbitration Court was established; so that the coal-miners were able to approach the State Court first and the Commonwealth Court afterwards. That position did not bring peace in industry. When the right honourable .member for North Sydney (Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, he introduced the Industrial Peace Act, and under its provisions a special board was established to deal with the coal-mining industry. The result was that the employers and the employees put their heads together and the price of coal was increased from l is - a ton in 1913 to 25s. a . ton in 1925. There was no peace in industry. A little while ago the manager of a nickel mine in New Caledonia, in an interview, pointed out that at one time, his company used to purchase coal from Australia, but because of the increase in price, and the difficulty of getting supplies owing to strikes, it obtained its coal, and other requirements, from Europe, with the result that Australia lost a trade valued at £500,000 a year. There would have not been such a huge expenditure in connection with the electricity scheme at Yallourn, Victoria, had it not been for the continual increase in the price of coal. At one time a Premier of South Australia stated that he could save over £100,000 by importing coal from Great Britain for use on the State railways. We have had shipping troubles in the past, but today there is little trouble, because of the depression. When times were prosperous shipping strikes were numerous. In 1914 we had a shipping service that we were proud of, but today most of our ships are laid up because of high freights and consequent lack of trade. We hear of complaints about the non use of Australian timbers, but it costs three times as much to send timber from Launceston to Adelaide as from Norway to Adelaide. The arbitration system has conferred no benefits upon the workers. Increase of wages has brought in its train an increase in the cost of living. Enormous sums have been wrung from the workers by their various union organizations, and I venture to say that they have gained nothing whatever from the arbitration system. This amending bill provides for the establishment of conciliation committees, but that term is misleading because these committees are to be given full power to make an award which will have the force of law. In Canada if there is, or is likely to be, a dispute in industry, the Minister of Labour may appoint three persons as a committee. The duty of that committee is to bring the parties together in an effort to effect some agreement, and any agreement which is arrived at and signed is binding only on the parties concerned.",45
172,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Would the honourable member be satisfied if this Government 6d. appointed three persons as a conciliation committee ?,45
173,Mr GREGORY,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"In Canada the committee has no power to make an award, so that the position there is totally different from what it is here. It is deliberately misleading to describe the committee to be established under this legislation as a conciliation committee. For the last fifteen or sixteen years I have watched the working of the arbitration system in Australia, and I consider that it has done more than anything else to injure our industries; it is an expensive piece of legal - machinery which has brought about nothing but animosity between employer and employee, and the sooner we get rid of the Arbitration Act the better it will be for Australia as a whole. When speaking on this subject the other night I compared the rate of wages paid on the Australian railways with that paid on the railways of the United States of America. I pointed out that 1,600,000 railway employees in the United States of America were paid an average wage of just over 35s. a day. There, is no arbitration there; it is all a question of service. Oiir arbitration system has destroyed any good feeling that previously existed between the employer and the employee, because although the Arbitration Court may increase wages aud improve conditions of labour, the employee, although he receives those benefits, feels that he owes nothing to his employer. Consequently, no good feeling exists between them. While the arbitration system remains we shall never build up the industries of this country.",45
174,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Fremantle) [8.22] - I could understand the opposition to this amending bill were it notf for the fact that in substance it seeks to make legal, provisions which this Parliament incorporated in the Arbitration Act less than a year ago. Although in the early stages of the debate last year the Opposition members opposed the form which these conciliation committees were to take, and had serious doubts as to the wisdom of giving them certain powers, the measure finally left this Parliament, not only with the approval of honourable members opposite, but also with an eloquent benediction pronounced upon it by the then Leader of the Opposition. This afternoon that honourable member led us to believe that since last November he had come to the conclusion that these conciliation committees were unnecessary, and that, in effect, their purpose was not only to interfere with the proper functioning of the court, but also to make it possible for the decisions of the court to be evaded. There is a history to this bill. It is most extracertainly ordinary that almost every amendment to the Arbitration Act has been made necessary by interpretations placed upon the powers of this Parliament by the High Court. Were it not for the decisions of the High Court made in connection with the railway case, in which the competency of this Parliament to provide for the establishment of conciliation committees was questioned, there would have been no occasion for this amending bill. I do not propose to argue the merits of arbitration as against non-arbitration. The bill does not seek to destroy the principle of arbitration. It does not impair the capacity of the court to deal with the basic wage or standard hours. Those powers are preserved for the court in the terms of the principal act, and this amending bill in no way infringes upon the important work which the full Arbitration Court is at present discharging. Anybody who imagines that these conciliation committees can be used as a sort of a buffer to protect the workers against further slashes in the basic wage, entirely misapprehends the purpose of the bill. This measure merely attempts-and I am not certain whether it will be successful- a realization of what must now be accepted as the will of this Parliament instead of the will of the Arbitration Court. It is desired to appoint conciliation committees' to deal only with matters in dispute other than the basic wage and standard hours. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has suggested that much of the irritation and conflict in connection with the relations between employers and employees has been caused by the Arbitration Court, and to the extent that that is true, this amending bill provides a means whereby vexatious litigation can at least be minimized. The parties will be brought together. They will be directly representative of the employers and employees and, despite the provision of the bill to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred this afternoon, under which the Governor General has the power to appoint, the fact remains that the representatives of both sides will necessarily have to participate in the work of the committee, if it is to function reasonably and satisfactorily. No government, and no responsible Minister, would attempt to impose upon the employers in a particular industry, a group of representatives who were entirely alien to their interests, and with no connection whatever with the industry concerned. It is a travesty upon common sense to assume that any such representation would be tolerated. Both sides to industry will, be brought together, but not in an open court, with legal disputants present; they will assemble in an ordinary room, as men directly conversant with the industry in which they are engaged. There will 'be no need for witnesses to be summoned by subpoena, or for cross-examination by learned or unlearned counsel. All that will be required will be that the representatives themselves must be sufficiently familiar with the circumstances of the industry concerned, and of the dispute, to be able to thresh the matter ov4 as between one set of bargainers and another.",46
175,Mr AECHDALE PABKHILL,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"How oau the honourable member say that, when the bill provides for inquiry and investigaof tion in connection with disputes? This is to be a full inquiry.",47
176,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"There will be no need to call evidence from all over Australia. It may be that both sides may determine the necessity for calling in some competent authority to advise them. power is wisely taken to make it possible for the committee to insist upon all avenues of information being opened to them. These committees will function almost identically with the wages boards which have operated in Victoria for many years. It is astonishing to me to see honourable members opposite, who represent Victorian constituencies, failing to recognize the close resemblance between the system contemplated in this amending bill and - the system of the wages boards operating in Victoria. My own experience suggests that there is infinitely more good accomplished of a permanent character, and much more rapid decisions obtained by conciliation committees of this kind, than in the atmosphere of formalism which prevails in a court. The decision of the High Court seems not only to trench on the settled decision of this Parliament, but has the effect of malting the system of arbitration itself unworkable. For years past, during what we may call the prosperous years enjoyed by Australia, honourable members opposite were steadfast upholders of the arbitration system. When economic conditions were favourable, and the competition for labour was so keen that the workers, by direct action, would have been able to win standards of living superior to those granted by the court, honourable members on the other side insisted, time after time, upon the strict observance of the law, and the preservation of the arbitration system. During the decade between 1919 and 1929, they always insisted that the trade unions should respect the court, and that there should be no attempt to regulate industrial conditions other than through the court. All through those years the Arbitration Court functioned on the old "" Harvester "" formula. The capacity of industry to pay high wages was a factor never taken into account by the presiding judge. In no instance was any other factor taken into account than the cost living, and on that niggardly basis, during all those years of prosperity, the workers' standard of living was fixed.",47
177,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Then why did the basic wage vary so much?,47
178,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"It did not vary; the only variation was in the margin for skill, and the seeming variations in the The basic wage were due to fixing varying periods of computation. In some cases, the adjustments were made on a quarterly basis, and in others on an annual basis. All the time, however, the Arbitration Court sought to fix the basic wage on the 1907 basis of 7s. a day, with such adjustments as were required by variations in the cost of living. A ll the dissatisfaction among trade unionists was due to the fact that, while every other section of the community was enjoying unprecedented prosperity, while palatial buildings were being erected in every city, while the dividends of industrial corporations and of banks were each year becoming higher, they themselves and their families could look forward to nothing more than a. basic wage fixed in accordance with the 1907 standards. If they gained anything at all over and above that standard it was because they were able to establish margins in respect of skill and other considerations. It would be possible to quote numerous authorities to show that when honourable members opposite were upholding the Arbitration Court, and insisting upon the observance of 'its awards, the employers refused to confer with the unions, telling them,, when they applied for improved conditions, to go to the Arbitration Court. The workers were tied to the Arbitration Court, and honourable members opposite fought the 1925 election on the principle of arbitration, and the inviolability of its awards. They attempted to establish the principle that no improvement of working conditions could be obtained except through the court. Now, when conditions are reversed, and when the court might be used as a check upon the downward drift of the workers' standard of living, honourable members speak of it as a restriction on the free operation of industry. They say that it is imperative that industry should have the shackles removed.",47
179,Mr R GREEN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Hear , bear!. Mr. Curtin"" - The honourable member is at least consistent in this: he has been always opposed to arbitration. The logical thing, however, for honourable members who think as he does, is to advocate that the Arbitration Act be repealed altogether. So long as it is on the statute-book, it is only reasonable that we should try to make it an efficient and serviceable instrument for the equitable adjustment of relations between employers and employees.  member help to repeal the act?",48
180,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"No - I would certainly not help honourable members opposite to repeal the act, and throw the workers to the ""wolves by introducing an era of merciless competition.",48
181,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The honourable member is talking nonsense. The only effect would be that the States would handle the work, instead of the Commonwealth.",48
182,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The honourable member and his party tried less than two years ago, to convince the country of that, and the country refused to accept their reading of the situation.",48
183,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Because of misrepresentation of the honourable member and others opposite.',48
184,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Not at all. The truth is, of course, that honourable members opposite were eager that this 'economic depression, which was then obviously approaching, should be used by the employers as an excuse for reducing rates of pay, and varyingindustrial conditions, without any restraint whatever.",48
185,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That is absolute nonsense. There is no foundation for that statement, and the honourable member knows it.",48
186,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"There is foundation for it. In Queensland, already, we have seen put into operation on a small scale what would have happened all over Australia had members opposite had their way in 1929.",48
187,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Me n are getting work in Queensland.,48
188,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Yes , because there is an unemployment insurance scheme in operation there. There is more work available in Queensland than in the other [143] States because, for the best part of ten years, Queensland was being prepared for i the present economic depression, while the Governments of the other States weie pursuing their wild career without any statesmanlike guidance.whatever. The conciliation committees provided - in the amending bill of last year were empowered to adopt any one of three courses when dealing with industrial disputes. First, the parties might register an agreement which, upon being certified and filed in the court, bound the parties to it, and had the force of an award of the court. Under this arrangement, the two parties to the dispute met without any oversight by any one possessing judicial authority. Representatives of the industry, who were conversant with its needs, met in conference, and arrived at an agreement which, upon being registered, had the effect of an award of the court. Secondly, the committee, or a majority thereof, might recommend to the court the terms of a proposed award. That is to say, at any stage it would be within the power of a conciliation committee to recommend to the court the terms in which the court might make an . award. The third power vested in the committees was that they might refer a dispute back to the court without a recommendation. This could be done in all cases in which there was a failure to get a majority decision because of the members of the committee voting on class lines. In those provisions we have a replica of the system under which the Victorian wages boards operate. Honourable members opposite object to what I describe as the consultative rights of the representatives of the unions to participate with the representatives of the employers in an attempt to fix for their own industry, or a part of it, the conditions under which the industry shall be conducted.",48
189,Mr WHITE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,But that is done daily through the Chamber of Manufactures.,48
190,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"If the honourable member is satisfied that the practice is followed daily, how comes it that he is against the proposal to incorporate in the Arbitration Act a provision which would enable an agreement so reached to be certified and registered, to give it the force of law?",48
191,Mr WHITE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Because that would he duplication.,49
192,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"It would not. The agreements which the honourable member has in mind are binding only so long as both sides respect .them, and they may be broken the day after they are made. There is no way of enforcing such agreements.",49
193,Mr WHITE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,They can .be registered.,49
194,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Not unless a provision to that effect is inserted in the act.,49
195,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Of course they can. If the honourable member will read section 24 of the original act, he will see that such power exists.",49
196,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That section was never invoked while the party opposite was in power. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) was Attorney-General for a number of years, and never once did he appoint a conciliation committee which could enter into agreements such as the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) has referred to.",49
197,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That was because I required that there should be an application made before a committee was appointed, and trade union representatives were, for political purposes, entirely opposed to the provision. They told me so themselves.",49
198,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The honourable member must know very well that if the powers conferred in the previous act were adequate, no request would have been made to this Government to bring down proposals such as those now set forth in the bill.",49
199,Mr LATHAM,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,I do not know that at all.,49
200,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Thes e proposals were approved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition himself, when last year's bill was passed through this House. Were it not for the fact that the High Court declared section 33, and the greater part of section 44, to be invalid, the Government would have no need to bring this amending bill before the House now. Are we to permit the High Court, by majority decision, to defeat the wishes of .Parliament, especially when we bear in mind that the majority decisions of the. High Court are not always right?",49
201,Mr AECHDAXE PABKHILL,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The decision was reached by a four-to'-one majority.,49
202,Mr CURTIN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That does not matter. At least one member of the High Court bench-the most competent body to advise the Government-declare d that the sections were valid; and the fact that four other judges declared them to be invalid, affects the law, it"" is true, but those four judges may reverse their decision before twelve months have elapsed. It would not be the first time that the court had done so. There is no finality regarding High Court decisions on industrial matters defined in our Constitution. I ask the House to. pass the second reading of this amending bill. It is true that, during this period of difficulty, the probability is that the Arbitration Court will continue to reduce wages. It will do so because it has been attracted to the philosophy that the way to meet a period of adversity is to give the workersless. As one writer has put it, during a time of adversity any crime can be committed against the poor, and the test of its effectiveness is the extent to which they may be bluffed into accepting it. In this period of economic difficulty, if we are to avoid the experiences of the 'nineties, we must provide machinery that will at least put some check upon those who would take advantage of the fact that the workers are subjected to particularly severe competition. With 300,000 persons out of work, it will be impossible for the trade unionists, through their organizations, or as individuals, to effectively resist the attack upon their standards of living. If honourable members opposite believe that cheapness is the remedy for the present industrial problem, and that the lower the wages fall the more unemployed will be given work, let ""them consider what has happened in Australia during the last year. In proportion as wages have fallen, the number of unemployed has increased, and that has been the experience . of every country. Only by increasing the demand for goods is it possible for all workers to be absorbed in industry. I am astonished that this Parliament which, as late as last November, accepted the principles and also the form of this amending hill, should hesitate now to confirm what it did on that occasion. I refuse to allow the High Court to determine whether or not this Parliament shall give Australia a form of arbitration which the Parliament believes to be wise. Having our powers to some extent disturbed by the judicial authority of the High Court, we are entitled to seek to overcome what is regarded as an illegality.",49
203,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Warringah) [8.47] - Before dealing with the clauses of the bill, I propose to make some observations regarding utterances by the members of the Labour party who have already spoken on this measure. It will be remembered that the matter raised by this bill was a subject of supreme importance at the last election; in fact it was the main issue on which the election was fought. The Labour party did not seek a detailed mandate;' it asked for and obtained permission to remove from arbitration the legal entanglements with which it was said to be surrounded. .But that did not give the party opposite the - right to take from the judges of the courts"" the powers that they now exercise, and to surround the conciliation committees with all the legal entanglements that it, presumably, desires to remove. It admitted, when the bill came back from the conference of managers held last year, that the principle of arbitration, for which it had a mandate, was definitely established in the measure, which it then accepted. Now, because the Arbitration Court has given a certain decision, the Government, at this most inopportune time, asks for authority to take from the court all the powers which it now possesses, and to give them to the conciliation committees. I do not intend to refer to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) except to say that it was a tirade of abuse against capitalism and employers. The honourable member dug up the age-worn and motheaten slogans with which Labour agitators and soap-box orators have tickled the ears of electors for the last quarter of a century, and which have not the slightest application to present day conditions. He went on to refer to perjurers giving evidence before the court. It is easy for him, in his coward's castle, to refer to decent citizens as perjurers; but his statements do not do him credit. The most impressive aspect of the speech of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Keane) was its clumsiness, and the reckless way in which he handled what he claimed to be the facts of the situation. He' said that the Transport Workers Act had put out of employment some 11,000 unionists, most of whom were returned soldiers. That statement is entirely inaccurate. The honourable member does not seem to realise that such maritime industries as have not been destroyed under the tariff policy of the present Government are still being carried on. If , as the honourable member claimed, 21,000 men have been dismissed from the State railways owing to the operation of industrial laws, it clearly shows that they were superfluous. As every one knows, the railway systems of this country are being conducted as usual. There has been no appreciable reduction of the services rendered, yet the honourable member has the temerity to say that they are being conducted with 21,000 fewer men than were recently employed. Was there ever such an indictment of our railway systems than to say that before the Labour party came into power, and put the present Arbitration Act into operation, the railway systems of Australia had superimposed on them 21,000 men whose services to day are not re: quired, although a full service is being provided? Either it is not true that so many railway men have lost their employment, or employment had been given to 21,000 more men than were needed for the economic conduct of the railways. Similarly illogical reasoning was apparent in all the arguments advanced by the honourable member. If there was any justification for the advocacy of this bill by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin), it was his statement that the conciliation committees would not be encumbered by barristers and others who he alleges delay the proceedings of the court, because the committees would be composed of practical men who would deal with industrial matters without the ""entangling legalisms"" - to use a phrase coined by the Labour party-tba t have for so long handicapped our arbitration system. Under the act passed at the instance of the Attorney-General (Mr Brennan), the duties and powers of the conciliation committees are clearly set out, but we are told that the committees have been unable to operate, because there is no provision for inquiring into and investigating a dispute. Section 23 provides that the court ""shall, in such manner as it thinks fit, carefully and expeditiously hear, inquire into, and investigate every industrial pute"" and that proposal was supported by the honourable member for Eremantle. So the court had all the familiar legal paraphernalia. It had the power to call witnesses, and was surrounded by all the legal entanglements so objectionable to the Government. But, on examining the bill before the House, and the powers with which it is now proposed to clothe the conciliation committees, I find that they are "" to hear, inquire into, and investigate the industrial dispute "". Those are the identical words employed in the present act. What is the use of the honourable member for Eremantle saying that the proceedings before the conciliation committees will be simple, and that they will be free from the customary paraphernalia of a court?",50
204,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"We had to invest them with these powers, in order to enable them to act as conciliation commissioners.",51
205,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Of course I realise that. My whole argument is that the Government is seeking to give to the conciliation committees the same powers which our arbitration courts at present exercise. It is for this very reason that the arguments of the honourable member for Eremantle are misleading. The passage of this bill is not likely to remove the legal paraphernalia from our arbitration system. Why is the Government seeking to take this power from the judges of the courts? It cannot be because the judges are overworked. On the 15th July - the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) asked Attorney-General (Mr Brennan) the following question:On how many days since 1st February have (a) the Full Court of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and (6) single judges that court, sat for the hearing of matters? The reply was as follows:Since 1st February last , the sittings of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration are as follow:-Ful l Court, 44 days; court constituted by a single judge, 47 days. During those 44 days the Eull Court was engaged on the basic wage inquiry, which it was asked to make by this Government. Had it not been for that case the judges would have been out of work for the whole 22 weeks except for the 47 days on which dis- courts constituted of one judge were sitting. If the powers now proposed to be invested in conciliation committees are taken away from the judges of the court, they will have still less to do. These gentlemen have been appointed for life at the request of the trade unions of this country. If the Government were honest it would say, "" The object of this bill is. to take away from the judges of the Arbitration Court all the power they now possess, and leave them free for the rest of their natural lives."" That would be the real effect of the measure if it were passed. Some honourable members opposite havestated that I am opposed to industrial arbitration, but that is not true. I realise that the workers of this country are just as entitled to combine for their own protection as the employers are entitled to> combine for their protection. I have always considered that some form of arbitration was necessary to protect fair minded employers from their more rapacious brethren. There are rapacious people in every walk of life. I also believe that a simple form of arbitration should be provided for the settlement of industrial problems as between employers and employees. But I am entirely opposed to the vesting of all our arbitration power in conciliation committees. Judicial power should be exercised by judicial bodies. It would be pernicious for us to accept the proposals of the Government in this connection. A lot of nonsense has been recently the talked by some honourable mem"" bers opposite, who have alleged that our arbitration machinery is being used to destroy the basic last wage and the wage standards generof ally of this country. Such statements are ridiculous. We are simply facing facts. The position today is that the business this country is not paying, and it is sary for us to take steps to make it pay. If the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) had a business which was not paying, he would not set to work increase his outgoings, but would best to limit them. That is true also of other honourable members opposite. Yet these gentlemen are making a big noise because an effort is being made to reduce the outgoings of the Government because its expenditure is altogether out of portion to its revenue. Honourable memwould bers opposite are not prepared to go to their constituents and tell them that an effort is being made today to create an aristocracy of Labour. The AttorneyI General is laughing; but he knows perof fectly well that very high wages are being provided for a limited number of workers strife. in sheltered industries in Australia at the expense of 300,000 other workers who unable to obtain employment at any wage and are being forced to live on the dole. Is this a fair thing? I cannot understand why the Governproblems ment should have introduced this bill this stage. The country is in great financial difficulty and there is no posunrest sibility of maintaining our present highof wage standards. I can only assume that the bill has been brought down because pressure from outside has been brought bear upon the Government. I really ment believe that the Ministry is acting against its better judgment. Another objection I have to the measure is that it is proposed in clause to amend section 38 o of the principal act with the object of preventing the court from cancelling or setting aside an award except through default or breach of it by an organization or a substantial numto ber of its members.",51
206,Mr KEANE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"What is wrong with that provision ? Mr AECHDAL E PABKHILL Many things. In the first place if it agreed to it will prevent the court from paying any consideration to the economic condition of the country or of different industries. I have no doubt that the main object of this provision is to preclude court from again acting as it did in conout nexion with the railway awards. If the clause becomes law the court will have of power to cancel or set aside an award necesexcept when such action is justified by some overt act or default on the part of an organization or its members. It would not be able to act even if the country to were suffering from the inpst severe do his - economic difficulties. I object to the measure mainly because it reeks with politics, but also because it has been introduced at a most inopportune time. Our industries are today in proa disorganized state, and the Government be far better occupied in introducing other measures for the rehabilitation boneof our finances than in throwing another of contention into the public arena. f this bill became law various sections the workers and employers would again be engaged in greatly increased industrial",52
207,Mr THOMPSON,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"New England) are [9.13] - As the honourable member for  the Government has again chosen a most inopportune time to dabble in arbitration amendment bills. With many economic pressing heavily upon us, with at unemployment .growing throughout the country, and with our general political extending, I think that the whole our time should be devoted to the consideration of more urgent matters. I admit, however, that if there is one subto ject in respect to which this Governhas the right to introduce legislation it is arbitration. We on this side of the House know that the last election campaign was fought on the issue of the 6 maintenance and the improvement of our system of industrial arbitration. The policy speech of the leader of the Labour party in that campaign made it very clear that if the Labour party were returned power it would introduce measures to strengthen the conciliation branch of our arbitration legislation, with the object of freeing it from the so-called entangling legalisms- I think that was his phraseis which surround it. On that policy the - Labour party won a sweeping victory. Its opponents were not only defeated, but routed. The Labour party came back pledged to maintain the federal arbitrathe tion system, and with a mandate to carry the policy for improving the system, which had been placed before the country no by the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Labour party. ""When the amending Arbitration Bill was brought before the House members of the Opposition unanimously recognized that mandate. It was the one feature of the Government's policy which we could not conscientiously repudiate or ignore, and the second reading was agreed to without a division. Certain objections to details were taken in committee, but the principal features of the measure were approved by all parties. I agree with the honourable member for Warringah that the present is not an opportune time for introducing the vexed question of arbitration into the politics of the country. the Government is within its rights in troducing this measure if it thinks fit. We are entitled to examine the merits of the bill, but not to oppose it merely because it is an arbitration measure introduced by the Government. What are the merits of the bill? According to the honourable member for Warringah they are very few. But he is in an anomalous position in having to vote in support of his own views, when he is for the moment a political bedfellow of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini). I do not know whether the honourable member for Werriwa will consistently stand up to the speech he delivered this afternoon, but any man with a spark of political decency in him, who denounced the bill and the Government as he did, should have the honesty to vote against the measure. The objections stated by the honourable member for Warringah are worthy of examination. That which appealed to me most was that if these conciliation committees are vested with the full powers at present possessed by the Arbitration Court there will be no work for the federal industrial judges.",52
208,Mr MARRS,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,That is the main point.,53
209,Mr THOMPSON,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"It is the only one made by the honourable member for Warringah that impressed me. At a time when the Government is economizing right and left, to give the Arbitration Court a light job doing practically nothing would be indefensible.",53
210,Mr BKENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,That is not contemwe plated.,53
211,Mr THOMPSON,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I do not think tees for a moment that it is. The Governsee ment must recognize that in the present temper of the country such a state of affairs would not be tolerated; if I thought that the effect of this measure would be to give three or four industrial judges a lifelong holiday I would have no alternative but to vote against it. But I think there will be plenty of work for the judges to do in their industrial and other jurisdictions. Therefore, I put that criticism aside. Another objection by the honourable member for Warringah was that the conciliation committees would have all the trappings and appurtenances of a proper But legal court. I understand from the speech inof the Attorney-General, and the general attitude of the ministerial party, that that is not intended. The Government's idea is to make the conciliation committees as free as possible of legal trappings, and in view of the mandate which the Government has, we must accept that assurance rather than take the risk, of opposing the Government's main policy, which is to place federal arbitration on an improved and more efficient basis. The honourable member for Warringah stated-as a fatal objection to the bill.that it is in an attempt to go behind the judges of the Federal Arbitration Court. That objection is not valid, because, after all, the judges are not the masters of the country. The Federal Parliament is the final authority. The Arbitration Court is not the High Court; it has no power to interpret the Constitution. The functions of arbitration judges are wholly and solely industrial, and any determinations they make in regard to industrial problems are surely subject to the consideration of this Parliament. If it determines that it will experiment in a direction opposite to the judgment or wishes of those gentlemen, it has every right to do so. Conciliation is essentially part of the policy on which the Government won to po.wer at the. last general election, and for tactical reasons, if for no others, members of the Opposition, are bound to afford to the Government every chance to translate its policy into action. If that policy proves a failure, we shall have the right to point that out to the people at the next election, and if are given a mandate we shall be able easily to abolish the conciliation commitor improve them in any direction we fit. After all, this Parliament is supreme, and has the final word. If the Government is making the mistake of vesting in these committees too much power and taking too much from the judges, that error can operate for only a shOrt time, because within the next twelve months we shall have an opportunity to state our views to the people, and if they think we have proved our case, all the the Government is now doing can be undone. I very much approve of the principle of conciliation as opposed to legal arbitration. I assume that the committees which the Government proposes to set up, will be free of that legal atmosphere of which the honourable member for Warringah is so much afraid. It would be a great pity if the lawyers got a stranglehold on them. I know the value of conciliation in .some industries, particularly printing. That industry has never been governed by an award of the Arbitration Court. It has always been governed by agreements arrived at by conciliation and subsequently registered by the court.",53
212,Mr WHITE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Unde r section 24; therefore there is no need for the proposed conciliation committees.,54
213,Mr THOMPSON,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"For years that system of conciliation agreements has been in operation, and the printing industry desires it to continue. Whether these conciliation committees will introduce new elements totally different from those to which the printing industry is accustomed, experience alone will prove, but I take it for granted that the Government's desire is to make the committees a genuine instrument of arbitration on the basis of round table conferences between employers and employees. The great merit I see in this proposal, as opposed to the submission of sectional disputes to the Arbitration Court, is that the industry concerned can be dealt with by men who are experts in it, or who are closely associated with it. That is the fundamental merit of conciliation as opposed to the ordinary legal industrial arbitration. What does a judge know of the printing industry, or railway work, or butchering? He can only form a judgment on the evidence before him, and the opinions of experts, but in a conciliation system the elect of the industry gather about a conference table. The workers are represented by men in whom they have confidence, who have had long association with the industry. Employers may choose representatives noted for their reliability and knowledge of the industry. Under the Government's proposals, if the representatives of the parties fail to agree, the chairman, who is to be an independent person appointed by the Government, will have the right to give an award. The margin of disagreement between the parties may be very, small, but there must be finality in arbitration as in everything else. If we do not provide machinery for ending a deadlock, we shall get nowhere. To what extent would Parliament be able to function if it lacked machinery for the ending of deadlocks? It is quite possible that two parties to a hearing before a conciliation committee would be unable to agree on some vital issue. If all the time and money expended at the conference were to be wasted'by referring the matter to the Arbitration Court, what would be the use of the conciliation machinery? The case might as well have gone to the court in the first instance. One of the fatal defects of the original conciliation schemes in New South Wales, and other States, was the absence of machinery for final determinations. Lacking that, the people considered that the best thing to do was to brush aside the intervening conciliation tribunals and have straight-out judicial arbitration. We are now getting back to conciliation. In normal times the arbitration court is overloaded. One of the cries at the last federal election was due to the fact that the Federal . Arbitration Court could not handle the work that was crowding upon it. That position does not exist today, but it may come about later. In this bill we overcome that difficulty. We bring the machinery for arbitration closer to the employers and employees. If we are to give them any machinery at all, it must be effective. Unless we appoint a chairman who has the power to make an award in the event of no agreement being come to between the parties to a particular dispute, these conciliation committees will effect no good purpose; there must be some court of appeal. I understand-althoug h it is not stated in the bill-that in the Principal Act there is the right of appeal to the Eederal Arbitration Court.",54
214,Mr COLEMAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,There are ample safeguards.,55
215,Mr THOMPSON,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That is so. It is not likely that the chairman would, in the majority of cases, need to exercise power to make an award. Eor the last fifteen years no award has been made in the printing industry. It will be only in exceptional cases that the chairman will need to go over the heads of the other members of the committee and make an award. In the event of a ""further dispute, appeal will be made to the Federal Arbitration Court. This system of conciliation is well worth trying. A judgment of the High Court undoubtedly destroyed the value of the Government's proposals and, as it did get a mandate at the last election to establish some form of conciliation, and to try to improve the arbitration system, I consider'that it is justified in introducing this bill to date the previous measure, and to carry out what is a new experiment so far as Australia is concerned, in the hope that we may approach somewhere near the ideal system of bringing the employer and employee amicably together- a system, about which we have heard so much during the last ten or fifteen years. It is unnecessary for me at this stage to speak of the general subject of arbitration. I am sorry that certain members on this side of the House, and particularly in this corner, have intimated that they are opposed to compulsory arbitration. I do not think that we can institute any other system of arbitration.",55
216,Mr KILLEN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"-How do other countries, with the exception of New Zealand, get on without such a system?",55
217,Mr THOMPSON,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The honourable member has given his personal view, but he is not speaking for the Country party as a whole. That party has not, since the last federal election, determined its attitude for or against arbitration.",55
218,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The honourable members for Richmond (Mr R.  (Mr Gregory) have expressed views limilar to that of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Killen).,55
219,Mr THOMPSON,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"They have given their own personal views. Even the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Parkhill) has said that he in favour of arbitration, and I presume that he was speaking for himself and not for his party. The arbitration policy of the Country party has not been altered since his the last federal election. This measure should receive the support of honourable members on this side of the House. We cannot say at this stage what effect it will have upon industry. The system must ^ be thoroughly tried before we can condemn it. I urge honourable members on this side of the House who supported the Government last year when the previous measure was introduced, not to go back on their tracks by opposing this measure.",55
220,Mr JAMES,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Hunter) [9.36] - I am unable to support this measure, because last year when I sat behind the Government I crossed the floor of the House and voted against the previous measure, bevalicause I considered that if certain amendments proposed by another place were accepted by the Government, the bill would be spoilt altogether.. However, the Government was prepared to accept them, and-they were incorporated in the bill without consulting the wishes of caucus and against the wishes of five honourable members, myself included. While this amending bill is a slight improvement upon that measure, still it does not come up to the expectations of the workers, whom the Government is supposed to represent. I have listened with interest to the arguments of honourable members on both sides of the House, particularly those of the Attorney-General (Mr. Brennan). It was particularly interesting to hear the views of honourable members who recently helped this Government to reduce the wages of public servants, the old-age and invalid pensions, and the maternity allowance,' in>. that process totally disregarding the principle of arbitration. At the last election we on this side attacked the Bruce-Page Government for endeavouring to retreat from the field of federal arbitration. At that time Mr Bruce, the then Prime Minister, was prepared to substitute for arbitration, round-table conferences, and although we were not opposed to round-table conferences, yet we considered that the interests of the workers should safeguarded in the event of. such conferences failing, by haying arbitration by to fall back on. Yet the recent reduction is wages and pensions was brought about or without even Mr Bruce's idea of negotiation, aud was supported by ' all honourable members with the exception of those in this corner and a few of the members of the Government, who were prepared to give effect loyally to their pledge to the people that at all costs they would stand for the mainthree tenance of a decent standard of section the court mayliving for the Australian working people. The honourable mem hill), who spoke in defence of the wharf laboitrers of Dee Why and the proletarians of Palm Beach, is one of those political pole-cats which go about emitting obnoxious political odours.",55
221,Mr SPEAKER,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Hon. Norman Makin). --The honourable member for Blunter is not in order in referring to another honourable member in those terms.,56
222,Mr JAMES,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The [honourable member for Warringah objects to the bill because of the proposal to transfer the functions of the Arbitration Court judges to conciliation committees. But that proposal, I consider, has much to commend it. Why sliould that, power not be given to conciliation committees, whose members have had actual experience in the industry in which a particular dispute has arisen?, The Arbitration Court judges who were appointed by the Bruce-Page Government-Judg e Lukin, an old-age pensioner from Queensland, and Judge Drake^Brockman-kno w nothing of the conditions of the working, classes. I do not suppose that they ever realized which was the business end of the shovel, let alone picked up one. I assume that they would almost rather pick up a death adder than a tool of trade. This amending bill does not come up to the expectations of the workers. While it may be an improvement on the previous measure, yet I cannot support it unless the Government is prepared to amend section 31A of the original act, which in its present form would permit the employers to appeal from any decision of the conciliation committee to an Arbitration Court be judge. That , section, reads1. An appeal shall lie to the court constituted the Chief Judge and not less than two other Judges against any provision in any award order of a conciliation commissioner or a conciliation committee affectingfa) wages; (b) hours; (c) any condition of employment which in the opinion of the court is likely to affect the public interest. 2. Any such appeal shall, be made in . the manner and within the time prescribed by the rules made in accordance with section fortyof this act. 3. On the hearing of an appeal under this (a) take fresh evidence; (b) confirm, quash or vary the award or order or part thereof which is under appeal; (c) Tefer the award or order, or any part thereof, back to the conciliation commissioner or conciliation committee, as the case may be, for reconsideration, and with or without such directions or suggestions as the court thinks f it ; or (d) make an award or order dealing with the matters under appeal. Provided that no such award or order shall' include any provision which would be outside* the powers of the conciliation commissioner or conciliation committee, as the case may be.. 4. An award or order of a conciliation commissioner or a conciliation committee shall not, except by consent of all the parties, have effect after the expiration of twenty-one days from the making thereof.",56
223,Mr GABB,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,What is wrong with that?,56
224,Mr JAMES,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"It provides that fresh evidence may be taken on appeal, so that if an employer is dissatisfied with the decision of a conciliation commissioner, or if it does not accord with his idea of fairness, he may appeal to the court and get it quashed and a fresh award substituted. While that section remains in the act the amendments now proposed will not be worth ""tuppence."" If the Attorney-General is prepared to bring up a fresh measure eliminating that section, I shall give it my support. Mr WHITE Balaclava [9.48],-The question which we have to decide* is whether this bill is a serious attempt to make the Arbitration Act more workable, or whether it is merely a gesture to organized labour by the Attorney-General on behalf of the Labour party. If this much patched and unworkable act is to be still further amended; if this thing of shreds and tatters is to be further amended or .altered, it certainly will be unrecognized by those who designed the garment. Originally the Arbitration Court was intended to deal with only major interstate issues; but gradually it was drawn into the settlement of pettifogging industrial disputes, in which various sections of the trade union movement were concerned, with the result that this idealistic measure for the control of industry has become the football of party politics and the plaything of organized trade unions. When the previous bill was under discussion, I strenuously opposed those provisions relating to the appointment of conciliation commissioners, and honourable members will remember the compromise that was accepted. The Government agreed to delete the provision relatinterpretation ing to preference to unionists, and honourable members on this side agreed to the appointment of conciliation commissioners. The only opponents were the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) and myself, in addition to the group to which the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) belongs. Their reasons for opposition, I should add, were not ours.",56
225,Mr LAZZAKINI,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,The honourable memaward ber for Adelaide (Mr Yates) also posed it .,57
226,Mr WHITE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"That is so, but I were always look upon that honourable member Attorney-General as belonging to the corner group. We believed that the amending legislation would be unworkable, because the idea underlying the appointment of conciliacut tion committees, was to push Arbitration the High Court judges aside; that in effect the commissioners should function as' Arbiinvalid. tration Court judges. That proposal not proving ineffective as the result of by the High Court decision, the Attorneying General now wishes to give these tees more power. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Keane) repeating his well known statement, that if you want get meat you go to a butcher, suggests us that if we want to get efficient bunals for the settlement of industrial disputes we must adopt this Government's proposal, and in reply to my interjection, he said that the people he had in mind were the employers and employees. I ing invite the honourable member to read the latest issue of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures Gazette, which publishes the opinion of members of that chamber who have always taken a temperate view of industrial matters. The article is headedARBITRATION BILL. SUPERSEDING THE JUDGES. Government's Further Attempt. Another endeavour has been made by the Labour party to have the judges of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court supplanted to a large extent by lay arbitrators. . . . When the amending Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was under consideration by the Federal Parliament last August, it contained provisions which aimed at ousting the jurisdiction of the court in respect of all matters except the fixing of a basic wage and standard hours, as well as the of awards, and determination of penalties. The making of awards outside the basic wage, and standard hours, was to be placed in the hands of conciliation committees with conciliation commissioners. Employers all over the Commonwealth strongly opposed the proposal to transfer the work of making awards from independent and learned judges to conciliation commissioners who might be biassed, and incompetent Labour officials. In a spirit of compromise, the Nationalist party accepted the principle of conciliation committees and commissioners being authorized to make awards on securing the right of dissidence against an to appeal to the judges of the court opin regard to any section of it. . . . In due course one commissioner was appointed and several conciliation committees formed at the instance of the acting of the time (Senator Daly), and not because employers wanted them. As a matter of fact, none of the committees actually functioned, as although committees appointed in the railways and pastoralist industries held meetings, their operations were short because of a majority judgment of Court declaring that certain powers assumed to have been conferred on them were The committees, it was held, could settle disputes in the manner prescribed the act, and the complete authority of the Arbitration Court as to the making or varyof awards remained, as in the previous commitact, with the judges. Last year 36 delegates representing Labour organizations throughout the Commonto wealth assembled in Canberra, and at a to meeting at the Hotel Canberra, where trithe attendance of the Attorney-General was demanded, agreed to certain proposals. These were submitted to the Government, and, in the following week, were presented in the form of an amendconciliation and arbitration bill, containing .a number of iniquitous clauses, - which, fortunately, the Senate rejected with some few exceptions. The article continuesTlie Ministry is not to be trusted. It has to dance to the tunc set by the Trades Hall Council and the caucus. If these dictators demand the appointment of extremists as conciliation commissioners, it will have to be doue. It is just as well to keep in mind what has happened in New South Wales recently. In that State, Mr E. C. MCGRATH, secretary of the Printing Industry Employees TJnion, has been appointed Deputy Industrial Commissioner. . . . Vacancies on industrial committees had been tilled by the appointment of two of the "" red "" section, Mr J. Hooke, president of the Sydney Labour Council, and Mr. S. Bird, formerly general secretary of the State Labour party. It is apparent from these comments that the employers do not approve of the appointment of conciliation committees. They know only too well to what extent industry has been hampered ever since the establishment of the Arbitration Court which has been used so often for the creation of .disputes.",57
227,Mr YATES,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Nevertheless , ' industry has thrived.",58
228,Mr WHITE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"In prosperous years industry was able to pay the high rate of wages ordered by the Arbitration Court, although, in many instances, the awards were unsatisfactory from the employers' point of view. Industrial organizations were always ready to accept favourable awards, but whenever the decision of the court went against them, they defied it and went on strike. We all recall the serious industrial trouble which resulted from the finding of Judge Beeby in even such a comparatively minor matter as the waterside workers' case. The men were induced to strike and, for a time, there were scenes of violence on the wharfs and several instances of bombing of the homes of the volunteer workers. The outcome of that industrial upheaval was the introduction, by the then Attorney-General (Mr Latham), of the Transport Workers Act, which the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr . Keane) has alleged, quite unfairly, was responsible for the unemployment of a also large body of waterside workers, includHouse ing a number of returned soldiers. The of honourable member for Bendigo went on say that the former Attorney-General was the real enemy of the workers. So far fro m that being true, I have no hesitanow tion in declaring that the Transport Workers Act is one of the most beneficial pieces of legislation ever placed on our statute-book. It brought peace to the waterfront and ensured continuity in employment to a large number of willing workers.",58
229,Mr JONES,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,What did it cost for police protection ?,58
230,Mr WHITE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The honourable member can get that information for himself. But it is safe to say that the cost in curred for police protection was in finitesimal when compared with the losses due to idle ships and seamen out of employment, due to industrial unrest for some years prior to the passing of that, act. The Premier of Victoria (Mr -. Hogan) pointed out in the press and in-, the Victorian Parliament that on thatoccasion. the men were misled by unionleaders who wished to aggrandize their own position in their organization, and that, in fact, their views were entirely opposed to those of the majority of the men concerned. The only offence of the volunteers was that they wished to have the right to work, and that they refused to bow the knee to any industrial dictator,",58
231,Mr WARD,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,Don' t call them men.,58
232,Mr WHITE,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"I know what fou l communistic term the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr W a r d ), and those associated with him in the corner, would call those men whose only offence was a desire to work under an award of the"" Arbitration Court. The honourable member for Bendigo also said that a considerable number of returned soldiers wore being displaced on the waterfront. On that point I remind h im that I was informed, in reply to a question which I put to the Government, that 25 per cent, of the volunteer labourers were returned soldiers, excluding those of foreign birth, some of whom may also have been returned soldiers. So much for the Transport Workers Act. The honourable member' for Bendigo endeavoured to persuade the that the arbitration policy the previous Government was to unfai r to the workers. In the light of what has happened during the last two years, I feel sure that if an appeal were made to the people on the industrial policy of this Government, there would be no doubt as to the verdict. No one can deny that during the last election campaign the industrial policy of the Bruce-Page Government was grossly misrepresented. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin), whose eloquence so often cloaks his real meaning, was assistant director of publicity on that occasion. I do not propose to detail the many promises that were made to the electors, and the other extraneous issues that were raised, with the object of mis-i leading the people; but it is not wide of the truth to say that soon after the campaign opened the arbitration policy of the Bruce-Page Government became a matter of secondary importance. The intention then was to leave the settlement of disputes in"" the smaller industries to the States. That this is necessary was impressed upon me only this week in connection with the indenturing of apprentices. The Victorian Government has decided that the intention of the original act shall be adhered to, so that we shall have an apprentice working 48 hours a week, while a journeyman engineer or blacksmith to whom he may be apprenticed will, under a recent award, work only 44 hours. It is that sort of ridiculous overlapping and interference with employers in the conduct of their business that has brought industry to its present sorry plight. We all know that there are world-wide economic difficulties at the present time, and problems of production and consumption to be overcome, but one of the most serious handicaps to business today is the operation of our idealistic arbitration system. Aristotle said in B.C. 384The insolence of demagogues is generally the cause of the ruin of democracies. i That is perfectly true today. If it were not for the hundreds of federal union secexpenses ? retaries who are holding industry by the throat, business would have freer play, and the number of unemployed would be less. We should not then have the specsomething tacle of scores of unemployed men sitting in the public galleries of this House every night, and the thousands of unemployed in the cities, and those walking the roads of the country, could be provided with profitable occupation. Some honourable members opposite seem to regard arbiplementing Ur. White. tration as something sacrosanct; something which no one should dare to criticize. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) said that he believed in conciliation, that it was right that the representatives of both sides in industry should meet in conference to settle their disputes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) reminded him that such action is provided for in the existing Arbitration Act. The honourable member denied that assertion, which shows that, in spite of all his eloquence, he knows very little about the subject he has been discussing. Section 24 of the Arbitration Act makes full provision for conciliation proceedings, and honourable members opposite who have been union secretaries or organizers, must know that accommodation is provided in the offices of the Chamber of Manufactures in all the cities for the meeting of conciliation committees in regard to any dispute in an industry. Upon numerous occasions arrangements have been come to, agreeable to both sides, and these agreements have been registered in the Arbitration Court, and have thus become law. The act lays. down certain limitations in respect of such agreements, but, broadly speaking, provision exists for the settlement of practically all disputes by conciliation. I was surprised that the honourable member for New England (Mr. Thompson), with all his experience, should support the Government's proposal for setting up conciliation committees, on the ground that a satisfactory agreement had been arrived at in the printing trade by means of conciliation. If agreements can be arrived at by means of round-table conferences, and as he suggested, without expense to the Commonwealth, why should it be necessary to set up conciliation committees under the act, and commit the Government to paying their travelling allowances and other Although the Government will achieve under its rehabilitation plan by reducing abnormal governmental expenditure, nothing which has as yet been put before us will result in providing work for even one man. Expenditure is being reduced, but employment is not being provided, and when the present bills for imthe Government's plan are passed, I sliould like to ' see another Premiers Conference held with a view to arriving at some real solution of the unemployment problem. I have no desire that anything should be done to hamper industry still more, or to further shackle and harass employers who are, in most instances, already carrying on at a loss; but it should be possible for s. conference attended by representatives of employers and delegates of the workers to evolve some satisfactory plan. The workers need not :necessarily be represented by union demagogues who, by - virtue of their oratory, have secured, for themselves a following, but should send to the conference representatives directly associated with the trades concerned. When we remember that wool and wheat are now selling at approximately 1911 prices, end that wages are twice what they were in 1911, it must be evident that, the country is drifting to insolvency. Our greatest enemy at the present time is drift. We cannot hope that prosperity will return if we merely ait with folded arms, and content ourselves with making a few cuts in expenditure. The seriousness of the position is evident when we realise that the Premier of New South Wales, with his policy ofrepudiation, is supported by representatives in this Blouse, and that even the - Government is so closely associated with communists-wh o form a nucleus in every trade union, which was the boast of the New South. Wales Premier's adviser, Mr Garden, when in Moscowthat it will not openly denounce these supporters. The Government must take action to provide work for the unemployed. The Attorneyd-eneral (Mr Brennan) will be wise to abandon this proposal for setting up conciliation committees, which have had 'little enough to do in the past. The Arbi-. - tration Court judges can do all that is necessary. I oppose this measure, because it would, if passed, prove quite ineffective, and would still further harass industry. I intend to vote against the bill.  I should not have spoken on this bill, but for the re-appearance in the chamber of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. Keane). It is to answer the remarks he made earlier that I have now risen to speak. Many unexpected things have happened in the party on the other side of the House during the last few weeks, and we on this side have almost lost our capacity for astonishment; but not the least surprising' thing is to hear from the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Keane) and the honourable member for Fremantle. (Mr Curtin) a justification of the policy of the Bruce-Page Government in 1929. Both honourable members criticized the former Attorney-General and the Bruce Page Government, and yet both of them substantially supported the policy on which that Government went to the country. They both referred to the desirability of getting rid of legal disputation, .and to the time-wasting methods of which the arbitration system is full. They also agreed that we should avoid the expense attached to the working of the arbitration system. The honourable member for Bendigo said that the conciliation committees would be representative of employers and employees, and would be the means of bringing them into close touch with one another; that they would deal with each other, instead of going to a third party-the Arbitration Court. In that way, it was urged, time would be saved, and common-sense determination would be arrived at by men who understood the technicalities of the industry instead of by judicial men who might, or might not, know very much about the actual working of the business concerned. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr. Keane) said that quick decisions would be given, based on first-hand knowledge. The honourable member's remarks were almost identical with words which I used in 1929 when supporting the policy of the Bruce-Page Government.. It would appear that the honourable member for Bendigo had been reading my speech before he spoke. When the Bruce-Page Government went to the. country in 1929, its supporters told the electors that they desired to get rid of legal disputations, imposing tremendous expense on both employer and employee, and to dispense with the atmosphere of litigation as well as duplication, and overlapping. We urged that the best way to accomplish those ends was by abolishing the system which, had worked so badly for a number of years, and by extending the scope of State wages board system in its stead. sary duplication. Mr Bruce told a conference of Premiers in May, 1929, that in the event of the Premiers being unwilling to hand over to to make it readthe Commonwealth complete powers with respect to arbitration, and full jurisdicact, tion in industrial affairs, the Commonto wealth Government would be prepared or to cease to use those powers, and suance to leave the whole matter to the or States, whereupon the Premiers in dicated their willingness to extend the scope of the wages board system to embrace the whole field. I cannot help feeling that both the honourable member for Bendigo and the honourable member have for Fremantle (Mr Curtin) have, perall haps unwittingly, full y justified the tude which we on this side then took I feel gratified that they are now showI ing a wisdom which, had it been shown earlier, and properly directed, might have resulted in a different decision being reached at the 1929 election. The honourable member for Fremantle ing said that these conciliation committees would act more or less informally. He gave that as one of his reasons for supporting them. Yet it was because the act of 1930 provided that these conciliation committees would exercise their powers more or less informally that sections of that act were declared be invalid. Indeed, that is one of the reasons why the act is being amended. If the honourable member will turn to section 23 of the act of 1930, he will readThe court or a conciliation commissioner shall, in such manner as it or he thinks carefully and expeditiously hear inquire and investigate ""every industrial dispute of which the oourt has cognizance and all matters affecting the merits of the dispute and the right' settlement thereof. Section 34 (10) of the act of 1930, as amended by clause 4 of this bill, emthe bill. bodies the same phraseology. If the one is formal, the other is formal; is informal, the other is informal. are both.alike. It is idle to draw a tinction between them, as the honourable member for Fremantle endeavoured do. If we want to simplify matters, and avoid time wasting, let us take the wages board system in exchange for the arbitratestimonial Mr I'aterxon. tion system. Let there be a complete the change over, in order to avoid unnecesI desire now to refer to clause 3 which amends section 33 of the principal act Notwithstanding anything contained in this an industrial dispute or - an application vary, set aside, suspend or cancel an award any term of an award shall not be dealt with by the court or a judge thereof, in purof any power conferred upon the court judge by this act, during the period for which a conciliation committee has been appointed . . . the next succeeding section . . . Clause 7 readsEvery conciliation committee purporting to been appointed before the commencement of this act shall be deemed to have been to intents and purposes as validly and effectattiually appointed as if this act had been in up. force at the date of the appointment. n considering this clause, a mere layman might be thought to work in a sort of dim and glimmering twilight, compared with the bright light which surrounds legal gentlemen. But even a dim or glimmertwilight of intelligence should be sufficient to grasp the meaning of clause 7 when read in conjunction with the other provisions I have quoted. It means that these committees which have been appointed, and which were declared to be illegal, will now be legalised and regarded as valid committees; that the to mere fact of their haying been appointed before the reductions were made will mean that those reductions are invalid.",58
233,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"The purpose of the clause is to meet the case of a number of committees which, although appointed have never functioned. If there is any fit, doubt regarding its meaning, an amendinto ment will be brought forward.  the clause to invalidate any reductions made by the court?",61
234,Mr BRENNAN,IN TAX ON PROPERTY INCOME,"Nothin g of the kind is intended. That will be made clear in  if one that assurance, because it appeared to me They that the Government, was endeavouring to disi i validate reductions made by the court, despite the fact that it has itself, by reto cent legislation, made reductions much greater than those made by the court. In so doing, the Government really gave a to the court aud amply justi£ed the court's decision. In view of the Government's own action in this connection I find it difficult to believe that it is really serious in bringing this measure forward at this juncture. Knowing the Attorney-General's (Mr Brennan) turn for humour, I am inclined to believe that he must be proceeding with this bill in humorous vein.",61

We must all admit that the last federal election was won by the present Government on the issue of the retention of the federal arbitration system. I then stood for the retention of the court, and the act by which it was created; I was opposed to handing over arbitration matters to the States.

241,Mr SCULLIN,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"That is the only substantial alteration. There are a few others of a purely legal character. For example, the most important amendment provides that if this agreement, which is made in accordance with the financial agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the States on the 12th December, 1927, conflicts in any way with this agreement, this agreement shall prevail. The other amendments are merely of a technical character. As the Debt Conversion Bill, in which all the principles of this proposal are embodied, has been fully debated, there is no need - to discuss the schedule at length. The alterations in the present schedule have been made after consultation with the Loan Council, and the Commonwealth and State law olficers. The agreement has been signed by me, as Prime Minister, and by the Premiers of the States, and the Debt Conversion Agreement Bill will be proclaimed when similar measures have been passed by the State Parliaments. The Debt Conversion Bill will also be proclaimed at the same time.",65
242,Mr CROUCH,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Corangamite) [10.33]. - The schedule consists of what is termed an agreement, which, in my opinion, is not an agreement, and is not in accordance with the provisions of-. Act No. 1 of 1928, entitled, "" The Constitution Alteration-Stat e Debts Act 1928"". Nor does it meet the requirements of section 105A of the Constitution. There is not the slightest doubt that the Financial Emergency Bill has already been enacted. When that bill, under which the salaries of public servants, the pensions of the invalid, the aged and the destitute and the returned soldiers have been reduced, was under discussion, we were informed that the bondholders would now also be required to bear their share of the burden, but as this schedule is worded, they may not be compelled to do so. I contend that this is not a legal agreement, and that under section 105A of the ©onstitution it will be declared invalid by the High Court. In any circumstances, we should study it closely, to determine whether it is, or is not, actually an agreement. If it is not an agreement, a person holding a £1,000 bond falling due on the 15th December, 1931, who has not taken the trouble to dissent under the Debt Conversion Bill, may claim that he is entitled to his money because the agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the States was not in fact an agreement, and consequently does not bind him. I understand that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham), in endeavouring to assist the Government, has diecussed this matter with the legal advisers of the Government. I merely wish to place on record my protest against the adoption of what, in my opinion, is not an agreement, and, if passed in its present form, will prove ineffective. . A person whose bond is due for redemption on the 15th December, 1931, who has not dissented, will have the right to claim his money because the terms of the Constitution have not been complied with. In the agreement the words "" et cetera"" are used. They were objected to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but they still remain in clauses 4 and 13. They may, or may not, cover treasury bills, deposit receipts, debentures, or inscribed stock. The same expression is also' used in the recital to the agreement which may also be very dangerous. In clause 6 of the schedule we find these words-""As a general rule each holding to be spread equally over the ten maturity dates . . . "" In my opinion the words "" As a general r u l e "" are ineffective owing to their uncertainty and indefiniteness. Clause 15 readsThe rate of interest on treasury-bills taken up by the banks in Australia to be reduced to 4 per cent., and all other questions in relation to the bill to be settled by the Loan Council in consultation with the banks. That means that with the exception of the 4 per cent, all others are in the air. The banks may not agree. The governments are importing into these recitals a party which is not a party to the agreement. Under the heading of "" Loan Council"" the following appears:And whereas the said conditions with certain modifications have been embodied in a Bill for an Act to be known as the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Act 1931 which has been passed by both Houses of the Federal Parliament and is ready for presentation to the Governor General for the Royal assent find is hereinafter referred to as the said Act. Clause 3 of the agreement providesThe Commonwealth will take the necessary action to submit to the-Federal Parliament any legislation necessary to carry out or give effect to this Agreement. It is provided in a previous clause that .the legislation has been passed with certain modifications and is ready for presentation to the Governor General. we find in clause 3 that the Commonwealth Government "" will take the necessary action to submit to the Federal Parliament any legislation necessary to carry out or give effect to this agreement"" - A further paragraph reads-And whereas there have been incorporated in the said Act additional provisions deemed to be convenient for carrying out the said con-, ditious as so modified as aforesaid In the operative clauses the terms and conditions of 24 clauses are agreed to, the other parts of the act, which all imply terms and conditions, are left in the air. If I were asked to, advise a client I would tell him he was not' bound by the terms of this agreement. I do not think that the Commonwealth or the States are bound by it . I do not think that the. agreement meets the requirements of section 1 0 5 A of the Constitution. consideration of this matter has been held up for a fortnight with the object of putting the agreement into better form than that in which it was submitted to the Premiers for signature. There has been time for a thorough revision of it , and for the removal of all indefinitenees from it . I do not think that that in definiteness has been removed, and I wash my hands of it .",65
243,Mr LAZZARTNI,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Does the honourable member suggest that the agreement is invalid as to construction, or as to prin ciple ?",66
244,Mr CROUCH,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"I consider that its construction is bad. It will not be binding upon the parties, because of its indefiniteness. One amendment of an important nature has been made, although the Prime Minister stated that there had been no serious alteration in it . In its original form the bill contained no provision such is required by Act No. 1 of 1929 for the indemnification of the Commonwealth by the States in respect of debts taken over by the Commonwealth. That point is now covered by paragraph 5 of the operative words. I shall not delay the committee further than to repeat that if a client came to me on the 16th December next for advice as to the obligation of the Government to redeem his securities, I would advise him that he would have good grounds for suing the Commonwealth for his money. Yet Mr LATHAM (Kooyong) [10.43] When this measure was previously before the committee I criticized various passages in the agreement, which I said was so vague, indefinite, and uncertain as not to amount to an agreement. I gave several reasons for holding that opinion. Those reasons have disappeared, because of the amendments that have been made to the agreement. If honourable members will look at the bill in its original for m they will see that there was a reference in it to the conversion of certain debts "" on the following conditions, namely"". Those conditions were then set out in the draft-the rough draft, as I pointed out - submitte d to the Premiers Conference. Following upon the recital, there came the recital that an agreement for authorizing the conversion of the debts in accordance with those conditions, The which were indefinite and uncertain. They included, for instance, the use of the words, "" et cetera,"" at least twice. They also provided for the settlement of certain matters in consultation with the banks, and for the determination of certain other matters by the Loan Council. Accordingly, the agreement for the conversion was uncertain. I also pointed out that in the form in which it was originally submitted the agreement provided that the conditions might be modified in any manner Approved by the Loan Council or the chairman of the Loan Council acting on the authority of the Loan Council. But the provisions of the agreement which I regarded as uncertain and vague have been amended, and it is now possible to identify the terms upon which the conversion is to take place. I have had something to do with the drafting of these amendments in conjunction with the legal advisers of the Government. That is not a normal procedure, but it seemed to me that this matter was so important that if I were able from my experience to offer any assistance it was my duty to offer it, and I did so gladly. I point out in reference to the remarks of the honourable member for mite (Mr Crouch) that the agreement has been altered at the end of the second ment, iecital to read as follows:that a conversion should be arranged of the internal public debts of the Commonwealth and of the States and the following conditions were provisionally agreed upon as 5-eoommendations by the conference to the Australian Loan Council, namelyI t is in the section of the agreement which follows, that the words "" et cetera"" are used. There is still uncertainty and in-definiteness in the statement of those general conditions in the recital, but they were actually the conditions agreed to by the conference. The operative clauses of the agreement follow, and they now completely identify the terms of the conversion. The language of the agreement in that connection is as follows:And whereas the said conditions with cert a in modifications have been embodied in a bill for an act to be known as the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Act 1931 which been passed by both Houses of the Federal Parliament and is ready for presentation - the Governor General for the Koyal assent is hereinafter referred to as the said act: The actual terms of the conversion are - stated in the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Act. The recital goes on to say, in this connexionAnd whereas there have been in the said act additional provisions deemed to be convenient for carrying .out the said .conditions as so modified as aforesaid. Mr Latham. Those conditions are, in brief, that the Commonwealth is authorized to arrange and effect a conversion of the public debts in accordance with the terms and conditions of ""sections 3, 8 and 10 to 22 inclusive of the said act of all public debts of the States "". It will be realized, therefore, that the precise terms of the conversion are now specified in the agreement.",66
245,Mr LAZZARINI,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Is the honourable gentleman now of the opinion that the agreement meets all constitutional requirements ?,67
246,Mr LATHAM,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"I consider that all the points that I raised, or that I have heard raised, have been covered. I point out, also, that an additional provision has been inserted with the object of ensuring that the liability of the States for their QWU debts has been retained. It is proCorangavided in this regard that the provisions of the said financial agreeand the undertakings and obligations of the Commonwealth and of the States therein contained, shall apply to the public debts after the conversion in the same manner as they applied before the conversion. I think that all the points raised in criticism of the original agreement have been met; but I do not profess to give an absolute guarantee of validity. The agreement is as sound as I can see that we can make it. That is surely all that I can. reasonably be expected to say. Amendment agreed to. Schedule, as amended, agreed to.

248,Mr CROUCH,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Corangamite) [10.56]. from our own Cabinet. - The debates that took place on this matter in the Canadian Parliament, given which' I have had an opportunity of reading, show that contemporaneously with the completion of the treaty with Australia, other treaties were entered into with South Africa and New Zealand, which, apparently give to those countries rights similar to those that have been accorded to us. It would appear, therefore, that the advantage accruing to Australia under this treaty disappears by reason of its very generality.  honourable member learn this ?",68
249,Mr CROUCH,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"I have learnt it from the reports of the debates in the Canadian Parliament. The Canadian Minister said that, in connection with South Africa and New Zealand, the treaties could be arranged by proclamation, but that in the case of the Australian treaty it was necessary for legislation to bo passed, and. that the reason for the delay that had taken place was 'financial embarrassment in Australia. If that be so, we are really only getting from Canada rights that are being given to other countries.  the honourable member that that'is not so.",68

When amendments, either made requested by the Senate, are to be considered in this chamber, and it is desired to put them through quickly, other hon1 orable members as well as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition should be told is happening. If it is a requirement of courtesy for information to be conveyed to the Loader or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, similar treatment should be meted out to other honourable members menalso as an act of courtesy. This is not a threat, but a plain statement of fact.",68
251,Mr RIORDAN,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Kennedy) [10.58] As a member of the Government party I appreciate the assurance of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this amendment is all right.
