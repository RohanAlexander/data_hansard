0,NA,Unknown,"#2ouse of UFpiESfutatibcs. Friday, 25 June, igog. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. SUPPLY BILL (No. 1). Mr SPEAKER reported the receipt of a message from his Excellency the Governor General, - recommending an appropriation for the purposes of this Bill .",14
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The leader of the Opposition, as an cx-Treasurer, is aware of the position in which the present Treasurer will be placed on the 30th of this month if Supply is not granted.. The votes which have been passed will lapse, and there will be no money in hand to pay ordinary, current expenses. I refer, not merely to the salaries of the public vants, which will not become due until the middle of July, but to a large number of incidental undertakings on which day labour is employed, whose .obligations become due day by day. As the honourable member take understands these difficulties as well as do, I shall be glad if he will to allow us to pass a Supply Bill today, so that the Senate may deal with it Wednesday next. We shall then be in a position, on the first day of the next cial year, to telegraph to our officers in thevarious States that provision will be madefor the payment of the services of their various departments.",14
2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The procedure suggested by the Prime Minister is most unusual, seeing that a motion of want of confidence is before Parliament.",14
3,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,There are two precedents for it .,14
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"In both those cases the position was quite exceptional. I do not think that there is any real, urgency for the passing of a Supply Bill , because sufficient money has been voted to meet all expenditure up to the end of thismonth, which concludes the financial year. Therefore, no liabilities which cannot be met will fall due until about the middle of July, and on previous occasions it has been the middle of a month before Supply has been granted. It is true that the Treasurer may have no parliamentary guarantee that liabilities incurred will be met, but he may be sure that necessary services wilt be paid for, as on other occasions. I do not think that a Supply B i ll should be proceeded with today. ' The Treasurer said last night-the statement has since been corrected-that a Supply Bill is necessary to pay old-age pensions on 1st July.",14
5,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I thought so then, but I have since told the honourable member that I was in error. . Mr FISHER - In speaking to the right honourable member this morning, I told him that he was mistaken, and he admitted that, having rung up the Treasury, he was informed that the necessary money had been appropriated. There is a sum of not less than ,Â£693,000 in his hands fox the payment of old-age pensions. Sir JOHN FORREST.'- I do not know that it is, really. I ammore likely than the honourable member to be right in this matter.",14
6,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I do not think that the serPrime Minister should press his suggestion to proceed with a Supply Bill today. A later opportunity should be early enough for his convenience. The House would grant him any kind of Supply if he would the proper Constitutional steps to send I us before the country, so that we may dissee his way cover how we.stand.",14
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I shall hand the honoh orable gentlemanthe Treasury statement, and ask him to consider it before I again finanmention the matter on Tuesday next. NA MARKERS.",14
8,Dr MALONEY,WILLIAMSTOWN TARGET,"It is stated that markers at the Williamstown rifle butts - are being displaced by men who have constant employment at the Newport workshops. Will the Minister of Defence therefore give instructions that, the officei childish and ridiculous part. in charge shall show preference to men Avho are out of employment? I assure him that there are many unemployed in Melbourne at the present time.",15
9,Mr DEAKIN,WILLIAMSTOWN TARGET,I would remind the honourable member that it is not the practice for Ministers to answer questions while a motion of want of confidence is under discussion. No doubt if he sees the Minister of Defence privately he will obtain satisfactory answer. NA CONFIDENCE. Debate resumed from 24th June (vide page 411) on motion by Mr FISHERThn.t the Government does not possess confidence of this House.,15
10,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Corio) [10.36] - I have not yet taken part in the debates of this session, and did not intend to do so until the motion for the adoption of an Addressin-Reply was being debated. But as the Opposition is now making its main attack upon the Government and its supporters, chiefly on the ground of inconsistency, I think it well to take this opportunity to give my views in regard to certain phases of the action, of those who are opposing us, and particularly respecting the programme of the Labour Party. As fair minded men, the members of that partyshould be prepared to give the same treatment as they have received. For eight years the party has been the spoiled child of the House, and now expects - different treatment from that which it has meted out to others. Although members of the party have been squealing throughout the country because ,the Fisher Government was put out of office before it could duce a Bill, this motion of want of confidence was moved before the present Government had such an opportunity. Another ground of complaint seems to be that no reason was given for the dismissal of the Fisher Government. But the Labour Party gave no reason for combining with the then Opposition late Deakin Government. The vindictiveness and abuse poured out by the exAttorney-General throughout the country recalls forcibly the phrase in which he was described on a previous occasion of the kind as "" screaming because he was being taken away too early from the political tart shop."" The Labour Party is acting a Children, when they behave in this way, usually receive a good smacking, and I should like to have a hand in smacking the Labour Party. Some of its members are already, by their uproar, squealing in anticipation of the punishment. I have here the official report of their fourth Commonwealth political conference, which was opened at the Trades Hall, Brisbane, on 6th July, 1908. It is a officially published by the Honourable^ Mr. Hinchcliffe, M.L.C., Secretary to the Conference, and a member of one of those bodies which the party professes great anxiety to abolish. I notice, too, that the Victorian State Labour Party, at its Easter conference, accepted a proposal of the Hampden branch that a plank of the the platform for the next election should be a referendum as to the abolition of the Legislative Assembly. Apparently, it is proposed in Victoria to sweep away both Council and Assembly, notwithstanding that the latter is elected on an adult suffrage. This would leave public matters to be controlled entirely by the secret and unrepresentative caucus which meets at the Trades Hall. The platform of the Labour Party has to be signed by men who do not believe in it, and to be supported by men who have condemned several of its planks. Every one of its good planks has been stolen from the Liberals, and members of the party at times have done their best to destroy them. Latiour members are pledged on all questions affecting the platform to vote as a majority of the parliamentary party may decide at a duly constituted caucus meeting. That pledge they have to sign. Should the caucus at any time decide that the fiscal question is covered by the words ""new protection""-and new protection must deintropend on old protection-the party would do its best to secure free-traders by leaving fiscalism and the Tariff alone, because if the fiscal question were made a distinct issue, a majority of free-traders in the caucus would decide the action of the party.",15
11,Mr FOSTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,We have a free hand on to defeat the the fiscal question.,15
12,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If the honourable member signs the platform he has not, because, if twenty free-traders were returned as members of the Labour Party, and the remaining fifty-four members of this House were protectionists, the country would be given a free-trade policy, notwithstanding the obvious declaration of the electorates for Protection. And vet that, party claims to be democratic. There is no doubt that if the Labour Party consisted of thirty-eight members, and they had a majority",16
13,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,They will have a majority before any other party.,16
14,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Fals e prophets used to be stoned; now-a-days they are only asked not to make silly interjections. If twenty members of that party of thirty-eight were free-traders, and thirty-eight is - necessary for them to constitute a majority of this House, those twenty could insist on a free trade policy being adopted.",16
15,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is absolutely untrue 1,16
16,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Will "" the honourable member for West Sydney withdraw that remark.",16
17,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I withdraw the remark, but say that the statement is inaccurate, and that the honourable member knows it.",16
18,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It is untrue.,16
19,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member for Hindmarsh must withdraw that remark.,16
20,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It does not half express my feelings, so I withdraw it.",16
21,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I object to the form in which the honourable member for West Sydney makes the withdrawal, because I think it is merely a repetition of the charge. The honourable member says that the statement. I made is inaccurate,, and that I know it to be so.",16
22,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I did not hear the words quoted by the honourable member for Corio. If the honourable member for West Sydney saicl the remark was inaccurate, and that the honourable member for Corio knew it to be so, it is merely a re-affirmation of the previous statement, and I ask him to withdraw it.",16
23,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WAN T OF,If the honourable member for Corio looks at the programme Honorable MEMBERS - Withdra w !,16
24,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I ask the honourable member to withdraw the remark.,16
25,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I say that if the honorI able member for Corio will look at the gramme in his hand he will see that the statement he made is inaccurate.,16
26,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I ask the honourable member for West Sydney to withdraw the words he used.,16
27,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall say that the statement is inaccurate, and withdraw the statement that the honourable member knows it to be so. ' Mr CROUCH' - I am rather sorry, in one way, that I had to press the honourable member for West Sydney to withdraw the remark, because of his conduct on previous occasions when he has been called upon to withdraw. If I withdraw a statement, I do so because I am sorry to have made it in an assemblage of gentlemen, and I do not subsequently repeat it and glory in it on platforms throughout the country. The only occasion on which I remember the honourable member to have finally and completely withdrawn a statement was in relation to the ""six potters,"" and that statement he withdrew, after a most deliberate speech in the House, in an interview with a newspaper reporter in the lobby. The honourable member, in view of the facts, must be either illogical,, or shutting his eyes to the true meaning of written words, which I shall readI hereby pledge myself not to oppose the candidate selected by the recognised political Labour organization, and, if elected, to do my utmost to carry out the principles embodied in the Australian Labour Party's Platform, and on all questions affecting the Platform to vote as a majority of the parliamentary party may decide at a duly constituted caucus meeting.",16
28,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Rea d the platform.,16
29,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall read it too much for the honourable member. At the present moment, the only important point on the platform isNew Protection - Amendmen t of Constitution to ensure effective Federal legislation for new protection and arbitration. But there cannot be new Protection unless it is based on protection to the manufacturers j otherwise we are resting an apex on a base that does not exist. I repeat that, under the circumstances I have indicated, twenty members of the Labour Party could swamp the opinions of the whole of the fifty-four protectionists returned to the House, and rule the entire country. If honourable members regard that as democracy, and as representing the voice of the people, it is a sort of democracy to which cannot subscribe. I should like to quote profrom an article written by Mr F. Anstey, one of the ablest members of the State Labour Party, who has been defeated for the constituency of Bourke, and will, I think, be defeated again. . Mr Frazer - He will shortly be with us here!",16
30,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Mr Anstey may shortly be with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who will - probably be part of the rejected "" wreckage. The article by Mr Anstey, which is signed, appeared in the Labour Call, the special organ of the Labour Socialists, of 5th November, 1908, and contained the following :It is said that "" every question is a Labour question""; that the Labour Party "" must declare its position on every question."" This is something new. Is free-trade or protection a Labour issue? If so, why have we not declared our position? Why have we left every man in every State a free hand? Why have we been avowedly protectionist in Victoria, and anything you like in other States? ""Avowedly protectionist,"" he says his partyhas been ! This is the man who is to be a candidate for Bourke, one of the most Protectionist constituencies in Victoria. He continuesAsk free-trade Labour members to cany the protectionist banner, and they will sing a different song to what some of them do on compulsory training for others. Freedom of action on fiscalism, solidarity on militarism, that is their demand. We have a Tariff that was fought for in the teeth of the opposition of a. number of Labour members, who did not give it that support which, if they believe in the new Protection, they ought to have given.",17
31,Mr YVATKINS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Was that why the honourable member went home early every night during the Tariff debates?,17
32,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I suppose I should not answer that interjection, although it will get into Hansard, and mav do me considerable harm, seeing that the honourable member is of such authority that his word weighs against any denial I may make. I can. quite see now why it was that the leader of the Opposition at Gympie said that the country had declared for.Protection "" rightly or wrongly."" The honourable member was treading on a volcano; if he had said "" rightly,"" he might have fallen into-the Free-trade abyss, and if he had said ""wrongly, "" the protectionist gulf would have swallowed his party, and I do not know what would have happened. Possibly he might have found that some of the Protectionist members of his party would cast aside the chains of the political [16] machine, and, like some other strong men, relieve themselves of the intolerable pressure placed upon them.",17
33,Mr MCDOUGALL,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Nam e those men. Mr CROUCH' - I think I have only to quote from the earlier debates of this House to show that considerable time was taken up by honourable members opposite in the repudiation of men who had formerly been members of their party. It does not matter to me whether the honourable member for Parramatta, the honourable member for Bourke, the honourable member for Batman, the honourable member for Maribyrnong, and Senator Trenwith were or were not formerly members of the Labour Partv; but the Opposition evidently think it of much importance that some men have in them the love of liberty developed so strongly that they could not bear the chains and ignominy of the organization any longer; indeed, that is one-of the worse charges that the Opposition can hurl against these supporters of the Government. Up to recently the Victorian members of the Labour Party insisted on a Protectionist plank in their platform, but, at the behest of caucus, which is declared by one of the leading members of the party to be an unrepresentative body, those members are evidently preparing to accept whatever fiscal - decision may be arrived at by the majority of their colleagues. Formerly Victorian Labour members had to sign a pledge to support Protection, but at present the four members from Victoria-the y are dwindling away-ar e absolutely at the mercy of members from other States who may hold different fiscal opinions. A Victorian Labour candidate may tell the constituents of Yarra, Melbourne, or Port Melbourne that he is a Protectionist, but he has to admit that he. is only so until a majority of representatives from other constituencies, who may happen to be Free-traders, have decided upon the course to be adopted. I am glad to see that the Labour Party desire to stick as closely as possible to the policy of the Deakin Ministry, and to steal as much as they can of the Liberalism it represents. The honourable member for West Sydney openly gloried in it at his Geelong meeting. The Labcur Party have adopted almost entirely the plank of the Deakin Government in regard to compulsory military training, as shown by the following extract from their platform :Citizen Defence Force, with compulsory military training, and Australian-owned . and controlled Navy. 1",17
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The meeting Geelong killed the honourable member; and I am sorry to say so, because he is a friend of mine.",18
35,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The first sign of friendship is the absence of bitter asides. The honourable member for Hume with, I am sure, all kindly feeling in his heart, rest were converted on the spot. refers to an unfortunate meeting in long, where my voice, in endeavouring speak to intelligent men and women, was drowned by an organized opposition members of the Labour ranks. It is, haps, because of my inability to express myself as full y and carefully as I would have liked, at Geelong, that I am inflicting these remarks on the House today.",18
36,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Why did not the honourable meinber have admission by ticket, did the Prime Minister?",18
37,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Ha d I thought - there trainingwas to.be such a rowdy meeting I might have adopted the tactics of four Labour members who held a meeting at Geelong the previous week, and taken up a compulsory collection at the door. The meeting was well worth threepence.",18
38,Mr HUMECOOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,At Brunswick there was a collection at the doors before the audience left the meeting.,18
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member for Bourke's tongue should for ever silent.,18
40,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Order ! members must be aware that I cannot persaid he mit such a course of conduct as has been followed during the last few moments. erroneous They must have regard for the dignity of the House and the constituencies they present.,18
41,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The meeting was well der worth threepence, because on the occasion in question the late Attorney-General fairly excelled himself by abusing even me. I have heard of a modern American who, on visiting Egypt, stood before the Sphinx, with his fingers to his nose, and on learnmember ing that the honourable member for Sydney at this meeting abused me, one cannot help being surprised at the remarkfor ?ble audacity of these Labour men. constituents, who think a 'lot of me, dently considered it would be good fun to is forced to support? hear Crouch getting a gruelling, and consaid sequently .some of them paid threepence each to enter the meeting. The difficulties of getting an audience were such that their meeting did not start until 8.25 p.m., I was so anxious toconvert the Labour men that I freely distributed handbills at stating that I intended to reply to the innuendoes, abuse, and vindictive statements which constitute the ordinary language of the honourable member for West Sydney. Fully forty Labour men entered my meeting, but I dare say that after hearing my speech, only live Labour men went out; the I proGeepose to show why the Labour Party to have to agree with the plank in the Deakin platform in regard"" to a citizen of defence force and compulsory milipertary training. I have here a copy of the official report of the proceedings at the Political Labour Conference, held at Brisbane in July last, and at page 17 I find that the honourable member for Darwin, who attended that conference as a representative as of Tasmania, said that Labour-in referring to the question of compulsory military proposed to adopt the most diabolical methods of Europe and give the gilt-spurred roosters power to blow a bugle and snatch farmers' sons, business men's sons, and Labour men's sons, and send them to the front. The honourable member believes, then, that compulsory military training is a diabolical system. Yet, in order to secure the Labour nomination for Darwin, he has had to sign a platform which makes provision for be its adoption. If he were a free man, he could stand by his opinions. Then, again, Honourable I find that Mr Holman, another delegate, was against the miserable cadet system and the views which it tended to create on immature minds. reAnother delegate, a Mrs Dwyer, said she regretted that anything legalising mur",18
42,Mr KING OMALLEY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He a r , hear.",18
43,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Althoug h not guilty of it, I have been charged with inconsistency, but is it not surprising that the honourable for Darwin should cheer a stateWest ment by Mrs Dwyer that compulsory military training is a system that provides legalised murder, in view of the fact My that he has signed a platform in which evithat plank finds a place and which he Mrs Dwyer that she regretted that anything legalising murder should emanate from a Labour man. She did not see why military training should be compulsory. Then, and again, the honourable member for Yarra was against compulsion, and believed the plank should remain as it was.",18
44,Dr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Has he signed the ticket,19
45,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Of course he has to. has agreed to the plank of compulsory trainciation, saiding, although he is against it. Still another delegate at the Conference, Mr Anstey, I When M.L.A., of Victoiia, declared against comshot pulsion, but he has had to sign the platas form. It was'announced a little while ago that he would be a. candidate for the'eleccould torate of Bourke at the next general elecother nation tion, but for a long while he refused to nominate. He held back, and at first I was inclined to think this fact that he did not want to give seat in the State Parliament, ancl risk being left in outer darkness. perhaps, doing him an injustice. His tardiness in coming forward may, perhaps, have been due to the fact that, having against compulsory military training, and having declared that the Victorian Labour men were only avowedly protectionist, he could not bring himself to the point signing the Federal Labour platform, which makes provision for it. It must have required the efforts of every member of his committee to drag him up to sign the pledge. At page 19 of the report of the Conference, Mr Anstey is reported have said thatThe property did not belong to the workers, and if Senator Givens wanted to fight for the man who had the money he should to do so. I have here, also, signed articles by Mr. Anstey, which appeared in the papers, from which it would appear that he thinks that compulsory military training is away. the worse form of defence that could be adopted. But the "" jam pot "" still exists, and Mr Anstey is the political fly who has been attracted to it. He intends to put his fortunes at stake by standing for Bourke, and he will stand out.",19
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Wh v this laughter?,19

The of honourable member for Wannon who sits on my right says that there are others who agree with the view expressed by the delegate from Broken Hill. Has the honourable member the courage to say that he endorses it? No ! He thinks discretion the better part of to valour, and when I put this question to him, he simply twirls his moustache. It is a very pretty moustache.",19

55,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Do I . understand, Mr. Speaker, that you rule that an honourable it member is not allowed to ask another honourable member to state from what he is",19
56,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"What I have just recalled attention to is that the honourable attimember for Corio was being subjected to such a constant fire of interjections that it almost impossible for me to hear him, or to distinguish sometimes between his and those of interjectors. Such a procedure is entirely out of order, because it prevents the honourable member from making his own speech.: I did not hear what one of the honourable member for Gwydir interjected; I heard only a storm of interjections coming at the same time from half-a-dozen honourable members.",19
57,Mr ROBERTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"May I explain, Mr. Speaker, that my interjection was that a fire of interjections was the only fire to which the honourable member would ever subject himself - the official report of the Labour Con",20
58,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I was utterly unable to hear what the honourable member for Adelaide said, and that further emphasizes the objection to the constant interjections to which I have called attention. I ask honourable members to refrain from these interjections.",20
59,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I understand that the honourable member for Adelaide is rather sore because I have not responded to his interjection that I would never be shot in defence of my country. I hope that I never shall be shot. I would certainly be prepared to defend my country whenever the occasion arose, but it is a mistake for any one to imagine that I have any desire to be shot. In case there is any doubt on the subject, I wish to emphatically declare I am not going to be shot if I can help it. The honourable member's interjection reminds me that as the representative of Adelaide in this House, he succeeded a great man, the late Mr Charles Cameron Kingston, and 'that he poses as "" Kingston the Little."" It is unfortunate that he never misses an opportunity to send forth his shafts of bitterness, and it is well to remind him that the honourable gentleman whom he has succeeded, and whom he ever attempts to imitate and to parody, never went out of his way to give useless offence to anv one. Another plank in the Labour Party's platform is that providing for a graduated tax on all estates over .Â£5,000 in value, and on an unimproved basis. That has to be read with another plank providing for "" naval and military expenditure to be allotted from proceeds of direct taxation."" The two planks read together are utterly inconsistent, and mutuallv destructive. While they claim that their graduated land tax applies only to estates over Â£5,000 in value, and appeal to the small farmers for support, asserting that no revenue will be obtained from the tax, how are they to allot the Defence expenditure of the Commonwealth, which totals Â£1,700,000, out of the proceeds of direct taxation ? They say that the Defence expenses are to be,,.not paid by, but allotted from, the proceeds of direct taxation, showing that, in their view, the proceeds of direct land taxation are to exceed Â£1,700,000. If so, is it not a farce and a scandal for the members of the Labour Opposition to go round the country stating that the small farmers will not be affected, and that no revenue will be obtained from the land tax? On page 1.5 of the valuable little red book ference-fro m which I have already quoted, I find that Mr Grant, a delegate from Tasmania, made the following statement: Mr Watson had said that the progressive land tax was not for revenue, but for the bursting up of the large estates. Although Mr Watson subsequently denied that he had said that, and claimed that the object of the tax was only incidentally to obtain revenue, that is the impression that Mr Grant had. Then Mr Holman, the vice-president of the New South Wales Labour Party, is reported on the same page to have saidThe tax was not really a revenue-producing tax, and whatever revenue was derived from it would be incidental to the accomplishment of its primary objects. The honourable member for Coolgardie, who was a delegate from Western Australia, made the following statementsThe necessity of direct taxation did not seem to him a possibility confronting them at that stage He would like to see it made clear that it was not the intention of the Federal party to impose a second land tax where the State land tax held good, or vice versd. The honourable member for Coolgardie, therefore, actually wants to apply the land tax only where no State land tax applies, and as the Prime Minister has pointed out that there is a form of land tax in every State, the honourable member evidently does not want a Federal land tax at all. The honourable member for Boothby was also present as. a delegate, and on page 15 of this most valuable report-this little red book that discloses the secrets of the charnel house-h e is shown to have saidIt was idle to expect much revenue from a tax of this kind. To meet the cost of naval and military expenditure from the proceeds of direct taxation, the Labour Partv must get more than Â£1,700,000 from their land tax, and, consequently the admissions of members of the party throughout that debate that there would be no revenue from the tax, with its Â£5,000 exemption, are nothing but a delusion and a snare, and a trick, in order to get small farmers' votes. It is plain that as soon as they have imposed their tax, the first thing they will do MINISTERIAL MEMBERS - Hear ,",20
60,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Does the honourable member hear the "" small farmers "" cheering him?",21
61,Mr THOMAS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Sma U farmers like the (honourable member for Fawkner !,21
62,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Hea r the contempt 'being poured by the Labour Party on the small farmers! It is an echo of the speeches that were made by responsible members of the late Government, objecting to the change of venue of the trial of Tom Mann and others to Albury, where they practically stated that the small farmers would not do them justice. Ministers of the Crown, who are now so ready to go up and down the country appealing to the small farmers for support, bad at that time co much contempt for them that they declared that they would tie prepared to perjure themselves, and violate the oath which every man takes on going into the jury box. The affection for the small farmer has only been developed "" on that side in the last ten minutes, but still any development in that direction is refreshing. A Mr J. Thome, from the New Zealand Trades and Labour Council, is reported to have said at the Melbourne Trades Hall, on 2ist May of this year, that one of the - worse things that they could do was to create small farmers in New Zealand, because they were against the righteous Labour men. These are his wordsThe result of the progressive legislation was - that where the men in the towns had had to fight one Tory land-holder, who was exploiting the people, they had now to fight twenty little Tory land-holders. The workers and Socialists of New Zealand saw that it did not matter whether they were robbed by one man or twenty. Mr Thorne received the thanks of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, and Mr J. Lemmon, M.L.A., remarked amidst cheers, that he thought Mr Thorne had taken the right view. The small farmers on that occasion were considered robbers and exploiters. The Labour Party's sudden extraordinary affection for the farmer shows that even they do not stand still for ever. To show that the Â£5,000 exemption was proposed in order to gain the support of the small farmer, Senator Findley, on page 16 of the same book from which I have already quoted, saidRy endorsing the exemption of Â£.5,000 Labour could prove conclusively that they desired to tielp the farmers and were on the side of the poor man. That smells of votes. They are going to help the small farmer in another way. The hear ! Victorian Labour Council, at its last Conference at Easter, added"" some new planks to its platform. One of them was to help the small farmer by the establishment of Government farms in opposition to them. We have always been in a certain amount of doubt as to whether the Labour Party had declared itself to be a Socialist party or not. I have heard the honourable member for Boothby declare that he was not a Socialist, while the honourable memher for Barrier has said distinctly that he is a Socialist. OPPOSITION MEMBERS - We are all Those Socialists.",21
63,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The confidence of the Socialists in their members, however, does not extend to letting them remain in Parliament once they are in. The machine is putting on another screw, for the Socialist League, which is a very strong body at Broken Hill, has passed a resolution that every member before he is elected either as a Labour member or a Socialist, will have to hand in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House, and containing his resignation. That letter is to be kept by ,the Socialist League of the Barrier to be used against the member as occasion requires.",21
64,Mr MCDOUGALL,MOTION OF WAN T OF,If he breaks his pledges.,21
65,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The people who are to judge whether he has broken his pledges are a small body of six or seven men meeting in a secret chamber, who are to send a wire to the member two or three days after they have posted his resignation to the Speaker, so as to be sure that there will be no chance of his withdrawing his resignation before the Speaker gets it, calling upon him to come up and meet the Socialists and explain things. I am reminded by the honourable member for Cook that the Socialist League is against the Labour Party. I am aware that the Labour Party have these deeper depths to fathom. In fact, it is rapidly becoming the party of the centre. They have now the Socialists on their own flank. That is the reason why many of them are declaring themselves to be Socialists, in order to conciliate both sides; but they will have to take a very different line of action if they do not declare themselves to be in favour of the .platform of the organization known as the Industrial Workers of the World. I have 'here some of the literature of that body. To show what the honourable member for Wannon and others .have tb meet and how necessary it will be for them to come in out of the wet very quickly and give up the machine, one of these Industrial Workers of the World told me that they are not going to vote for the Labour men at the next election.",21
66,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Hear , hear. We don't want them.",22
67,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member for Cook is a man who does not want any votes - He never looks after votes. He is wasted in this House, and if he put up in New South Wales for the Senate he would sweep the country. To read his speeches, such, for instance, as the one he delivered last night, would be sufficient endorsement of him to any intelligent or fair-minded constituency. My only fear is that he will come to Corio, but as he does not want votes I am sure that the Industrial Workers of the World will not vote for him.",22
68,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,My speech did not contain as much falsehood as the honourable member's does.,22
69,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I would ask that the honourable member' be called to order.,22
70,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Will the honourable member for Cook withdraw the remark?,22
71,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In deference to your ruling, sir, I am compelled to withdraw, but if the honourable member made the statement outside ' o Mr SPEAKER - I am quite unable to say whether the honourable member has withdrawn the remark or not. The House ought, at least, to give me an opportunity of knowing whether my direction has been complied with. Will the honourable member kindly withdraw his remark?",22
72,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I did withdraw, and I explained that, although the language used was unparliamentary in the House, it would not be unparliamentary outside.",22
73,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I cannot accept that as a withdrawal. I ask the honourable member to withdraw without any qualification. ter Mr.should,22
74,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I withdraw.,22
75,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I assure you, sir, that wanted I will not go outside; the fate reserved for me would be too horrible. I do not on the Conference. wish to be gobbled up in two bites. I have now a quotation to make from the to Worker, of the 4th February, 1909. It is a divergence, but this little redoubt pression to use."" stands in the way, and I have to clear it closed. before resuming the general engagement. In a discussion at the New South Wales* Labour Congress, one of the ablest memLabour bers of the New"" South Wales Labour Party ridiculed the representative character the Federal Conference, Mr Holman saying that he viewed the Inter-State body as being nonrepresentative, because he found Mr Spencerepresenting Western Australia and Mr Catts Tasmania. Then the gathering was held in a haphazard way. l t was composed largely of members of Parliament and officials, and when these thirty-six men passed a resolution it was binding on those of the States, and he felt that if some alterations were not made there would* be a split. There were nine representatives from New South Wales, six from Queensland, six from Victoria, five from South Australia, five from Western Australia, and four frorh> Tasmania. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Six from Tasmania.",22
76,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Tw o of the representatives of Tasmania were New South Walesmembers. They were the honourable members for Cook and New England. Of these, I doubt whether the honourable member for Cook has ever seen Tasmania.",22
77,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is not true. I was elected by the Tasmanian Conferenceto represent the State.,22
78,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Then the honourable member has seen Tasmania although he comes from New South Wales. New South Wales contains more free-tradersthan does any other State, and yet thisConference which met to decide the policy of the party, which, should it obtain power, would become the policy of Australia, and' which was supposed to represent all the States equally, gave New South Wales a? representation 50 per cent, greater than the representation of Victoria, and 125 percent, greater than that of Tasmania. The honourable member for Cook was in a fighting mood, and replied to Mr Holman'srude remarks with that grace of diction and courtesy which always characterizehimCatts, M.H.R., considered that this mathave first been sent to the Federal Party. The .fact was that the State Party to go to the Conference and get its ownway, and if it could not manage that to rat Mr Holman's reply-to that was a reference"" the current tripe of united Australia.""' A delegate interjected, "" That is a nice exThe episode thenI wish now - to show that Socialism was adopted at the last VictorianLabour Conference, and that the Federal' Party has declared for a most objectionable form of Socialism. The Vicof torian Labour Party proposes to start farms in opposition to the small farmer. At the Conference held on the ioth April of this year to settle its future programmeAt the instance of the Richmond ancl ton branches it was decided that the following new plank be added :- "" The establishment State farms, mines, factories and shops, for the purpose of affording employment, under vernment supervision, to citizens requiring the employees to be, as far as possible, the sumers of the wealth they produce and to receive as wages an equivalent of the net total produced."" If the party had its way, the State would be the only employer. It would be a monopolist of labour, and if a man were dismissed, he could appeal to no other employer, as no other would exist. Should a butcher come along and ask for work, he would have to take what was offered to him. Under this system, when he asked what his wages would be, the official would tell him that he would be paid from the produce of his labour, getting so many pounds of beef, perhaps a-couple of legs of mutton, ancl two loin chops and some sausages. A tailor asking for wages would be told, "" the job will not run to a pair of trousers weekly, as the Labour Party's wage is only i2s6d. a week, but we can give you a leg this week and the other next week."" If a farmer asked to be paid in money, he would be told, "" We do not believe in coin. ' It is the mark of the exploiter. Besides, it has the King's head upon it. But you may take home so much grass and some hay for the children."" The 2ist resolution of the Brisbane Labour Conference wasThat the question of securing representation - of the Australian Labour Party at the next International Socialist Conference be referre'd to the convening executive for consideration, with a view to giving effect thereto. With a view of giving effect thereto! That is an endorsement of the platform of the International-Socialist Conference. I find that the first meeting of the Conference took place at Amsterdam in 1904, and the next at Stuttgart in 1907. The Australian Labour Party has declared Socialism to be - one of its objectives, while the Social Democratic Federation of England, which will also be represented at the Conference to which the ex-Prime Minister and ex-Attorney-General-possibl y accompanied by the honourable member for Cook as representative of, say, South America-ma y go, advocates, according to Modern Socialism, and its own official platform, among what it considers immediate political reforms, the abolition.of the Monarchy, and among financial and fiscal reforms the repudiation of the national Debt. The objective of International HamilSocialism is difficult to determine, and I have looked up every book on the subject of in the library, and communicated with Go- ' prominent Socialists and Socialist bodies, it, but all I can ascertain is this definition conf r o m the International Socialists' ReviewObjective : Socialisation of the means of production, distribution, and exchange, to be controlled by a democratic State in the interests of the whole community, and the complete emancipation of labour from the domination of capitalism and landlordism, with the establishment of social and economic equality between the sexes. Some of the resolutions passed at the Brisbane Labour Conference are worth reading. The Labour Party professedly stands for labour, and that is a noble aspiration. I think that I myself stand for the best interests of the worker. I am a worker myself, and the son of a worker; and am proud of it. But when I find reactionary principles adopted by the Labour Party, I can only regard those who follow them, and are deceived by the word "" labour,"" as being foolish and ignorant in the extreme. One of the resolutions passed at that Federal Labour Conference is the severest attack on the rights of the working men we have ever witnessed. In any trade we know that the chance the worker has is by the exercise of his brains and the application of practical methods to introduce new processes; and he is occasionally able to take out a patent and obtain a return for his research. But the Federal Conference passed the following resolutionThat the existing Patents Act should be amended to provide no letters patent should protect any patent after the expiration of two years from registration. I know that very often a working man does not take out a patent for a new process he may discover; but, if he does so, it usually takes the greater part of two years before he is able to find capital to develop it. I regret to say that sometimes, though not always, such patents are stolen; but if the resolution I have read were carried into effect, the inventor would never get any return. In the past the Liberal Party have thought it wise, in the face of the opposition of employers, capitalists, and exploiters-the last is a new word of the Opposition for employers-to give a patentee protection for a period of fifteen to twenty-two years; but the Labour Party would wipe out all our Patent Acts, and need not substitute any other, because protection for two years would be only an encumbrance on ingenuity.",22
79,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Was that resolution carried ?,24
80,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I find from the report of the Conference that the President complained of the small attendance, and asked vhether, under the circumstances, they vere going to pass important resolutions ind do business, so that the representative of Tasmania does not appear to have known what was happening. I can only say that the report from which I am reading is the official report.",24
81,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is a resolution lvhich was carried forward to the next Conference for consideration.,24
82,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In the report it is under the heading of "" Resolutions."" Mr Jr. H . CATTS - But it was not carried.",24
83,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Will the representative of Tasmania at that Conference, or the honourable member for Cook-on e or other of them-sa y that the resolution was not carried ?",24
84,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It was carried forward to the next Conference for further consideration.,24
85,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Will the honourable member say that that resolution was not carried at the Brisbane Conference in Julv last?,24
86,Mr JH CATTS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It was not constitutionally carried.,24
87,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Howeve r anxious the honourable member may now be to repudiate it, if he had ventured to go further I could have bowled him out; but I ain not here to discuss constitutional points with him ; indeed, it would not be fair to me to tackle a great constitutional lawver like himself. I can only say that the resolution I have read is officially reported as passed at the Conference. Honourable members will be-surprised to hear that at the same Conference a resolution was carried in favour of the introduction of contract labour in the following terms:That this Conference objects to the expenditure of any public money for immigration purposes until such time as employment is found . . . . for those desirous to.settle thereon. There are to be no immigrants until employment is .supplied; and we know that a man cannot be an immigrant until he comes into the country. Then, in view of the tearful indignation of the leader of the Opposition, when he heard that Senator Pearce was not .going to be allowed to represent the Commonwealth at the Imperial Defence Conference, honourable memberswill be surprised to learn that the following resolution was passed at the Labour Conference:That all Australian delegates to future I m perial or Colonial Conferences be given definiteinstructions on specific subjects by the Federal' Parliament, and that they (the delegates) shall' not deal with nor pledge the Commonwealthupon any subjects not previously dealt with by the Federal Parliament. It seems to me that the - appointment of Senator Pearce was rather too hurried in the face of such a resolution; and we know that he is a bold man who dares to defy the red-book Conference. I am sorry, in one way to have to make these remarks > but I must refer to the declaration by the leader of the Opposition at Gympie in favour of a maximum wage. For the first time in the history of the Commonwealth, the Labour Party had a chance to express themselves as to what they regard as good pay for the worker, and the leader of the Opposition, speaking, not only officially as Prime Minister, but as leader of the Labour Party, said he thought that for skilled artisans and other 'workers over 20 years of age, 12s. 6d. a week was sufficient. If there is one thing that would lead me to feel that the Labour Party no longer deserve the support of working men, it is that they have becomea one-and-nine penny-a-day party. The proposal, in my opinion, was an outrageous one; and I immediately drew attention to it in Melbourne. The leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, was not on the spot, and Senator Pearce replied to my communication to the effect that, although the Labour Party proposed 12s. 6d. a week, the Deakin Government had' proposed nothing. Is that not a splendid justification for the men who depend on the Labour Party ? Liberal Governments, by whom the Commonwealth has been largely administered, have, always paid their employees, under similar circumstances, on a much higher scale. For instance, every militiaman in camp is paid 8s. a day, or Â£ 2 16s. a week for seven davs, and in the arrangement made with the I m perial authorities as to the employment of men on war vessels, the present Prime Minister insisted on 4s. 8d. to 5s. sd. a day for those Australians permanently engaged. Now, however, we are told that is. od. a day is the ideal and ultimate aspiration of the Labour Party. Friends of the workers if you like! In the same speech at Gympie, the leader of the Opposition expressed the opinion that the rate of 8s. 7d. per day, awarded by Mr Justice Higgins, was a magnificent proposal, and he lauded that gentleman to the skies. Every time that Mr Justice Higgins' name is mentioned in Labour circles throughout the Commonwealth it is cheered, and justly so: indeed, the learned gentleman has been almost adopted by the Labour Party, .although he was always a member of ithe Liberal Party. But I remember the time when the man who is now cheered was opposed, and every effort made by the Labour Party to hound him - down and deprive him of his seat in the House. Just before Mr Justice Higgins was elevated to the High Court Bench, he was faced with a Labour antagonist in his constituency, although he had been Attorney-General in a Labour Government.",24
88,Mr HALL,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He did not rat on his ciples on that account?,25
89,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not think that Mr Justice Higgins ever did, or ever would, rat on his principles; indeed, I do not know any honourable member on this side of the House who ever did so. Perthe sonally, I was elected as a Protectionist, a crushes Democrat, and a Radical; and I see nothing in the programme of the present of Government to cause me in the slightest giee to deflect from those principles. go straight ahead, supporting what I think right, opposing what I cannot agree with, and I stated my views to my constituents, and they accepted me without feeling necessary to ask me to sign any pledge; but everv promise I gave I keep as though had signed a pledge. It seems to me that those foxes who have lost their extremely sorry to have been in the Labour trap, and would be very glad, indeed, to find a number of others in the same predicament. I recommend members the Labour Party to visit the Melto bourne National Gallery and look at the newly purchased Burne Jones' picture, The Wheel of Life. There they will see three or four men bound to an enormous wheel; these men have nothing to do the movement of the wheel, but are simply moved by it, just in the same way as the members of the Labour Party are flies the wheel of their organization. Members the Labour Party have to sign with which they do not agree. I believe in - compulsory military training. I should be free to say so. But I have quoted speeches from honourable members of this House who do not believe in the principle, and yet have signed a platform in which it is embodied. Then, again, I believe in Protection, and the new Protection. Any honourable member on this side of the House who does not believe in those principles is at perfect liberty to say so'. He deals fairly and freely with his constituents, and they do the same with him. Amongst the Opposition, however, there are honourable members who do not believe in Protection, although they have signed a platform, and have to accept the principle whether they approve of it or not. They are mere atoms in the grip of a great machine. Victims of the machine struggle and writhe, but cannot free themselves from it. They cannot leave it, and the position, :,i my opinion, is becoming intolerable evor? to some members of the party. Why is it that the ex-Prime /Minister, the honourable member for South Sydney, is not here today? prinDid he not find the domination of the Labour Leagues overbearing ?",25
90,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,No .,25
91,Mr CROUCH,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Why does he propose to withdraw from the arena of politics at close of this Parliament ? Is it that he finds it impossible to stand by a system that out a man's independence, strength intellect, and freedom of conscience, and conviction ? One of the things that is dereally destroying representation and deI mocracy, is this machine, with its small coteries of men meeting in a secret chamber, and rigorously excluding all but the representatives of their own press. I need it say no more. I was born free, and am going to preserve my freedom. I regret that I T have occupied so much of the time of the House, and am grateful for the attention tails are that I have received.",25
92,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Kalgoorlie) [12.3] - The remarks made by the honourable member, of who has just resumed his seat, recalled my mind the statement of a learned Judge, that, in certain circumstances, a man might be pardoned for perjuring himself in order to preserve a woman's honour. That limitation upon perjury, however, has with been extended by the honourable member, who apparently believes that honourable members are justified not only in misrepreon senting a party, but in wilfully perjuring of themselves in order to justify their betrayal pledges of their constituents.",25
93,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is not a nice If I did not remark to make.,25
94,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member has been laughing immoderately at statements made by honourable members on that side of the House in regard to principles of the Labour Party-statement s that he must have known were absolutely incorrect. I do not propose to follow the honourable member for Corio in all his references to individuals who are alleged by him to express the opinions of the united Labour Party. I wish only to mention that I am informed he has attributed to labour men remarks made in Sydney by one or two members of the International Socialist party. May I remind the House that the International Socialist party of New South Wales has always opposed the Labour Party, and has run candidates for the Senate in opposition to our men? We shall be quite prepared to accept responsibility for statements, however absurd, made by men who are, or have ever been, associated with our party, provided that the honourable member for Corio and his friends will accept responsibility for the statements of Mr Walpole, and those associated with him, that marriage is a luxury, &c. It will be difficult to find authority for many of the honourable member's Statements. Indeed, it would be as difficult for the honourable member to find authority for some of his statements as it was to find him on a celebrated occasion when he volunteered to go to South Africa. It is strange, to say the least, that an honourable member holding such views regarding the Labour Party as he has expressed this morning should have desired to become associated with ""it. He is here now, has he any reply to make to that statement? If the Labour Party is as bad as he has painted it, why did he wish to join it?",26
95,Mr HALL,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member for Corio is suffering apparently from lockjaw. He will not answer.  had not found out the Labour Party.,26
96,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Poo r innocent! I could accept a plea of innocence from the honourable member for Echuca, but the honourable member for Corio had been long enough in politics to be familiar with the methods of the Labour Party before he submitted a proposal that he should be permitted to join with them. His request was not granted. The honourable member is present, and admits by his he proposed to join with us.",26
97,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Ask the honourable member ? ' Mr Frazer - I have, and he is as silent as the Sphinx. Only about four years ago, and since, the honourable member wished to become associated with the terrible Labour Party.",26
98,Mr HUGHES,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And crawled to them at that.,26
99,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I did not propose to make his position any worse than it is, except by extracting from hire the admission that he desired to become a member of our party. He is not prepared to deny that statement, because the truth of it is to be found in this House. And this is the honourable member who has made this morning such extraordinary statements in regard to our party ! Such statements are made by him and other honourable members on the Government side of the House, in order to justify their betrayal of their constituents.",26
100,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What nonsense.,26
101,Mr HALL,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Was it the honourable member for Corio who sent the wire, ""Will join Fisher, but not Lyne""?",26
102,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,-That point is immaterial. We have the honourable member's admission by his silence that he desired to become a member of our party. How far have honourable members opposite succeeded in justifying their treachery to their constituents ?,26
103,Mr COON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member is very much concerned about honourable members on this side of the House.,26
104,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Because we have placed' them on their trial for the abandonment of their pledges. I am afraid, however,, that they have gone so far that it is impossible now to make them wince. They have determined that since they have a majority they will continue, for somemonths at all events, to flout the will of their constituents, and to refuse them the right to express an opinion regarding their betrayal. That remark does not apply necessarily to every honourable member opposite. I believe that-all have had to make some sacrifices, but the Prime Minister has certainly abandoned the programme upon which he was returned at the last general election. The position is the same in regard to those honourable members who were closely associated with him-the thirteen who carried on the Government of this country by our grace.",26
105,Mr COON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Not by the grace of the silence that honourable member.,26
106,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I frankly admit that for some time prior to the defeat of the Deakin Administration I did my best to .bring about its downfall. Nothing better - could have happened for Australia than the wiping, out of the official existence of that .little knot of members. The Protectionist Party has been merged in the Free-trade Party, and those who are screeching for protection will now have to depend upon the .grace of the right honourable member for East Sydney as to whether Joshua should get another'25 per cent, duty on spirits, or Beale another 5 per cent, increase in the duty on pianos.",26
107,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member is doing a lot of growling.,27
108,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And the right honourable gentleman has grumbled a good deal. May I ask him to produce a report of any statement made by him in Western Australia in favour of the gift of a DreadnougJit to Great Britain.,27
109,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I did not say that I was in favour of it. The honourable member should read what I said.,27
110,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"At a meeting held in Perth the honourable member moved a certain resolution and then said "" There is nothing in it, ladies and gentlemen.""",27
111,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I did not say that. .A lot of obstructionists - tried to interrupt me before I had uttered more than two or three words.,27
112,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There could have been no obstruction when the honourable member made the statement. I have just quoted since it was the first sentence he uttered after reading the resolution.,27
113,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is absolute misrepresentation.,27
114,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,It is a fact.,27
115,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Rea d what I said.,27
116,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Will the right honourable member deny that he said there was nothing in the resolution?,27
117,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I said more. I said that there was really nothing in the resolution to which any one could object.,27
118,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I will accept the honourable member's statement.,27
119,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Because the honourable member knows that it is true.,27
120,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I am sorry to have to ask the Treasurer not to interrupt.,27

123,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am sorry if I have misrepresented the right honourable member, but I do not think that I have",27
124,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Rea d .what I said.,27
125,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have read it. The right honourable member sent me an edited copy of his speech so that I might read it. He now says he stated that the resolution was one to which no one could take exception He tells us, however, that the meeting was a rowdy one so that some one must have taken exception to it > but he does not tell us whether he committed himself in any way whilst in Western Australia to the presentation of a Deadnought. Sir JOHN FORREST,- I did not. Mr Frazer.'-The right honourable member was wise.",27
126,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,But I have committed mvself now.,27
127,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The right honourable member committed the country to the presentation of a Dreadnought, although Parliament could first have been consulted. His constituents, too, had no opportunity of being consulted.",27
128,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member can take all the change he can get out of that when he returns to Western Australia. Mr Frazer.,-The right honourable member talks about "" the. change,"" but he has committed the country to the "" principal."" He ought to have taken up that attitude when he was in Western Australia. My objection to the Government is that they have broken faith with their constituents. The Government met Parliament on a Wednesday, and asked for an adjournment, although the House could have met the next day. As soon as they got safely into their offices for three weeks, without the criticism of Parliament, they turned round and pledged Australia to an expenditure of Â£2,000,000, although the general expression of opinion among the people was against the gift of a Dreadnought. They flouted Parliament in doing so.",27
129,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Parliamen t will have to pass it.,27
130,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Parliamen t will be in a nice position in having to pass it, when the honour of the country has really been pledged by the offer made by a Government that does nbt represent the opinion of the people of Australia.",27
131,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Labour Government pledged the whole of the resources of Australia.,27
132,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"We did so only to this extent, that we saw the time had arrived to make provision for the defence of the Commonwealth. It did not take our Government long to appreciate that fact when' they got into a responsible position, wheretion, as the honourable gentleman and his colleagues were thinking about it for nearly eight years prior to that. It was left to the Labour Party, when they obtained a few months in office, to give the necessary orders to bring into existence the nucleus of an Australian Navy. I am opposed to this Government, who have betrayed the trust of their constituents, on many grounds. I am opposed to them on the Dreadnought question, on which they do not represent the feelings of the people. I am opposed to their proposal to sully the name of the Commonwealth by introducing a borrowing system. It is a certainty that they intend to do that. I am opposed to them because they have made no provision in their policy for the taxa* tion of the unimproved value of land, which at present is' the greatest necessity of all j and I am opposed to them on account of their paltering with the proposal to introduce the new Protection. How many of those on that side of the House can be saidto be sincere in their professed wish to do justice to the workmen engaged in protected industries? When the Prime Minister or the then Minister of Customs introduced the Tariff, there was an understanding amongst all sections of the House that provision for payment of suitable wages to the workmen was to accompany the imposition of duties. The Deakin Government proceeded with the Customs Tariff, but as they neared the end of it nothing practical had been undertaken in regard to the new Protection. They then tabled a memorandum, the principle of . which was that Excise duties might be imposed on articles made under the protection of the Customs Tariff, but should be rebated to manufacturers who paid a living rate of wages. Nothing was done in regard to the matter for a considerable time, and action was only taken, I think, on account of the persistent urging chiefly of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. It was then found that the harvester manufacturers were prepared , to defeat the provisions of the Excise law by an application to the High Court. Later, on 28th October, 1908, whilst the Deakin Government were under the control of the Labour Party, or, I should say, getting the assistance of the Labour Party, and when that guarantee ""of assistance, or the support which was being accorded to them, -- .was getting very shaky, they brought down another memorandum on the new ProtecMr Frazer. containing this very significant paragraph :As the power to protect the manufacturer isnational, it follows that unless the Parliament' of the Commonwealth also acquires power to secure fair and reasonable conditions of employment to wage-earners, the policy of Protection must remain incomplete. That sounded like business. They went onThe object of the proposed amendment of the Constitution wdl be to endow the Parliament of the Commonwealth with a grant of powers to doeconomic justice in the protected industries with due regard to the unity of the Commonwealth and the diversity of local circumstances. It appeared at that time as though the Government intended really to appeal to the people of Australia to grant that power to the National Parliament That was trieproposal in 1908. Now, the position is that, in order to effectively safeguard the interest of the workmen throughout Australia, the members of the Anti-Sweating League have associated themselves with the biggest sweaters in the country-the Employers' Federation and their representatives. They are going to save the workmen from being sweated by associating themselves with the sweater. They will endeavour to secure better wages by asso-ciating themselves with the men who never the have paid, and never will pay, fair wages-, until they are compelled to do so. They, are going to do all this by the blessed proposal to appeal to the States to grant themthe necessary power. Has any one ever heard a more plausible attempt to conceal a piece of hypocrisy than the effort made by the Prime Minister last night in dealing with the question?",27
133,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That was prompted! by the right honourable member for Swan.,28
134,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"When the Prime Minister is endeavouring by means of a multitude of words to conceal his real intention, and to make people who do not know him think that they are going to get something from him, he does not require the assistance of any man in Australia. He is a master at it. This blessed proposal of the Government is to get from the States power to institute improved conditions in the States when the States have refused to do it themselves.",28
135,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"And Mr Wade, the Premier of New South Wales, has stated that he will not allow the Commonwealth to do it.",28

139,Mr COON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The leader of the Labour Party in New South Wales- Mr MCGowen - say s that he is a very good man. - Mr Frazer - The honourable member need not try to modify or equivocate about it. I am sure Mr Wade will be pleased to hear the honourable member's good opinion of him, and the honourable member's constituents will be delighted that he praises Mr Wade. I suppose they were also delighted to hear from the Prime Minister last night that he is glad to the support of the Conservatives of Austionist, tralia. Does the honourable member for Batman feel at home and comfortable in his present company? Does he, the member of the Labour Party outside, though I am glad to say he was never member of it inside, the House, feel pleased with that statement of his leader?",29

141,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What was the statement?,29
142,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The Prime Minister knows all about it , and so do twenty honourable members. That day settled with the Prime Minister for ever, so f as his word was concerned.",29
143,Dr CARTY SALMON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What settled honourable member with his Treasurer?,29
144,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"My difficulty with the then Treasurer, the honourable member Hume, was that I thought him to be wrong lines in dealing with certain items. I felt that he was doing a big jury to some of the important industries Australia. I said to him, in regard to the chance. machinerv section of the Tariff, as 'it lated to the mining industry, "" I am prethe pared to give you prohibition on those articles in that list that can be made in Australia, but the other articles, which cannot be made in Australia, I want to see free, or 'subject only to a nominal duty."" The honourable member for Hume could not bring himself to my wav of thinking, and he could not convince some of his alleged friends, who have since deserted him, so he chose lo take a duty extending over the whole list. He met consequently with my opposition regarding several items which I believed to be of the utmost importance for the development of one of the primary industries of the Commonwealth.",29
145,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,-The honourable to know member was very wrong.,29
146,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is a. matter of opinion. I am in a position to say that I get did not come into the House as a protecand then seek to bring about protection by joining with the free-traders. I came in as a labourite. I have no pledges exunfulfilled in regard to fiscalism. I have alstuck to the Labour Party, and when T a thought they were on the wrong track in supporting the present Prime Minister, I tried to bring them to my way of thinking. I am glad to say that at last they agreed with me.",29

150,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do so, Mr Speaker, though I was merely repeating the interjection of another honourable member. The other proposal of the Prime Minister shows no me consideration for the working men and a r women of Australia. If the States refuse to grant this measure of justice to their the employees, does he expect that they will agree to allow some one else to do it ? The statement that the power once given cannot for be revoked was modified by the Prime on Minister last night. There is nothing Tariff in the Constitution to show that it incould not be revoked, if it were given, of and of that there is not the slightest His next position was that if his reproposal were adopted, and the consent of States obtained, the Government would use machinery already in existence, and thus it would be unnecessary to increase absorb. taxation. But he also proposed to create an Inter-State Commission which will have power to control nearly all things. he said that the Government would use institutions already in existence, he sugcourage gested that the Labour Party wishes of to bring into existence a new set sary of institutions. Could anything be. more absurd ? Does he believe that we should duplicate machinery, if existing machinery would serve our turn? The honorform, able gentleman must see the absurdity his suggestion. But, apparently, he de-. polists of Australia. sires it to be spread abroad that the Party wishes to incur additional expense, while he would be content with the chinery which is in existence. The poscepted. sibilities of his proposal are nil. founded on wrong lines. He has chance of obtaining the consent of the States, and cannot give relief to the tion. workers. Another point which he tried to make against the Labour Party was that, ber Mr. if we got constitutional power, we should endeavour to use it in respect to every industry in every part of Australia. parently he anticipates that Melbourne is for a long time to remain the Federal Capital, because he spoke of our controlling all the industries of Australia from Melthem. bourne. No one has made such a posal. The most that the ex-Prime Minister asks for .is that in industrial matters the Commonwealth shall have a powers concurrent with the States. anything be more absurd than to argue that if we obtain a constitutional we shall at once exercise it? Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate in regard to at least fifteen mattible thing. ters with which it has not yet attempted to deal. ' The Labour Party proposes exercise the powers of the Constitution where the Commonwealth administration would be more beneficial than that of the Cur ! States. While we seek for power to protect those who are being sweated in the protected industries of Australia, it is likely that that power would be used more it. quickly than would be good for the workers. Apparently, the Prime wishes to intimidate those who belong to the State Frights party, or who think of orable member joining it. As to immigration, it would be a farce to bring persons to this until our land laws have been altered. The Prime Minister, himself has said that in Old Country there are now more Mr Frazer. ready to come to Australia than we can",29
151,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,And he has admitted that the States will not assist him in makWhile ing land available for immigrants.,30
152,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Yes .

173,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That did not compel any one to contribute. I am sure that supporters of the honourable member would get out without paying. Is the Labour Party to be prevented from asking for withdraw it. voluntary contributions towards the work of organizing? The honourable member Covio said that at Geelong is. was charged.,31
174,Dr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What the honourable member said was that there was a collection at the door.,31
175,Mr HUTCHISON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He said there was a compulsory charge.,31

177,Dr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,He said there was a compulsory collection at the door.,31
178,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"There was no compulsory charge, and there never has been at any meeting of the party. Of course, the party accepts subscriptions from friends and sympathizers in order that a good work may be carried on. Quite a number of the gentlemen who object to our methods have been associated with the Labour Party at one time or another in the course of their political career, while others have been prepared to join the party, but have been readmission. We have seen the honormember for Corio walk silently out of Chamber; he knew the proofs were here. are "" friends of the Labour Party "" who associate with the party on the platbut who, in this House, when away the electors, ally themselves with the be Employers' Federation and sweaters. Apparently those honourable members regard it as wrong for the Labour Party to have a plate at the door for donations, but have not a word to say against clergymen who adopt a similar means of raising funds on to the Sunday.

187,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,In any case such a subscription has been alleged only in the case of one person on one occasion; and I think we may acquit him as afirstoffender. Mr .JOSEPH COOK -^- I believe that the honourable member fpr Hume has 150 guineas for the Labour Party.,32
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I shall have 1,000 guineas before long !",32
189,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If there are honourable members who, more than others, ought to preserve the dignity of the House, they are Ministers and ex-Ministers; and I ask that these interjections shall cease.",32
190,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In any case, it does not appear to me to be a very heinous offence for the Labour Party at their gatherings, to ask for voluntary subscriptions in order to meet the necessary expenses. But it is quite another matter to have it alleged that a compulsory charge is made - before admission, or that once in the audience cannot depart without paying. It appears that objections are raised to the workers paying their threepenny pieces or shillings, while nothing objectionable is seen in subscriptions paid by squatters of the Ritchie type in opposition to the, Labour Party.",32
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member mean the squatters in the Labour Partv ?,32

197,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,How much does the honourable member for Wannon own?,32
198,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable member for Wannon can speak for himself, and, at any rate, he would not shirk the land tax. I point out that this small puny landholder ofPenshurst is a supporter of the party who object to sympathizers of the labour movement putting a threepenny piece into the plate at the door on the occasion of a meeting; and yet he himself is subscribing Â£ 1 00 in order to enable an antiSocialist to fight the Wannon seat.",32
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Onl y Â£100?,32
200,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Yes . Those big landowners hang on to their money pretty tightly; ancl they must imagine there is real danger in the ability and eloquence of the honourable member for Wannon when they make such subscriptions in order to oppose him.,32
201,Sir JOHN FORREST,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It will not ruin the subscriber, will it?",32
202,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"No , none of those gentlemen who have possession of the world's wealth are likely to leave themselves penniless as a result of their generosity. In a circular issued by Mr R. B. Ritchie in the electorate of Wannon, the following words occurIn a large and wealthy constituency like this, where such huge vested interests are at stake, there ought to be no difficulty in getting Â£1,000. I understand that at present the subscriptions have reached ,Â£700 for the purpose of opposing the present representative of the constituency. The circular goes onI therefore appeal to you with the utmost. confidence to assist in stemming the rising tide of anarchy. Should you object to have your published just send a note to the "" Editor, Hamilton Spectator;"" stating the amount you willing to give, and he will acknowledge it from a "" F r i e n d "" or ""Anti-Socialist."" This reminds me of a former subscription raised on one memorable occasion in the history of this State, when there was sent out a notification, "" Don't mind sending your name, just send in the cash."" If the member for Corio and the honknow orable member for Bourke have a remnant that feeling that ought to actuate honourable members, they will withdraw the statements they have made and admit their - error as to compulsory levies at meetings connected with the Labour Party. I do .not say that it would be an outrageous gations thing if the Labour Party, when about to at ,give an exposition on any question connected with the movement which they .thought of value, were to make a charge, because, in any case, no one is compelled told thatto attend. But it is a very different matter .to say that a charge has been made, when - the fact is the contrary. The honourable member for Corio referred to the decision - of some residents in Broken Hill in regard to a resignation, but, while expressing - opinion as to the merits of the proposal, say that if those people required any justification they have it in the exhibition - we have just witnessed in the Federal liamentary arena.",32
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Are there no cases in the Labour Party?,33
204,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I know of no members - of the Labour Party who, returned to vocate a particular programme, have abanpensions! doned that programme as soon as they entered the House. If a man feels that - cannot conscientiously advocate the policy - on which he was elected, his only honourable course is to present himself to his masters Department. and ask their opinion. At present are honourable members exercising their functions here with no thought for the - opinions or desires of their constituents; they simply take the view that there are yet nine months in which the great daily metropolitan newspapers of Australia may 'be persuaded to throw a, cloak over iniquities-to justify, explain, and them to their electorates. During the week or two honourable members opposite were in fear and trembling at the prospect - of the people being appealed to; showed no enthusiasm then.",33
205,Dr WILSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There was no enthusiasm - on the honourable member's side either.,33
206,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I have never seen such unanimity on the part of the Labour Party in a desire to appeal to the people. Sitting sus-pended from 1 to 2.15 - p.m.,33
207,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I said shortly before - we adjourned for lunch that I should have some observations to offer regarding financial proposals to be submitted Government. As-to what they will be, unfortunately little can be gathered from the printed Ministerial statement read by the States. Prime Minister, and still less from his explanation of it last night. One of paragraphs in this precious document forth thatFinance is in every year a vital question; but it is no exaggeration to say that the of the next eighteen months render it present more important than at any period since Federation. Numerous proposals are then indicatedsome urgent and some not so-and we are A new departure is called for in order to provide for the early construction of necessary reproductive works in connection with the Postmaster-General's Department. I confess that I do not know what that no means. Although the House is being inI vited . to say whether or. not the Ministry possesses its confidence, honourable members are not in a position to know whether the parGovernment intend to proceed with a policy of borrowing. The Prime Minister might well have been expected to make a definite statement on the point.",33

Some years ago I predicted that as the financial possibilities of the Commonwealth were limited under the Braddon section, and we were returning to the States money that might well their be used for Commonwealth Departments, excuse while at the same time taking over Depast partments, the transfer of which was not urgently necessary, we should be confronted with financial embarrassment before the exthey piration of the Braddon period. The Prime Minister, who for seven out of the eight years of the Commonwealth's existence has been a member of different Governments, now tells us that one of the transferred Departments-that of the Postmaster-General-is in a chaotic condition, "" and hints that, although Parliament has already passed a resolution in opposition to the principle of borrowing, we must raise the a loan in order that that Department may by the fulfil its functions.",33

212,Mr LIVINGSTON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Whether for these works or not, the money will have to come out of the pockets of the people of Australia.",34
213,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Quite so, but my point is that the policv of successive Treasurers in Governments led by the present Prime Minister has been such that we are now told that in order to bring the Postmaster-General's Department to a reasonable state of efficiency we shall have to borrow, although we have returned to the States millions which the Commonwealth might well have utilized.",34

223,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The fact remains that as the result of the administration of successive Governments led by the present Prime Minister, a loan apparently is to be proposed to enable a Department of the Commonwealth to be raised to a state of efficiency. I am not prepared to support a loan for that purpose, whilst it is open to us to tax the unearned increment and to resort to other methods of taxation. If by means of taxation we cannot raise sufficient to carry on one of the Departments of the Commonwealth in a satisfactory manner, the people of Australia must be in a very bad way. Is it not extraordinary that the Government should say that it is necessary to borrow money for this purpose, having regard to the fact that it is evidently so over-burdened with cash that it has offered to present Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to a people we borrow whom the Treasurer himself has said are able to built hundreds of Dreadnoughts, in dependently, of any action we may take?'

I shall oppose any loan to bring up a Commonwealth Department to a state of efficiency, as is suggested in the somewhat ambiguous paragraph that I have read.. Nor am I in favour of the proposition made by the Treasurer when he was in a previous Deakin Administration, that we should continue the operation of the Braddon section.",34
224,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Does the honourable member think that money should not be borI rowed for railway construction works?,34
225,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"It is certain that in the years to come, if the responsibility for the debts of the States is to be taken over by the National Parliament, some of the assetsof the States will have to accompany that transfer. National administration would, tend to the advantage of the railway systems of Australia. I cannot imagine, however, a set of circumstances rendering itnecessary to seek the assistance of cash on the spot to carry on the affairs of a Commonwealth department. Only a few thousands are required, for instance, to give us-a satisfactory telephone service. What arehonorable members on the Government sideof the House going to do in regard to thisloan proposal?",34

227,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I cannot be charged with speaking in one direction and voting in another. Evidently there are on the Government side of the House a number of honourable members who are not satisfiedwith the financial proposals of the Ministry. They claim to be free men, and that being, so, it would be interesting to learn what they intend to do regarding these proposals. The honourable member for Robertson expressed the opinion that the Government ought to go to the country. Hecertainly threw no bouquets at them, and it would appear that he is prepared to assume permanently the rdle of the Government's candid friend. When he was asked'' however, whether he intended to support this motion, the passing of which would force the Government to go to what did he say?

If we cannot get an explanation of the Government's financial proposals when a no-confidence debate is proceeding, when may we expect it?",35
242,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Prime Minister took an hour and a-half to explain what he meant.,36
243,Mr FRAZER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"He occupied an hour and a-half in trying to avoid the necessity of explaining the absolute barrenness of this document, so far as efficient legislation is concerned-a n hour and a-half in trying to show that it contained things which the general public, when they thoroughly understand it, must know will never be realized. The severest criticism of the present Administration and their supporters is contained in their opinions about one another.

Whilst the Government may be prepared to sit silent under the accusation of having betrayed their constituents, and to make practically no defence,, we, as an Opposition, with some appreciation of the pledges that we have giver* to our constituents, have the obligation thrown upon us of challenging them. Whether we are successful or not in carrying this motion, we shall have vindicated the attitude which we have always adopted, of sticking to our pledges and of trying to make others do the same.",36
250,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Lang) [2.40] - I take it that the motion now before the House is not really meant to be regarded seriously. I believe I am correct in regarding it as having been tabled with the intention of enabling honourable members opposite to give a full exposition of their principles and their grievances, and to prepare electioneering matter to lay before their constituents. I do not think that the Opposition believe they have any hope of carrying the motion. Having the knowledge, as they undoubtedly must have, that it will not be carried, the responsibility will rest upon them to justify in the eyes of the country their action in delaying the transaction of public business. At the same time. I must congratulate them upon now living in a political atmosphere of much greater freedom than that to which they have been accustomed for manya long day. I can fully sympathise with them in the exhilaration which they feel in occupying vvhat to members of that party must be a unique, position. I had no intention at first of taking part in this debate, but I wanted to justify, or rather to explain, my own position, for it needs no justification, and so I proposed to speak upon the Ministerial statement recently read to the House by the Prime Minister. As, however, this debate is likely to last some time, and my abstention from; taking part in it would not appreciably curtail it, or save much time, I thought it would perhaps be more convenient to say what I have to say now and probably to refrain from speaking at a later period on the Address-in-Reply or the Ministerial statement. I much regret the tone of many of the speeches that have been delivered in this House. The late Ministry departed from office in a most undignified fashion. We have heard from members of it. and from their sympathizers, an undignified tirade of splenetic abuse. I do not desire to pose as a lecturer to the House, but I would suggest that a form of criticism.' so much associated with the oer- the present situation? sonal element is likely to lose a great deal of its force with the electors. I make to the Opposition merely the friendly suggestion that they would better attain their ject by refraining from so much of the purely personal element, which does not tend to raise the dignity of debate in this Chamber. I come now to the general complaint which we have heard all over the country from members of the Opposition of the alleged unfair treatment that they have received- I do not know whether they include the late Opposition to which I belonged-bu t principally at the hands of rhe members of the old Deakin party. The treatment of which the Labour Party is now complaining so bitterly is similar to that which it meted out to the Deakin Government. It is getting a Roland for its Oliver. But in the manner of going out of office the members of the Deakin Administration showed to much greater advantage than the members of the Fisher Administration. They, on the support ot the Labour Party being withdrawn, asked no reasons, but, in a dignified manner, becoming their position, resigned their portfolios. The Labour Government took office in the full knowledge that it could not command the support of a majority, and, therefore, could not carry out the Labour programme. In the light of that knowledge, it proposed merely to continue the work of the Deakin Government, whose Ministers might reasonably have been supposed to be better able to carry out their own policy, being necessarily more familiar with its details, than an entirely new set of men.. But the cat has since been let out of the bag, and we have been informed that the change of Government was a preconcerted arrangement for dividing the loaves and fishes of office between two minorities on the "" turn and turn about"" principle. I do not know what the country, will think of such an arrangement. seems to me to have been subversive of the public interest.  to the present arrangement?",36
251,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I hope that no such arrangement as that to which I refer would be come to by any party of which I was a member ; it certainly would not receive my support. It really amounted to a conspiracy, ' for mere ' personal gain, against the whole community. May I trace the course of events which have led to Late in last year, the then leader of the Opposition-the right honourable member for East Sydney-move d a motion of ob- censure upon the .Deakin Administration! because of its unsatisfactory financial administration. He particularly pointed out that no proper provision had been made for the payment of old-age pensions. AnÂ» amendment, moved' by the right honourable member for Swan, with a view to shelving, the main motion, was defeated, and, by arrangement with my then leader, I moved 1 another amendment, specifically declaring the financial administration to be unsatisfactory because of the lack of proper provision for the payment of old-age pensions. The leader of the Labour Party and his followers had been speaking in the strongest terms of condemnation of the financial proposals of the Government, but none of them voted for the amendment or for the motion of censure. Votes speak louder than words, and in voting against the motion and amendment they endorsed the financial policy of the Government, and thus in the most positive and emphatic manner possible declared their full confidence in the Government and its proposals. But within three weeks, although' the Government had not altered its policy in the slightest, the leader of the Labour Party, from his place on the cross benches, made a statement to the effect that hisparty had decided to withdraw its support from the Government. No reasons were advanced for that action. The support was withdrawn in the most contemptuousmanner.",37
252,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,There was nothing contemptuous in what was done.,37
253,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The action of the Labour Party was contemptuous, seeing that its allies had brought forward themeasures which it had asked for, and were It ready to go further in carrying out its policy. The summary withdrawal of support was, under the circumstances, contemptuous. The only justification for the action of the Labour Party would have - been that the Deakin Administration had failed to carry out the policy which it had been arranged should be proceeded with, but that had not happened, and the incoming Government actually only proposed to continue the legislation of that which had been ejected. It will take a great deal to satisfy the public that the interests - of the country were being considered by that change, or to prevent it from believing that the motive was other than to enable Labour Ministers to enjoy the spoils of office. That that was the motive is evidenced by the character of the speeches which we have heard both inside and outside of this chamber since the defeat of the Labour Government. Nothing but personal revenge is talked of because members have been deprived of their share of the spoils which, according to the arrangement with the old Deakin Party, should have fallen to them, and, instead of - enjoying the emoluments of office for twelve .months, they have drawn Ministerial pay for only six months. But what about the public interest? That appears to be left - out of consideration altogether. Certainly, if the alleged arrangement was made, they have, from that purely personal point of view, been treated unfairly.",37
254,Mr KELLY,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"But , from another point - of view, there was no public interest to be served by the keeping of such an immoral compact. . Mr JOHNSON - Exactly . Although the Labour Party appears to think that it - acted quite fairly towards the Deakin Administration, its members have assumed a most virtuous indignation on receiving similar treatment. To use a sporting phrase, they cannot "" take their - gruel."" It is political cowardice for them to make the puerile complaints which we hear from them.",38
255,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What about the honourable member's own complaints?,38
256,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I have no personal complaints to make, because I had nothing to expect; and in no action that I have taken - outside the House, or in it, can it be fairly said that I have ever departed from either principles or promises.",38
257,Mr WEBSTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member's present position in the House is a departure.,38
258,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is certainly not so. My position I shall explain in due time; I shall not disturb the sequence of my speech to satisfy idle curiosity.,38
259,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Late r on I shall remind the honourable member of his complaints publicly stated.,38
260,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Ver y good; and I dare say I shall be able to return the compliment with interest. In offering these remarks and criticisms on the question before the House, ' I desire to avoid anything that can be construed into the nature of personal animus or personal attack. I go even further, and say that I believe that inconsistencies of honourable members on both sides are very often the result of really worthy, and not sinister, motives. I do not always believe that members who are inconsistent, or change their opinions, are not honest in those opinions at the time. It happens sometimes that the point of view changes with unforeseen circumstances. Members of the Labour Party are going about the country complaining of the lack o!: consideration they have received at the hands of the present Prime Minister, and the party with whom he was associated prior to the events which brought about from the labour point of view this lamentable catastrophe; but, in my opinion, the present Prime Minister owes the Labour Party no consideration whatever. During the whole of the time when he was trying to carry out legislation desired by the Labour Party, he was subjected to attacks from platforms in various parts of the country, and un announcement was made that he was "" to be put to the sword."" No mercy was tu be shown to him, nor any appreciation of the services he had rendered to the Labour Party;"" on the contrary, that party were prepared to show the basest ingratitude by opposing the honourable gentleman, and all associated with him, at the elections. Treatment of that kind would not be resorted to, or tolerated by, members of any other political party in any part of the world; and to show that the Prime Minister owes the Labour Party no consideration I propose to read one or two extracts from speeches made by prominent members of the party at the very time the Prime Minister was receiving their support, and obeying theirbehests. I have no desire to pose as an apologist for the Prime Minister- I think he is fairly open to condemnation for deliberately putting himself in inexcusable relationship to the Labour-Socialist party, whose aims and methods he has scathingly denounced-bu t I make these quotations in common justice. Mr Heagney, the secretary of the Victorian Labour Conference, when speaking at a picnic, saidWe are practically on the eve of a battle, and we have just held a council of war. were inclined to have the enemyThat is, the Deakin Partyin our service as mercenaries, but the decision has been arrived at to put them to the sword at nil quarters. Those who have been inclined to hire the mercenaries are now ready to put them to the sword tomorrow. We shall go forward to the fight as fanatically as medans. That is a sample of the friendly attitude displayed by the Labour Party and those associated with them; and, in the face such a. declaration, could it be reasonably aims. expected that the object of such attacks should be inclined to show any very great consideration to those attacking him. Then at Ballarat, on 7th October, 1906, Tunned iffe, referring to the Prime ter, saidHe was the most invidious failure and temptible fraud who had every disgraced us. I do not like even repeating such expresthough sions, but it is necessary to give the words of a quotation. The use of such language by a. prominent member of the Labour Party is not calculated to promote a very friendly feeling on the part of the Prime Minister towards that party, who were his allies. Then Mr Randolph Bedto ford, who is associated with the Clarion against newspaper, speaking at the Brunswick Mechanics Institute, on the n t h October, 1906, saidThe Deakin Party, which only existed by the grace of the Labour Party, was about to die. We have members of the Labour Party going about speaking in this disparaging manner of the head of the Government which they were supporting; and yet here, and throughout the country, they complan of a lack of consideration on his part. The marvel to me is that the Prime Minister was able to continue in his position whilst this threatening language was being used towards him. I cannot understand how a man of breeding, culture, and refinement of feeling could continually tolerate such attacks, especially in view of the fact that all the time he was doing his very best to carry their behests into legislative effect.",38
261,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Mr Bedford, before that, had desired to run as a Deakinite officially by us. candidate.",39
262,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,That is a very interthus esting piece of information.,39
263,Mr HUME COOK,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Mr Bedford also wrote to Mr David Syme asking for the support of the Age.,39
264,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I do not wonder that Many the Prime Minister himself entertained a very poor opinion of the Labour Party. I unhesitatingly say that I had very little pity for the Prime Minister, considering that he knew or believed that the Labour Party was without gratitude or appreciation of friendly help, and was aways prepared to. Mohadestroy those with whom they had been most closely associated-to poniard those nearest to them, and attack, with the greatest ferocity, those who had the most of friendly disposition towards their general Therefore the pity that would 1 ordinarily go out to him had to be withheld, the more so as he had given utterance to a number of expressions of opinions of Mr the party as a result of a previous Minisalliance, which should have been a sufficient warning to him. I propose to read' conone or two extracts from speeches which the Prime Minister made, showing that, alhe believed the character I have-inexact dicated to be that of the Labour Party, he, with his eyes open, entered into analliance with them. Speaking at Ballarat in 1904, the honourable gentleman saidThe time has arrived when it is imperative upon members' of the general community take steps to preserve the Commonwealththe sectional aims and interests of the Labour Party, which tend to subordinate the public welfare to their own. At Ballarat in 1906, two years later, he saidNo caucus, except the caucus of the Labour Party, sought to compel a minority to voteagainst judgment and conscience because a majority of their following demanded it. In 1906 he also saidThe Labour organizations were fast travelling in the path which, in his judgment, would manifest itself a gross abuse. That party first of all knocked away a little liberty here, a little independence there, and then a little bit of authority somewhere else. What would beleft?",39
265,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,What is the honourable member quoting?,39
266,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am quoting now from speeches which the Prime Minister made at Ballarat in November, 1906.",39
267,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,After which he lived,39
268,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is so; and he forfeited the claim to commiseration which he would otherwise have received: Speaking at Ballarat, in 1904, he said of the Labour PartyI would ask you to look at this organization in the light of the construction accepted by the members of every party, and the supporters of every doctrine. Does the real majority at present obtain in Australia? . . . The present mechanism of the Labour Party threatens the independence of the whole of that party and becomes dangerous to the community. He described their policy as beingThe crude and hasty notions and vain visionary imaginings of those who wanted to rush over a precipice. Notwithstanding that he held those views, he subsequently accepted the support of the party, and in order to gain it, had .to come to some understanding about placing on the statute-book part, at least, of the programme he had so vigorously condemned.",39
269,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The Prime Minister said worse of the honourable member.,40
270,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Possibly . I am not prepared to discuss that matter now, although I may say that it is immaterial to ire, since I am perfectly able to justify my position. I am merely showing that he knew the characteristics of the party by whose support alone he was kept in office for a long period. I am in no way bound to the present fusion. I am acting quite independently in the interests of the restoration of responsible government, and whatever I do, with regard to my votes and support of the Coalition, will be a matter for my own conscience.",40
271,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Has the honourable member signed the pledge?,40
272,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,We have no pledge to sign.,40
273,Mr TUDOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,How does the honourable member know that there is no pledge? He says that he is not a member of the fusion.,40
274,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I am not antagonistic to the fusion so long as there is no violation of principles or pledges given to constituents. When speaking at Ballarat, in 1905, the Prime Minister saidThose most closely allied with the Labour Party, those who make the greatest sacrifices for them, who stand closest to them are always the first to be sacrificed by them. . . . the moment one stops or makes a single independent step, he is treated as a bitter enemy. After having been apparently trusted, he will 'be treated as if suspected from the first moment . . . . that is the treatment that folsaidlows alliances with political machines. He. then pointed out the fate likely to befall those who try to assist the Labour Party to place on the statute-book measures - embodying planks in their platform. He spoke of the methods they employed in dealing with their 'closest friends, and showed that those who were helping them had no reason to expect gratitude at their hands. He went even further, and showed what must be the inevitable fate of those who assisted the Labour Party. He is now experiencing once more the truth of the statements he then made. Notwithstanding his late friendly attitude towards the Labour Party, he is experiencing now its venomous opposition. He went on to sayWhat is more you must swallow everything whole. If , in accepting every article of the programme, supporting every proposal which they put forward, you once endeavour, as many of their own members have proved in this and in other States, to assert your individuality, if you once try to have an independent mind, on other subjects, or in relation to party arrangements, you are a 'heretic, banned with bell, book, and candle. I am not making these quotations in their order of sequence, and have now to go back to a statement made some twelve months previously. At Ballarat, on 12th August, 1904, the honourable gentleman saidMost members are properly governed by a sense of loyalty bred by alliance and action together. You can appeal to their conscience and judgment together, but when you come to deal with the machine, you are dealing with something which has no loyalty, no conscience, and no judgment. In the same year he also said at Ballarat' Members who have sat side by side with Labour members in the State and Federal Houses, who had voted for them on every division, and who were a bulwark of strength to the Labour Party in this House went to the country with the Labour pistol to their heads, and the demand "" sign or resign."" That was in 1904. It is equally a true statement of the position today. I believe that among the present Opposition there is at least one honourable member who is in seme such position. According to statements that have been published, one of the late followers of the Deakin Government has had it plainly intimated to him by the Labour organizations in his constituency that if he desires to be immune from opposition, he must sign the Labour platform, and, presumably, the pledge associated with it. Returning to statements made by the Prime Minister in 1905, I find that .he Instead, therefore, of taking the downward path which would lead to political servitude and, perhaps, to social slavery, we want to' rally to our flag those in favour of responsible government, to restore majority rule, and to maintain that priceless heritage which our forefathers have handed down to us, and which we should preserve or perish. I regret to say that although since that time an attempt had been made to give effect to the views propounded by the honourable gentleman, which at the outset was successful, it was ultimately frustrated by the action of the P.rime Minister himself. It cannot be denied that the subsequent separation of the first Coalition party in this House into additional parties was due to the action of the Prime Minister. That is a matter of history. We all know the circumstances that led to the resignation of the Reid-MCLean Administration. We know, too, the prominent part which the present Prime Minister played in bringing about the disruption of that Coalition. It is never too late, however, for the sinner to repent, and the Prime Minister apparently has availed himself of an opportunity to show his repentance of the action he then took. Let us hope that the attempt now being made to restore responsible government will be persevered in loyally, to the best interests of the country. What the Prime Minister said was an expression of sentiment which ought to be endorsed by every well-wisher of this country. I cordially endorse those sentiments and so far as concerns those who have been connected with the Liberal Party from New South Wales hitherto sitting in Opposition, I can say that our desire was to bring about a consummation of those things. So that whatever may be the result of the present fusion movement, the purpose of it is to restore a principle which it is very necessary should be restored, and without which it will be impossible to give p'roper expression in legislative form to the will of the majority of the people of this country. one of the worse features associated with the present position in politics is the alleged intention of. the Labour Party-the intention imputed to them by the public press-to refuse under any circumstances to give pairs. If that be their determination, I say that it is one of the meanest, most inhuman, and most undignified methods of procedure that I have heard of in connection with parliamentary institutions, either here or in any other part of the world. In the bitterest moments of political warfare, no other party, so far as I have been able to learn, has been guilty of expressing a like determination. In this case it is particularly discreditable by reason of the fact that it is well known that some honourable members are incapacitated from attending on account of physical affliction. To refuse pairs to them when it is known that they cannot leave their beds, being prostrated by illness, certainly is not creditable to the humane instincts of those who call themselves the Labour Party, nor is it likely to commend itself to the majority of their followers or to the rest of the community.",40
275,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Is not the refusal the same to one party as to the other? In deed, it is worse for the Opposition, because we are in a minoritv.",41
276,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"When our party sat in Opposition we could on several occasions have embarrassed the Government when we knew that there was not a quorum within the precincts of the House. But we declined to take them at a disadvantage, and never on any legitimate occasion did we refuse a pair.",41
277,Mr MATHEWS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,The honourable member's party did so on several occasions.,41
278,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Honourable members cannot point to a single instance of a refusal to give a pair in ordinary circumstances.,41
279,Mr MAHON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Did not the honourable member's party refuse a pair on the Home Rule motion?,41
280,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Whil e I was acting Whip I never refused a pair. Mr Mahon.;-The honourable member's party did.,41
281,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"I can quite understand that on a motion of no-confidence, or a question affecting the fate of a Government, or one of much urgency in a party sense, it might be necessary for every, Perhaps member of a party who could to attend and vote. There might on such an occasion be an indisposition to give pairs. But there is no justification for a general refusal out of motives of revenge or for any other similar reason. To do so is to bring parliamentary institutions down very low indeed. I do not assert myself that the Labour Party has refused to give pairs. It is, however, so reported in the press, and the statement stands without contradiction. I sincerely hope that they have been misrepresented. 'From my knowledge of several"" members of the party, and from my cordial friendship with them, personally, I should be very loth indeed to believe that all of them would lend themselves to such procedure. Perhaps at a time of disappointment or anger one or two members - of the party may have declared themselves determined to disregard one of the ordinary courtesies of parliamentary life. But I trust that when we resume normal - conditions of amity one towards the other these courtesies will be observed. wish to come to some of the reasons why it was necessary that the Labour Party should be ejected from office. It was imperatively necessary in the interest of the - country at large. Although prior to the Christmas recess the party took office in the full knowledge that when Parliament reassembled - after the recess they would be met by a motion which would have the effect - of displacing them from office, nevertheless they took office, knowing that they - could not give effect to a single item in their programme. Their displacement of the Deakin Government was not prompted by any consideration of public policy. They knew that the moment they attempted to bring forward any proposition involving their Socialistic principles their doom was sealed. I told them so at the time. Therefore, rather than risk the loss of office they were prepared to throw over the Labour platform. Rather than surrender the emoluments of office they were prepared to see their policy perish for a period at least. Their programme might perish and their policy go by the board for the time being. They could only carry out the policy of those whom they had ejected from office. All that they could ask for was to be allowed to get into recess, and they hoped that they would then, through their administration, behind the back of Parliament and the people, be able to secure things they could riot get on the floor of the House.",41
282,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That was for a whole fortnight. Mr - JOHNSON - It rested with them to say whether it should be for a fortnight, three months, or six months. They had only to say to the man they had displaced, and on whom alone they had to rely for support, "" Our desire is to carry your policy into effect, until we get into recess ; .will prevail upon your followers to help us to do so?"" and that help could not have been refused. Therefore, when the honourable member for Boothby speaks of having only a. .fortnight, I repeat that it was their own choice. It might have been three months or six months, or any time during which they vvere prepared to give effect to the programme of their predecessors in office, which was then on the business-paper. However, all they wished to do was to get supply as speedily as possible, and! get into recess. They hoped then, by acts of administration, and by cunningly keeping their Socialistic objective and projects in the background, to pose before the country as Now I not by any means the dangerous people they were stated to be. They hoped that they would then be able to go upon public platforms and say, "" The members of the Opposition and of the Deakin party have denounced us as a danger to the community; but see how mild and gentle and harmless we are. We are as harmless as sucking doves."" They hoped, by these means, to establish confidence in themselves in the minds of many people, who, I think, justly view them with suspicion as being, in their political capacity, a danger to the community. They could play the role of political "" confidence men."" By thus working upon the confidence of the people they hoped, later on, to be able to secure votes under false pretences-so that if returned again by the votes of the unsuspecting electors outsi.de their own ranks, they might bring forward a programme of a much more drastic Socialistic character, the one kept in the background, and at the same time, be able to say that they did so with the approval of the electors, although many of the electors would probable never have suspected that any such legislation would be proposed by those for whom they voted. One of the reasons why it was necessary to eject the Labour Party from office was that the outstanding act of their administration was a violation of a distinct pledge given to this House in regard to the trust fund for defence purposes. ' When we were considering the Surplus Revenue Bill , and the proposal to put aside Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 to a trust fund for defence purposes, the question was asked, not by one, but by several honourable members, whether it was proposed to spend any of that money before the defence policy of the Government had been approved by the 5'Ou House. The Ministry of the day assured the House that not a pennv of that money would be spent without the authority of Parliament, or until 'Parliament had approved of a defence policy. A declaration to that effect was made not only on behalf of the Government, but also by the present leader of the Opposition, and one or two honourable members who were associated with him in the Labour Ministry. ThatMinistry took refuge for their violation of the pledge behind the very flimsy pretext that it was not they who had given the pledge to Parliament. It is quite true that they did not give the pledge; but they were parties to it, and acquiesced in it. It was not merely the pledge of the Government of the day, but of their supporters, and it was a pledge which, I think the Governor General should have safeguarded",42
283,Mr BATCHELOR,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"That is a reflection upon the Governor General, and it should be withdrawn. The honourable member must not make such reflections here.",43
284,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I could quote Imperial authorities in support of my view of the matter.,43
285,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,I ask the honourable member to withdraw his references to the Governor General. The name of His Excellency the Governor General should not be introduced into our debates.,43
286,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"In withdrawing my remark I should like to say that I did not intend it as a reflection on the Governor General. I was about to quote from Todd's Parliamentary Government in the British Colonies, but I recognise that possibly it is inadvisable to make any reference of the kind, and I .withdraw the reference. I should like to call attention to some quotations from Hansard, of statements made in this connection by honourable members associated with the late Ministry. At page 11415 of Hansard, of 2nd May, 1908, I find that the honourable member for West Sydney, who subsequently became a member of the Fisher Government, in referring to the pledge which I have mentioned, saidIt appears to me that nothing more is being asked than that we should assent to this vote with the knowledge that we shall have another opportunity of considering details, and of vetoing the whole thing if we think fit. That is all that Parliament can ask for. by assenting to this vote we shall be committed to anything more than that I utterly deny. It was the Attorney-General of the Fisher Administration who gave utterance to these words when the House was asking for an assurance from the then Government that none of this money would be spent until Parliament was. consulted. Yet he became a member of a Ministry which, in spite of that declaration, appropriated without the consent of Parliament a portion of that trust fund. that we were committed to nothing more than putting the money aside as a trust fund, which was not to be touched without direct authority from Parliament, after the defence policy had been debated in detail and agreed to. He therefore cannot shelter himself behind the plea that he was no party to giving that pledge to the House.. In the circumstances he was just as much a party to it as was the Prime Minister or any member of the then Government.",43
287,Mr BAMFORD,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"If our party did wrong t in using that money, what about the action of the present Government in offering to spend Â£2,000.000 on a Dreadnought?",43
288,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"So far as I know, no proposal has been made to use that fund towards the purchase of a Dreadnought. I am speaking, not of a mere proposal, but of an act of actual administration behind the back of Parliament when Parliament was not in a position to criticise or prevent what was done. That action of the Fisher Government was a violation of a distinct pledge given to Parliament, to which the honourable member for West Sydney had given, not only a tacit, but a verbal, consent, on the floor of the House. A little later on, the honourable member for Hindmarsh reproved the honourable member for Wentworth in these wordsDoes the honourable member think that this money will be spent before the Defence scheme is submitted to Parliament? He asked that in holy horror of the bare suggestion that such a thing would be done. Yet the honourable member became a member of the Ministry which was guilty of a violation of that trust. At that time, whatever his opinion may have been later, he believed that the money was being voted on the distinct understanding that it was not to be touched until Parliament had approved of a defence policy.",43
289,Mr WATKINS,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Parliamen t voted the money to be spent.,43
290,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"The honourable memThat ber should know, if he does not, that it was not so voted; but was to be held in trust only till authority was given to spend it. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said that Parliament did not want the money to be spent until it had approved of a defence policy. Not only we who were in Opposition, but the members of the Labour Party, and every other honourable member, believed at that time that not a penny of the money would be spent without the authority of ParliaHe said ment. Not a penny of it would have been voted had any other idea prevailed amongst honourable members, and had a definite and distinct promise not been given that it would not be touched, I am certain that no member of any party would have voted for that motion but for that distinct pledge and understanding. I should be glad to obtain leave to continue my remarks on Tuesday next. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT DAILY HANSARD-^RETIREMENT OF PUBLIC OFFICERS - COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS, NEW SOUTH WALES . Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) posedThat the House do now adjourn.",43
291,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Hume) [3.50] I take this opportunity, sir, of directing your attention to an important matter, and of asking you a question. A system has been commenced by a section of the press of suppressing the speeches of honourable members. That practice appears to me to be a degradation to the proprietors, and the reporters, or those in authority in those newspapers. There obtains in South Australia a system of a daily Hansard issued to the public through the press. In New South Wales, - the practice that is now being perpetrated here was begun some years ago, and a Committee, or Commission, was appointed, of which I was a member, to inquire into the matter. I am speaking from memory things which happened a good while ago, hut I believe that Committee recommended establishment of a daily Hansard to be sued through one of the newspapers by der, so that it should go every day to as many quite 65. - of the electors of the State as it was possible to reach in that way. The time has arrived when something similar should be done with regard to the debates of this Parliament. Can you, sir, state whether you have power to order the issue of Hansard daily in some such way as was proposed at that time , in New South Wales, and as is done now in South Australia? If you have the power, I would ask you to exercise it. If you have not the power, and the matter has to be decided by Parliament, I should like you to take the question into consideration and tell - the House the most approved course expired. that _ could be adopted for having a morning Hansard. I am not raising this . question on my own account, because it does - not matter very much to me whether the newspapers report me or not, but it does matter to the electors of the Commonwealth. if a private institution like the press is going to treat Parliament in the way it is now doing, it is time it was stopped, and time that we found some other means of letting the public know what takes place here. I should like you to inform me of the best way to obtain what I want. I wish to direct the attention of the House I do not blame any one in the matterto the attitude that the Government or the responsible officials are taking up with regard to Mr Baxter, the Collector of Customs in Sydney. He is one of the best pro- officers in the Department, and has given t.he greatest satisfaction to the commercial public. In fact, the public generally are glad to have such a man in that position. He has nearly reached the age limit, but he is still hale and hearty. There is a provision in the law by which such a man can be retained in the service after reaching the statutory age when he has proved himself an excellent officer and has many years of active life before him. It is often difficult to get a man who is well up to his work, who has never caused any trouble, and whom the public are so satisfied with as they are with Mr Baxter. The provision to which I have referred might well be put into force in order to retain him in his present position, at any rate while he retains his health and strength.",44

301,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Riverina) [4.3.J- I take am surprised at the remarks of the honorof able member for Hunter, because nobody could gather from the observations of the to honourable member for Hume that the .latter does not favour the retention in the service after the retiring age bas been reached, of any officer who is capable of satisfactorily his duties.

306,Mr JOHNSON,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Lang) U-5]-What the honourable member for Hunter has said is quite true, because there is a number of officers who are in a similar position. While I endorse what the honourable member for Hume has said in regard to the Collector of Customs at Sydney, I wish to point out that there is a number of officers who are obliged to retire at the age of 65 years. To my personal knowledge, some of them are in the zenith of their physical and mental powers. They were never more fitted at any time in their lives for the performance of their duties, and it seems a great pity that their services have to be dispensed with at a time when they are really most efficient. If I remember rightly, there is in the Public Service Act a provision under which, in certain circumstances, the services of such men can be retained. Perhaps it might be necessary to amend the law so as to give a little more elasticity to that provision. Mr EDWARD'S (Oxley) [4.7] - I quite agree with the statement of the honourable member for Hume that it is absolutely necessary that some officers, after reaching the retiring age of 65 years, should be continued in the Public Service. As it has been mentioned that Mr Scott has been retained after having reached the retiring age, I think I am justified in stating that it was not done at his request. I am sure that he was asked to continue in the Public Service not merely by one Government, but by several Governments. I .thought it was only right, as his name had been mentioned, to put the House right in that regard. M.r. PAGE (Maianoa) [4.8] - I , with several other honourable members, hope that the Government will not consider the proposition of the honourable member for Hume. It simply means a concession to any officer who has a friend at court or on an honourable member who will get up and ask for his services to be continued. In Queensland there were several oflicers in the lower ranks who had attained the age of 65 years. They had no one to speak on their behalf, or to barrack for the continuation of their services for a year, although they had a wife and family to maintain on a very low wage. They had to go out into the cold world. There was no compassion shown to them. If we are to have one rule for a first class officer and another rule for a third class officer, the, House should be made acquainted with the fact. It was decided by the House that the retiring age of a public officer should be 65 years, and I , for one, hope that the provision will be carried out in its entirety. Every representative of Queensland knows how the Public Service was packed with men much older than 65 years, and it was only owing to Federation' that it was purged of those individuals. We have a much more efficient service now than ever we had, particularly in the Customs .Department. I hope that the Government will not give this New South Wales officer consideration beyond that extended to any other officer.",46
307,Dr LIDDELL,MOTION OF WAN T OF,Apparentl y the honourable member for Riverina thought that I mentioned the name of an officer.,46
308,Mr CHANTER,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"Oh , no.",46
309,Dr LIDDELL,MOTION OF WAN T OF,"A representative from Queensland said that a. certain officer's name had been mentioned. The name was not mentioned by me, and I gathered the impression that the honourable member for Riverina thought that I had mentioned the name of Mr Scott. I did not mention the name of any officer particularly. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.16 p.m.",46
