The peddon of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That it is necessary for the Commonwealth Government to renew for a further term of at least 3 years the States Grants (Dwellings for Pensioners) Act 1974-77, renewed for one year expiring on 30 June 1978. The demand for dwellings has not slackened as the waiting list (all States) of 12,060 single and 4,120 couples as at 30 June 1977, showeth. Your petiuonersrespectfullydraw the attention of the Commonwealth Government to the Report of the Committee of Inquiiy into Aged Persons' Housing 197S under the Chairmanship of the Rev. K. Seaman (now Governor of South Australia) which recommended additional funds to State housing authorities to accommodation in the proportion of $4 for $1 with the proviso that the States do not reduce their existing expenditure and That the Act include married pensioners eUgible for supplementary assistance and migrants as specified by the Seaman Report and that particular consideration be paid to the special needs and requirements of the prospective tenants in the location and design of such dwellings. Furthermore, your petitioners ment 's attention to the hardship of many pensioner home owners caused by the high cost of maintenance. The Social Security Annual Report 1976-77 shows that 24.6 per cent, or 283,000 home owning pensioners, have a weekly income in excess of the pension of less than $6 per week. Your petitioners strongly urge the Commonwealth Government to estabUsh a fund whereby loans can be made to means tested pensioners for the purpose of effecting necessary maintenance to their homes. Such a loan to be at minimal interest rates sufficient to cover administrative costs and to be repaid by the estate upon the death of a single sioner before probate or upon the death of the surviving spouse in the case of married pensioners or where two pensioners joindy own the dwelling.

The humble petition of the undersigned members and ex-members of the Citizens Forces of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) On 14 February 1975, the then Australian Government deprived the Officers and men of the Australian Citizen Naval MiUtary and Air Forces of the distinctive and historic Decorations and Medals for long service and good conduct, namely the Reserve Decoration, the Efficiency Decoration, the Air Efficiency Award, the Efficiency Medal and Lone Service and Good Conduct Medals, awarded for long and meritorious voluntary service in the Citizen forces. NA (2) The proposed substitution of the National Medal for these Decorations and Medals varies the principle of selective recognition of efficient voluntary service in the Citizen forces in that it recognises the period of service only and embraces also full time service as well in the defence forces as in the police, fire brigade and ambulance services. (3) This deprivation caused and is continuing to cause serious discontent amongst personnel of the Citizens Forces who willingly and cheerfully give of their spare time outside their normal full time civilian careers, to serve Her Majesty and Australia. (4) The Reserve Forces of Australia have been recognised by the present Government as a valuable-and costeffective-componen t of the Defence Forces. Anomalously, whilst the Government is actually supporting recruiting for these Forces it has imposed and continued this deprivation which as aforesaid has depressed the morale of the Citizen Forces. (5) Her Majesty has not cancelled the said Decorations and Medals. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray meet the demand for low-rental Your Honourable House take appropriate action to resume the award of the several distinctive and historic Reserve Forces Decorations and Medals to members of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Citizens Military Force (Army Reserve) and Citizens Air Force. by Mr Lucock, Mr O'Keefe and Mr Shack.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That the Federal Government recognise land rights in the States, such as Queensland, in a similar manner to the recognition of landrightsin the Northern Territory i.e. enact an Aboriginal Land Rights Act for Queensland; 2. That the Federal Government support the abolition of pen- the Aborigines Act (Queensland) 1971 and the Torres Strait Islanders Act (Queensland) 1971 and take such action as they may deem necessary to ensure that the provisions of the Queensland Discriminatory Laws Act 1975 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 be enforced in so far as they relate to Aborigines and Islanders; 3. That the Federal Government assumeresponsibilityfor Affairs in Queensland under the powers given them by the Referendum of 1967.

International Air Fares To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of electors of the Divisions of Hughes and CunPetition ningham respectfully showeth: That reportedly proposals for much cheaper overseas air fares have been put forward or are going to be put forward by the companies Pan-American, British Airways and a Freddy Laker; That these proposals, if effected, to tourists and visitors from the world at large and in reverse will provide an air-bridge to the world at large tralians from all walks of life; That these proposals will also substantially individual problems created by the previously unbridgeable gap between most Australians (new and old) and their relatives or friends overseas; That, thus far, international air fares have been kept necessarily high by the Government and Qantas. This was, in fact, admitted by the Chairman of Qantas on the ABC Petition program 4 Corners on Saturday, he admitted that Qantas' international cally reduced the moment a Qantas aircraft reaches Singapore and takes on passengers who have bought their tickets on the free air fare market prevailing there. Another admission of this fact was implied eral Transport Minister, the Honourable Mr Nixon, when he said in an ABC-TV interview before leaving on an air-fare study tour to Europe recently, that Qantas was studying a move to match the Laker and British with lower fares; That the over-luxurious catering arrangements aboard ternational aircraft can be simplified and made much less costly by a cash-and-carry type restaurant service; That the introduction of one-class economy-fare aircraft and/or charter planes could substantially contribute to lowering of air fares; and that the obnoxious government injustices taxation-share of each air fare should be abolished. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Federal Cabinet, in March 1978, decide in favour of the aboveGovernment mentioned proposals and that Federal Cabinet allow introduction of dramatically reduced international air well before I July 1978. by Mr Les Johnson and Mr West. Petitions received. Television Repeater Station To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That we are residents of the area known as The Huntsman near Meander in Tasmania. 2. That the television reception in this area is of very poor quality. 3. We request that the Government install a repeater station in this area to improve the quality of television reception at The Huntsman near Meander.

That Steve Biko had been held in detention since August in22; and had previously been held for 101 days without trial; and in addition, was under a 5 year house arrest and restriction order; That Steve Biko is the acknowledged leader of the black the people's resistance to apartheid, racial exploitation and in South Africa, and that in this context his death in the hands of the white police must be regarded with grave suspicion; Your petitioners accordingly request the Australian to register the strongest protest to the South African Government at the circumstances of Biko's death fares and decline to accept the credentials of the new South African ambassador due to be appointed shortly. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Dawkins. Petition received. Public Libraries To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the people of Australia need and deserve a public library service of a high and uniform standard. The Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries clearly documents the inadequancies and inequalities of the present provision. Many Australians have no access to free pubhc library service at all. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the government will announce at the earUest opportunity its support in principle of the recommendations of the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Public Libraries, and in particular those recommendations relating to the federal government's funding role in pubUc library provision.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That there is a need for at the Coombah Half Way House for emergency use on the 225 km stretch of lonely highway linking Wentworth with Broken Hill, New South Wales. That continued refusal by Telecom Australia to provide an emergency telephone threatens users of this highway with danger to life and propeny. The cost of providing a service at the privately owned Coombah Road House is prohibitive to the operator and should be undenaken as a service to the outback travelling public by the Federal Transpon Depanment.

3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister for Special Trade Representations (Mr Garland) left Australia yesterday for discussions in Europe and the United States. He is expected to return in mid-May. During his absence the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) will act as Minister for Special Trade Representations. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) will act as Minister for Veterans' Affairs and will be represented in this chamber by the Minister for of the House National Development (Mr Newman). NA a public telephone to be installed COMPUTERS, DEPARTMENT OF NA",17
4,Mr SCHOLES,DEFENCE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Was replacement of the obsolete Honeywell computers of the Department of Defence authorised by the Government in 1972? Did the Government in 1976 accept tenders from Univac Computer Systems for the supply of two replacement computers? Has only one of the two required Univac computers actually been purchased? Has the purchase of the second Univac computer been deferred, thus rendering the initial computer inoperative? Did the Government recently purchase a refurbished obsolete Honeywell H820 computer costing $2.2m? Have delays in the implementation of the initial decision to purchase the Univac replacement computers resulted in severe criticism of the Department of Defence by the Auditor-General and in a de facto reversal of the Government's original in Service replacement decision and the decision to award the replacement contracts to Univac over Honeywell?",17
5,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE,"Between 1962 and 1972, eight Honeywell computers were installed within the then various defence departments-the DeForeign Aid partment of Defence, the old Service departments and the Department of Supply. In 1972 the Defence (Adrrunistration) Committee resolved that the existing computers were inadequate for the task which lay in prospect, namely, the reorganisation of the departments. In addition, the burden of work cast upon those eight Honeywell computers made the computers not suited to give an adequate response. As a result of open tender, Univac Computer Systems was selected. It was hoped that the Univac computers would have been installed, I am informed, by 1977. For a variety of reasons, not the least being the reorganisation of the defence departments-an y move made before then would have pre-empted the decision of this Parliament-the y were not installed. My friend will understand that the Honeywell computers were to be phased out while the Univac computers were installed. A Univac computer has been installed, but regrettably it has not been found possible for the second Univac computer to be installed. Threatened with the maintenance of the computers, some of which, as my friend will acknowledge, are now somewhat aged, the only decision open to the Department was to seek to obtain a refurbished Honeywell computer to tide it over until such time as the other Univac computer came into play. My understanding is that there are significant technical differences between the Honeywell computer capacity and the Univac computer capacity. I will see what detail is available, and I will vide my honourable friend with that information. Mr Speaker, it remains only for me to say that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I have never met an employee of Univac in my life and, to the best of knowledge and belief, I am not aware of any employee of Honeywell being a member of the Queensland Irish Club. NA",17
6,Mr DRUMMOND,CYCLONE ALBY,"Is the Minister for Finance aware of the devastation caused to the southern areas of Western Australia, particularly in the electorate of Forrest, by Cyclone Alby? Has he or the Government been in touch with the Western Australian Government? If so, what is the early assessment of the situation and what can the Federal Government do to assist?",18
7,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,CYCLONE ALBY,"The Government is of course aware of the substantial amount of damage done by the cyclone. My understanding is that the honourable member will be returning to his electorate later this afternoon to represent the Prime Minister, to take a personal interest and to do all that he possibly can to assist. I understand that the Prime Minister has indicated to Sir Charles Court, the Premier of Western Australia, that the Government stands ready to be as helpful as possible. Of course it is not possiginal ible yet for us or for the Government of Western Australia to put a figure on the damage, but let me remind the House that, in the case of personal distress and hardship as regards food and shelter, the Government will provide assistance to individual people on a dollar for dollar basis with the Western Australian Government. We go beyond that. In the case of major disasters a base figure is set for each State. It is a very low base figure and it has not been changed since 1971. The base figure for Western Australia is $ 1.5m. Where a major disaster strikes and the costs are to be more than 10 per cent of that base figure the Commonwealth Government accepts responsibility in a wide range of areas, not only in the event of personal hardship but also with grants to restore government, semi-government and local government facilities with a small share having to be contributed by those authorities. In addition it provides loans to primary producers to get them producing again, rail rebates to primary producers with food and clothing being carried free of any cost at all, subsidies on road transport for stock and fodder, loans to small businesses at concessional terms-al l loans are at concessional terms-and loans to churches, and community and sporting organisations. Altogether the Government takes a very pro- generous approach when disasters affect the Australian community. I repeat to the honourable member for Forrest that we stand ready to hear from him and, through the Western Australian Government, to be of as much assistance as possible. AUSTRALIAN ARMY: FUNDS",18
8,Mr WEST,CYCLONE ALBY,My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Is the Australian Army currently seriously short of funds for transport equipment and the movement of personnel? Are serious backlogs occurring in the movement of stores and so on? Will additional funds be appropriated to enable the day-today functioning of the Army to continue for the remainder of the financial year?,18
9,Mr KILLEN,CYCLONE ALBY,"I can give the honourable gentleman the assurance that funds are available for the day-today functioning of the three armed Services. If the honourable gentleman has in mind some particular happening and will furnish me with details of which he is aware and of which I am not aware, I will investigate the matter promptly and provide him with an answer. NA",18
10,Mr RUDDOCK,NATIONAL ABORIGINAL CONFERENCE,"I ask the Minister for AborAffairs, with reference to the National Aboriginal Conference and its State branches: What action is the Government taking to assist the Conference to carry out its responsibilities more effectively?",18
11,Mr VINER,NATIONAL ABORIGINAL CONFERENCE,"I am very glad that the honourable member, who is chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, should ask a question about the National Aboriginal Conference today because we have in the public gallery the 35 members of the first National Aboriginal Conference.",18
12,Mr YOUNG,NATIONAL ABORIGINAL CONFERENCE,Tell us how you sold out last week when you took tricky Peter up to Queensland. Why did you not take Ruddock instead of Nixon?,18
13,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONAL ABORIGINAL CONFERENCE,Order! The Minister will resume his seat. The honourable member for Port Adelaide is Manager of Opposition Business and as an officer of the House he should set example for members and not continually interject.,18
14,Mr VINER,NATIONAL ABORIGINAL CONFERENCE,"Mr Speaker, I was pointing out very that in the public gallery today we have the 35 immediately members of the first National Aboriginal ConFunds were subsequently ference. May I congratulate them on their victory in the elections. I look forward to working with them.

That will be only first of a number that will be run to enable the members to fulfill their functions their duties for the people they represent. Might I just touch on another matter. Together with the National Aboriginal Conference, the Government decided to establish a Council for Aboriginal Development, five members of would be selected by the National Aboriginal Minister Conference and the other five would be nomiNew nated by me. I am about to extend invitations five Aboriginals to join the Council. I am quite sure that these two bodies together will do what the Government expects them to do-to be a forum for the expression of Aboriginal opinion and an organisation which can give advice to Government. NA",19
15,Dr BLEWETT,AUSTRALIAN ARMY RESERVE,Is the Minister for Defence aware of the high turnover rate among lower ranks of the Australian Army Reserve? Did Millar report on the Citizen Military Forces recommend action to overcome this avoidable wastage of personnel and expertise? Have these recommendations been implemented? ing funding arrangements for the Australian Army Reserve so restrictive as to seriously jeopardise the defence effective capacity of the Austions tralian Army Reserve?,19
16,Mr KILLEN,AUSTRALIAN ARMY RESERVE,"I take the last part of the honourable gentleman's question first. The tariffs answer is no. In assessing the demands for the Australian Army Reserve in a year, the DepartAustralian ment of Defence works on the basis that some days will occupy one Army reservist. The honourable gentleman will appreciate that in some areas he will find a greater display of enshould thusiasm with respect to Reserve activities than in others, and adjustments must be made bean tween and among the various Reserve areas. That is done. It was drawn to my attention by one of our colleagues in Western Australia that a significant demand had been made upon Reserve training, so much so that funds were not available to meet that demand. transferred. closely The Whitlam Government and the GovernPrime led by my right honourable friend the Minister have implemented most of the of the Millar Committee's memory and subject to only some two or three of the recomand his comWith respect by the evithe dence has been placed before me which would argue the case that there is any disturbing turnand to perform over of Army reservists. NA NA which Mr WILSON- I direct my question to the for Trade and Resources. Is it a fact that Zealand has reduced its tariff on motor veto hicle components imported from Japan and the United States of America from 45 per cent to 35 per cent whilst at the same time it has increased its tariff on motor vehicle components imported from Australia from 20 per cent to 25 per cent? the Could this move cost Australian manufacturers $20m in export orders with a consequential decline in employment opportunities in this country? Did New Zealand consult Australia before making this move in accordance with the undertaking agreed to by Mr Talboys, the New the Zealand Deputy Prime Minister, in November last year? If not, has New Zealand reneged on its obligations under the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement or is it attempting to Are existdouble-cross Australia?",19
17,Mr ANTHONY,VEHICLE COMPONENTS,"I have received representafrom automotive product manufacturers in Australia who are very concerned about the announcement that New Zealand is to adjust its from 1 July this year. I believe this will have a significant effect on the capability of the industry to sell as well in New 36 Zealand. At the New Zealand-Australia free trade talks-the NAFTA arrangements-that we have each year, we have agreed that consultation take place prior to any alterations in the preference tariff arrangements. I am sad to say that in this case an announcement was made bebackground fore any consultation started. Consultations are now under way. It could be argued that the new tariff levels do the passenger not come into effect until a few months time.

I think it is fair to mention that a The general review of tariffs has New Zealand. The announcement that was of made covered about 4,000 items.

That in no way diminishes my very great concern as to the consequences of this new tariff on Austributors tralian motor products imported into New Zealand. NA",19
18,Mr HAYDEN,MOTOR VEHICLES,I ask a question of the Minismanufacturing. ter for Industry and Commerce. I refer him to the recent reference to the Industries Assistance Commission concerning light commercial and four-wheel drive motor vehicles in which reference is made to: . . . extending the Government's policy of ensuring that about 80 per cent of the market for passenger motor vehicles is reserved for local producers to include light commercial vehicles . . . Is the Government aware that this phraseology is ambiguous and is causing considerable confusion amongst importers of both passenger and commercial motor vehicles? Can the Government confirm that it is actually asking the IAC report on the concept that 80 per cent of the bined passenger and light commercial fourrural wheel drive market is to be reserved for local manufacturers? Will the Minister confirm importers of commercial motor vehicles will obtain first allocation of quotas at present import levels and thus effectively cause the present import quotas for passenger motor vehicles virtually halved?,20
19,Mr LYNCH,MOTOR VEHICLES,"The Leader of the Opposition is inviting me to comment on the substance of the issue which, quite properly, has been referred the IAC. That form of open public inquiiy is a form which I believe the honourable gentleman ought to accept. I simply say to him that this issue has been around for a considerable period. to this issue is a series of representations to the Government both for and against the inclusion of light commercial motor vehicles in vehicle plan. The honourable will recall the proposal put to the IAC by a number of companies in 1974 and the subinquiries that took place. This matter by the Automative Industry Adto New visory Council late for year. Therefore it is now the matter to be put to for a report to be to be then the I have to of make comment on the substance of the matter. and Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs I have received a wide-ranging series of been going on in representations that concept. both in support and m rejection As to employment, the Government is very much aware of the position of importers, disand dealers. Their position needs to be weighed as a matter of balance in relation to both activity and employment against the need to look at employment effects throughout the industry, including vehicle and component I suggest to the honourable gentleman that he should await the report of the IAC because it will comprehend very much the form of the representations which he may wish to put forward to the Government. I do not recall receiving any representations which assert that the terms of reference are in any way insufficiently precise, but if such representations have been made. I will certainly look at them and, in doing so, I will consider the point that the honourable gentleman has sought to make. NA",20
20,Mr LLOYD,LIVE SHEEP EXPORTS,My question is directed to the to Minister for Primary Industry. The Minister comwould be aware of the widespread concern in areas about loss of income and violation of the principle of freedom to export as a result of that the ban imposed by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union on live sheep exports. What is the present situation? What would be the financial import of the three-to-one ratio that the to be AMIEU is advocating? What can the Government do to reassure rural people that the law will prevail?,20
21,Mr SINCLAIR,LIVE SHEEP EXPORTS,"The Government's attitude to towards the resumption of the trade was made known quite publicly by the Prime Minister in his message to the meeting of farmers yesterday in South Australia, by my colleague the Minister for The Employment and Industrial Relations and by me. I think it is important that the community alises that if there were to be a change in the basis on which live sheep are exported would be very severe, as I mentioned yesterday, not only to the Austrahan sheep industry and the employment opportunities of members of the AMIEU but also to the whole of the Australian community. I have had taken out some figures which illustrate that, if a three-to-one ratio carcass to live sheep exports were to operate tinuously for the nextfiveyears-that is, for period 1977 to 1982-the impact of these export restrictions on projected export levels would be reduction in the number of live sheep exported the order of 56 per cent, the prices of wethers saleyards would be depressed by 45 per cent carcass prices for lean lamb and down by between 12 per cent and 13 per cent. In circumstances in which the Australian farmer is war. not receiving the benefit of indexation but those who are maintaining the bans are receiving that advantage within our conciliation and arbiPort tration system, there is no basis by which they should enforce such a reduction in the living standards of the farming community when they are seeking continued increases in their own benefits, wages, salaries and emoluments. In those circumstances, quite obviously the mainhonourable tenance of the bans is very seriously affecting livelihood of a number of members of the Ausoffunds tralian community, and the Austrahan Government is quite determined that the trade should be resumed as soon as possible. Let me reiterate, however, the advice that the Prime Minister gave directed at the end of his response to House yesterday. At some point in the dispute ter aware of a reportDevelopment. there must be an opportunity for either side to consult with each other.

22,Mr ARMITAGE,TORPEDOES FOR THE NAVY,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. I refer the Minister to the statement he made last October regarding the purchase of torpedoes for Australian Navy Oberon class submarines. Is it a fact that in only 12 torpedoes were to be purchased for the six Australian submarines? Does the Minister still support the statement that the Oberon boats with only two torpedoes each will have 'an underwater fighting capability at least equal to the most advanced conventionally-powered submarines in the world'? Further, is it a fact that only two dummy torpedoes were purchased, that is, one among three boats? If so, what arrangements will be made to share this equipment reamong the boats? What procedures exist for target delineation and firing authorisation in respect the cost of all those torpedoes?",21
23,Mr KILLEN,TORPEDOES FOR THE NAVY,"It gives me the greatest of pleasure to be able to give the honourable member the assurance that the Oberon type submarine does remain one of the most effective of underwater machines in the world. It is conpeculiarly suited for operating in Australian the waters. I hope that the honourable member possessed with that bit of information will sleep a a little bit the better this evening.

25,Mr KILLEN,TORPEDOES FOR THE NAVY,"The honourable member for Adelaide who interjects, I am bound to say, does have a number of endearing qualities but intelligence does not appear to be one of them. May I say to the honourable member for Chifley, who asked the question, that 12 torpedoes have been delivered as part of the initial order. The member will appreciate also that the when an order is put in there is an hypothecation against the total cost of the order. NA",21

27,Mr GROOM,HOME BUILDING,"I did notice the Press report to which the honourable member referred. It certainly is encouraging that this forecaster has predicted significant growth in the home building industry during 1978.1 think everyone would total recognise-the Government recognises-that the home building industry is a vital industry and a vital part of the Australian economy. It is fair to say that in recent months it has been going through a rather flat period. This forecast suggested that the quarterly dwelling commencements would grow throughout 1978 and that in the December quarter, in particular, they should be about 25 per cent higher than they were in the December quarter of 1977. Forecasts that were recently made by my Department also indicate that there will be increased levels of activity during the latter half of 1978. Those forecasts are not quite as optimistic as the forecasts made by Philip Shrapnel and Co. Pty Ltd. Nevertheless, they do show a trend towards growth. Both the industry and home buyers, especially, should be encouraged by the more certain prospects for increased construction activity during this year. I believe that these result very substantially from the success of the Government's general economic policies. NA",21
28,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND,My question is directed to the Minister for the Capital Territory in his capacity as Minister for Home Affairs. Is he aware of the formulation of a plan for the evacuation of Christmas Island which would reduce the population to 120 persons? Did the Minister's Department initiate this development or was the plan initiated solely by the Christmas Island Administration?,22

33,Mr SPEAKER,CHRISTMAS ISLAND,Order! The honourable gendeman is entitled to ask his question without interruption. I ask honourable members on my right to allow the question to proceed.,22
34,Mr INNES,CHRISTMAS ISLAND,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Is the Minister aware that the original reason given to the persons on Christmas Island who were directed to draw up the plan was that such a plan could be used to forestall and counteract possible industrial action by the union of Christmas Island workers during the negotiations on the Island due to commence at the begmriing of June? If the plan is simply to cover a potential emergency situation, why was it necessary to provide for it to be ready within a period of two weeks from 23 March, with the contemplated date of use of such a plan being stated as July 1978? Will the Minister guarantee that the plan is not designed to intimidate the workers of Christmas Island and that the threat of evacuation will not be used during the course of the negotiations for the purpose of frustrating the union representing the workers on Christmas Island while pursuing their legitimate claims?",22
35,Mr SPEAKER,CHRISTMAS ISLAND,Order! The honourable gentleman will cease commenting.,22
36,Mr ELLICOTT,CHRISTMAS ISLAND,"I am the Minister for Home Affairs in my own right. The honourable gendeman asked a question about the evacuation of Christmas Island. No plan has been approved by me to evacuate Christmas Island. I have no doubt that people who are concerned with Christmas Island may, from time to time, speculate in relation to it. Nothing has come before me under which my approval has been sought for, or that indicates that any other Minister has approved of, a plan to evacuate Christmas Island. Industrial questions have arisen on Christmas Island. So far as I understand, they have been the subject of debate and consultation in recent weeks. I imagine that if the parties involved speak together in a spirit of compromise as is necessary on the Island they will be able to come to agreeable terms. As the honourable gentleman would know, an arbitrator has been appointed. He allowed an award last year. I also understand that the question of the extension of that award is currendy being considered. I do not think the honourable gentleman should be concerned about an impending evacuation of Christmas Island. NA",22
37,Mr BAUME,NATURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and follows the question asked by the honourable member for Forrest. What federal assistance has been made available to residents of New South Wales in general and of my electorate in particular who suffered severely in the recentfloods?Further, what progress has been made in implementing the Federal Government's $200m water resource program, including flood mitigation, announced last month by the Prime Minister, on which the States were to be approached for their participation? Have all the States responded in a satisfactory way?",22
38,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,NATURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE,"There are standing arrangements for support in relation to natural disasters, and during the time of the severe problems in New South Wales I was in touch with the New South Wales Premier concerning the programs and standing arrangements that the Commonwealth has with the States. The honourable gentleman would know that a number of matters are agreed automatically in these circumstances-grants for relief of personal hardship and distress, grants for the restoration of public assets, concessional loans to small businesses, concessional loans to churches, sporting associations and other voluntary non-profit organisations, concessional loans to primary producers for carry-on, restocking and restoration purposes, freight subsidies for primary producers, assistance to State, local and semi-government authorities for the slaughter and disposal of helpless and unsalable stock. In the lastfinancialyear the Commonwealth provided nearly $ 13m to New South Wales for natural disaster relief, and it appears from the estimates for this year that the amount will be again over $ 12m for the State as a whole. The honourable gentleman also referred to the period some weeks ago when I wrote to the States remmding them of our pre-election commitment for a $200m national water resources program. Both the Minister concerned and I are eagerly awaiting the responses of the States in relation to that because we want to be influenced by the States' assessments of their own priorities. The funds could be used for city water supplies, flood mitigation and relief, water storage, or farm or irrigation purposes, and much will depend upon the priority that the States themselves have within their own arena. I must say that up to this point South Australia is the only State that has responded to that request. I hope that the other States will respond shortly. NA NA",22
39,Mr HAYDEN,COMMISSION,"I ask a question of the MinisMinister ter for Aboriginal Affairs and remind him that yesterday he told the House that he had ations instructed his Department to continue the review of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission that has been going on since 1976.1 a fact that this review already has recommended that the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission should be retained with, and I quote, permanent 'strengthened guidelines'? Is it also a fact that idea that the Land Fund Commission should be abolished and its functions taken over by a body under direct ministerial control was iniwho tiated not by the departmental review but by the Minister himself?",23
40,Mr VINER,COMMISSION,"The honourable gentleman obviperience. ously has a copy of a minute of a meeting I held with officers. There is every reason why initiate consideration of particular points which may in the long run provide for the Aborpartment iginal and Islander people a much more effective use and application of the funds made available by government to the Land Fund Commission. I should have thought that from the honourable gentleman's own experience in government he would know that Ministers do have ideas of their own, which if implemented can be of benefit to the Australian people. A review is going on at moment, and when my Department has country. completed that review, including a consideration of the ideas that I have put forward, I will make a decision on what should be put to Cabinet. NATIONAL WOMEN'S ADVISORY NA",23
41,Mr HASLEM,COUNCIL,Does the Minister for Home Affairs recall that during the last Federal election campaign the Government undertook to establish a permanent women's advisory body? When does the Government propose to honour this promise?,23
42,Mr ELLICOTT,COUNCIL,"I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. It gives me an opportunity to make an important announcement. It is true that during the election campaign the Government promised to establish a permanent women's advisory body. I am very happy to announce to honourable members that the Government has decided to honour that election promise and to establish a National Women's Advisory Council. Honourable members will be aware that in September of last year the report of the women's advisory body working party was presented to the Parliament and was available for honourable members to look at. That resulted from an initiative taken by the Prime in 1976 to call together women's organisations and representatives of women's organisfrom all over Australia. As a result of that initiative, that advisory body was set up. It recommended that a permanent advisory body now ask: Is it not be established. Of course, the new Council will give women a voice in government. It will enable the them to give advice to me as the Minister for Home Affairs in relation to all matters of concern new to women. This body will consist of 12 women will be drawn from all walks of life. They will not be on this body to represent particular organisations. They will come with their own exThey will represent all women- I repeat, 'all women'. At this point I pay a tribute I should to the women who work in my Office of of view Women's Affairs. They have come to my Deand have assisted greatly in the establishment of machinery leading to the Government's decision. I hope that in a fortnight or a httle longer it may be possible for the Government to announce the membership of this body. But I think that all honourable members will agree that it is a very significant step forward. As I say, it will enable women to have a firm, strong the and permanent voice with government in this I do not propose to read out the powers and functions of the body. But I think it appropriate that they be incorporated in Hansard, and seek leave for their incorporation. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA The powers of the Council shall be: to repon and make recommendations to Government on request or on its own initiative in relation to matters of concern to women; to set up, subject to Ministerial approval, subcommittees, working parties or task forces as necessary, drawing on its own resources when appropriate and on other resources which may be made available; and at the request of the Minister responsible, to encourage research into areas of imponance to women. The Council may do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connection with the performance of its functions. NA The primary role of the Council will be to advise me, as Minister for Home Affairs, on matters of concern to. women. In furtherance of this function the Council may: establish and maintain effective communication with women and women's organisauons and other interested groups and individuals; explore means of overcoming language and other communication barriers; raise awareness within the community of the situation of women and of their varied and changing roles and aspirations; encourage and assist effecuve liaison with the communications media in ensuring that the individuality and achievements of women are given due recognition; actively promote a policy of equality of opportunity for all women; review and repon to the Minister on legislation specifically relating to its powers and functions; convene forums, seminars and conferences throughout Australia; repon annually through the Minister to Parliament and the pubhc, and regularly produce publications and other material in several major languages to disseminate information; establish and maintain cooperation with other advisoiy bodies and relevant machinery at State and Commonwealth levels and internationally, with a view to guarding against unnecessary duplication; and in collaboration with Depanments and agencies and through the Department of Foreign Affairs estabUsh and maintain Uaison with international and regional agencies in relation to implementation of the World Plan of Action for the UN Decade for Women.

43,Mr HAYDEN,ABORIGINAL LAND FUND,"I direct a question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs which is supplementary to that which I asked him a short time ago. Does he recall saying yesterday in answer to a question which I directed to him about the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission that he had asked his Department to carry on the review of the future role of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission which had been under way since 1976 and also that when the review was completed its findings would be put before him as Minister? The Minister will recall confirming that statement today. Is it not a fact that the minutes of the meeting in his office between himself and officers ofhis Department on 14 March shows that the Minister decided that a Cabinet submission should be prepared which would incorporate the functions of the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission, the Aboriginal Loan Commission and Aboriginal enterprises into a single body directly responsible to the Minister? If the Minister cavils at that, has he any objection to a copy of the minutes being incorporated in the Hansard record?",24
44,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND FUND,"I do not know what the honourable gentleman thinks he is on to. I would have thought that it was quite in order for a Minister to request his Department to prepare a Cabinet submission. When I see it I may disagree with what the Department has provided to me. I might ask my officers to modify it and change it. I do not know what the final form will be. Obviously, the honourable gentleman has a copy of a handwritten minute of a meeting that was held in my office. Of course, that is a confidential document- a stolen document which the honourable gentleman is quite prepared to receive. We know the quality of receivers of stolen documents.",24
45,Mr HAYDEN,ABORIGINAL LAND FUND,I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a document which is a handwritten copy of a minute of a meeting held in the office of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on 14 March. Leave not granted.,24

47,Mr CORBETT,EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade and Resources. In view of reports appearing in the media concerning expon development proposals, can the Minister indicate when he will be able to announce details of the Government's decisions in this regard? COMMISSION Mr ANTHONY-I noticed a number of reports in the Press today based on speculation about the Government's decisions with regard to export incentives and export promotions. It should be no secret at all that the Government considers it important to maintain and expand our existing export performance for reasons of employment and balance of payments. For these reasons the Government announced during the last election campaign that it would introduce a new incentive scheme to encourage and assist exports. That scheme has been under exarrunation. Industry people have been consulted and have made comments. There has also been an Industries Assistance Commission repon looking into the expon market development grants scheme as well as other expon incentives. All these matters are being considered by the Government and until they are resolved I am not in a position to make any funher comment. As soon as the matter has beenfinalisedby the Government, an announcement will be made in this House. NA",24
48,Mr BARRY JONES,INTEREST RATES,"I direct my question to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the Reserve Bank has been pushing down forward margins on the United States dollar below the relative differential between interest rates in Australia and interest rates in the United States? Is the present margin unrealistically low and is it intended to reduce it funher? Is the Reserve Bank pushing down forward margins in order to bring the Australian dollar to parity with the United States dollar? If so, does this indicate that the Government wishes to establish an open foreign exchange market in Austraha?",25
49,Mr HOWARD,INTEREST RATES,"On a number of occasions, in response to questions and also through statement, I have provided to this House and to the community generally, a description and explanation of the current management of the Australian exchange rate. Frankly, I have nothing to add to those descriptions. NA",25
50,Mr SHIPTON,ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,"I direct a question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs concerning illegal immigration to Nonhern Austraha. Is the Minister aware that numbers of Papua New Guinea citizens are over-staying their traditional, normal and usual visits to Australia and have settled permanently in northern Australia, particularly in Queensland? Has the Minister's Department investigated this matter? Does the Minister have an estimate of how many such people are over-staying in Australia? Have they come to Australia under any special anangements?",25
51,Mr MACKELLAR,ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION,"This matter was brought to my attention last year. Following that, I consulted Ministers of other interested depanments and an interdepartmental committee was set up to look at the impUcations of the question. A task force was established and that task force journeyed to Thursday Island in the Torres Strait in October last year and again in February of this year. The task force has reported back to the IDC which is composed of interested departments. The task force was charged with the responsibility of investigating the allegations, keeping firmly in mind the traditional rights and traditional movements of people from Papua New Guinea in the Torres Strait area. The interdepartmental committee is at the present time considering the report of the task force. The response to that report has not yet come to me, but the initial investigations show that the movements referred to by the honourable member are not considerable. NA NA",25
52,Mr NIXON,RESEARCH,For the information of honourable members. I present a report prepared by the Department of Transport entitled 'The Transport (Planning and Research) Act 1974 Report of Progress to 30 June 1977'. The report was produced at the request of State authorities and provides an example of the co-operation between State and Commonwealth which is being achieved under the Act. COMPENSATION: COMMONWEALTH NA,25
53,Mr HUNT,GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES,Gwydir-Minister for Health)Pursuant to section 122 of the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 I present the annual report of the Commissioner for Employees Compensation for the yearended 30 June 1977. NA,25
54,Mr GROOM,ENVIRONMENT,"Braddon-Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development)-For the information of honourable members. I present the summary report of the sixth meeting of the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers, Cairns, 29 July 1977, and the summary record of proceedings of the ninth meeting of the Australian Environment Council, Canbena, 11 August 1977. - CROATIAN EMBASSY' Ministerial Statement  Foreign Affairs)-by leave- I wish to make clear the Government's position with respect to the creation of establishments, institutions or organisations which can, because of the diplomatic terminology used, result in substantial difficulties in Australia's relations with other countries and impede the operations of Australia's foreign policy, the effective conduct of which is vital to the well-being of the nation. This is particularly so when such an establishment is referred to as an 'embassy'. Australia is a party to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. That convention, in article 22-whic h has the force of law in Australia-impose s on Australia a special duty to prevent any impairment of the dignity of a diplomatic mission accredited to this country. It is not a matter which can be dealt with in any sense of compromise. It is a matter of our international obligations and the domestic law which gives effect to these obligations. I need hardly add that this would not apply to such estabUshments as the so-called Aboriginal Embassy as it did not affect the standing of any other nation with which Australia has diplomatic relations. It has not been necessary in the past to treat this matter as one for legislative action. However, this has now become necessary because of the establishment in Canberra late last year of a so-called Croatian Embassy. It is because the establishment of the so-called Embassy has had important ramifications for Australia-ramifica tions with respect to the Vienna Convention, Australia's responsibilities under it, the effective operation of Australia's foreign policy, and our long-standing relations with a universally recognised nation, namely Yugoslavia-that the Government now feels it necessary to consider legislation to put an end to this anomaly and to guard against any recurrence. I therefore wish to set out the Government's position with regard to this matter. The so-called Croatian Embassy has been set up in Canberra by certain persons who may or may not be fully aware of the serious impUcations of their actions, which impede the correct and orderly conduct of Australia's international relations, for which I am directly responsible. It is therefore necessary that I now make clear to this House beyond any possibility of doubt the Government's views and intentions on this matter. These are in short that an establishment such as the so-called Croatian Embassy is damaging to the national interest and that such an estabUshment cannot therefore be tolerated. Yugoslavia acceded to independence in the context of the post-World War I settlement, to which Australia was a party. Australia has long standing and friendly relations with that country. By mutual agreement many people from Yugoslavia have settled in Australia. This has strengthened our ties. We respect Yugoslavia's sovereignty. The Government cannot therefore view with indifference an attempt to establish and maintain on Australian territory any organisation which not only is openly dedicated to the destruction of a state in friendly relations with Australia but which also arrogates to itself an unacceptable title and status which could in turn disrupt the orderly conduct of Australia's relations with another universally recognised member of the international community. This could clearly have a substantial adverse effect on our international standing, the conduct of Australia's foreign policy and our national interest, thus affecting all Australians. It can scarcely be maintained that the setting up of a so-called Croatian Embassy is not an impairment of the dignity of the diplomatic mission which in law, and in fact, represents Yugoslavia in this country. It is of no less concern that the unauthorised establishment of this so called Embassy interferes with the exercise of the executive power of the Commonwealth to conduct Australia's international relations. The Government is thus deeply concerned lest other minority groups may be inspired by the continued existence of the self-styled Croatian Embassy to believe that they, too, may similarly interfere in and jeopardise Australia's relations with sovereign states. Furthermore, it has been a long standing poUcy of Australian governments to oppose the importation into Australia of alien political and racial feuds. The Government is also concerned about the aggravation of tension between certain ethnic groups. At this stage let me make it quite clear that it is not in any way the Government's wish to discriminate against the Croatian community or to stop, or hinder, members of that community forming their own groups and clubs where these are not aimed at a state and government with which Australia has normal diplomatic relations. The overwhelming majority of the Croatian community in Australia has shown, by its contribution to the development of Australian society and culture, a strong loyalty and commitment to its new homeland. It is an affront to this loyalty and commitment that a so-called Croatian Embassy should purport to represent them. The proper international representative of the interest of Australians of Croatian, as of other, origins is the Australian Government and no one else. The only course of action for the authors of this enterprise is for them to abandon it forthwith and revert to the means by which dissent may be peacefully asserted within the law as it prevails in our society. In order to leave no doubt of the seriousness with which this matter is being regarded, and consistent with the provisions of article 22 of the Vienna Convention, I wish to inform the House that the Government will introduce legislation specifically prohibiting institutions or bodies falsely representing themselves as diplomatic, consular or other official missions of another country or part of another country. Such action is essential not only to remove the anomaly which has already been created, but lest the practice of establishing so called embassies be extended thus jeopardising Australia's foreign relations and national interest. The Government does not believe that the Australian community would support the establishment of organisations so obviously to the detriment of this nation. I present the following paper: 'Croatian Embassy'-Ministeria l Statement, 5 April 1978. Motion (by Mr Fife) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",25

I would wish that he might have more success in the introduction of that legislation than he has enjoyed so far in seeking to introduce legislation to prohibit the operation of the Rhodesian Information Office in this country. Honourable members will recall that Security Council resolution 409/77 cosponsored by the United States of America, proposed among other things that member nations should take action to close down Rhodesian Information Offices. This Government gave a firm undertaking to the Australian people last year that that would be done. The right wing rump of the Government, which is large and even greater in its influence on the Government",27
56,Mr SPEAKER,ENVIRONMENT,Order! The motion is to take note of a paper about legislation in relation to organisations declaring themselves to be embassies when that is not the fact. The honourable gentleman can make statements relevant to that motion but not to an entirely different subject.,27
57,Mr HAYDEN,ENVIRONMENT,"Mr Speaker, I submit that what I am proposing is that on the Minister's record so far we have no reason to feel reassured that he will be successful in introducing the sort of legislation that is required here. In the case of the Rodesia Information Office he has been constantly thwarted. Last year the promise was made but the matter has been bogged down in Cabinet since then. I leave the matter there. The point, I believe, has been adequately made. However, I will relate a few simple facts associated with this matter. The 'Croatian Embassy', as it is called, was opened on 29 November last year. It has taken something like four months to obtain this firmness of attitude from the Minister. In that intervening period it has become quite clear to those about Canberra who have contacts and who are concerned about these matters that relations between Yugoslavia and Australia have become increasingly strained and were reaching the point of jeopardy as a result of the absence of appropriate firm action by the Government. I remind the House that on 29 November last year when the 'Croatian Embassy' was opened, the opening was graced with official Government presence. Senator Knight, formerly of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and Mr Haslem, of this House, were present. I think it is reasonable to ask, in view of the provocative statements that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made, whether their presence at the opening of the embassy was with the knowledge of the Government and of the Minister and to what extent they were encouraged or discouraged. But there are more important questions to be asked. It is significant that although the embassy was opened well before the last general election, the Minister did not find his way clear to make a statement on the matter until well after the election, nearly four weeks later. Presumably he was waiting until the Croatian vote had been safely counted.",27

62,Mr HAYDEN,ENVIRONMENT,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs has attracted no stature to his presence by the way in which he has handled this matter. He has been tardy and unimpressive. His final action, the statement to the House today, comes, as I said before, grudgingly and belatedly and is a clear indication that action was finally extracted- I stress extracted-fro m the Government, not because it felt it should act as a matter of principle or because it felt the burden of its responsibilities internationally under the Vienna Convention which the Minister has quoted, but rather because it had been made abundantly clear to the Government that if the 'Croatian Embassy' were to continue any longer in operation the strained relations between Australia and Yugoslavia might well break. Debate (on motion by Mr Hodges) adjourned. NA NA Ministerial Statement",27
63,Mr STALEY,BROADCASTIN G,"by leave-On e of the most recent amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-77 made by the Government-namel y section IIIC, enacted in December last year-entruste d the Minister with the responsibihty to plan the development of radio and television services in Australia. In accepting this trust, one of the ongoing priorities will be to ensure that this responsibility is underfore, taken in a manner that will facilitate socially responsive, yet systematic, planning and policy implementation. I am well aware of widespread concern about what has been described as the 'haphazard ad hockery' of broadcasting planning and regulation since its inception in this country. Whilst I do not intend to take issue with the justification, or otherwise, of such a viewpoint, I am bound to take account of it, voiced as it has been by such a wide range of organisations and interests, both here and outside in the country. This statement will be thefirstof a series in the Government's systematic approach to the development of pohcy guidelines for the entire broadcasting system. These statements will be designed to keep Parliament and, through it, the public informed of Government intentions and proposed action relating to particular areas of the system. On this occasion, the statement will deal with our intentions as they relate to the planning of pubhc broadcasting. However, before moving on to that particular matter, it is timely to outline the general assumptions and philosophic principles upon which the Government's overall approach to broadcasting planning and development will be based. Broadcasting, in the broader context of mass communications structures, is one of the most influential and pervasive social phenomena of our time. It is a phenomenon, moreover, which presents governments of all democratically based nations with a continuing, and not easily soluble paradox. Each country has approached this paradox by adopting a system of broadcasting to meet its own individual geographic, social, economic and cultural problems. In formulating and articulating a clear philosophy on which to base guidelines for policy planning and implementation for Australian conditions, it is necessary to stress that broadcasting-and indeed government attitudes to it-is inextricably linked with matters of national pohcy. This derives from a number of factors: Firstly, its importance to public information, freedom and expression is crucial. It projects, influences and reflects socio-cultural values and opinions to an extent unrivalled by any other media form. Secondly, this all-pervasive medium of communication is a valuable national resource-in strategic, technological and economic, as well as social, terms. Thirdly, it can be argued that the electromagnetic spectrum-the physical medium by which radio, television and other communications services are delivered-is by no means an inexhaustible, if not a scarce, resource. Therethere must be some ultimate arbiter, some final regulatory authority responsible for decisions on matters affecting allocation and utilisation of the component elements of the spectrum, particularly where broadcasting frequencies are concerned. Fourthly, it derives from national, indeed international, regulation of the physical bounds, the broadcasting airwaves and all electromagnetic communications channels-for example, their frequencies, power and points of origin and deUvery. Without such regulation, the whole system would be plagued by interference until it degenerated into utter chaos. In short, broadcasting is so powerful a social and communications instrument, so valuable a national resource, so crucial to the public interest, that no government can afford to ignore it. The problem for government of course, is the extent to which the system can, or should, be regulated. Where does sensible planning and policy implementauon finish, and totalitarian control start? A basic premise accepted by most governments in free societies is that the electromagnetic frequencies-o r airwaves-use d by broadcasting and in most forms of communications, are public property. That premise leads logically to an assumption that government must accept the role, and attendant responsibilities, of custodian of those airwaves for, and in, the pubUc interest. This Government interprets 'public interest' in terms of a system which must, while remaining economically and administratively viable, be sufficiently flexible and diverse to respond to the very wide range of changing needs implicit within the complexities of Australian society. Therein Ues our basic approach as regards broadcasting planning and policy implementation, expressed in these philosophic terms: That government involvement in Australian broadcasting must be directed to ensure freedom of expression and enterprise in all forms of communication available to Australian society, particularly radio and television, and that this freedom is best served by diversity of structures and outlets. However, we also believe that facilitation of freedom of expression and enterprise in broadcasting must be consistent with the onus upon government to make the necessary planning and administrative provisions, to obviate theriskof freedom of expression and enterprise for one sector, or group, being indulged at the expense of others, or of"" the system as a whole. We believe that this can best be achieved by encouragement of diversity in the airwaves through logical and systematic planning. In passing, it should be noted that this approach is in line with a fairly widespread consensus expressed in submissions to two major government-initiated broadcasting inquiries undertaken in this country over the past two years. I refer, of course, to the 1976 departmental inquiry into the structure of the Australian broadcasting system and associated mattersgenerally known as the Green inquiry-and last year's Australian Broadcasting Tribunal inquiry into broadcasting standards and the concept of self-regulation. The Government is mindful of the inherent relationship between freedom of expression and a free society. Our view is that this relationship can best be nurtured by the encouragement, wherever possible, of public consultation in the actual planning process. A parallel view is that the free, complex and dynamic society in which we live requires considerable flexibility in the planning process to ensure effective response to changing needs. These views give rise to two essential planning criteria for ministerial planning responsibility under the Broadcasting and Television Act-publi c consultations and proceduralflexibility,both of which have special relevance to the public broadcasting sector. The very nature of that sector makes close involvement between public broadcasters and the communities they hope to serve axiomatic. The axiom will be just as applicable to communities comprised of, say, Aboriginal residents or broadcasters of Christian programs. It is accepted that public broadcasters should have a better appreciation of the interests, hence needs, of their broadcasting communities than anyone else, including government. This acceptance is signified by the Government's intention to give every opportunity for those community interests and needs to be articulated during planning processes. But, because pubhc broadcasting is a relatively recent phenomenon in Australia, this acceptance must be tempered with realism. This sector of the system is bound to experience considerable growing pains. No doubt there will be a number of potential licensees who will underestimate the needs of, and support they might expect from, their chosen communities. The converse is also inevitable: There are bound to be others who will overestimate the capacity of particular communities to sustain and to devote resources and skills to their own special interest broadcasting stations. These will surely fail. However, any such failures should not be used as a yardstick by which to judge the overall potential or success of the entire public broadcasting sector. The now thriving commercial sector, which has made such great contributions to broadcasting services in Australia over the past half century, also experienced its early failures. But this has not prevented commercial broadcasting from becoming a vital, essential and invaluable part of Australian communications heritage. Nor should any early failures by some public broadcasters prevent this new sector from developing to complement the nauonal and commercial services and to enrich the system as a whole. It is expected that early definition of long term strategic objectives for public broadcasting will minimise teething troubles in the early growth years. But it is stressed that such objectives for the public sector cannot be formulated in isolation: They must take into account the structure of the overall broadcasting system and the objectives of the two estabhshed national and commercial sectors. Until recently, Australia has been served by what has been termed the 'dual' broadcasting system, which is serviced by national and commercial sectors. With the advent of the handful of public broadcasters licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, a third sector entered the system. They embryonic state of this sector was documented officially in the Green report. That report acknowledged the existence of, and made recommendations on, legislative provisions for 'administration in all three sectors and for licensing of public as well as commercial stations'. Both recommendations have since been adopted by the Government and passed into legislation. Consequently, the term 'public broadcasting' has now acquired legislative definition in Australia. Section IIlA (1) of Part IVA of the Act describes the public broadcasting service and the pubhc television service as applicable to a 'licence granted for a special purpose as specified in the licence'. Section 81 (4) also provides that pubhc broadcasting Ucences may be granted only to non-profit corporations. I return to the problem of defining long term strategic objectives for the pubUc sector. The Government has approached this problem by relating the proposed objectives of this sector to those of the system as a whole and hence, logically, to those of the estabUshed national and commercial sectors. The overall objectives for the system as a whole are implicit in the philosophy of this Government, as I outlined earUer. We believe that the Australian broadcasting system should aim for diversity and quaUty as an overall objective and also to cater for and reflect the widest possible spectrum of information, opinions, values and interests in Australian society. These objectives have been rationalised and defined in both the Green and Australian Broadcasting Tribunal Inquiry reports. More specifically, the Government takes the view that the various sectors which comprise the system should aim to develop programming objectives and functions expressly designed to avoid unnecessary and wasteful dupUcation of broadcasting facilities, resources and content. In considering the programming objective, the ultimate raison d'etre of the individual sectors, the starting point must be a general assumption that the total viewing or listening audience is comprised of a series of majority and minority groups. These have been traditionally identified in terms of block mass and minority groupings. However, it must be recognised that what may constitute a minority audience in terms of a percentage of the total listening or viewing population can still constitute a mass audience in merical terms. It also must be recognised that different audience groupings, whether mass or minority, are both divisible and interchangeable. All people at some time or another will form part of a mass audience. Of those, most at some time or another will, in following specialised interests, be potential members of minority audiences. The nature of the broadcasting system in Australia until quite recently, together with the physical hmitations of the avaUabUity of broadcasting frequencies, has tended to serve mass audiences well but to overlook those members of the various mass groupings with additional and quite specific interests outside those catered for in mass appeal programming. The commercial sector has been, by virtue of its economic structure and marketing requirements, traditionally oriented to cater for largely undifferentiated audience blocks via mass appeal programming. The national service, by virtue of its Australia wide network structure and public funding origins, has also, though to a lesser extent, tended to program for mass audiences, albeit across a wide geographical service area, whUe at the same time tending to concentrate on more specialised educational and cultural interests. The newer public sector is seen as complementary to both pre-existing sectors. It is likely to program for minority rather than mass audiences in response to special interests and needs. This is not to imply that public broadcasting should be confined to elitist interests. Speciality and elitism are not necessarUy synonyms. After all, a special interest may range, for example, from football to Flemish weaving, from film to Florentine art, from hard rock to harpsichord recitals and from Bach cantatas to brass bands. What public broadcasting should aim to do, as a sector, is to develop appeal for all of the people, some of the time. From these premises, the Government proposes that the strategic aim of public broadcasting is to serve specialised audiences or, as the Act puts it, to provide 'special purpose broadcasting'. Action on planning proposals for the public broadcasting sector is now urgently required due to,firsdy,the imminent expiry of licences issued under the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1905, and secondly, the volume of inquiries and follow-up requests received by my Department from potential pubhc broadcasters. In recognition of the urgency of the situation, a series of discussions have been held with the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia to consider draft 'GuideUnes for the Planning of Public Broadcasting in Phase I ' . After discussions with the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia, the nu- guidelines have been modified and I have now authorised a final version. I seek leave to have terms of thefinalversion incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read asfollowsNA BROADCASTING IN PHASE I (See Note A) 1. Public radio station licences will be categorised by the 'special purpose' for which they are granted, viz. Category E Licences: Will be issued to educational bodies intending to provide programs of continuing and adult education, but including material designed to enrich the cultural life of the audience. Category S Licences: Will be issued to groups intending to provide programs serving a particular interest or group of interests e.g. music/spon/rehgion. Category C Licences: Will be issued to community groups intending to provide programs serving a particular community e.g. Bathurst, Manly-Warringah. 2. The licensing policy adopted these categories (See Note B). For example(a) Category E Licences (educational bodies): (i) in capital cities licences will normally only be issued to consortiums of educational institutions or to a single appUcant where that appUcant agrees to allow reasonable participation by other educational institutions; (ii) licences will be medium coverage. They may be issued in either AM or FM (See Note C). (b) Category S Licences (special interests): (i) consortiums will be permitted, but not mandatory; (ii) Ucences will be medium coverage. They may be issued in either AM or FM. (See Note C). (c) Category C Licences (community groups): (i) consortiums will be permitted but not mandatory and Ucences may be issued to bodies such as shire councils, schools, and non-profit companies in isolated areas; (ii) Promise of Performance may include educational and access programs; (iii) licences will be low coverage in capital cities but may be medium coverage elsewhere. They may be m either AM or FM (See Note C). 3. In Phase I (See Note A) a maximum of three (3) medium coverage FM Licences will be issued in Categories E and S for each capital city. However, further licences will be issued in Phase I I. Licences in Category C will be issued freely wherever frequencies are available. 4. The Minister will call for applications for one or more pubUc broadcasting licences for a service area, after which the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will hold a pubhc inquiry and then issue a licence/licences to the successful applicants. AppUcations for Category E, S and C Ucences to serve a particular area or part ultaneously wherever possible. 5. Any pubUc broadcasting organisation will be free to apply for a licence and demonstrate to the Tribunal its greater suitability than that of other applicants, according to specifications determined by the Minister and conditions imposed by the Tribunal. 6. Applicants will submit a Promise of Performance setting out their programming intentions and other poUcies related to broadcasting, which will be used in choosing a licensee and in renewal hearings. Significant departures from the Promise of Performance may be subject to investigation by the Tribunal. 7. Licensees will be directly responsible under the provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, for their station's programs. 8. Government financial support will be limited to indirect funding. 9. State Governments, statutory bodies other than educational bodies, and political parties wiU not be issued public broadcasting licences. 10. Sponsorship in a form approved by the Minister and administered by the Tribunal wdl be permitted, but not advertising of the' spot announcement' type. 11. Licensees will not be permitted to own/control more than one public broadcasting Ucence, but may apply for translator licences. 12. Transfers of pubUc broadcasting Ucences will not be permitted. If an effective transfer is desired, a new Tribunal hearing wiU be held, with aU prospective applicants considered equally. will differentiate between Explanatory Notes A. 'Phase I ' may be regarded as the period from the present to that point at which engineering studies on multiple FM transmissions aUow a definite assessment of frequency avaUabUity to be made. The intention is that this Phase should be as short as is consistent with proper caution in planning and Phase II will be announced as soon as possible. B. Licence categories (a) are concerned with estabUshing the special purpose of stations for the planning and licensing processes-wha t might be called the 'station profile'. They are indicative rather than prescriptive, setting out broad planning guidlines, and are not mtended for use in the regulatory process. That function will be served by the stations' own Promises of Performance, (b) are not intended to be mutually exclusive. For example: (i) Category E Licence stations (educational bodies) may well use material 'aimed at a particular interest'. An example might be programs designed to increase understandmg of ethnic cultures and languages. (ii) Category S Licence stations (special interests) may well use material which would 'enrich the cultural life of the audience'. An example might be a fine music station using programs on the history of music. (iii) Category C Licence stations (community groups) may well feature 'programs of continuing and adult education' relevant to their community. An example might be a community station in Bourke or Walgett featuring enrichment programs for Aboriginals. C. Coverage areas will be determined according to the special purpose of the station concerned. Following the Government's acceptance of the MCLean Report, planning of the FM service has been based upon three types: wide coverage, medium coverage and low coverage. The radii indicated below are illustrative only. Actual radii will depend on many factors, such as aerial height, terrain, etc. of an area will be invited sim(a) wide coverage stations: 80 km (urban) or 122 km (country) (b) medium coverage stations: 32 km (urban) or 56 km (country) (c) low coverage stations: 15 km (urban) or 28 km (country) The precise mix of wide, medium and low coverage stations to be adopted in a particular area will depend upon demonstrated demand and detailed planning considerations.",28
64,Mr STALEY,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,"The guidelines form the basis for preparation of planning proposals for licence applications in both areas now served by broadcasters licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy Act and those in which potential licensees have expressed an interest in servicing. The Phase I to which they refer may be regarded as an introductory period in the establishment of frequency modulation pubhc broadcasting stations. The Government intends that Phase I should be as short as possible to avoid unnecessary restrictions upon the development of public broadcasting. At the same time, there is a responsibility to control the way in which the enormous potential of FM broadcasting is to be realised. That involves all sectors of broadcasting and requires proper caution in its exercise. At this point, a priority task is to initiate public hearings in those areas served by the broadcasters Ucensed under the Wireless Telegraphy Act Planning proposals have been prepared and will be circulated by my Department to the appropriate organisations for comment prior to the relevant hearings to be conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. As indicated previously, the planning guidelines propose that public radio stations should be categorised according to the 'special purpose' for which they apply for Ucensing under the Broadcasting and Television Act. Three licence categories are envisaged to identify what might be described as individual 'station profiles'. The categories are intended to be indicative rather than prescriptive and will be chosen by the applicants themselves. They are not intended for use in the regulatory process and are as follows: Category E licences will be issued to educational bodies intending to program for continuing and adult education. Such programming may include material designed to enrich the cultural perspectives of the audiences served. In the capital cities, Category E licences will normaUy be issued only to consortiums of educational institutions in Phase I. They may also be issued to a single institution with the proviso that other educational institutions be allowed reasonable participation. Most new licences will be issued in FM, since it is mainly in the VHF band that frequencies are available. However, the criterion for the granting of AM or FM Ucences will be the mode seen to be more technically appropriate for the programming involved. Thus Category E licences, which will provide for medium coverage, might be issued in either mode. Category S Ucences will be issued to groups intending to program for a particular interest, or group of interests. This will be the most flexible category, as it allows potential appUcants scope to define in their Promise of Performance whatever interest groupings they wish to serve. These might cover music, sport or rehgion for which Ucences will be issued in either AM or FM mode and which will provide for medium coverage. Category C Ucences will be issued to community groups intending to program for the interests of a community, or communities, in a specific geographical location. Potential licensees would be drawn from bodies like shire councils, schools, student organisations and resident groups. The point I made earUer about active involvement by public broadcasters with their communities of license is especially applicable to applications for category C Ucences. Participation will be the name of the game. As with categories E and S, category C licences will be issued in both modes. However, in capital cities they will extend only to 'low coverage', that is, coverage over a radius of approximately 15 kilometres. I stress that these three public broadcasting Ucence categories are not intended to restrict Ucensees to immutable programming compartments. Programming from one category to another will have some inevitable similarities. Notwithstanding, in planning development of broadcasting services for each particular geographical area, a prime consideration will be the need to offer listeners the widest possible diversity of programming options. There are lessons to be learned here from the experience of countries like the United States. There, because of a permissive planning policy in the past, the regulatory authority faces enormous difficulties in finding enough frequencies for deserving new applicants. At this stage, it is the Government's intention to moderate demands from bodies like educational institutions, which can be expected to be strong contenders for licences. The rationale for this intention is the need to maintain reserves, both present and future, for other types of public broadcasting. No doubt many licensees will be educational broadcasters, and these will be welcomed as such. But I expect the public broadcasting sector to be developed in a way that will facilitate eventual provision of greater variety and public benefit than educational broadcasting alone could offer. An important consideration in planning for the development of public broadcasting, indeed broadcasting as a whole, must be the protection of existing broadcasters against interference from new transmitters and receivers. For this reason, at this stage, I propose to call for a maximum of three medium coverage FM public broadcasting Ucences for each capital city. There are not such tight limitations upon the issue of category C Ucences: These will be issued subject to demand and avaUabUity of frequencies. At a later stage when more FM frequencies will be avaUable, licensing will continue within the bounds of an orderly, systematic development of the system. The general procedure will be that I will call for appUcations for one or more public broadcasting licences for specific service areas. Public hearings will then be scheduled ducted by the Austrahan Broadcasting Tribunal, on the basis of which a Ucence or Ucences will issued, in accordance with the planning the specifications I have determined. Any pubUc broadcasting organisation, or group which forms itself into a non-profit corporation will be free apply for a Ucence, with a view to demonstrating that it is the best appUcant for the available cence, within the above parameters. As an appUhe cant, it will be required to submit a Promise Performance setting out its programming intenguidelines tions and other pohcies related to broadcasting, which will be used by the Tribunal in choosing licensee and in subsequent renewal hearings. Significant departures from this Promise of formance may be subject to investigation by the Tribunal and Ucensees will be directly responappealing sible for their station's programs. The Government has accepted the Green report attitude that public broadcasting is an tivity which should spring from local, community initiatives. Accordingly, it is proposed to specify that State governments, poltiical parties statutory bodies other than educational ones should not be issued with pubUc broadcasting cences. Again, Ucensees will not be permitted to own or control more than one pubhc broadcastrequires ing Ucence-althoug h they will be permitted apply for translator Ucences-and the effective transfer of pubUc broadcasting Ucences will necessitate a new Tribunal hearing at which prospective appUcants will be considered. Adapplied vertising of the 'spot announcement' type will not be permitted on pubUc broadcasting stations. However, sponsorship in a form approved by the Minister and administered by the Tribunal be allowed. Finally, it should be said that the main reason for setting up new broadcasting stations is to vide better programs. The Government sees pubare Uc broadcasting as a force for diversity. Its role to provide Australians with a range which the national and commercial sectors are not able to provide. PubUc broadcasters perform this role not by duplicating the programming of national and commercial stations, but by defiriing very clearly for themselves, Tribunal, and above all their audiences, the 'special purpose' which motivates them. In doing so, they will add to Australian broadcasting an exciting and challenging new element which should make it one of the best systems in the world. I present the following paper Public Broadcasting Planning-Guideline sforPhase Ministerial Statement, 5 April 1978. Motion (by Mr Anthony) proposed: and conThat the House take note of the papers.",31
65,Mr INNES,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC," I should like be to say at the outset that the Opposition welcomes statement by the Minister for Post and Telecommunications (Mr Staley), although it does have some disagreement on points of detail. I to know that the Minister has complied with the notification requirements in relation to the preslientation of ministerial statements but I think that would readily agree that the philosophical of statement and the details laid down in the for planning are somewhat complex and may well need some consideration at some a later time. Once again the philosophy on any of these propositions is very good. The Government Peris to be commended for the way in which these propositions have been presented. They are very to the Opposition. However, it is the implementation of that philosophy in line with the guideUnes with which we are particularly acconcerned. This statement is refreshing in its frank approach to broadcasting in Australia after two years of vacillation and ad hoc decisionand making by the previous Minister. The issues and principles are set out in the Ustatement. Page 4 of the statement mentions the: . . . complex and dynamic society in which we live considerableflexibilityin the planning process, to to ensure effecuve response to changing needs. I think this is necessarily a veryfineprinciple all but once again it needs to be implemented and if the whole philosophy on broadcasting is to mean anything. On the same page of the statement reference is made to the very nature of the pubUc broadcasting sector which makes close will involvement between public broadcasters and the communities they hope to serve. Reference is made also to Aboriginal communities and broadcasters of Christian programs. The Oppoprosition hopes that ethnic communities particularly to be included. I note that they did not rate a is mention in the statement, but I am sure that that of choices is only an oversight. will best Mr STALEY - Absolutely .",33
66,Mr INNES,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,"I am assured by the Minister that it was an oversight. The Minister, in his general the observations at the beginning of the statement, rightly emphasised three points which are particularly relevant to the somewhat unique broadcasting structure in Australia: Firstly, the fact that the airwaves are a limited public resource; secondly, the need for government involvement as the ultimate arbiter in relation to the use and 1 - development of that resource; and, thirdly, the need for a definition of the philosophy of broadcasting in Australia. The Parliament will be aware that only recently the General Manager of the Austrahan Broadcasting Commission, Mr Duckmanton, called for a statement on broadcasting philosophy. For years an attempt at philosophy has been expressed in terms of a need for 'adequate and comprehensive programming' or more recently in the words of the Broadcasting Tribunal report 'a need for an Australian look'. In fact a number of important statements by bodies such as the Green inquiry into broadcasting were ignored until this statement in which the Minister started to take them up. Members of the Opposition need an opportunity to examine in detail the statement and the results of that inquiry and to comment on those matters. The Opposition welcomes the opportunity which Parliament has both now and, as promised, in future to discuss the whole philosophy of broadcasting. The technology, the expertise and initiatives with regard to public broadcasting have been available for a number of years in order to develop a vigorous and viable public broadcasting sector. The Public Broadcasting Association of Austraha is a well-informed and responsible organisation whose initiatives hitherto have been frustrated. The Minister's discussion of the guidelines with the Public Broadcasting Association is an example of how the Government and the Parhament can co-operate constructively with community organisations. Ethnic community organisations ought to avail themselves and do avail themselves of the procedures outlined by the Minister. That is a fair example of what can be done. Two events seem to have motivated the Government's new initiatives in relation to public broadcasting. The first was the initiative of President Carter in supporting the already active and virile public broadcasting movement in America which led the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to dispatch Mr Westerway of the Postal and Telecommunications Department to America late last year to study these developments. It was a totally necessary visit. The second event was the appointment of a new Minister who seems to be at least prepared, on the basis of the present statement, to grapple with the problems. While there will be, undoubtedly, disputation about the detailed implementation of the pubhc broadcasting policy, the statement of the Minister promises that that development at least will now take place. The Opposition is convinced that it will be in the interest of all sections of the Austrahan community. As I indicated at the outset, we believe that some of the points of detail-onc e again we can lay out the principles, how they should apply and what may well be the working effect of the procedures in the future-nee d to be considered. Other honourable members wish to participate in this debate. I have been given an assurance by the Minister for the Capital Territory that honourable members will be afforded an opportunity to speak in this debate at a later stage. Therefore I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. AUSTRALIA'S TRADING INTERESTS Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",33
67,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Minister for Trade and Resources in Japan to defend Australia's trading interests. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplaces",34
68,Mr KEATING,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,"The Opposition has raised this matter of public importance today because of the current sorry state of Australia's international trade, in particular the calamitous position that has been reached in Australia's trading relations with Japan. The responsibility for this situation rests solely on the shoulders of the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony). No longer can he shelter behind the international gaffes and embarrassments caused by his Liberal Party and National Country Party colleagues, Sir Charles Court and Mr Bjelke-Petersen, on their recent constitutionally illegal safaris to Japan. Nor can the Minister shy away from the blame for the abortive foreign policy initiatives taken by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in recent months culminating in the sugar negotiations and the Facom affair both of which have done great harm to Australia's relations with Japan. The depths to which the Deputy Prime Minister has fallen in the eyes of the Australian people, the media, the mining industry and his own Party were illustrated clearly last Monday night in his sorry attempt to justify his recent 10-day visit to Japan. When talking of the difficulties facing the iron ore and coal industries the Minister claimed, as his only credit, that it was he and he alone who forced the Japanese steel mills to adopt a policy of maintaining existing stockpiles of iron ore and coal as a means of preventing cutbacks for Australian iron and coal producers. This is what he told a very sceptical Mining Industry Council dinner I argued strongly Tor the retention of existing levels, not only of iron ore steel and coke . . . The mills gave me an assurance that they would hold their stocks of iron ore and rent record levels-and this was thefirsttime such ance had been given. Yet in Japan when the Deputy Prime Minister floated this so called achievement to the the Press quickly discovered by talking to Japanese officials that this pohcy had been decided by the Japanese steel mills before Anthony arrived and was not the result of advocacy on his part. At any rate the Deputy Prime Minister failed to impress the miners the audience last Monday. The attitude of the Fraser-Anthony Government in its foreign pohcy and trading relations with Japan is to run hot in public vate. It is ironical that these two men would use every opportunity to bucket the intiatives of the former Labor Government in a most unwholesome way when they were in Opposition, yet in Government, have twisted Labor policy to suit their own ends. It was the Liberal-Country parJapan ties in Opposition that coined the phrase curehigh 'resource diplomacy' in relation to Labor's sucof cessful attempts to increase both price and tonnage for Australian resource exports. Labor's cession. objective was to see that Australian resource proand ducers did not fall for the tricks of the international cartels which one Australian producer off against another. such Labor wanted to ensure that Australia's major trading partners had a reliable source of supply at proper prices. It was benign supervision and nothing more. Yet, it was painted as nationalisation by our opponents who thought nothing ter of running down the pohcies to foreigners and Australia, only belittling the status of Australia and its with his own and Government. Now, the Fraser-Anthony Government, by Japanese failing to recognise the achievements of the Australia that Labor Government, has cost the coal and iron ore industry millions of dollars in export income. I refer to the Inayama agreement negotiated the late Rex Conner in July 1975. The agreement was in the form of a letter from the Chairman Nippon Steel, Mr Inayama, providing for increase in purchases from Australia of coking coal from between 27 million and 29 million tonnes for the current year to between 44 million and 49 million tonnes for the year 1980. There was to be a maximum increase of 20 million tonnes over the period. The agreement also contained the important proviso that if, through economic circumstances - this ought to be listened to-there should be a stockpile reduction in the manufacture of steel in Japan, and coal but also of pig iron, scrap there would be no reduction in coal purchases coal at curcommitted under Japanese contracts for coking an assurcoal imports from Australia. That is a very significant concession and one that, if kept, would be of great importance to the industry today. I Press, seek leave to table a copy of that letter. Leave granted.",34
69,Mr KEATING,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,"I thank the House. At the Mr time of this agreement Mr Fraser and Mr any Anthony, as Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, went on the attack to downgrade the in agreement. The then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Fraser, said in a Press statement: The deal is unnecessary despite Mr Connor's claims. I seek leave to table this statement also. and cold in priLeave granted.",35
70,Mr KEATING,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,"Las t year the Deputy Prime Minister, when in Japan, sought a reaffirmation of this agreement and, in a Press statement, later acknowledged this. I quote from that statement: has come to recognise Australia as a regular and sesource of supply. This has been demonstrated in periods demand when Australia honoured its contracts and did not desert Japan for high priced markets. We would expect Japan to act similarly in periods of reIn fact, Mr Inayama as Chairman of Nippon Steel representing the Japanese steel mills gave the Australian divisive negotiating Governmentplayed He did not say the Labor Governmentan undertaking in writing in 197S. This undertaking was re-confirmed when I was in Japan last year. That is when he was there as Minister. At the negotiations this year, the Deputy Prime Minisan again brought up the Inayama agreement in attempt to salvage something to take back to to be confronted by the Japanese the Prime Minister's statements in 1975 downgrading the agreement. The are not fools, and according to our Japanese sources they were anxious to show the approach adopted by the Liberal and Country parties in resource negotiations by was both immature and disruptive. The Japanese steel mills have taken the world of recession far more seriously than the Australian an Government. Mr Inayama was talking about falling steel production as far back as mid-1975. Throughout this period the Fraser-Anthony Government failed to appreciate the need to manoeuvre the Japanese steel mills into a continuing acceptance of the philosophy of the ConnorInayama letter, namely, that the producers who werefirstinto the market on a long-term basis were to be the last penalised. The latent overcapacity in the world iron ore andrakingcoal industry is the direct consequence of the steel mills own policy. They alone must now take responsibility for the excess nuning capacity that has only gained recent entry into their market. It is these new mines which should bear the brunt of production cutbacks-no t Australian mines which in good faith entered into long-term supply contracts, long ago. The mills wanted the over-capacity as a weapon to depress prices in good times; they should now take responsibility for their folly in the bad times. Acceptance of minimum contract tonnages is reasonable enough in the circumstances, particularly with declining steel production, but going below these levels to the tune of acceptable and the Australian Government should tell them so. Some mines in Australia stand to lose up to 33 per cent of base contract tonnages. This will drive many of them into loss situations and adversely affect employment. The Government would be recreant in its duty if it did not stand its ground against the Japanese steel industry and insist on at least the rmnimum contract tonnage uplift during the current contract year. As far as prices are concerned, the mills squeezed a favourable price reduction in iron ore from Brazil so Brazil could hold its tonnages. This should not be a precedent for Australia. If Brazil feels compelled to grovel there is no reason why we should feel compelled to imitate it. On the contrary, a $70m revenue loss to our mines is too great. Existing prices should be held and old contracts should be renegotiated to current prices so as to minimise the loss of income from tonnage reductions. There are still quite a few old contracts written at low prices, and if the Japanese want to mitigate the damage of a loss of tonnage deliveries to the level of 10 per cent falling away from the base contract tonnages they can reduce the impact of revenue losses by upgrading the old contracts to current prices. Any drop in prices for Australian producers will clearly signal complete capitulation by the Australian Government. Australia's interests have not been helped by the antics of the Premiers of Western Australia and Queensland. The mills must be laughing themselves sick with the caravan of conservative Australian politicians that has beaten a path to their door in recent weeks. Sir Charles Court was there doing his best to further convince the mills of their supremacy. He was there trying to save Western Australia's iron ore mines from cutAustralian backs, yet the same man was in Tokyo last year trying to start another new iron ore mineGoldsworthy's Area 'C. If he had suceeded one can only imagine how sick the Western Australian iron ore industry would have looked if even more capacity were to have been built into it. Of course, the mills sent Sir Charles home empty handed despite the fact that Sir Charles and the Western Australian newspaper have spent the last week trying to put a good face on his rebuff. The mills know Sir Charles is now dehghtfully irrelevant. It would help Western Australia's interests and his own to leave trade matters where they constitutionally belong and that is with the national Government. Far better for him to stiffen up Mr Anthony than to try and take on the role as the National Trade Minister. The same goes for Premier Bjelke-Petersen. He has no more clout with the miUs than his Western 15 per cent is un-Australian alter ego. These incursions by the States into international trade negotiations are a direct consequence of the absence of any permanent mechanism to deal with difficult trade questions. The Government must formalise a system whereby there is close harmony and exchange of information between the relevant government departments and private industry so that when negotiations get under way all available skill and knowledge come together at the one time. There is nothing wrong with active government support in resource negotiations and the reluctance of the Fraser-Anthony Government to continue the policies of Labor in this regard seems to be the result of an ideological blind spot and not of any rational assessment of the current international market place. The Government in the national interest must move towards the Opposition in this matter and forget its prejudices. The system should work by officials getting together following consultations with the various industries for talks with their counterparts overseas. Once the ground rules are worked out, the various resource companies could then begin their negotiations with prospective buyers in the full knowledge that they have all the knowledge and skill to back them up. There is no reason why such negotiations should always take place in Japan, and in fact it is in the interests of Australia that in future these important negotiations take place alternately in Australia and Japan so that we can end the cap-in-hand treks to Tokyo that have characterised the relationship between the two countries since the fifties. In fact the Japanese steel mills in the late sixties had become so arrogant in their dealing with iron ore and coal producers that their negotiators openly claimed that they set prices which allowed the Australian producers a reasonable profit after costs. Can anyone imagine the Japanese steel mills allowing the Australian resource producers to determine their profit levels? Yet the subservient attitudes of successive Liberal-Country Party governments in their private negotiations with overseas buyers has allowed this philosophy to develop and be accepted. It is demeaning, and if the Australian public were fuUy aware of it they would be ashamed. As it is, they merely see Government Ministers, including the Prime Minister, threatening the Japanese and the European Economic Community with retahatory action unless they buy more beef, wool, iron ore or coal. The approach of the Government to resource negotiations and foreign relations in general is one of posture and empty rhetoric and is long in need of an overhaul. The Government's recent crude forays into 'resource diplomacy' demonstrate the extremes which have characterised this Government's trade approach. This Government actually threatens foreign governments that supplies will be cut off unless certain conditions are met. The Minister for Primary Industry recently used the 200-milefishingand resource zone off-shore as a lever for Australian cattle producers to gain access to Japanese markets. The Prime Minister in his usual heavy handed way has threatened the EEC that unless it buys more beef it cannot be sure of gaining access to Australian uranium. It was the Prime Minister last year who, after informing the Australian newspaperfirst,summoned the Japanese Ambassador to Kirribilli House in Sydney to read him the riot act over the sugar negotiations, causing the Ambassador severe embarrassment. On the same matter, it was this Prime Minister last year who wrote direct to the Japanese Prime Minister in most direct and undiplomatic language on the sugar question, ignoring the Japanese Embassy and other accepted and proper channels and causing great offence as a result. They are very bold and resolute in pubUc, but every time these pubUc confrontations are reduced to across-the-table meetings Australia is always the loser. Up they go to Japan waving a big stick and back they come with the stick well and truly broken over their backs. Perhaps the Australian editorial of 30 March last sums up the current situation adequately: Trade is essential to our survival in this economically troubled world. Mr Anthony presents himself as entirely inadequate in the position of Minister to Japan was demonstrably unsuccessful and his attempts on his return to give a semblance of success to his mission succeeded only in giving an impression of a farmer sent on a super-salesman's errand. The Japanese are tough businessmen and for Mr Anthony to try to sway them with talk of a special relationship' between Australia and Japan is ludicrous. It is yet to be demonstrated by the Japanese that they recognise a 'special relationship' and Mr Anthony would be better off realising that, instead of publicly apologising for the tough line taken against Japanese fishermen'by the New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr Muldoon-wh o seems to understand tough dealing better than we do. That is a quote from the Australian. There is a clear interest for Australia to protect, firstly in regard to our balance of trade and our balance of payments, and secondly in regard to our industries. The Prime Minister has demonstrated an interest in running the detail of most Ministers' portfolios. If the Minister for Trade and Resources does not pick up his feet the Prime Minister will feel obliged to take command ofhis portfolio also.",35
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,37
72,Mr ANTHONY,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,"It is fairly obvious that this is a political exercise on the part of the Opposition. One naturally would expect that the shadow Minister for Trade and Resources, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), needs to put up some performance so that he can circulate a speech to the branches of the Australian Labor Party in his electorate. It is unfortunate that this has some ramifications. Certainly, it does not help a common national objective of trying to facilitate the maximum amount of trade between Australia and Japan during times of difficulty. The honourable member talked about my trip to Japan as a cap-in-hand approach to negotiate and suggested that the Japanese should come to Australia. Clearly, he does not understand the intentions of my trip. My visit to Japan was for the purpose of discussing Government policy, to meet with Ministers, officials, organisations, utilities, trading houses, to help to create good relations and to cement goodwUl between our two countries. This probably was one of the most valuable trips I have had. I received a particularly good reception in Japan. We had frank and understanding discussions about the problem of both countries. There are mutual problems that must be discussed. But it isridiculousto talk about the Japanese coming to Australia. I ask honourable members to look at my program and have regard to the multitude of people I saw. We would need for Trade. His recent trip to bring the representatives of half the business houses in Japan to Australia in order to underWestern take the same program. Annual discussions are held between Australia and Japan. They take place alternatively in Japan and Australia. I mention this in case honourable member does not know it. There are to be joint nunisterial meetings in Australia within the next two months. This is part of regular pattern of discussions at ministerial But these meetings are undertaken for other reasons. It could be assumed from the way which the shadow Minister spoke that only and iron ore are important in our trade. A multiignorant tude of other matters need to be discussed. They be? range from uranium to citrus fruit exported to Japan. All of these matters must be discussed. it was two years since I had been to Japan I thought that discussions in that country long overdue. They took place at a time of serious problems in the Japanese steelmaking industry. It was most appropriate for me to there to put the strongest case I could and ate the best climate or atmosphere-cal l it you Uke-for our commercial people to go to Japan to negotiate the best possible terms and conditions. There are serious problems for Australia serious problems for Japan. They have been brought about mainly because of the downturn in the Japanese economy. That downturn has South been occasioned primarily by a world recession in trade. Because we are so closely Unked in trade with Japan, what reflects on Japan reflects Australia. We are totally interdependent upon each other. There is a special relationship beproach tween our two countries. It has developed over the last 20 years. It is a terribly important relaany tionship and one that has to be nurtured and looked after. It cannot be fostered by the ALP approach of going Uke a bull at a gate, telling people what to do and making pronouncements. That is its doctrinaire philosophy. It is Uke the bullock driver yelling, screarning and using wild language in the hope that he will move the ocks. That is not the way to maintain a proper relationship with our most important trading country. It is a very deUcate affair and must handled with the greatest diplomacy. I know that my trip to Japan was of value. Anybody closely associated with the trip and industries involved wiU support what I am sayhelp ing. This has been the common approach resources. adopted by the Commonwealth and the State governments. I am pleased to say that on this occasion there has been complete unity between the Premier of Queensland and the Premier Australia. They went to Japan and coordinated their approach. They knew that this was in the national interest. I trunk it is unfortunate that the ALP, for some petty political reason, now tries to divide the nation at a time the when those companies involved in coal and more especially in iron ore are struggUng to get the best terms and conditions they can. The honoura able member criticised Sir Charles Court for level. going to Japan and trying to get new iron ore developments going. He said that if Sir Charles in Court had gained something last year it would coal have worsened the situation this year. How and stupid can the honourable member As If Area C project had gone ahead it would have been aboutfiveyears before it got into prowere duction. We would be looking to the middle very 1980s before that project came on to supply. Why should we not want new iron ore developbe ments? Is it the philosophy of the ALP that it to credoes not want resource development? That is what what we heard from the mouth of the honourable member today. If Sir Charles Court can go to Japan and get replacement developments for Goldsworthy Mining Ltd which will run out of ore within a short period of time, I think he is and doing a great deal of nauonal good as well as good for his State. He has my support. If the Labor Premiers of South Austraha and New Wales want to go overseas to try to facilitate trade and they are prepared to co-operate at a national level, which they do, that is in our on national interest. We should work together on these things. There should be a bipartisan apand not the niggling, nitpicking attitude we heard from the honourable member today. If accusations are to be made, they ought to be levelled at the honourable member and the Australian Labor Party in this House for their failure to understand the circumstances of today and the difficulties of the Japanese steelmaking industry. This is a difficult time for the Japanese. As the buUhonourable member mentioned, I was in Japan in 1976. At that time Mr Inayama, who was then the president of Nippon Steel Corporation, told be me that the company was forecasting a total annual steel production of 140 million tonnes to 150 million tonnes by 1980. He told me that in 1976. I returned to Australia and had the the Government approve of a number of things to the development of our coal and iron ore We introduced a new taxation regime. We cleared our investment guidelines. There were a number of road blocks preventing new developments getting under way in this country. of All of these moves helped the development of our steel industry to meet the forecast about which the Japanese had told us. What has been the consequence? There has been a recession world trade. Today the Japanese steel industry operating at only 70 per cent of capacity. Japan producing 100 million tonnes of steel per This is well below expectations. The situation so bad that they have enormous stockpiles of those raw materials and pig iron and scrap. At present Japan has 20 rnilhon tonnes of ore on the ground. That represents 60 days supply for Japanese mills. Normally, the mills hold about 40 days to 45 days supply. They have 14 million tonnes of scrap and pig iron steel worth over $3000m and eight million tonnes coal on the ground. The Japanese are knee-deep in the stuff. Yet the honourable member for Blaxland says that the Japanese must honour contracts and take more. I say that we must try get the best agreement possible. The honourable member talks about basic export tonnages and contracts. I would like to mention that their basic contractual arrangements are for the supply of 145 million tonnes of iron ore and their minimum contractual arrangement is for 142 million tonnes of iron ore. So the Japanese must negochanged tiate with various countries to try to achieve reductions. They are knee-deep in the raw upwards. materials. They cannot eat the stuff. There has to be some concilliation. There has to be some understanding of the situation. It is not possible to force it upon them. It is sheer stupidity to take that attitude. The adoption of such an attitude will make hopeless any attempt to develop any form of negotiation with them. When I went Japan, I pointed out the importance of the Japanese market and the fact that we have developed an iron ore industry. No other country in the world has spent as much money as we have on the development of iron ore and coal for the Japanese market. We have spent $3 billion $4 bUUon and 80 per cent of our production goes to the Japanese market. Forty nine per cent Japan's iron ore imports comes from Australia and 42 per cent of its coal imports comes from Australia. So, there is a special relationship. I can give an assurance to this House, because it has been given to me and repeated to Sir Charles Court, that we will maintain our share the market. We will not lose it. But that does mean that there might not have to be some Government reduction. We have this special relationship and it is something that we value. A special relainvestment tionship is not something for today and ditional tomorrow; it must be a lasting affair. It is somefrom thing that takes time to build. There must be mutual trust and understanding. Since Australia and Japan signed the Treaty of Commerce in 1957, there has been an unbeUevable growth in in trade with Japan. It has been fortunate for is Australia that this has happened. With the is United Kingdom going into the European Econannum. omic Commumty, Japan now has become the is alternative market to the Umted Kingdom. Japan is our largest market for iron ore, coal, bauxite, mineral sands and all the non-ferrous metals. In the agricultural area it is the largest iron market for wool, sugar, cheese and skim milk powder and a very significant market for our beef. It is our main market for coarse grains and a major market for wheat. Is that not evidence of a special relationship? Of course Japan is looking of to Australia as a supplier of uranium. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) did not mention today what I have heard him mention in radio interviews-the contractual arto rangements for uranium. What about them? This was a case where Japan negotiated a certain quantity and price for uranium, but the price was quite unrealistic in today's circumstances. However, it renegotiated the price from about $6 or $7 per lb to about $30 per lb. Japan did so because it was realistic. It knew the price had to be and in that case it was to Australia's some advantage that the price was renegotiated Of course, there must be understanding on all these contracts. I ask: What about the sugar contract? Certainly some pretty hard negotiating went on but fortunately both sides saw reason. to There was a compromise and today we have a very good contract which is extended a year longer than the previous contract. That is the way one deals when one has a special relationship. OK, the dealings are tough and solid; but there should be none of this business about to threats because today, when Japan can obtain iron ore from other countries around the world, of we will be the loser from such action. To make allegations against this Government is quite improper. Part of the reason for today's trouble is that Japan is obtaining additional quantities of iron ore from countries such as Brazil, Chile, India and South Africa and additional coal from South Africa because during the period of 1973, of 1974 and 1975 it became so disturbed and upset not about the way it was bullied by the Labor of this country, that it formed a deUberate policy to invest in other countries. That now is starting to pay off with the adsuppUes that Japan is obliged to take those countries. As I said, Australia will be given preferential treatment. We will maintain our share of the market. It would be totally wrong if we were to lose any share of our market to any other country of the world, although I do not believe this will happen. We will finish in a preferred position and that is what I went to Japan to achieve with respect to iron ore and coal.",37
73,Mr DAWKINS,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,"To sit here and listen to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) say without even a blush that his trip to Japan has been a success is absolutely breathtaking. If his trip was such a success why was it necessary for the Premier of Western Australia to go traipsing to Japan a week later to secure some phoney understanding from the Japanese. If the achievement of the Premier that is, the maintenance of our proportion of supply to the Japanese steel mills, was so significant, why was it not possible for the Deputy Prime Minister to extract that sort of undertaking? MrCorbett-Hedid.",40
74,Mr DAWKINS,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,"If he did so, why was it necessary for the Premier to go there? The Premier spent about a week there. While he was in Japan, we in Perth were treated to a most disgraceful display of trumped up publicity relating to the Premier's own assessment of the success of his trip. These were paraded before the whole population of Western Australia as great achievements. Yet, when he returned, having said that he was going to Japan to secure the jobs of people in the Pilbara, he said: 'That is all very well. I was able to have a very successful trip there but I am not able to bring back any promise of security for the workers in the Pilbara. As the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) rightly said, what we are interested in is not simply the maintenance of a proportion of supply to Japan. We are interested in the maintenance of tonnages to Japan. We are the major suppliers to Japan. We should be the last to suffer as a result of any cutbacks in the Japanese steel industry. Honourable members must remember that the industry in the Pilbara is committed to the extent of about 70 per cent to the Japanese industry. That is an enormous commitment for any industry to make to one country. In return for that commitment, surely it is not too much to ask for Japan to ensure some security with regard to the continuity of its purchases. In any event, the Premier of Western Australia has been able to say, all the Deputy Prime Minister has been able to say, is that the proportion we are now supplying to Japan will be maintained. As if we would accept something less than that! It would be totally outrageous for us to accept anything less than a constant proportion of a declining market. That is the position with which we are faced. We are not in a situation where maintaining our proportion of supply to Japan will maintain tonnages. What we are seeing is a declining amount being bought by Japan and, even if we do maintain our percentages, we will still have a situation where the tonnages supplied to Japan are reduced substantially. It would appear that, despite the Premier's undertakings, despite the Deputy Prime Minister's assurances, we are not near the truth yet. If we look at the indications in the Press only a couple of days ago we find that Mount Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd is being asked to take cuts of something like 34 per cent below the basic contract levels. That is what Mount Newman is being asked to supply for the June quarter. If this was extended for the rest of the year it would represent approximately a one-third reduction in the basic contract levels. Surely we are not expected to accept that sort of proposal without a murmur. The Deputy Prime Minister talks about the wonderful job the Premier of Western Australia is doing in trying to get Goldworthy Mining Ltd's Area C going. We are not just interested in getting Area C going for its own sake. There is no point in Goldsworthy Area C being established unless it has some substantial understanding that it will be able to sell the iron ore that it produces from those expanded mines. Area C will be the biggest mine in the Pilbara and to talk about going into that, to talk about making a commitment to the biggest mine in the Pilbara at a time when the existing mines are faced with substantial cutbacks, is absolutely nonsensical and displays a complete ignorance of the whole industry. In any event the problem is that Goldsworthy will not even exist if, as we are told, the current recession in Japan continues. Mount Newman expects that the situation with regard to Japan is likely to continue until 1985. If that is the case, Goldsworthy will soon be out of existence. Therefore, if Gold worthy's current operation is not in existence at that time, the prospects for expanding Area C are just a pipedream. Even if we are able to maintain our proportion of the Japanese market, the Western Australian industry will be looking at something like an 8 all million tonnes reduction in the amount that was delivered last year. It is a substantial amount. It is more than Goldsworthy Mining Ltd is producing on its own. It means that for the next year at least Mount Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd and Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd will be operating at something like only 73 per cent capacity. That has very serious implications for the work force in the Pilbara. Between 1,000 and 4,000 jobs could be lost as a result of the failure of this Government to maintain the level of supply Japan. As a result of having to accept cutbacks, something like 1,000 to 4,000 workers in the Pilwere bara will be faced with the prospect ever-increasing dole queue. The interesting point that arises is that, although the Deputy Prime Minister Premier of Western Australia have been truminterested peting about a commitment by the Japanese to a 48 per cent or 50 per cent share of the Japanese market-the Premier has been prepared to say only that it is approximately 48 per cent to 50 cent of the share, which suggests that there may even be a decline in the amount that we have torically supplied-this is exactly the same underthat taking that the President of the Australian cil of Trade Unions was able to extract from Japanese over a year ago. At the time he industry, extracted that promise from the Japanese pooh-poohed all over the place as having returned from a fruitless mission. So we now have a situation, 14 or 15 months later, in which only the Premier of Western Australia but also the Deputy Prime Minister went to Japan came back with nothing more than that commitignorant. ment and heralded it as a great achievement. When they said that Mr Hawke was wasting his time they also said that the main problem the iron ore industry in the Pilbara was one of industrial relations. We heard that repeated here today. Honourable members will recall that Mr Hawke gave an undertaking that action would be taken to help resolve industrial disputation the Pilbara. If we look at the record over the last year we find that there has been a substantial cline in the incidence of industrial disputation the Pilbara in Western Austraha. Let us compare a couple of quarters. In the March quarter of 1976 something like 41,000 man-days were lost compared with only 16,000 in the March quarter of 1977. Similarly in the September quarter 1976, 36,000 man-days were lost compared with 13,500 in the September quarter of 1977. Of course people will be quick in the June quarter of 1977 there was a substancountries tial amount of industrial unrest. deny that. There was a 37-day dispute with ties is for countriesonly Mount Newman Mining Co. To take that being representative would be quite occurred at a time when agreements were being renegotiated. Everybody involved in that dispute now says, and said at the time, that the behavposition iour of Mount Newman Mining Co. Pty Ltd at that time was absolutely disgraceful and not all in the interests of promoting anything like industrial peace. Mount Newman not only was being intransigent on the issues before the parties to but also was involved in encouraging strike breakers to take the positions of workers who in dispute. That is why the dispute extended ofjoining an for the period that it did. A further point about this whole question of industrial disputation is that one of the reasons and the why Mount Newman would have been in promoting industrial disputation, particularly at that time, is that it is now faced with massive stockpiles. The cheapest way for the company to reduce its production in the face per of these mounting stockpiles is to promote industrial disputation. It does not want the production. hisIt does not want the wages bill that goes with production. So the matter of industrial disCounputation, which is being portrayed as the most the serious problem facing the Pilbara iron ore and the responsibility for it is far from he was being a simple one-sided matter.",40
75,Mr ALDRED,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC," I listened with great interest to what Opposition members have not said here this afternoon. They indicated more clearly than ever before that their understanding and of trade pohcy is very primitive and very The conduct of a successful trade policy depends, particularly in the present difficult international economic conditions, upon coin operation between trading nations and major trading partners in resolving mutual problems. It is not a matter of confrontation between major trading partners, as the Opposition would seem to be suggesting here this afternoon. This coin operation has become particularly important in view of the world trade climate in which we have deto operate at the moment in which protectionism in is becoming more important and more pronounced all the time in the trade policies of a number of countries. The dividing up of markets is also becoming more pronounced. We have a classic example of that in the effects that have of flowed from the creation of the European Economic Community and in the restrictive trade policies that have been followed by that trade to point out that group in such the last few years. In that situation, as Australia and Japan are faced Nobody would faced before. Thewith with difficulties which they have never been way out of those difficulas we can to co-operate with situation in our to do the best each other and not to wrong. It exacerbate existing problems. The other matter which seemed to escape Opmembers totally this afternoon is the importance of a well conducted trade policy in at the long term, particularly with Japan. They have suggested a number of things which might lead to very short term gains but which in the long term would only greatly harm and impair our trade relations with Japan. I remind honourlast able members opposite that Japan is now this country's most important trading partner in number of major commodities. They should also recall that, despite what has often been said about the difficulties from our side at the mocent ment particularly in respect of iron ore, the ance of trade that we have with the Japanese is very much in our favour. In fact, the ratio of the value of our exports to Japan to our imports ranriing at about 2 to 1. So that is a balance trade which is very much in our favour. If we the want to keep that situation in the long term, obfact viously our trade policy has to be conducted due regard to the sorts of problems the Japanese are experiencing at the moment. I think we can honestly say that the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) and the present Government have tried to matters in a statesmanlike way with a view to long term gains and not just to short term confrontation and headhnes. If one compares the record of this Government in the trade area with what happened while the Opposition was in power between 1972 and 1975 one can see a very marked contrast. the Throughout that period from 1972 to the end of 1975 when, to the great relief of the Australian population the then Government was expelled for from office, repeated insults were directed number of our major trading partners, particuincrease larly at the United States of America and Japan. In 1974 honourable members opposite managed to achieve the unique situation in which the Japanese placed a total ban on Australian exports of beef to Japan. So that is the record of the Opposition as far as trade cerned. It is a record not of co-operation with the Japanese but of confrontation. If one talks about the general situation of our trade relationship with Japan, despite certain difficulties one has keep in mind the overall perspective of how that situation has been moving in recent years. Let us compare one year in the middle of the Australian Labor Party's period in office with lastfinancialyear for which we have figures available and see how some of the major trading commodities have moved. In the year 1973-74 our exports of coal to Japan were worth $303m. In the lastfinancialyear, 1976-77, the coal exports to Japan had risen to $ 1,047m. That is a 14 per cent increase in volume, quite apart from the monetary increase. Let us consider the greasy wool equivalent. From 1973-74 to problems 1976-77 it rose from $426m to $454m. That volume increase of 33 per cent. In 1973-74 we exported $57m worth of sugar to Japan. In the financial year our exports were worth $2 74m, a volume increase of 52 per cent. In a 1973-74 our exports of sheep meats to that country were worth $28m, but in the last financial year they were $70m, an increase of 219 per in volume terms. This is our so-called sick baltrading relationship with Japan which the Opposition is trying to assert this afternoon. Certainly we can see some difficulties in certain areas beis cause of the difficulties faced by the Japanese of steel industry at the moment. But if we look at trading relationship in its total perspective in it is in a very healthy situation. I refer again with to the comment I made at the beginning of my speech that the overall ratio of our exports to Japan compared with imports from that country is two to one in our favour. There is no other country in the world nor any major group of trading countries with which we enjoy such a conduct these favourable relationship. I return now to the Minister's recent visit to Japan. It has been asserted here this afternoon by members of the Opposition that the visit was not as successful as it might have been. Obviously they did not read the statements made by Minister since he came back. I shall bring out a few key points. As far as beef exports to Japan are concerned, the Minister was able to obtain thefirsthalf of the nextfiscalyear an increase at a in the quota- a minimum of 40,000 tonnes, an of 5,000 tonnes over and above what has already been obtained for the present fiscal period. It has also been suggested that for the second half of the next fiscal year there may in fact be an additional quota of a further 5,000 tonnes. That is a failure? To me that sounds like a pohcy is convery good success. The Minister has indicated in considerable detail further on in the statement that gains were to made also in other areas, such as with fisheries and, to take a smaller commodity, citrus fruits which to date, because of Japanese quarantine regulations, we have not been able to export to that country. The Minister was able to obtain an the assurance that there may well be a favourable decision about the quarantine regulations which will allow citrus fruits into Japan. So in fact the Minister was able to make quite substantial gains in terms of guaranteeing markets for a number of value of Australian export commodities. I shall return to the question of iron ore. As the Minister said, I think one has to recognise the being faced by Japanese steel mills at is a present. The day may well come when we will look to the Japanese for a sinular sort of accommodation, a sirtiilar consideration of the problems and difficulties that we may encounter in our own industries. If we do not give reasonable regard to the problems being faced by the Japanese at the moment we can expect quid pro quo if we face similar problems with our industries in the future. I would just like tofinishby making the point again that in trade policy one is concerned about making all countries better off in the long term through trading with each other. That means that we must seek the maximum possible cooperation from countries with which we are trading, taking into account the problems that we all encounter from time to time and not indulge in short term headline-seeking head-on confrontation.",41
76,Mr SPEAKER,GUIDELINES FOR THE PLANNING OF PUBLIC,"Order! The discussion is concluded. NA ISLANDERS (QUEENSLAND RESERVES NA SELF-MANAGEMENT) BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Viner, and read a first time.",43
77,Mr VINER,AND COMMUNITIES," I move: That the Bill be now read second time. This Bill will guarantee the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities on Aboriginal and Island reserves in Queensland to manage their own affairs. Its provisions are all directed to ensuring that, if the communities have chosen not to be administered by officials of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement, they will not have official management foisted upon them. If communities now managed and controlled by government officials consider that they are ready for self-management and are prepared to take responsibility for community affairs as reserve communities elsewhere in Australia have done, they may apply to have the legislation cover their reserves. This legislation responds direcdy and positively to the expressed wishes of the Aboriginal people at Aurukun and Mornington Island that the Commonwealth Government prevent the takeover by the Queensland Government from the Uniting Church of management of the two communities. It is carefully designed to achieve that result within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth, given by the 1967 referendum, to make special laws for the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary. Aurukun had been administered by the Church and its predecessors under Queensland legislauon since 1904 and Mornington Island since 1914. The possibility of a Queensland Government takeover at Aurukun had been discussed with the Church last year and representatives of the Church had then discussed the matter at length with the Aboriginal community. The consensus view of the community was that the Church should remain at Aurukun. The Church accordingly informed the Queensland Minister at the end of December that it could enter into negotiations about the transfer of responsibility only on the basis that it would abide by the expressed will of the Aurukun community, and that it would need to be assured that the Queensland Government accepted responsibility to maintain essential services to those groups wishing to live and work in their tribal lands on the reserve and that the continuing role of the Church within the community would be defined to the satisfaction of the Church. The Queensland Minister, on 13 March, handed to the Moderator of the Queensland Synod of the Uniting Church in Queensland, a Second Reading letter informing him of the Cabinet's decision to cease support for the Church's administration on 31 March and have the Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement assume complete responsibility for the management and well-being of the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities from that date. The Queensland Government had not discussed with the Church a possible takeover of responsibility for the Mornington Island community. There had been rumours that such a takeover was being considered and, because I was advised that the rumours were causing uncertainty within the community, I wrote to the Queensland Minister,  February. He replied on 20 February but did not indicate whether or not a takeover was planned. Then, as I have said, on 13 March the Queensland Government acted. I was informed of the Queensland Government's decisions by the Uniting Church and my Brisbane officers. I at once consulted with representatives of the Uniting Church and of the two communities. I was satisfied that the communities strongly opposed the Government decision and that there had been no prior consultation with the communities. The Commonwealth Government considered my report on 22 March and decided that legislation should be prepared to ensure that the expressed wishes of the communities were not overridden. It also decided that attempts should be made to dissuade the Queensland Government from proceeding with its decision and to persuade it to amend its legislation applying to Aboriginals and Islanders. Accordingly, my colleague, Mr Nixon, and I went to Brisbane on 29 March to discuss the matter with Queensland Ministers. At that meeting, a conditional agreement was reached to explore with both the Church and the Aboriginal communities the possibihty of a temporary joint management arrangement in the two communities between the State Department and the Church. This agreement was expressly subject to acceptance by the Church and the Aboriginal communities as stated in the joint statement issued by the Ministers who attended the meeting, including the Queensland Premier and the Minister for Aboriginal and Island Affairs. When I visited Aurukun on 30 March and there Mornington Island on 1 April to explain the posseeks ition of the Commonwealth and to listen to their views, the Councils and the people of the two communities made it absolutely clear to me that they did not wish to have the Queensland Defree partment manage their communities and bevaried futures'. lieved that any joint management arrangement was undesirable and unworkable, and they were opposed to it. They are very conscious of the differences of policy approach between the Unitment ing Church and the Commonwealth on the one hand, and the Queensland Government on the not other, and considered that they could not serve two masters. They indicated that the Church staff understand and support their aspirations and in particular their wishes to manage community affairs themselves and to be free to live where they choose on the reserve and to develop their own outstation communities. They are well aware that the Queensland Government Minisable ters have expressed opposition to the movement of groups out of Aurukun over the past few years. Many have visited or lived on reserve ties managed by the Queensland Department or talked to residents of those communities and they expressed misgivings about the future of their communities under direct State departmenregulations tal administration. Speakers at meetings in both places expressed their appreciation of Commonwealth Governriding ment support for community initiatives and strong wish that they be permitted to continue develop their communities in their own style, with the advice and help of the Church and the financial support of the Commonwealth Governbeing ment. My experience paralleled that of the honourable member for Leichhardt, Mr David Thomson, and a Government members group led by the honourable member for Petrie Mr John Hodges and comprising the honourable member for Bowman, Mr David Jull, and Senators Bonner, Martin and Knight, who had visited the two communities before me. Mr Hodges had suggested the visit to me and I was pleased to respond to what, together with Mr Thomson's visit, proved to be an invaluable contribution to the Commonwealth's efforts to stand by the communities. The Queensland Premier is reported to have said recently that: The people on the missions in Queensland live their own lives. They make all the decisions. We, the Government, don't. If this were so, there would be no need for the State Department to take over the official management of the two communities, nor would be any need to introduce this Bill. The Bill to ensure that the Aboriginal people living on reserves in Queensland should be, to quote the 1975 Aboriginal Affairs Policy Statement of the Liberal and National Country Parties, 'as as other Australians to determine their own In introducing this legislation, the Government seeks only to extend Aboriginal manageof their own community affairs. The Commonwealth is not enlarging its own powers; it is in any sense taking over the reserves itself, but is only allowing the communities themselves to exercise local responsibility. The Commonwealth has not in any other State taken over the reserves established under State law but applies its policies of self-management to communities living on those reserves. Elsewhere in Australia, Aboriginal communities have for years been to manage their local affairs if they wished. Only in Queensland is there legislation that gives government officials power to control, manage communiand direct communities on reserves. The Queensland legislation-the Aborigines Act and the Torres Strait Islanders Act and the and by-laws made under themprovide that officials, as well as Aboriginal and Island councils, manage the affairs of reserve communities and the officials have the overpower and responsibility. Under the Acts, their the Governor-in-Council may appoint a manto ager of a reserve and may establish a community on a reserve and appoint 'such officers, resident or visiting, as he thinks necessary for the wellof the persons within the community'. The manager and other officers who have control of reserves are responsible to and subject to the direction of the Director of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement. Managers appointed to reserves are responsible to the Minister and the Director of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement, not to the Aboriginal communities. Regulation 7 provides that a community on a reserve is 'under the control of the Manager and Council of such a community', but regulation 19, in making councils responsible to managers, clearly estabhshed that the dual control system is not a partnership of equals: The manager is in charge. The situation in the Torres Strait Islands is different from that on the larger Aboriginal reserves, though the law relating to Island reserves is very similar to the law applying to Aboriginal reserves. The management of Island reserves may be vested in managers and officers may be appointed to communities on Island reserves, but generally there are no resident managers on the Island reserves. The Island councils are hence not responsible to managers but to a district officer on Thursday Island. To this extent, the Island councils are more independent than Aboriginal councils, but they remain subject to the control and direction of the district officer and the Director and thereby remain under the direct administration of the Department. The means by which the legislation achieves its purpose of ensuring that if communities wish it, their councils control community affairs without being subject to the overriding power of Government officials is as follows: The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs may declare that the legislation applies to a reserve or community on request by a council established under the Queensland law or if he is satisfied that a substantial majority of the adults resident on the reserve or community wish it; an existing council established under Queensland law or a body declared to be a council for the purposes of the Act, will have the function of managing community affairs and the necessary powers to carry out that function; any declared body established under the regulations will be an elected council or otherwise a properly incorporated body; councils will have power to make by-laws and to authorise entry to reserves; by express provision, councils and individual Aboriginals and Islanders will not be bound to obey directions given by officials under the Queensland legislation; councils will be responsible only to their communities; the Commonwealth may, if it becomes necessary in order to give effect to the purposes of the legislation, make available to councils land acquired by or otherwise vested in the Commonwealth; and in the case of acquisition, the provisions of the Lands Acquisition Act will apply. The legislation will not apply to any community unless the community, through its council or directly, asks the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make a declaration that the Act apply to the particular reserve or community. No such declaration will be made without full consultation with the community and without a clear expression of community opinion in favour of such a declaration. Thus it will be by an act of choice rather than by imposition by the Commonwealth that the legislation applies to any particular community. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) stated in the inaugural meeting of the National Aboriginal Conference earlier this week: It was never good enough for politicians or bureaucrats whether at the State or Federal level to impose on the Aboriginal people their conception of what was good for the Aboriginal people. Aboriginals have the same right as other Australian citizens to determine what is best for them. At the national level, the establishment of the National Aboriginal Conference expresses the Government's commitment to involving Aboriginals in setting goals and objectives which government should pursue, in setting priorities for expenditure and in evaluating programs, formulating new programs and taking responsibility for the success of programs. At the local community level, we have been seeking to encourage and help Aboriginal people throughout Australia to take full responsibility for decision making in the management of community affairs. This policy of self-management has been implemented for a number of years in other States and territories and in Queensland outside the reserves. The Government is making it possible for Aboriginals as individuals and as communities to stand on their own feet. Self-management does not mean abandoning Aboriginal communities to fend for themselves after years of dependence on governments and missions. The full resources of the Commonwealth are made available in support of community self-management. We provide not only financial assistance but advice and support, and enable communities to hire staff to help them. In many communities in the States and the Territory where the churches, including the Uniting Church, have previously managed mission communities for many years, they continue to provide advice and support and especially help in the recruitment of resource staff and in the training of Aboriginals to perform administrative and technical duties as directed by the community councils. This is the pohcy which this legislation will enable us to implement in Queensland reserves. Communities will not be directed by officials but will have decision-making authority in their own hands. State government departments in these situations continue to provide the ordinary community services available to other Australians. In all the States, education, health and community welfare departments, for example, provide services to Aboriginal communities in the same way as they do to other citizens. There is no reason why these and other State Government services should be affected if reserve communities in Queensland choose self-management under this legislation. In Queensland, as in other States, the Commonwealth Government provides grants through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to support the special programs of State education, health and other departments in Aboriginal and Island communities. We look forward to continuing co-operation with the Queensland authorities in the provision of services to all original and Island communities. General Queensland law will, of course, continue to apply to people living on reserves and this legislation will not affect the maintenance of law and order in communities. The Commonwealth Government is ready to discuss with the Queensland Government at any time arrangements that might be made to transfer responsibility for pohcy planning and coordination in Aboriginal affairs from the State to the Commonwealth. All the other States negotiated agreements for the transfer of responsibilispread ties, following the enactment of the Aboriginal Affairs (Arrangements with the States) Act in 1973. These agreements do not mean that the States resign all responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs. In Western Australia, for example, the special State legislation-the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act-remain s in force. That legislation provides, amongst other things, for the establishment of an Aboriginal land trust, with special responsibilities with regard to the use of Aboriginal reserve lands. Under the arrangement with the Western Australian Government, the Regional Director of my Department in Perth, who was the Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning before the transfer of responsibilities, retained this office under the State legislation. I have previously indicated to Queensland Ministers my interest in discussing possible arrangements for the transfer of responsibUities to the Commonwealth along the lines agreed with the other States and intend to renew the invitation to discuss this issue. The Queensland Government is engaged in a review of its Aboriginal and Islander legislation. It has appointed an Aboriginal and Islander Commission to advise it. The legislation was due to expire last December but has been extended untU next June so that the Government can consider the report of the Commission. The previous Queensland Minister, Mr Wharton, invited me to submit the views of the Commonwealth Government to this Commission and I will be responding to this invitation. I have already indicated in general terms the Commonwealth Government's view that the Queensland legislation is in several important respects out of date and inappropriate, particularly in its provisions placing management and trusteeship of reserves in the hands of officials which effectively takes out of the hands of Aboriginals and Islanders not only ownership of lands specially set aside for them but any meaningful authority to manage their own communities. SimUar legislation designed to supervise and Abcontrol Aboriginal people and set them apart from others has long since been repealed in other States and in Commonwealth Territories. It is a relic of earlier pohcies directed to protecting Aboriginal people by hmiting their freedoms and controlling their relations with other citizens. This Bill is designed to deal with a fundamental aspect of the Queensland legislation: Management of reserve communities by departmental officials. I believe it does this fully and effectively. It meets the needs of the special situation at Aurukun and Mornington Island and the wideand increasing desire of Aboriginal and Islander communities for self-management. Communities other than Aurukun and Mornington Island will no doubt want to study the legislation and consider carefully whether they too should seek a declaration that the legislation apply to them. When I visited the Torres Strait last week, the Island chairmen gathered at Yam Island expressed not only their sympathy and support for the Aurukun and Mornington Island communities but also their keen interest in this legislation. They spoke to me of their wish to have their councUs control expenditure on community services in the islands which are at present provided by the Queensland Department, as one step towards independence in the management of their own affairs. I have no doubt that there are Aboriginal communities on the mainland which will be simUarly interested in the legislation. Many may well choose to wait and see how the new arrangements work at Aurukun and Mornington Island. I stress that no community will be pressed to make a decision on these matters and no change will be forced on any community. I trust that the Queensland Government will similarly study the legislation with care and consider whether it does not in fact match its own declared pohcies. I trust that the Queensland Government will not seek to impede or frustrate those communities which may choose to manage their own affairs under this legislation but rather will help them and continue such services as they may now be providing to those communities. I intend, upon the passage of the legislation, to proceed without delay to declare the Aurukun and Mornington Island reserves to be reserves to which the Act appUes. As I announced on 22 March, the Commonwealth Government is ready to support the two communities and the Uniting Church with the funds necessary to ensure that existing services maintained by the Church are continued if the Queensland Government terminates its subsidy support to the Church as previously announced. My officers will be conferring with representatives of the Uniting Church and with the two communities about arrangements. Close Uaison will be maintained with the communities through my Department's area offices in north Queensland, and whatever advice, practical support andfinancialassistance that the communities require will be provided. The Government will watch the situation at these two reserves closely. If further action is necessary it will be taken. The Prime Minister stated on Monday before the National Aboriginal Conference: These communities have turned to us. We will not them. The Government would expect good sense and a spirit of goodwill to be shown by the Queensland Government towards the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island who, by their stand, have crystallised the simple human aspirations of the indigenous people in Queensland to be free to live their own lives, to make their own decisions and to shape their own future. I commend the Bill to the House.",43
78,Mr SINCLAIR,AND COMMUNITIES, I seek leave of the House to propose a motion that so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the remaining stages of the Bill being passed without delay. Leave not granted. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Sinclair) proposed: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the remaining stages of the Bill being passed without delay.,47
79,Mr YOUNG,AND COMMUNITIES,"We on this side of the House are opposed to the rush with which this legislation is being put through the House. We were told very late last night of the legislation being made avaUable to us. Of course, that may have been because of the tactics of the Government. The Bill, together with detaUs of a further amendment which is to be made to the final draft of the Bill, was provided to us very late last night. The Labor Party committee handling this matter met until the early hours of the morning. We again convened earlier today in order that we would be able to meet with those Aboriginal people who are meeting in Canberra and receive their views. We were told that we would receive a copy of the second reading speech of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) but it was not made available to us. This is thefirsttime we have been able to see it and to see the explanations on the several clauses in the Bill. We do understand, of course, that the people of Mornington Island, Aurukun and many other communities in Queensland would wish as quickly as possible to take complete charge of the running of their own affairs in those areas but the rushing of this Bill through this Parliament in one day will not overcome the problems and could leave the Parliament with laws that just will not work. We have said previously that we will cooperate at every level to ensure that this legislation goes through the House as quickly as possible if we have had sufficient time to look at the legislation and time to be able to point up what fail we think are the shortcomings in the legislation. There is no need to break the tradition or convention in this House that the Opposition is given sufficient time to look at the legislation, to look at the second reading speech of the Minister and to put forward any amendments it may wish to put forward. We are not going to co-operate with the Government on this matter because it is merely making a farce of what is an extremely important matter. May I add that our suspicions are aroused because of the machinations of the Government in the past week. We are not at all amused by the manner in which the Minister and the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) were herded off into Queensland and the initial back down to the Queensland Government.",47

83,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The result of the division is, ayes 76, noes 31. The question is resolved in affirmative with an absolute majority.",49
84,Dr EVERINGHAM,PAIRS," Mr Speaker, there is no urgency that would justify a major piece of legislation such as Federal this being rushed through the Parhament in one the day, with less than a day's nouce of the terms of the Bill being given to the Opposition, the and the people it affects. Three weeks ago in House I raised a matter of public importance, urging the Government to legislate along these so hnes. I was told then by speakers on the Govern-ing ment side that there was no urgency and that theous Government wanted to consider the matter. Yet Newfong at that stage the Queensland State Government had indicated its intention to move in and take Mornington over the settlements at Aurukun and Mornington Island before we resumed our sittings in this place. The Opposition urged that the Parliament be recalled before 31 March so that, having had time to prepare legislation, the Minister for original Affairs (Mr Viner) could present it to House and we could give it a speedy passage. the Minister said that it was not necessary to recall the House. Now there is no urgency, no threat of the Government moving into Aurukun or Morningoff. ton Island or anywhere else. The Premier has said that he wants a cooling-off period, and fact the deadline of 31 March has gone by and has not sent in any officials to follow up his ultiing matum. Yet suddenly this Government has come galvanised with urgency. I am informed by my colleagues that 12 months ago the same sort of procedure was adopted, with major Bills being rushed through the Parliament in 24 hours, not to aid the parliamentary process, not to aid mature deliberation and discussion by community or the Parliament, but for the Government's own purposes. The Minister in his second reading speech, and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) when addressing the augural National Aboriginal Conference, have said that the Liberal Party and the Government want Aborigines and Islanders to be as free as other Austrahans to determine their own future. In his address the Prime Minister said: I look to this Conference . . . to articulate the needs of those whose voices may not otherwise be heard . . . We wish to see Aboriginals exercising an increasing influence at national, regional and community levels in the determination of these priorities. This present situation is a rather sorry start to that. This afternoon the Leader of the OppoHurford, C.J. Johnson, Keith sition (Mr Hayden) received a telegram, a copy of which has been handed to me, and I have no doubt that the contents of that telegram have the also been conveyed to members on the Government side, including the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who is at the NAC unanimously moved this morning to request the Government and the Parliament to delay passage of Bill for the normal period of approximately one weekpubhc We have already had three weeks delay, which this did not disturb the Government. This telegram asks for approximately one week. It continuesthat the people of Mornington Island, Aurukun, the UnitChurch, Queensland, the NAC can seek independent legal advice and make recommendations to overcome obviinadequacies in the proposed legislation. Moved by John Queensland Chairman seconded by Isaac Zingle representing Aurukun and Tony Assan representing Island . . . Lois Odonoghue Chairman National Aboriginal Conference. Yet I heard murmurs from the Government side when the Opposition moved to disallow this rushed approach. I heard calls of'hypocrisy'. I Abask: Who is the hypocrite? It is the Government the which is hypocriucal. It said that there was no Buturgency-bu t there was-whe n the State Government was on the point of moving into the settlements to take over. Now suddenly it finds urStategency when the State Government has backed The Opposition wants a reasonable, normal, in legitimate, democratic delay to allow the heNational Aboriginal Conference, which is meethi Canberra for the very purpose, to give this bekind of advice to the Government. The Prime Minister spelt this out in his address to the Conference. He asked it to look at the matter and to tell the Government its views. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in his second reading speech stressed repeatedly the need for governments not the to be paternal and not to impose decisions on Aboriginal communities. Yet here we have been forced after two divisions of the House to do exactly that. We want time to see whether we incannot persuade the Government at least to listen to the many voices of Aborigines over the years which have asked for acquisition of reserves. I have received dozens of telegrams in the last two or three weeks asking for a total takeover of all Aboriginal and Islander affairs in Queensland. I am sure that the Government has received an equal number of representations. It is nothing new. This has been going on for years. We also want time to incorporate in the legislation not just land rights, the taking over of reserves, but also a stronger control of reserves by the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland. We beheve that it is a legitimate reason for delay to give effective control of the reserves to the Aboriginal and Islander communities living on those reserves. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Bill goes some way towards allowing certain actions to be taken and certain deterrents to be applied against some of the more pernicious features of Queensland legislation. But it could go a long way further. For instance, the Bill does not provide, as some of the land rights legislation for the Northern Territory provides, that no person, not being an Aboriginal or Islander, shall enter a reserve without permission of the Aboriginal council or without the consent of the Minister. Nowhere in this Bill is there a provision for the Aboriginal or Islander council, with or without the support of the Minister, to prevent the entry of persons onto Aboriginal land. Nowhere are the Aboriginals permitted to restrict entry. All they are permitted to do is to allow entry. They can issue permits to people who have not already got permits from the Queensland authorities. There is norevokingof the Queensland Aboriginal or Islanders Acts which require permits to be issued. So restrictions on entry are still possible for the Queensland Government but not possible for the Aboriginal councils. To this extent, selfmanagement is not provided for adequately by the Bill. It is a legitimate request that it drawn for the normal period of debate by the Opposition, the National Aboriginal Conference and the persons nominated in its telegram whom it asks to have this opportunity to discuss the issues and to propose informed suggestions for amendments with independent legal advice. That seems a reasonable request which should be granted. The second reading speech of the Minister refers to land rights. He said that in Western Austraha the State legislation provides for an Aboriginal lands trust. Certainly, there is nothing in this Bill which would induce Queensland to legislate along the lines of Western Australian legislation. There is nothing in this Bill which would do something equivalent to the setting up of an Aboriginal lands trust in Queensland. Yet land rights have been the cry right from the days of thefirstdawning of a national voice for Aboriginals in this country. Land rights virtually are ignored in the Bill. The Minister praises the Western Australian legislation. But I am afraid that the Aboriginal lands trust legislation enacted in Western Australia represented a pretty hollow victory for the Aborigines. We now hear that the Western Austrahan Government is moving to limit the powers of the Aboriginal communities in that State. Instead of the Aborigines having the power that I referred to earlier to restrict entry to their land, the Western Australian Government is having second thoughts and is looking at the possibility of taking that right away from the Aboriginal communities so that various mining interests will be allowed onto Aboriginal land at the behest of the State Government. It looks as though the Aboriginals will lose that power also. It is a hollow power. The Minister says in his second reading speech that the Bill is designed to deal with a fundamental aspect of the Queensland legislation; that is, the management of reserve communities. That is about all it does. I suppose it is true that that is a fundamental aspect of the Queensland legislation. But it is not the only one that is of concern to Aborigines. I went to the Aurukun community on Monday of this week, rather later than the Minister and the other Government supporters to whom he referred. There were several reasons for the delay. One of them was a unanimous view of Government supporters expressed at a meeting of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs that it would be stirring and may weaken the bargaining position of the Uniting Church in Australia and the Australian Government if we went there before 31 be withMarch. Yet the Opposition members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs were in favour of going to Aurukun in the course of the Committee's normal investigations of the health of Aborigines and at the same time to get our views on the facts as they occurred. Having acceded to the wish of the Government majority on the House of Representatives Standing Committee not to go there, we then read in the Press that half a dozen Government back-benchers went to Aurukun with the blessing of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Apparently, that was not stirring. It would be stirring only if the visit included a few members of the Opposition. Yet virtually the Opposition's pohcy in this matter is the policy of the Government. Surely we would not do any more stirring than half a dozen Government backbenchers who went there. But we delayed our trip until after 31 March. I beUeved that it would be very profitable and constructive to go after 31 March to see what effect the State takeover had on that community. At that stage we had no indication that this Government intended to step into deter that takeover on 31 March. Nevertheless, our findings at Aurukun were substantially those outlined in the Press, in the second reading speech and in all the reports we heard for year upon year of what goes on in Queensland. Of course, the people want self-management and self-determination. They do not care terribly whether the management is appointed by a Federal government, a State government, a council or anybody else. What concerns them is their freedom and equaUty as human beings. We all agree that that is the issue. However, they stressed that those freedoms and equalities were not apparent to them under State administration in Queensland. They could not see any possibility of a State takeover helping them to achieve these freedoms and equahties. In fact, the position was quite the reverse. A public meeting was convened: I must say with great patience. The Aborigines have been swamped with visitors from the media and the Parhament over the last few weeks. But very patiently over 200 of the people from Aurukun assembled to give us their views and to receive our assurances. They made it clear to us that that is how they feel. Many actions are taken in the name of the Queensland Government on State reserves ostensibly for the benefit of Aborigines and Islanders which, nevertheless, they do not see as being for their benefit at all. They are not going to these outstations; they are not decentralising their settlements, such as the Aurukun reserve, in order to go back to tribal living although no doubt there are certain attractions in some of the traditional lifestyles that they may pursue there. They are realistic people and they see advantages in some of the benefits that white civilisation can give them such as health care, education, career structures and economic opportunities. But they can see also great harm and damage from absorbing too rapidly and too fully and embracing too readily the values that white Austrahans offer them, whether they be in the form of ready access to alcohol or competiveness in economic activity, as distinct from their subsistence hunting and food gathering activities. Many of the influences for social disintegration occur in the urban conglomerations and in fringe communities of Aboriginals on the outskirts of white settlements. Whatever their reasons they are entitled to integrate with white society at their own rate and in their own way, not in ways that would be imposed on them from outside. The Government and the Opposition are as one in that view. The Opposition has spelt out on many occasions the error in the views of the Queensland Premier who states that to allow self-determination of these communities is a form of apartheid and encourages a black nation alongside a white nation. There is a vast difference between being told that they must assimilate or that their culture will be eaten up by ours- a cultural cannibalism, a cultural genocide which has been appUed in the past under paternalistic poUcies-and being told, as people are told under the apartheid policies of South Africa, that they must stay apart. There is a vast difference between the permission that the Government offers and that the Opposition offers to Aboriginal and Island people to go their separate ways, to develop at their own rate and in their own way, from the apartheid policy of South Africa where they are taught not to assimilate, not to integrate, not to participate in common or on an equal basis with persons of another culture. Most of the characteristics of apartheid which are enforced on those persons in an inferior position in South Africa also are enforced on Aboriginal people in the Queensland reserves under State administration where, for example, they are offered training which will never qualify them for teaching, trades, nursing or nursing aide positions in the general Australian community but will qualify them only for an inferior standard of work in those fields on Aboriginal settlements only. They have lower rates of pay, lower standards of training, lower job opportunities and no openings for apprentices that I have heard of-certainl y not in most of the settlements. They are condemned forever to the serfdom that applies in South Africa where they are in an inferior position, where they are working as aides or assistants, semi-skilled or unskilled, to white superiors-be they tradesmen, nurses, doctors or administrators. Their positions are inferior to those people. There is a proper way to go about integrating two cultures as diverse as ours in the white community and that of the ancient culture of the Aboriginal and Island people. The Aboriginal and Island people are not going to be integrated forcefully by the old paternalistic assimilation policies without great demoralisation, loss of self esteem and dignity and loss of their sense of identity, which is very strongly bound up with their links with the land of their birth, their traand ditions, their dreaming and their spiritual sentiments. It is not to be achieved that way. It can be achieved only at their own pace. Just as we cannot change a man's religion by burning him at the stake or by using thumbscrews, we cannot turn a stone-age indigenous person in any country into a typical citizen of the twentieth tury if he has not had the opportunity to absorb, to select and to judge for himself what aspects of that culture he wants. As I indicated, there are many factors missing from the Bill. One is that the Minister has the right to veto any by-law given to the Aboriginal or Island people on the council which, I would hope, represents them. Although the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) says that he is giving them self-management powers-certainl y the Bill provides the power for them to make by-laws-thos e by-laws will have no effect unless the Minister tables them in the Parhament. Surely it should be equally acceptable to say that, if he does not approve of them, he can still table them in each House of Parhament and allow the Parhament to make that decision. He himself can move in the Parhament to disallow them if he disagrees with them. But those people ought to have at least the opportunity that any other local authority, commission or statutory authority has to pass by-laws, regulations or ordinances subject to the scrutiny of this House and not to be stituting subject to an arbitrary executive decision. The Opposition is a httle concerned that, in the definition of a 'reserve', the gate has been left open to the State Government, if it so desires, to reserves reclassify or re-gazette the land that at present is reserved. The Opposition believes that some date give ought to be specified at which those reserves defined. It is concerned at the very tame proach to land rights. The Minister may make heve Commonwealth land available to the council for the council's purposes but that does not that he gives it to the council. It does not mean that it has the freehold title. The land remains vested in the Commonwealth, not in the council. Surely, with all the glowing praise for land rights legislation in the Northern Territory in the recent address by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to the National Aboriginal Conference and with the Minister's own praise for land rights in Western Australia, we could at least have hoped for some foreshadowing of land rights legislation here. We could have hoped that the Bill not only would make land available to the council for its purposes but also would vest the land in the council. The Opposition is disappointed with the pace the extent of this legislation. It smacks all too much of an appeasement of public opinion, of the very severe reaction against the proposed actions of the Queensland Government. I would expect that the threat of Senator Bonner, and goodness knows how many other Government supporters, to resign if some such action was not centaken would have been a major factor in deciding the Prime Minister that perhaps he had better start doing something. He has waited for over two years, since he has been in government, to take definitive action against the regressive laws of Queensland. Certainly we received cooperation in 1975, when we were in government, for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act, but no action has been taken to enforce it. It may be said that that Act provides some power for the council on the Aboriginal lands to deny entry to people who are not Aboriginals or Islanders; or some other powers that have not been spelt out in the Bill. Those powers have not been enforced. There has been no action that this House knows of to enforce the laws passed in 1975 against discrimination generally and, in particular, against discrimination in the Queensland law concerning Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. For that reason, on behalf of the Opposition I move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to subthe rollowing words: 'the Bill be withdrawn until it has been referred to the current meedng of the National Aboriginal Conference in Canberra and then re-drafted to (a) take into account their suggestions; (b) make provision for acquisition of existing at 31 March 1978 and vesting them in the relevant Aboriginal and Islander communities; and (c) effective control of reserves to the Aboriginal and are Islander communities living on those reserves'. apI commend the amendment to the House. I be that, if the House will accept it, it will meet the sentiments of the telegram from the National mean Aboriginal Conference. If the telegram is disregarded and cast aside as of no relevance or import, what sort of message will those 30-odd delegates take back to their communities? They will say: 'We came down to Canberra. We heard fine words of great promise and new hope from the Prime Minister. We thought that at last it would be more than words. What happened? We did what we were set up to do: We advised the Government on priorities; we advised it on our sentiments; we spoke for those who could not otherwise be heard, as the Minister invited us to do. What was the Government's reaction? It said: 'Blow you, Joe. We will still be paternalistic and regressive. We will do it our way. We know what is best for you'. The Opposition's amendment is not an unreasonable one. It is in hne with good, established practice within the Westminster system. It is time for the Government to be humble enough, realistic enough and mature enough to accept that perhaps it has been hasty; perhaps this rush has been entered into with the wrong motives. Perhaps it will have repercussions not only against the Government but also against the people in whose interests the Government is acting. I appeal to the Minister, as a reasonable man, to do what the people want him to do. If the words of his second reading speech were really genuine the first thing he can do to demonstrate that is to accept our amendment, to delay a little, to talk, to consult with the people who will be affected. They ask for independent legal opinion. Surely the record must demonstrate to the Minister that when Aborigines ask for this right and when it is granted to them they exercise it with great responsibihty and effect. The legislation that has come out of the deliberations of the land councils has largely derived its force, effectiveness and value from just this procedure, from Aboriginal organisations getting independent legal advice and advising governments. Why does that suddenly become anathema? Why does the Government suddenly shrink from allowing this legislation to be made pubhc for the normal period, to be exposed properly in the Parhament for the normal period, to allow honourable members and everybody else proper time to deliberate?",49

88,Mr THOMSON,PAIRS," I rise to speak on this Bill with some regret because I believe that in many ways it should have been unnecessary. I do not propose to answer the rather rambling and disjointed speech of the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham). I beheve that he and the Opposition do not understand the purpose of this Bill. I will leave it to other Government speakers to answer the specific points raised by the honourable member. I want to talk about the people at whom this Bill is aimed. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) said, this Bill came about because the Queensland Government moved to take over the adrninistration and management of two communities, Aurukun and Mornington Island. Both of those communities are in my electorate, so I have a very special interest in this Bill. On 17 and 18 March my wife and I visited both Aurukun and Mornington. That was only a couple of days after the visit of the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Islanders'Advancement, who informed the communities that the State would be taking over their administration and management. I went to find out for myself what the people of those communities wanted. My wife and I spoke to several hundred people, many of whom we knew from previous visits. I was surprised at the unanimous expression of the people's wishes. I expected that there would be a division among the people, particularly at Aurukun as there has been often on other issues, but there was no doubt of the overwhelming support for the Uniting Church in Australia to remain in the management of those communities. Therefore I had no alternative but to support the wishes of those people. At both Aurukun and Mornington we talked to many of the people individually. We went to a public meeting at which I was asked to help and I gave my word that I would support the people of the communities. That was a very difficult decision for me to make because it put me in direct conflict with the Queensland Government and with many members of my Party in my electorate and throughout Queensland. I have twice been elected to represent all the people in my electorate of Leichhardt. I was not elected necessarily to represent the view of the Queensland Government in this Parliament, although on many occasions I have agreed with the views of that Government. On this occasion I do not agree because I believe that my duty is to support the wishes of my constituents, 1,600 of whom live in these two communities. I would like to quote from the Federal Nauonal Country Party of Australia platform. The first two planks of the platform on Aboriginals state: The National Country Party of Australia recognises the fundamental right of Aboriginals to choose whether they wish to retain their identity and traditional way of life, or to adopt in whole or in part a European life style. The Party recognises the different life styles of the Aboriginal people and the need for flexible policies to meet varying needs. I believe that this Bill and the intent of this Bill is exactly what those two planks of the platform of the Party which I represent in this Parhament are all about. There are more than 20,000 Aboriginal and Island people in my electorate, about one in six of the whole population. Many of them Uve in cities and towns but 13 Aboriginal communities live on reserves and there are 14 inhabited islands in the Torres Strait. I believe that I have a duty to all those people, as their elected representative in this place. As the Minister has explained, this Bill gives the people in the communities the right to choose. I think it is worthwhile for me to restate a short part of the Minister's second reading speech. On page 5 of the speech he said: The Commonwealth is not enlarging its own powers; it is not in any sense taking over the reserves itself, allowing the communities themselves to exercise local responsibility. The Commonwealth has not in any other State taken over the reserves established under State law but applies its policies of self-management to communities on those reserves. That is what this Bill does. There is no compulsion; each community will be able to make a choice. I do not mind who administers or manages all the communities in my electorate-the Church, the State or the people themselves. That is their choice and this Bill gives them the right to make that choice. They may wish to remain as they are now under State control; they may wish self-management; or they may wish, as I beheve they will at Aurukun and Mornington, for the Church to remain and share the management of those two communities. As I said in quoting from the Minister's speech, there is no question of the Commonwealth stepping into take over the management. Had I been asked about 18 months ago, I would have supported a State takeover of those reserves. At that stage they were both in a very difficult position. They had had a number of managers over a short period and they were not well run. Now they are much better managed. They are not perfect and I think very few reserves in the whole of my electorate are perfecdy managed. Many improvements in the management of Aurukun and Mornington have been made in the last 12 months. I think it needs to be reahsed that there is an infinite variety of communities throughout Queensland, and particularly in my electorate. They differ in history, racial composition, their degree of integration into the European community and in language. Some of them still speak their own language; some of them still retain their tribal and ditions; some of them have been partially and this some almost wholly integrated into the European hfestyle. Therefore it is not possible to say: 'This is the right policy for all communities'. I beheve that the Queensland Government through its Department of Aboriginal and Islanders' Advancement has in many ways done an admirable job in looking after the interests of Aboriginals and Islanders in the past. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Corbett) told me this afternoon that there were some very bad slum areas outside a number of towns in his electorate. By joint State-Commonwealth effort these have all been removed and the people have been housed in decent conditions. That is the sort of thing that has been occurring. Times and conditions are changing very rapidly and the State recognised this. It set up the but is only Aboriginal and Island Commission with four members. It is to report by 30 June this year on the State Aboriginal and Islanders' Acts under living which the reserves and Island communities are at present governed. I cannot understand why the decision to take over Aurukun and Mornington Island had to be taken now. Surely it would have been better to wait for the Commission's report because, for instance, if the Commission had recommended self-management, I am sure the State would have accepted it; but I believe that the precipitate action taken by the State without any immediate prior consultation was a mistake. I have said that there are many differences in the communities in my electorate. Staying in my house in Cairns at the moment on a holiday is Mr Alan Hockey, the Manager of Doomadgee Mission, which is outside Burketown near the Northern Territory border but still within my electorate. He and his wife have been at Doomadgee for 27 years and I suppose they know as much about this problem as anyone else in the business. When they went to Doomadgee the people had already lost their language, their tribal traditions and customs. The reserve is not on tribal land but is on land purchased by the Church for the purpose of the community. Alan Hockey told me that, in all the years that he had been dealing with the State, he felt that the Queensland Government had dealt with him and his community-hi s words were-'wit h compassion and justice'. Obviously this is not the experience of the Uniting Church at Aurukun and Mornington particularly in recent years. There are many reasons for this. I do not believe that I should go into them now. I would like to speak very briefly about the clan trapeople at Mornington and Aurukun to whom Bill mainly applies. Of course it applies to all communities and island communities in Queensland but particularly to Aurukun and Mornington. I believe those people have already made their choice as to what they want for their future. Mornington is an island in the ern part of the Gulf of Carpentaria. It is a isolated area and difficult to reach. Some people Uve there. Aurukun is about 60 miles south of Weipa and is on the north-western coast of Cape York Peninsula. About 750 people live there. The reserve set aside for them by the Queensland Government covers 750,000 tares or 1.85 million acres. It is a very large In both of these areas the people speak their languages. One language is spoken at Aurukun who and two languages at Mornington. The people eral Queensland retain their tribal and clan structure; they retain as it does anywhere their tribal and clan traditions. Both Uving on traditional clan and tribal land. There cation and law and order just asforit health, has been a great resurgence of interest in Aborelse. Questions have been asked tonight iginal heritage in these two communities. I think acquisition of land. No part of this Bill allows this can only be a very good thing. There has been a lot of talk about the effects alcohol in Aboriginal communities. No doubt there are many problems not only in communiBUl. ties run by the church but in all communities whether State run or church run. Alcohol is althe lowed at Mornington Island. The people there have had problems in the past. Under a very effective and recently appointed manager they have solved most of their problems. Aurukun does not have a canteen. It is dry by the wish the people. Liquor does come in there. It is often brought in by unscrupulous Europeans. that problem is under control; the situation is much better than it was in the past. The problem there is not worse than it is in many other communities. I said that the Aurukun reserve comprised rnilhon acres- a very large area. Until the last few years most of the people spent their time livwill ing in a small village community crowded together. In the last two or started to move out to what are called outstations in a decentaUsed plan. At the moment 270 people are Uving out in clan groups in seven the people? decentralised outstations. These outstations are not humpies on the banks of a creek. They are E roper small settlements with air strips, radios, uildings with tin roofs and stores. I believe the stores in each of these outstations are making a profit, which is not very usual. There is no doubt that the health of the people on these outstations is much better than the health of the people in the main community. They are eating better food. They have beef, fishable and duck. Vegetables are growing in the area. The health sisters tell me that there is no great problem in the health of the people at these outstations. The health of the children, particularly those in the main communities, is a much greater southeastproblem. Doomadgee, Mornington and very Aurukun are three very different areas. The 680 honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) also told me today that Cherbourg, one of the communities in his area, will almost certainly choose to remain under State management. This Bill will allow it to do so. The Bill is giving the heccommunity a freedom of choice. area. I think two points were made by the honourown able member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) led for the Opposition. First of all, the genlaw will apply in these reserves else in Queensland. groups are Queensland will be responsible eduis anywhere about the Government to acquire land. This can be done of only under the Lands Acquisition Act. A provision for acquiring land is not contained in this I understand that the Australian Broadcasting Commission mid-day news announced that Bill included plans to acquire land. This has caused a good deal of concern in my electorate and I have had a large number of telephone calls this afternoon. At the moment the land will remain Crown land vested in Queensland. It is of very difficult to change that situation. Other speakers, better versed in the law than I am, However might be able to add to that. This Bill will almost certainly be passed through this House and the other place this week. There is little doubt that it will be passed by both Houses. I appeal to the Government to delay the 1.85 proclamation of this Bill to allow further discussions with the Queensland Government. This be very necessary to allow for an orderly and peaceful period for the people of Aurukun and three years they have Mornington. Mr Barry Jones-What about discussions with Mr THOMSONThis will allow for discussion with the people themselves. A great deal of discussion with the people has already taken that place, as has been mentioned tonight. I believe that other communities will have to make up their minds about this matter. I think we should have discussions with the Queensland Government to ensure that any communities wishing to come within the provisions of the Bill should be to do so in as orderly a manner as possible. I am concerned that the people of the Aboriginal island communities should not suffer because of political arguments between governments. This Bill gives them the power to choose their futurethe future management of their communities. In carrying out the promise that I made to the people of Aurukun and Mornington, I support the provisions of this Bill.",53
89,Mr HAYDEN,PAIRS,"When this Bill is enacted it will cited as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act 1978. It will be a misleading entitlement. It has all the gloss of tion. This legislation, when enacted, will not vide for self-management at all. It is overridingly an Act providing for ministerial control, not for self-determination. For instance, clause IS makes it clear that the Minister has the authority to override the properly arrived at decisions of Aboriginal people as to the declaration of reserves and communities. He may declare on those matters. We say that is not good enough. We say he 'shall declare' within 30 days and that he shall do this through the parliamentary system. Clause 3 provides a definition of an Aboriginal reserve and makes it clear that the boundaries of the reserve stand at the whim of the Queensland Premier. That is asking for a lot of trust. The Houston Oil Co. would not be silly enough to buy an old oil drilling rig from the Queensland Premier. Why should we expect the Aboriginal people to buy this sort of thing from the Queensland Premier? Accordingly, we say that the boundaries ought to be clearlyfixedas those boundaries applying on 31 March 1978. I recognise that laws m the respective Queensland Acts are referred to in this Bill. Hopefully before much longer the relics of discrimination which riddle those laws will be removed. This Act can then be amended. I am afraid that we cannot share the sort of blissful trust that would encourage us to allow these matters to be left in the hands of the Premier of Queensland. Sub-clauses (4) and (5) of clause 10 are hanging on that dependent word 'may'. The by-law authority of the councils rests on the fickle guarantees of the Minister's pohtical fancy of the moment. Accordingly, on the experience we have had of this Government in the past, especially when it has been subjected to pressure from the Queensland Government, it is reasonable to anticipate that there will be many cases where by-laws that have been decided properly by the Aboriginal people on reserves and communities will go into limbo because of the authority that depends on the word 'may'. But the matter is left at the whim of the Minister. We say that the matter should rest with the Parliament and that the decision should be made there. The fault with this legislation is that we are expected to accept too much of it on trust. That is a big challenge-trus t in the Government. It is a quality of rapidly depreciating value. It is even shakier in value than the Australian dollar. How be can we be expected to trust the Government on its record in regard to Aboriginal welfare? Clause 16 of the Bill comes to the heart of that hestitation. It says with a display of grotesque decep- irony that the Bill will add to rather than pro- derogate in any way from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975. We introduced that legislation when we were in government. We were forced to introduce it as a response to the unreasonable and totally unacceptable racially discriminatory laws in regard to Aboriginal welfare in Queensland. When we went out of office the authority of that law was put into the deep freeze. Meanwhile, the rights of Aboriginal people in Queensland continued to be violated by official Queensland Government policy. Under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 we gave Aborigines rights over their properties, we ended wage discrimination, we established their rights to have legal representation in courts and we ended the odious permanent entry system onto reserves. After we went out of office the authority of that legislation was never adopted by the present Government. The authority of that legislation, in conjunction with the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975, the Aboriginal Land Fund Act and the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act of 1976 gave the Government, if those authorities were taken up, a great deal of clout in its relations with the Queensland Government in the matter of Aboriginal welfare and rights. The fact is that the Government has approached all these responsibUities and the authority avaUable to it with a faint heart. Much of the present problem, probably all of it, could have been averted if these authorities were taken up. The situation now is the product of a fickle Government commitment to therightsof Aboriginal people in the face of bluster from the Queensland Premier. How can we ask Aboriginal people to have trust in this Government? That is very largely what we are being asked to extend in this Bill. So much of it is not self-government. So much of it is dependent upon the whim and caprice of the Minister at any given time. I refer to the authority to make by-laws, the authority to establish councils and the authority to estabhsh reserves. How can we have trust in the Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser) and this Government when it established that there were secret assurances from the Prime Minister to the Queensland Premier not to apply the authority of some of those Acts I cited a few seconds ago. While the Prime Minister was giving those surances his representative in Aboriginal welfare matters, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), was going about the community conveypeople ing the impression that he was an unyielding, dedicated defender of therightsof the Aborigiexpression, nal people in the community. Between them the laws I have quoted would have removed odious discrimination from the laws, regulations by-laws in Queensland. They would have given Aboriginal people landrightsand they would have ended the sweeping, intrusive powers of the Queensland Director of Aboriginal Affairs-powers , intrusive and coercive in their nature, which no white person would tolerate. For instance, the Director of Aboriginal Affairs in Queensland has authority to take charge properties, wages or savings of Aboriginal people in that State. It is a very difficult for Aboriginal people to assert theirrightsif resent that. No white person would tolerate that. It is in conflict with the basic principles of many international conventions which this country has signed upholding human rights, human dignity and self-respect. The authorities under the laws I have cited would have aUowed a much greater degree of self-management than the Aboriginal people in Queensland have been able to estabhsh to point. But the fact is that none of these things done because there were secret deals between the Prime Minister and the Queensland Premier. They ensured that whUe the word was being promulgated the deeds were not being fulfilled. The most craven action of aU was the failure the Government to apply the authority avaUable to it under the Aboriginal CouncUs and Associnobbled ations Act of 1976. That legislation was passed this Parhament in December 1976. Today, more than 12 months later, it is yet to be proclaimed. is the Government's own legislauon. Why has the Government confronted this situation with such a faint heart? It is nonsense for the Governsecond ment to talk about self-management. The Government's one hesitant foray into this area with the Aboriginal CouncUs and Associations Act of 1976 was not proceeded with or taken up. The Aboriginal people were to be disUlusioned. Eighteen months ago the Prime Minister gave a secret assurance to the Queensland Premier that there would be no land acquisitions for the (Mr purposes of estabUshing landrightsfor Aborigiis nals in Queensland. The policy has proceeded in every other State. It is indisputable that the Queensland Government is very difficult in terms of allowing the development of this sort of policy. It is quite clear that the Queensland asGovernment's policy of assinulation and of seeking to submerge, dUute and, if possible, breathe out the main cultural influence of the Aboriginal encourages it to be opposed to any sorts of policies which will allow dignity, selfindependence and the strengthening of that sense of Aboriginal cultural identity. Accordingly, the Queensland Government resents and movements to provide more independence and influence for the Aboriginal people in the community to give more strength to their cultural and coercive form of expression. But that is no justification for accepting those obstructions. If the Government is prepared to be tough enough and determined enough it has avaUable to it sufficientfiscalauthority in various of the ways to ensure that even if the Queensland Government sought compensation it could admatter equately offset the sorts of claims that the they Queensland Government sought to establish. It is totally unacceptable that we have a governso ment presenting itself to the Aboriginal people of Australia and suggesting that so much of this legislation should be taken on trust when its record, insofar as matters of trust are concerned, in regard to Aboriginal welfare is so appalling. I repeat that 18 months ago the Prime Minister gave a secret assurance to the Queensland Premthis ier that, despite what the Government was wasclaiming it wanted to achieve for the Aboriginal people, it would not allow the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission to make independent land acquisitions for Aboriginal people. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs talks about selfof management. He should be the last person to seek to assert that principle. He has effectively the Land Fund Commission. Its degree in of independence has been effectively destroyed by his intrusion into its affairs. I know of two Itprominent examples of that. In thefirstcase the Land Fund Commission sought to purchase land in Queensland for Aboriginal purposes. In the case the Land Fund Commission sought a legal opinion on the matter of racism in Queensland. It had a specific incident in mind. It sought to have the legislauon against racism which we introduced in 1975 adopted if the case was appropriate. The Minister instructed the Land Fund Commission that it was not to proceed with the purchase of land and that it was not to proceed further with the legal opinion it sought. By clear implication the Government made it very clear that it was not to do any of those things in the future and furthermore, that while legislative authority existed in those matters they were to all practical intents and purposes to be accepted as dead letters for the Land Fund Commission and the Aboriginal people. The Minister's next step was to propose at a meeting with senior officers of his Department that a Cabinet submission should be prepared by officers of his Department. The purpose of that submission was effectively to destroy the Lands Commission. He sought to quibble about the detail of this claim but today, one month after the matter first surfaced publicly, he conceded that in fact the actions that he had set in train, if they were followed through, would effectively bring to an end the Lands Commission. The minutes of that meeting show very clearly that he left an instruction that it was his wish to have the Lands Commission absorbed in such a way that it would be destroyed and that consistent with this proposal a Cabinet submission was to be prepared. These are the sorts of responses which flowed from the actions of the Lands Commission seeking properly to discharge its responsibilities under law to Aboriginal people, that is, the action of seeking to purchase land for Aboriginal people in Queensland and of seeking a legal opinion about a racist incident in that State. These matters were objected to by the Premier of Queensland and that objection, that bluster, was sufficient for both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to react in this way. These men are towering mountains where Aboriginal affairs are concerned-towerin g mountains ofjelly! Where are the grounds for trust in this Government in such an important matter as this matter is? Are they in its performance? If there is a direct ratio between performance and credibility, the Government's credibility is slumping badly. This is the Government that suspended the trachoma campaign in Queensland because it suited the political whims of the Premier of Queensland, in spite of the fact that the continuation of the program was so essential for the health of Queensland Aboriginals. Even at this stage the program has not been restored, nor is there any firm guarantee that it will be restored. Where are the grounds for trust in the Minister himself? He is the man who under pressure buckled to the Queensland Premier and proposed a compromise arrangement, which was totally unacceptable to either the Uniting Church in Austraha or the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Mornington Island, whereby the Queensland Government and the Uniting Church would jointly administer the reserves. It was afinecompromise-it lasted four hours, and his credibility went with it. The Queensland Government in its policies on Aboriginal welfare has established a nasty racist record. The report by the Commissioner for Community Relations on the situation in Queensland had this to say: On the Queensland reserves today, one would be hard put to find any part of Aboriginal life which is not discriminatory. The report in itsfinalparagraph concluded: Unless one has actually seen and experienced the situation, it would be hard to credit that, in 1976, such oppression could be practised by the Queensland Government and its agencies against a secuon of its citizens; or that a State Government dailyfloutstwo Federal laws, namely the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) and the Racial Discrimination Act. If the Government were thoroughly genuine in this matter it would have long ago taken up the authority available to it under the legislation that we introduced to eliminate racial discrimination in all of its odious, oppressive and insidious forms in Queensland. It would have not only enacted legislation but also ensured that the laws on Aboriginal councils and associations introduced in 1976 would have been proclaimed by now and in effect long ago. How can the Aboriginal people be expected to take this son of legislation on trust when so much of it is dependent on this son of trust? The legislation is far from satisfactory on many scores. It allows for instance, as I said earUer, the Queensland Government not only to establish what the boundaries of a reserve are but from time to time, as the legislation now stands, to adjust the boundaries of those reserves. The declaration of reserves is still very much dependent upon ministerial whim. Council by-laws will stand or fall on the political capriciousness of the Minister at any given time. Under this legislation, the Queensland Government could effectively de-gazette, under the Crown Lands Act, Aboriginal reserves and Aboriginal communities. It could padlock the facilities on existing reserves and prevent their use by Aboriginal people. I can find nowhere in this legislation power for the Australian Government to build on reserve lands. Accordingly, there is further evidence of the defectiveness of the legislation and a demand that further action has to be taken by the Government. The legislation needs more teeth. But most importantly the legislation fails squarely to confront the landrightsissue for Aboriginal people. We hear so much from the Minister in this Parhament and elsewhere about the special quality and nature of the relationship between Aboriginal people and land. The relaalso tionship is well estabhshed. It is a very important one. It ought to be recognised and respected. Government has had adequate opportunity sufficient authority to ensure those things were done if it were fair dinkum enough in these ters. It has not done those things. And it has not done those things in this legislation. Again, clause 9 (2) is too Opposition and, accordingly, we propose certain amendments to the clause which protection to Aboriginal people about the conditions under which people can enter reserves provide necessary services for Aboriginal people. Clause 12 does not give sufficient authority Aboriginal councils to control the movements people in Aboriginal reserves. I said earlier that the Government seeks trust in these matters it must be judged by its deeds and its deeds fall far short of encouraging trust. For instance, the area of expenditure it has slashed by about $60m in real terms the amount of money being provided very broadly for Aboriginal welfare this year compared with the provision in our Budget in 197S. It has cut back expenditure in health, education, housing, generally in the fare area, and in all of those areas in which well estabhshed that Aboriginal people have disand tinct disadvantages, not through their own fault but because of generations of neglect which has been imposed upon them by the dominant white culture of this society. As the inquiry into poverty in Austraha found: Aboriginals probably have the highest birth highest death rate, the worse health and housing, lowest educational, occupational, economic, social status of any identifiable section of the Austrahan community. The Prime Minister has asked the Opposition for approach. bipartisan support in Aboriginal welfare. We extend that but we are not prepared to step down to his levels. We want him to step up to those which we expect should be apphed for the welIt fare of Aboriginal people.",56
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, Affairs Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,59
91,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS," I rise to terrible support this important piece of legislation and oppose the amendment moved by the honournot able member for Capricornia, Dr Everingham. This item of legislation is certainly very impormembers tant. It is not an easy piece of legislation by means, but it is one which I beheve that honourtheir able members on both sides of this House ought to approach in a co-operative way and in a which will lend itself to its prompt passage and lend itself to developing a co-operative approach between governments which do have The legitimate powers and responsibilities. Whilst and undoubtedly the Commonwealth has powers and responsibilities in relation to Aboriginal matpeople, the Government of Queensland has powers in relation to the services that it must provide to all of the people of the State of open to satisfy the Queensland.",59
92,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"What has that to do with this will give greater legislation? to Mr RUDDOCK-This is very important and has a great deal to do with this piece of legisto lation. As honourable members opposite would of know, clause 9 of the Bill deals with the very question of the provision of services to Aborigibut nal people in Aboriginal communities. It deals with the questions of housing, health, sewerage, in water supply, electricity supply, communication, education and training. As the Bill acknowledges, there is a role for the Queensland Government to play in proviciing these services, unless last honourable members opposite believe that we can have in any one State a situation of one set of wellaws in relation to education, for example, for it is one group of people-the Aboriginal peopleanother set of laws for the rest of the community. Nothing would smack more of the creation of a state within a state or of apartheid, if one likes to use that term, than that situation. I make this point in the debate because I have listened to two speeches today from honourable rate, the members opposite-leadin g spokesmen of the and the Opposition-whic h have smacked absolutely of and legal cynicism in a way which one would hope would not be necessary in a debate such as this, in which we are essentially pursuing a bipartisan In the last few weeks people have suggested that we should not involve pohtics in this matter. has been suggested that the disputes between Mr Bjelke-Petersen, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Aboriginal (Mr Viner) were terrible disputes, that the political wrangle between the Federal Government and the State Government was a thing and that the politicking Liberals, to who were pohticking amongst themselves, were really serving the Aboriginal people. Yet, what happens in this place? Honourable opposite sit back and let the situation any continue. They could allow other people to draw own conclusions. They come in like the tide with the most political speeches that one can way imagine, the most exaggerated comments and the most blatant over-statements of propositions that I have ever heard. Recently, on 15 March, after the Queensland Minister wrote a letter dated 10 March, the Opposition raised a matter of pubhc importance. The honourable member for Capricornia said: 'Act now. Five days after this event takes place, introduce legislation. We will facilitate its age through the Parhament'. The honourable member said that that was what the Opposition would do. We made it very clear that if necessary-if we could not talk on reasonable terms with the Queensland Government-w e would take this approach and that this legislation would be introduced. I refer honourable members to page 748 of Hansard at which the Minister made it very clear that the Federal Government would act and would stand by the Aboriginal people and introduce this legislation if we could not get a reasonable approach from the Queensland Government on this matter. Members opposite argued that it was an urgent matter. When we reached the point tonight of introducing legislation in response to the situation which has been fully documented and spoken about by so many people-it has been adequately spoken about by my colleague the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson)-honourabl e members opposite said that they wanted the legislation postponed and that there was no urgency about the matter. Some people who were saying previously that we could not deal with Mr Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland, now are saying: 'You can have absolute faith in his undertaking that he will do nothing in the meantime. Now there is no need for urgency. The situation has changed'. Mr Armitage-You are not talking about the Bill.",59
93,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"I am speaking about the Bill, which is more than many honourable members opposite do, even with their prepared speeches. I am replying to a member's specious remarks in this debate about postponing the legislation, putting it off, which could possibly endanger the communities about which honourable members opposite piously speak in this place. Consequential matters were raised in the speeches of honourable members opposite. They did raise some matters with which I beheve it is very important to deal in this debate. The honourable member for Capricornia moved an amendment suggesting that we ought to put aside this proposal which deals with the very important quesuon of control of settlements and of decision-making in settlements. He introduced a new and separate element. If the Opposition cannot fight on one question it brings in a new element, one which is likely to exacerbate the situation further and one which is likely to lead to the situation in which the very important question of services such as health and education-w e would expect the Queensland pass- Government to continue to provide those services for Queensland people, including Aboriginal people-woul d be put in jeopardy by promoting an aU-out confrontation. That is what honourable members opposite are all about. AU the speeches that we have heard in this debate and in sinular debates on previous occasions have been about an all-out confrontation in every respect. The speeches have been about one government-the Canberra Government-ob taining by way of legislation power over another government. I do not think that ought to be the basis for this legislauon; nor does the Minister. The legislation seeks to give to the Aborigines therightof self-determination-a n abihty of the people themselves to be able to make decisions in their own communities. Yet the Opposition has introduced a land rights question which puts in jeopardy programs which are for the benefit of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. I think this point ought to be made because we all know that we are the subject of a written Constitution. That Constitution provides that if the Commonwealth acquires land in one form or another it has to acquire the land from the party concerned on just terms and pay just compensation. What does that mean? The figures that have been quoted in relation to an attempt to acquire all the reserves in Queensland have varied between about $500m and $ 1,000m. That is the amount of money that would have to be paid out. Whilst it may be fine to acquire the reserves, what effect will that have on the programs and the balance of programs for Abonginals in our community? What would happen if all the money that would otherwise be appropriated for programs for the Aboriginal people-housing , health or education-were set aside to accept a constitutional obligation of providing on just terms for the acquisition of aU those lands in Queensland to which one could effectively give control by legislation of this sort? WhUst honourable members opposite might think that we can print money, take it from other appropriations or perhaps just find the money in some other magical way, we know from experience that there is no magical way. I am sure that if we put to the Aboriginal people that the question was whether we provided land and total landrightsin Queensland, acquired all the reserves on just terms, that is, paying out that money for thoserights,and lost all their other programs throughout the rest of Australia-housin g programs, education programs, health programs-the y would say responsibly that they would wish to see the maintenance of those programs which would be to their immediate benefit. In relation to the programs that the Commonwealth has a responsibihty to provide, it is important that the Commonwealth acts responsibly for all Aboriginal people, not just some Aborigines. There was some good material in the speech of the honourable member for Capricornia. I endorse generally his approach to the question of self determination and the emphasis he put on this. It reflects very much the approach of honourable members on this side of the House and members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. We have looked at other aspects of programs for Aboriginals in Austraha. I believe that it is very important that Aboriginals in their own communities are able to make those decisions which affect their well-being and they are able to make decisions as to whether they wish to be assimilated, if that is the nature the Queensland Government's policy and approach, as against a slower and more gradual approach which, I beheve, would be to their benefit. If we examine the history of Austraha over a long period, we can observe that the policy of assimilation of Aboriginals has failed. The reason we do not have many full-blood Aboriginal people in New South Wales, for instance, is that Aboriginals were forced to hve on the outskirts of towns and to be assimilated in one way or another. They were expected to live in houses and were not allowed to live in a traditional way. They were pushed aside, pushed out of the way and abused in many ways. There was no capacity for them to make a choice about living in a traditional way which perhaps would have preserved their culture and given them the strength to deal with some of the stresses that come when one's culture is under threat. I see that as being very basic to the problem. This item of legislation has been developed around pursuing that objective in relation to self-determination but not bringing into conflict a whole range of other questions such as the education and health services which the State would normally provide and which the State is expected by us to continue to provide to the communities. Sub-clause (2) of clause 9 is very important in that respect. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) spoke of deception in this debate and in the approach of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and he related his comments to clause S of the Bill. He suggested that the Minister was deceiving people because he was seeking to substitute ministerial control for self-management. Nothing could be further from the truth. Clause 5 of the Bill, one of the operative clauses, deals with the very basis upon which the Minister will be involved in making determinations on requests from Aboriginal communities as to whether or not self-management will occur. It is not a question ofhis ministerial control. In fact, the amendments that the Opposidon has proposed would do more to bring that about than the proposals of the Government. The suggestion of the Opposition that the Minister ought to act in a mandatory way when he makes a decision on a request from an Aboriginal community would put at risk the very legislation we are debating tonight and its effectiveness. One of the important facets of this legislation is the discretion that has been given to the Minister to enable him to satisfy himself as to whether the council genuinely reflects the views of the Aboriginal people in the community. The councils and their composition can be effected by Queensland legislation and by decisions of the Queensland Government-this is of one of the things that I should have thought the Leader of the Opposition would have picked up in his distorted claims about the Queensland Government-and it is quite clear that changes could be made in Queensland legislation so that we had a council that was not representative. If the Opposition's amendment is carried, a council could make a request and the Minister would have to implement it without going behind the decision of the council to see whether it was in fact a representative decision. I cannot understand the Opposition putting that view to the Parliament. In relation to clause 9, the Opposition wishes to substitute in sub-clause (2) the requirement that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs must consent to the Queensland Government accepting its specific responsibilities for schooling and health in the communities. I cannot imagine anything that would have a more disastrous effect on the relationship between the Commonwealth and the State and on the abihty of the Commonwealth to maintain meaningful services in these reserves and communities than an amendment that put at risk the schools that are there, the schooling obligations of the State, and the health programs that are being administered through the Queensland Government. Such a provision would only exacerbate the situation. The Leader of the Opposition spoke about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act and led the House to beheve that there was some failing on the part of this Government in implementing that legislation. That legislation is law. It is a Commonwealth law that prevails over Queensland law. One of the benefits that the Aboriginal people do have is access to an Aboriginal legal aid service. As individuals they are entitled to proceed before an industrial tribunal if they are not being paid full adult wages, and the Commonwealth Taw as it now applies enables them to get that full wage. If Aboriginals are prosecuted the same law can be used as a defence. Legal advice is available to Aboriginalsvery adequate legal advice-throug h the legal aid service. The law is available for their benefit and is in operation. To suggest otherwise shows a total misunderstanding of the nature of law and its effect. The emotional speech made by the Leader of the Opposition was couched in such a way as to mislead Aboriginal people and destroy their confidence in a very important piece of legislation, and to do it on a quite specious argument, in fact I believe a very deceptive argument. Mr Gillard-Shameful.",60
94,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"It is shameful in every respect and not worthy of the Leader of the Opposition. Finally he suggested that the Queensland Government would have the capacity to go into the reserves and padlock the facilities that had been provided-presumabl y the schools and hospitals. I cannot imagine anything more fearsome than to say to people that their schools and hospitals would be locked up. The Leader of the Opposition made that suggestion without any comprehension of clause 15, the clause of which he was speaking but quite clearly did not understand. Clause 1S of the Bill makes it plain that the Commonwealth will be able to go in and use its general acquisition power to buy or acquire land and facilities they might be in the form of a building or a school or a hospitalavailable to the Aboriginal people involved. There would be no padlocking of the facilities. Clause IS enables us to deal with that situation should it arise. The pohtical way in which this matter has been treated is shameful.",62
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,62
96,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"If the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) defends his clients in court in the same way as he has defended this legislation, it is no wonder that the prisons of New South Wales are over-full. I will take just some of the points that he made this evening. First of all, let us take the pohtical point. Fancy anyone in this Parliament being pohtical! I am going to disappoint the honourable member. I am going to be political. This is a major political issue. It is a challenge to the Parliament, a challenge issued by the people of Australia when they passed the referendum back in 1967, and the honourable member knows that full well. We have a clear constitutional duty to take up the challenge issued by the Queensland Premier and fulfil the aspirations of the Aboriginal people. That means that they must have absolute security on the reserves upon which they hve. The honourable member said that we had been political. He said that we might come into confrontation with the Premier of Queensland. What is wrong with that? It is probably 20 years too late to come into confrontation on these matters with the Premier and others in Queensland, but this is what the honourable member had to say in the debate on the matter of public importance only a few weeks ago: If we are to embark on a program of confrontation, as the Opposition has sought to do, we will be in exactly the same situation which the Austrahan Labor Party was in when it was in government. In other words, Labor lost nearly all its seats in Queensland. The honourable member is not afraid of the Queensland Premier; he is afraid of a political reaction that would lose seats for his Party. I suggest that the people of Australia will measure honourable members opposite by the integrity with which they have taken up this challenge. This Bill is a piece of shadow sparring. But honourable members opposite say that the Opposition is trying to create a state within a stateapartheid. What nonsense! Is Canberra, which is administered separately from the area around it, an example of apartheid? Of course it is not. Is Nhulunbuy in Arnhem Land which is a mining enclave an example of apartheid or a state within a state? Of course it is not. Are Puckapunyal and other military establishments of that sort, whether they be under constitutional or Commonwealth authority, which engage in Commonwealth services areas of this type? Of course they are not. Is the repatriation system which operates separately throughout the whole of our community for a separate group of people an example of apartheid or a state within a state? Of course it is not. We have to face the fact that we can put no faith in the Government of Queensland, in the present Premier of Queensland or in his immediate predecessors. Anything which ignores that fact represents shadow sparring. We are dodging the issue. I am afraid that after all the fanfares of trumpets this legislation represents another sellout. I want to take issue with our colleague, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) on the question of the role of the National Aboriginal Conference, as it is now called. I will take a couple of points which arise from the use of language. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) have talked about the inaugural meeting of the National Aboriginal Conference. For the last three or four days they have done everything in their power to make it look as if it was their initiative, as if they had set it up themselves. The Conference has been in business for five years. Its structure has been changed to a certain extent and its name has been changed. But the object for which it was established is still there. The major objective of its estabUshment was to provide a pipeUne between the Aboriginal people of Australia, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Government. In this first issue that comes forward after the Government has used the National Aboriginal Conference as a political ploy to show how good it is, how dinkum it is and how fair it is to the Aboriginal people, it ignores the Conference absolutely. I have a copy of the telegram from the National Aboriginal Council before me. It asks that the Conference be consulted and that the matter be deferred until it can consider it. Why can the Government not do that? I suppose that I have nearly as good a record as most honourable members in this House as a parUamentary advocate of the cause we are discussing here tonight But the procedures adopted in this Parliament today in respect of this piece of legislation are a disgrace to the Austrahan parliamentary system. They are fraught with the destruction of the traditional parliamentary program and system and we ought not to tolerate it, no matter how urgent we think the issues are. Of course, the urgency of the issues has been exposed by the failure of the Minister to act over the last few weeks and months and, in fact, over the last few years. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson) made a plea on behalf of the people whom he represents. One wonders how a person such as the honourable member is able to faU in with the people who run the National Country Party in Queensland. The honourable member talked about the choice of the Aboriginal people. This has been one of the major objectives of the Aboriginal policy of the Australian Labor Party over the last few years. We ask the question: Will the Aboriginal people be free to make continuing choices once they have made a choice to accept the provisions of this Bill? We say not and nothing said from the other side of the House, and nothing in the Minister's speech, disabuses our fears about that. When will honourable members opposite face up to the facts of hfe and do the job properly? We cannot make any deals with the Premier of Queensland. Surely that is obvious. The man is the quintessence of a pohtical practitioner. He cares not a point about principles. He has turned political hypocrisy, unprincipled behaviour and unscrupulous usage ofhis office into a fine art. He is Australia's greatest poltiical practitioner. He even makes members of this Government look like amateurs. I turn to deal with some of the other points which were made. The honourable member for Leichhardt said that Crown land will be vested in the Government of Queensland. That is placing a blissful trust in the Government of Queensland. Land is the issue and we cannot avoid that by changing the name of the legislation. Land is the issue and the key to the situation. To ignore that is to dodge away from the issue. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Dean) shakes his head. He is either attesting to or denying what I say. He will find out when the Aboriginal people go to the ballot box next time that land is the issue. The other issue is the opportunity of the Aboriginal people to control and manage their own affairs. I do not like to use the word 'control'. But the management of their own affairs is again another issue. This legislation represents a craven breakdown, blissful innocence-is there anybody who thinks that this Government is full of young innocents-o r is it a devious political ploy. I ask honourable members to look at the unhappy record. First of aU, we had the cuts in expenditure which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) proposed to the House. There was a total surrender when faced by the Queensland Government with issues such as the trachoma program. There was the failure of the Northern Territory Aboriginal land rights legislation to face up to the issue and place on the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory the responsibility finally for many areas which are of some importance. This legislation will not work. We say that this legislation does not face the issue and that those pans of the legislation which cover points of which we approve will not work because it does not have the appropriate teeth. I was hoping that tonight we would reach the end of the long haul. But what has happened? We have stopped short of the top. I pick up copies of newspapers and read articles dealing with the seasonal sport in politics. In a newspaper dated 24 January 19761 found the headline: 'Canberra may move in Aurukun row'. That was more than two years ago. At the same time, another newspaper headhne read: 'Canberra accuses State of Aurukun trickery'. Yet the honourable member for Dundas says that we can still put our faith in the Queensland Government. In 1973, at a time when the people running this country had the interests of the Aboriginal people at heart, a letter was written by the then Prime Minister to the Premier of Queensland asking him to transfer the Aboriginal lands to the Aboriginal people themselves. Of course, the Premier of Queensland did not do that.",62
97,Mr VINER,PAIRS,You did not do anything about it.,64
98,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"No, we started the persuasion. Then we started to produce legislation. We esrushing tablished a battery of legislation which the present Government is not game to use. What that matter all about? First of all we have as an example the aspirations of the Aboriginal at Aurukun and Mornington Island. I say that landrightsis the principal issue. I have spoken the Aboriginal people about this and that is what they say also. It is significant that there Aborigmal people in the House tonight than able there are Government supporters. Landrightsis the principal issue. But other matters are intime volved also. I ask the question: Does this legisable lation answer that problem for the Aboriginal people? The Opposition says that it does not. question of social development is another issue. In what way does this legislation fulfil Aboriginal aspirations in that respect? There is also the question of economic progress. How far will this legislation take the Aboriginal people along road of economic progress? Somewhere I have some figures from the last available report of the Queensland Government. It is stated in that report that only about one-third and in some cases 25 per cent of the adult iginal people in these places have any sort ployment. Does this legislation guarantee personal security of Aborigines? We say that does not. It still leaves the reserves open to trespass of the minions of the Government of Queensland. Does it establish which the Aboriginal people are entitled at this stage of our Australian history? Of course, it not. What should be done? From the very momillion ment that this issue became part of the political scene in Austraha, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs had at his disposal, without any further legislation being passed by this Parliament, a battery of laws which enabled him to act. First, it is clear that he had powers under the Constitution. Section 51, placitum (xxxi) states that the Minister has the power for: The acquisition of property on just terms from any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. The Constitution gives the Minister power to make laws for the Aboriginal people. He also has powers under the Lands Acquisition Act.",64
99,Mr VINER,PAIRS,We have the power of acquisition in this Bill.,64
100,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,That isright.The Lands Acquisition Act fortifies that. Why has not the Government used that Act?,64
101,Mr VINER,PAIRS,It is in there-claus e 15 of the Bill.,64
102,Mr BR YANT,PAIRS,"The Minister should have used that power weeks ago. There is no need to be legislation in this way. The only way we can ensure the satisfactory security of the people is of Aurukun, Mornington Island and other places is to acquire the land and deed it to the Aborigipeople nal communities. Why do you not do that? Mr Ruddock-You need to have a Commonto wealth purpose. Where is the purpose? are more Mr BRYANT-I will explain to the honourgentleman. First of all, a notice to treat is issued. The provisions are all there. I do not have tonight to read them all out but the honourgentleman will find the information in the Bills and Papers Office. I will arrange for a copy The to be sent to him and have it annotated for him directly if he wishes. The provisions are all there but the Premier of Queensland says: 'No, I will not be in it'. Then an order for compulsory acquisition is issued, and after a certain number of the days it becomes Commonwealth property. Mr Ruddock-You need to have an Act under relevant which you pursue it.",64
103,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"Wai t a minute. The deal, of Aborcourse, is that the Government says to the of emowners that it will pay them so much. The the honourable member for Dundas spoke of it $500m. How would he arrive at thatfigure?It is the a good round figure of course. He is a Sydney legal man. I suppose he would send a bill along the self-respect to the lines of: Doing this, that and the other . . . say, does $500m. The Aurukun Reserve covers about 1.8 acres. What is land worth up there? What is the going rate? They tell me that if one looks through the Queensland Country Life to try to buy a place in that general direction, one finds that it would cost between $ 1.50 and $2 per acre. Mr Ruddock-You do not want to buy the minerals also!",64
104,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"Wait a bit. It would cost perhaps $3m for Aurukun. MorTjington Island, I suppose, would cost $400,000 to $500,000. That is the offer the Government would make to the Queensland Premier.",65
105,Mr VINER,PAIRS,Why do you not move in yourself?,65
106,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"Just a moment. The Government would make that offer to the Premier of Queensland who then says that he will not accept that. He says that he wants to deal with the Government and he takes the matter to the High Court. What does the High Court say? I refer the House to the case of Austraha versus the Proprietors of Lanyon here on the doorstep of Canberra. The Labor Government offered them, I think, in thefirstinstance, $ 1.8m. The owner was again a person from Sydney and he said that he wanted $35m because it was going to be urban land. We said: 'Not on your hfe'. We tried to introduce legislation in this place to guarantee that land acquired by the Commonwealth would be paid for at the going rate for the usage of land. The Senate, under our friend Withers, threw it back. The matter went to the High Court and the High Court ruled that the appropriate price for land is the current usage value. What about minerals? I knew the question of minerals would rear its ugly head. The honourable member for Dundas is afraid of two things. He is afraid of loss of seats in the Parliament- I do not blame him for that-and who is going to get the bauxite. That, of course, is the weakness in this legislation. We should vest this land Aboriginal people in perpetuity by way of special legislation. That is what would be necessary and I would agree with it. Then, if the honourable- I should place those words in inverted commas-Premie r of Queensland decided to withdraw services from the people there, it would be the Commonwealth's duty to provide those services. We have had a double standard about these matters for too long. I ask: If the Queensland Government issued permits for mining tomorrow, would this legislation stop it? The answer is no. Is not that the pre-eminent threat to the people of Aurukun. Of course it is. If it decided to go on to the land and cut timber, would this legislation stop it? Of course it would not. If it decided to give specialfishingrights along the shores, would this legislation stop it? Of course it would not. The legislation is phoney. We are breaking parhamentary tradition in the way in which we are handling this legislation. We have raised the aspirations of the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island and the rest of the Aboriginal people of Queensland. If we pass this legislation without appropriate amendments or if we do not withdraw it and do the simple, direct things such as acquiring the land and consulting the people we will have failed. We must ensure that there are adequate decision making powers. I presume that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is sincere in his stated hope that, when it comes to the point of applying this legislation to the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island and other places, they will be able to make decisions about their own destiny. We say they will not. There is only one absolute security. I suppose this kind of psyche is common to all of us. The land upon which we live must be ours in some absolutely protected sense. In the current state of our society, in the current state of Australian pohtics, in our obsession with regard to minerals, there is only one absolute security for the Aboriginal people of Queensland and elsewhere, and that is the acquisition of the land and the vesting of it in them absolutely. I know this conflicts with that treasured and traditional attitudes to mineral rights. In this country the mineral rights belong to the Crown. The Crown then sells them off, not to the highest bidder, but usually to the lowest bidder. We have been selling this country over the last 10 or 15 years at about 5c a ton. Some people have made enormous fortunes out of this but not the people who traditionally own the land. What real profits have the people of Yirrkala received from the Gove bauxite developments? What real profit have the people in the of Groote Eylandt received? What real profit have the people of Weipa received? We must find another formula. The honourable member for Dundas and I have travelled this country very extensively looking at Aboriginal communities. I guess that our friends on this side of the House and our friends on the other side of the House all have something in their hearts asking them to try to find an answer to this question. But if they start on the premise that property, Staterightsand that kind of legalism transcends human rights, they will find no answer. As I said earlier, it is a long haul. It is some 20-odd years since we took up the debate about Aboriginal progress in this Parliament. Lots of things have happened since. The Constitution has been changed. The laws of Australia dealing with Aboriginal people have been changed, but not as effectively as we would have wished in Queensland. We have made a different social climate. I find it most gratifying to have on our side on this occasion the Right Honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser), not a notable radical revolutionary or progressive, to have Minister for Aboriginal Affairs sounding is almost one of us, to have the churches, which, organisationally speaking, have dragged their feet in the past coming out on side against Premier of Queensland. The churches have an unhappy history, as have governments, as have we all. When the issues were first raised in Yirrkala and Weipa, the Methodist Church in the first instance, and the Presbyterian Church, in the second instance, came down basically on the side of governments. The missionaries did not and the people on the spot did not. The original people owe a great debt to many people in the churches, not so much the people on the organisational side, but the people on ground. There is no answer, short of total sition deeding the land to the Aboriginal people and consulting them all the way. I appeal to Minister to take cognisance of the fact that the National Aboriginal Conference is meeting in Canberra at the moment. They are all here. How can we expect them to go away from here, from what the Minister chose to call their inaugural meeting- I put that in inverted commas toowith any sense of purpose or any respect for job which has been bestowed upon them if in this fundamental issue the Minister will not even 24 hours off to consult them.",65
107,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"When I hear the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) sounding almost elated that we are of one accord on the basics of this particular problem, I come a little sceptical. If ever there was trous Minister for Aboriginal Affairs it was honourable member for Wills. He is a nice low, a gendeman and a friend of mine but he was just not a good Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. As this debate has proceeded over the past weeks, I have become increasingly that the welfare of the people who are caught up in the middle of the wrangle that is going on tween the Commonwealth and the State-that is, the Aborigines-is in some danger. The welfare of the Aborigines is of paramount importance. Mr Innes-Crocodil e tears.",66
108,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"I hear a few comments from the other side. I probably have a greater affinity with these people than most members have. the 1940s, in the Second World War years, went to school with them. I saw quite a deal of them. That is probably more than most honourwefinda able members have experienced. The Aborigines of Austraha have come a long way in the past 30-odd years, from the days when I knew of them and went to school with them, when they lived on the fringe of Cooktown in shanties and the communities that were known as 'blacks camps'. as if he These people have moved forward. I visited a number of communities recently, the and I was impressed by the intelligence of the people, by the fact that they are aware of their rights and by the fact that there is an awareness of the world around them. As well they have become more articulate, and that is all to the good of the Aboriginal people of this country. So the welfare of the Aborigines is of paramount importance. I hope that we do not lose sight of that fact Abin this continuing wrangle. We as Europeans have imposed our way of life on them. Who are we to say that our Western way of hfe is better the for them? We have imposed it upon the acquiindigenous people of this nation, and that imposition has caused a number of unfortunate the problems which we are now trying to rectify. The Commonwealth's action in introducing this legislation has been precipitated by the Queensland Government's proposed takeover of the two communities of Mornington Island and Aurukun from the Uniting Church in Australia. the Let me say here and now that, having visited both of those communities, I am convinced of the take deep affinity that those people have with the Uniting Church. I heard the call go out from a senior member of the Uniting Church to the people of Mornington Island: 'If you want us to leave this community we will go'. Repeatedly the people of that community and the people of beAurukun stated that they wanted the Church to a disasremain and that they wanted the Federal the Government to be involved and not the State felGovernment of Queensland. I emphasise this point because to my mind a conflict of policies between the Commonwealth and the State of few Queensland has caused this whole problem in concerned these two communities. beAt meetings of approximately 200 adults out of a population of about 750 in both communities again and again they cried out: 'We want the Uniting Church involved and the Commonwealth Government, not the State Government'. That did not arise because the Church had been bramwashing them. The honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull), Senator Knight, Senator In Bonner, Senator Martin and I moved I individually amongst the people. We talked to them in groups and individually. At no stage did dissenter from the general view put at ordinary meetings or from the view put by the community councils. This legislation is enabling some legislation, not compelling legislation. I want to touch on the issue of States rights, about which the Premier of Queensland is so vocal. It is not a Statesrightsissue at all. Eleven years ago, in 1967, the people of the Commonnation. wealth of Austraha by an ovemhelming maQueenslanders jority voted in favour of amending the Constiin tution so that the Commonwealth could provide for Aborigines throughout the nation. It is States rights issue, yet the Premier of Queensland is saying repeatedly that it intrusion by the Commonwealth into an area in which the State has fullrights.Legally and stitutionally it has norightat all. Mr N. A Brown-Queenslander s supported that overwhelmingly.",66
109,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"I am reminded by my honourethnic able friend that Queenslanders voted overpeople whelmingly in favour of that constitutional change. In my research of the situation in 19671 did not find in newspaper reports any opposition at all to the proposal. There was no No case the referendum. Although the State Government of the day was comparatively silent on the matOutstations ter, the present State Government seesfittoday to cry: 'This is an intrusion by the Commonago, wealth into an area of State responsibility'. I want to refer to the attitude of the Queensland Government. Under Fraser's federalism we have seen a genuine devolution of powers and responto sibilities to the States. It is true that the Commonwere wealth has made mistakes. The States have made mistakes. If we are to make federalism work there has to be goodwill on both sides. I believe that the Queensland Premier is playing dishonest pohtics in relation to this issue. In Jull), Queensland there is more conflict and more travelled bickering going on than there is in the other five Cherbourgwith States put together. Let us not forget that three those States are Labor States and have an opposing philosophy to the Commonwealth's philosCherbourg ophy. The Commonwealth Government has money has been made mistakes and no doubt will continue to people of Cherbourg make them, but the Queensland Government ought to take a long, hard look at its approach federalism and to its relationship with the monwealth as it has developed today. Longserving State Premiers, such as Sir Henry Bolte in has Victoria, Mr Dunstan in South Australia, Sir Francis Nickhn in Queensland and Sir Charles Court in Western Australia, have been successful in their own right. As I see it, they have the been successful quite honestly. Yet the farmers Queensland Premier resorts to Canberrafound bashing time and again. What upsets me more than anything else is bitterness which the Premier of Queensland is engendering in the minds of Queenslanders and the feeling that they are a separate State and a separate race. That is just not on. We are the one Unfortunately, for cheap pohtical gain are led to beheve that down here the Deep South, there are sinister southerners trying to take something away from them. I was not a born and bred in Queensland, which is more than some of the strongest critics of the Comis an monwealth can say. I am working as a Queenslander for the State of Queensland, but I conam also able to take a national outlook. Let us look at what happens in relation to ethnic groups in Australia. The Government, assisted by the States, encourages ethnic groups to pursue their own religions and cultures. We have radio and ethnic newspapers. Indeed even of Danish parentage are encouraged to follow their religion and culture. Yet the Aurukun people, resident in this nation for over 30,000 years, are denied those rights. I can in assure honourable members that at Aurukun they fervently want to maintain their outstations. are part of their culture. They do not want to return to the situation of200 or 300 years but they are quite adamant that they want to return to that style of life. They have done so, and I believe they have done so very successfully. Yet the Queensland Government had attempted impose on those people a system whereby they being asked to return to the central community of Aurukun. I suggest that those people are not nearly as Europeanised as the people of Cherbourg. The honourable member for Bowman (Mr who is in the chamber at the moment, me on Friday, 31 March, to the mission after visiting Aurukun and of Mornington Island. I am led to believe that is known as the show place of the Queensland Government's missions. A lot of spent there, and in my view the are quite contented with what has been done for them by the Queensland to Government. Indeed I do not doubt their loyalty Combecause over a period a great deal of guidance been given to them and a great deal of money has been spent in their community, but the late one could hardly compare Cherbourg, a Europeanised community five kilometres from sizable township of Murgon, nestling amongst a number of communities with some and graziers- a community in which I it impossible to distinguish any full-blood Aborigines-wit h Aurukun and Mornington the Island with 80 per cent or more of their populations being full-blood Aborigines. To compare Cherbourg, which as I say has developed in close proximity to Europeanised communities, with Aurukun and Mornington is nonsense. There has been more capital expenditure at Cherbourg. The funding situation in relation those missions is very mteresting because unable to obtain information-that is, accurate information-concernin g the funding of the reserves by the Queensland Government. A been lump sum figure is included in its Budget but I understand that the breakdown of thatfigureis not available to the general public. It is a scanforcement dalous state of affairs that funds are included the Budget but that the Government appears be not accountable for the individual expendiof ture in each of the communities. When we checked at Cherbourg, the show place of the State Government, we found that absenteeism from work was quite high. We checked at the sawmill, the joinery works, sections where prefabricated homes are made, the pottery and the farm and found that absenPresbyterian teeism was high on that day. There is a European policeman at Cherbourg; yet Murgon is only five kilometres away. The Church has requested repeatedly that a operating European policeman be provided for the am Mornington Island community. Mornington time. Island is several hundred kilometres from the closest European settlement-quite isolated-an yet repeated requests for a European policeman to assist the Aboriginal policemen in the settlethe ment have been refused. Mr Jull-For seven years they have been after a white policeman.",67
110,Mr HODGES,PAIRS,"As the honourable member the for Bowman reminded me, they have requested a European policeman for seven years. In the case of the Hopevale mission and the Bloomfield River mission, both of which are near Cooktown, the need is not so great because a European police sergeant and a European constable are located in Cooktown. In the case of Aurukun also he said: the need is not so great because at Weipa members of the Queensland pohce force are been stationed. I found by questioning that at Cherbourg people own no land of their own, but I detected churchesinterest by those people in the possibility of ownDuring ing their own land. I asked the councillors at iginal Cherbourg: 'Do you not believe that your people provided would be better off if they owned their own plots that had been of land, say 24 or 30 perch blocks, like other Australians?' If those people owned their own in many blocks of land, in the future if they so desired alism they could sell their properties and live elsewhere. They would then have some funds to do that. I detected an interest in that proposal. A number of complaints, particularly in relato tion to health, education and law enforcement, I was have been made by residents of Mornington Island and Aurukun. It is an indictment of the Queensland Government if those services have lacking because the provision of health services, schools and teachers-that is, the education of the people in those communities-and law enin those areas is entirely the responsiin bility of the Queensland Government. It seems to to me that those communities have been deprived adequate services in the past although it was evident to us that education at least was up to standard. The visit to Mornington Island and the Aurukun reserve was mteresting for the five of us the who ventured there. In my view the Uniting Church in Australia and its predecessor, the church, have done an extremely good job with the Aborigines there. Let us not forget that for seven decades-in the case of Aurukun, from 1904, and in the case of Mornington Island, from 1914-the Church has been for the good of those people. As far as I concerned it has done a wonderful job in that In those seven decades governments, State and Federal, took little interest in the welfare of d those people. One can understand their close affinity with the Church and their desire to have Church continue to assist them towards selfmanagement of their affairs. I shall conclude my remarks by referring to the Queensland Director of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement because I believe that intrusion by this gentleman into the political arena is something that must be quite unique in Austrahan politics. I want to read for the House a section of a letter from the Director, Mr Killoran, to the Minister of the day-it was dated Tuesday, 19 October 1976-in introducing his annual report to State Parliament. Among other things The influence of the Christian Churches has in the past an immense power for good within the Aboriginal community as a whole. the That was a nice comment in praise of the the period of first contact when traditional Aborpeople were experiencing immense trauma from a situation of violent social change, ministers of many religions for them a belief and ethic that filled the vacuum created. It is unfortunate to note that the zeal for pastoral care has, instances, been replaced by a philosophy of materiand polidcal bias. The result is proof of the simple statement that 'man does not live by bread alone', and this is instanced by a marked decline in the moral and physical standards of some communities. That is a scathing attack on the churches-o n the Uniting Church in particular because it was obviously directed at it. For a senior public servant to become deeply involved in pohtical argument of this nature I think is scandalous.",68
111,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,"This Bill will come as a great shock not only to the Aboriginal people but also to the people of Austraha generally. It leaves the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Mornington Island dashed in the expectations that they have had built up through the media over recent weeks. The Opposition is very disturbed and disappointed about the inadequacy of the legislation which has no capacity to deal with the fundamental issue which gave rise to the dispute between the Commonwealth and Queensland Governments. Appropriately the honourable Associates member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham), in cheated leading for the Opposition, has moved that this Bill be withdrawn. This Bill, which obviously has been thrown inberespect together with impetuosity and simply designed as a sop to people whose interest has been generated by the media rather than an effective panacea for the problem with which the Aurukun and Mornington Island people are concerned. Of course the Bill should be withtion drawn. It should be withdrawn and referred to He said: the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island. If I that were done, the move would certainly not be madon. without precedent. That process was adopted by and the the Labor Government with the variety oflegiscome lation and great initiatives which characterised Labor administrations between 1972 and 1975. As has been said, the National Aboriginal Conference is currently meeting in Canberra. It is intertwined most insistent that it should be given the opporcussions withinthethis tunity to discuss this legislation. The National Aboriginal Conference, which was sitting yesterBut day when the Bill was in the process of aration, was not consulted. It was fortuitous for some members of the Conference to have made a visit to Parliament House last night and to have icy gained the benefit of some information which ment inahead was virtually leaked to them. They were told of Government hasutilisation. the general subject matter but were the opportunity to examine the details of the Bill. We want to see the legislation referred to the National Aboriginal Conference in order to give the Conference dignity and proper recognition right from the innovative stage in which it findsdivision itself now as it launches into a new area. The Government says that the Conference is to have responsibihty and a real sense of dignity. It says that it is to be treated with respect rather than the maternalism and the indifference which characterised conservative governments' attitudes to Aboriginal problems in the past. We want this legislation withdrawn to take into account the suggestions of the NAC, people of the various reserves in Queensland and indeed in other States as this legislation, if it were found to be effective, could be emulated in and applied to other pans of the country. We want the legislation to provide for the acquisition of reserves existing at 31 March. We want the power vested in the relevant Aboriginal and Island communities. We want to give the Aboriginal people effective control of reserves. We want to ensure that they have a say about land rights. Two years ago to this month I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) this question: Are the terms of the Queensland Government's Aurukun Agreement Act such that Aboriginal people are of royalties and deprived of ownership and customary use of their land? Has the Queensland Government infringed United Nations and International Labour Organisation conventions regarding the rights of indigenous people of their traditional lands, particularly the right to consulted? In what way is it intended to redress this indecent haste, is situation? as The right honourable gentleman replied to me that he had no further answer to give other than the answer that he had given to a previous quesasked by the then member for Parramatta. will be writing to the Premier seeking additional inforMy colleagues the Minister for National Resources Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will also be taking up with the appropriate Ministers the particular aspects that within their responsibility. He went on to talk about foreign investment and said: Since the matter of foreign investment is also closely total situation there will also be discompanies concerned to make sure that this Government's foreign investment policy is maintained. two years have gone by. Apparently the prepcompanies and the Queensland Government have such regard for the foreign investment polof this Government that they are prepared to surge regardless with a $ 1,000m investbauxite been Of course the Federal ineffective in the two years hardly given that have since transpired. This legislation is introduced in a FederalState atmosphere of rancour, animosity and bitter dissension. It provides further evidence of the in and divided purpose of the Government parties and the lack of common objectives of the Liberal and National Country Parties at State and Federal levels. The people in the ties are Jekylls and Hydes. They speak with different voices. They contradict one another. This Bill was conceived by an action of State Liberal-National Party intimidation. It was tured by inter-government distrust and jealousy. It was born in an atmosphere of panic, desperaattempt. tion and expediency. The Commonwealth-State on/off negotiation process over the future of Aurukun and Morfaith nington Island has now totally broken down. have a case now of irretrievable matrimonial breakdown between governments. The only this marriage guidance counsellors appropriate to this case-the Aboriginal people-ar e being gone. ignored. They should be consulted and listened to with respect to this situation. We have received telegrams from the NAC bdicating that consultation is the very cornerstone of its claims and aspirations. Everything that has happened the antithesis of the commitments that are made from time to time by the Government in respect of this consultative process. Paternalism is still the order of the day when the greatest controto versy about Aboriginal affairs is dropped from stake the greatest height with the least possible notice. We are going backwards and not forward. This Bill has not been the subject of consulthings tation. The opportunity of consultation has been given to the Government of Queensland the Parhamentary Opposition. It is hard imagine a Bill of this complexity and significance introduced as it was today going through all stages contrary to all the parliamentary traYarrabah ditions. Usually a week's notice know that the Government expected to get the Bill through the Senate as well. For what purto The pose? It is a sop to the Aboriginal are just trying to present some pubhc relations Aboriginala people. per se for the benefit of this benevolent Prime refer to it in other than Minister who is suddenly seeking to appear to be said: concerned about Aboriginal welfare. Aboriginal communities and the Conference, as I have said, have also been ignored. The issue that gaveriseto this Bill was the question of mining on Aboriginal reserves. It matter that is the subject of the Aurukun AssociHoly ates Agreement Act which was enacted by the Queensland Government in 1975. It the one hand the Queensland Government and on the other an overseas consortium which is not he said: answerable to the people of this country but which is intent on reaping out the resources of . . this country in a vandalistic way as quickly as it barrage can for the purpose of repatriating dividends to ground, overseas shareholders. This consortium is made up of the Tipperary Corporation, which has 40 lem. He said: parper cent of the shares, Billiton Aluminium Australia, which has 40 per cent of the shares, and Aluminium Pechiney Holdings Pty Limited, which has 20 per cent of the shares. We know nurabout the Aboriginal people's attempt to have a say in these matters. It was not just a casual It took them right to the Privy Council. Why, we have such an anachronistic state of affairs in Queensland that we do not even have and trust in the Australiana that is We represented by our own High Court. We had to see an issue concerning the indigenous people of country dragged embarrassingly off to a high court of another land. That is as far as it has This agreement covers a mining lease of 1905 square kilometres, of which 1800 square kilometres is on land reserved for the benefit of the Aboriginal inhabitants. The proposal also inis volves the likely estabUshment of an alumina refinery and smelter with all its ramifications-al l its roads, its ponds, its store houses, its heaps of mullock and all the rest of it. The consequences the Aboriginal people are immeasurable. At is their culture, their social structure, their traditions, their environment, their sacred sites and their religion. Those things are the playof the Bjelke-Petersen and Fraser governnot ments. We are not talking just about Aurukun or and Mornington Island. We are also talking to about the other reserves in QueenslandBamaga, Bloomfield River, Cherbourg, Edward River, Hopevale, Lockhart River, Palm Island, and so on. This precedent will affect all at least is given. I those places. Aurukun mining legislation was referred people.

He then dealt with the fear of the alcohol probThe Mission is presently free of liquor and the attendant miseries usually associated with drink. The responsible Aurukuns want to keep it this way. He went on to deal with the protection of the environment and the restoration of mined land because the Aboriginal people talked to him about it. He said: The Aurukuns expressed disappointment that the companies had not adequately consulted with them, especially upon the effect the proposed mining development would have upon the environment. He also dealt with the protection of the Aurukun settlement, hunting and fishing rights and the honouring of agreements and the enforcement of the law. He said: The nearest Queensland policeman is many miles and hours away and the people feel helpless against European intrusion, especially if there is a breaking of the la w. It was a Labor Government which entered into agreements with four of the mainland States to enable the Commonwealth to exercise responsibility in regard to Aboriginal affairs. The State of Victoria was co-operative, as were the States of South Austraha, New South Wales and Western consultation. Australia. As a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I had something to do with the making those agreements. The honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant), who has participated in this debate, is another former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He was able to enter into such agreements. Mr Hodges-Bot h disasters.",69
112,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,"The honourable Church, member for Petrie should ask the people whether that era is regarded as disasing trous. All that has happened since then has been a reckless breaking of promises in regard original affairs by the Government that sucneed ceeded the Whitlam Government, a cutting of that the availabihty of finance and a slowing down of initiatives. There is no doubt in the minds of Aboriginal people as to which government other served them best. The former Labor Governible ment negotiated successfully agreements with land-th four of the States and was in the process of ing a great impact on the Queensland situation as well. Let us remember that only Queensland remains unco-operative. It has a Premier who is as stinted, defiant and racist as Rhodesia's Ian Smith. This is the second occasion that a Commonmunity. wealth Government has had to make special laws in respect of Queensland. The first occasion, of course, was the passage of the Aboriginal Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discrimitablished natory Laws) Act 1973. This situation that has given rise to the introduction of this Bill is the discovery of bauxite at Aurukun. Queensland's bauxite deposits can be considered in similar terms to the uranium deposits in the Northern Territory, the iron ore deposits at Yeelirie in Western Australia and the diamonds at Oombulgurri in the Kimberleys. Already some efforts have been made in those States to safeguard the situation of Aboriginals. We have to apply the same principles. We have to work together, setting pohtics aside if you hke, to isolate BjelkePetersenism. That needs to be done. I believe that some of the speakers in this debate from the National Country Party and the Liberal Party could have been far more forthright and unambiguous in that regard. The Queensland Government has been intransigent in its attitude. In a nutshell the attitude of the Premier of Queensland is in union with that of the Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, who said on 1 June 1977 in connection with uranium mining at Yeelirie: We could not agree to Aboriginal consent but only to of That simply means that the compames and the Government will talk to Aborigines but will not listen or, if they hsten, will not take any notice. The Aboriginal communities at Aurukun and Mornington Island distrust the Queensland Government because they know that they will be sold down theriverin relation to mining. They would rather have the guidance of the Uniting which has managed Aurukun since 1904 Aboriginal self-management Island and Mornington since 1914. They want with the Uniting Church givpractical assistance and the Commonwealth to AbGovernment providingfinancialsupport. They consultative assistance to the extent that they determine from time to time. I do not doubt in their minds they hope to be totally the independent of the Uniting Church and all the do-gooders, if you hke, as soon as it is possto accomplish that. More than anything else they want an effective say over the use of their makyears. e land they have used for thousands of Despite all the pretence and public relations, this Bill will not achieve that. In other words, the Aboriginal people have been sold short. This Bill is purely about those people and their comIt does not have the effect of giving them landrights.It has nothing to do with the land rights issue. The Bill is capable of conceding cerand tainrightsand prerogatives to communities esunder the Queensland Aborigines Act of 1971. One wonders why the Government is so anxious to heap further indignity on that legislation, which is the subject of embarrassment for Hyde, J.M. all Australians. The Queensland legislation is the Jarman, most undignified and inhumane legislation relatJohnston, Roger ing to Aboriginals in operation in this country.

116,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"I move: 1. Omit the dennition of'Aboriginal Community', substitute the following dennition: 'Aboriginal Community' means a community of persons that, on 31 March 1978, was a community for Aborigines for the purposes of the Aborigines Act;'. 2. Omit the definition of'Aboriginal Reserve', substitute the following definition:' ""Aborigmal Reserve"" means any land that, on 31 March 1978, was a reserve for the purposes Tellers: of the Aborigines Act;'. 3.

Government and to the Committee that it would be appropriate at this stage of the deliberations Tellers: for the Minister to move that progress be Johnson, Les reported, the amendments having been circulated and in the hands of honourable members. Although I am a new member of the Parhament I have had some experience in another parliament, and I am completely appalled at a process which introduces into the House a Bill that the Government has said pays regard to the wishes, the desires and the aspirations of the Aboriginal community to make their own decisions and to be involved in the important process of decision-making as citizens In Committee of that great Commonwealth. I am bound to say that the Aboriginal community and the members of the National Aboriginal Conference who have sat in the Parhament throughout the debate have indicated the degree of their interest and concern in this matter. I wish to place my protest on record and to urge the Minister to consider what he is doing. He received today a telegram from the National Aboriginal Conference. What did that telegram ask the Government to do? It was the unanimous decision of the first conference of people representing the opinions and thoughts and feelings of the Aboriginal people",73
117,Mr BAILLIEU,PAIRS,What did the telegram say?,73
118,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"I will read it out for the benefit of the honourable member. I think it is important that Government members know what is in the telegram because it involves some very important matters of principle. The telegram states: NAC unanimously moved this morning to request the Federal Government and the Parliament to delay passage of the Bill for the normal period of approximately one week so that the people of Mornington Island, Aurukun, the Uniting Church Queensland, the NAC can seek independent legal advice and make recommendations to overcome obvious inadequacies in the proposed legislation. The motion was moved by the Queensland Chairman and seconded by Isaac Zingle representing Aurukun and Tony Assan representing Mornington Island.",73
119,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,Can you vouch for this telegram?,74
120,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"I can and I will. What concerns me, and I say this to the honourable member for Hindmarsh, is this: Has a more reasonable request ever been made to any parhament in the Commonwealth? I realise that the Aboriginal people do not carry quite the same weight with the Minister as does Mr Moyes and the representatives of IBM. They might not carry the same weight as people who contribute large amounts to the political funds of Government parties, but has a more legitimate request ever come before the Parhament? It is a plea to the Parhament and to the Minister, who less than three days ago was the sponsor of a function at which he told the members of the National Aboriginal Conference how deUghted he was to have them here, how concerned he was that they should engage in deliberations and let him and the Government know what they wanted. If ever there was an exercise in political hypocrisy and poltiical patronage it is this one. On Monday night the Minister acted as host at a function of the National Aboriginal Conference, but when every member of that Conference asks him to do nothing more than delay the passage of this legislation for one week to enable them to consider its impUcations, obtain their own legal advice and put whatever representations they feel can be put to him, this Government turns its back on that request.",74
121,Mr YATES,PAIRS,It can be done in the Senate. Why not?,74
122,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"This request represents a plea to the honourable member, who has not been in the chamber all night. I condemn him for that. The Aboriginal people have sat here and listened to the argument. The honourable member has not. It is time that the Parliament and members of the Government made up their minds about this. Do they really regard this cise as being one of trooping in through the door and putting up their hands, turning their backs on one of the most legitimate and proper requests ever to have come before a parhament? Is this an enormous demand? What the nal people are asking for is very simple. They asking the Government to pause for one week. What is going to happen in the course of one week? The Premier of Queensland has said that he wants a cooling-otT period. Presumably he is not doing anything.",74
123,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,PAIRS,So there is no element of urgency?,74
124,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"The Premier of Queensland, and the records are here, has said on public radio that as far as he is concerned there ought to be a cooling-off period. Interestingly enough, he has also said that there have been all sorts of telephone conversations and he is not very worried because everything will be all right in the end. There is no element of urgency, and the National Aboriginal Conference has said to the members of the House of Representatives: 'We want you to pause. We want you to think. We want you to give us time so that we can get the benefit of our own independent legal assistance.' I am not going to be a hypocrite. I know and the honourable member for Holt (Mr Yates) knows that he is going to vote against all these amendments. I am not going to waste my time putting legal arguments about a set of amendments that the honourable member knows he and every one of his colleagues will vote against. Mr Ruddock-You are not going to try to persuade us?",74
125,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,"I am not going to try to persuade you. The honourable member is the chairman of an all-party parUamentary committee and he moves around Australia saying that he is concerned about the pUght and the problems of the Aborigines. I accept his concern, but the real test for the honourable gentleman is this: This is not an improper request. It is a highly responsible and proper request from a group of Australian citizens whose future is being determined by this legislauon. They have asked the Parliament and the Minister for a delay of one weekthat is all they have asked for-in order to get an independent assessment of the effect that this legislation will have on them and in order to make representations to the Minister. The Minister has not told this House what is wrong with that request. Honourable members opposite can talk until they are blue in the face about Aurukun exerand Mornington Island. They say on the one hand that they believeConsideration interrupted. AborigiThe DEPUTY CHAIRMAN (Dr Jenkins)are Order! It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House I shall report progress. Progress reported. NA",74
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr M ill a r )Order! It being 10.30 p.m., in accordance with the order of the House I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Mr Fife- Mr Deputy Speaker, I require that the motion be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. NA ISLANDERS (QUEENSLAND RESERVES NA SELF-MANAGEMENT) BILL 1978 Consideration resumed.",75
127,Mr HOLDING,AND COMMUNITIES," I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to consider as a proper and honourable course available to this Parhament to have the Committee report progress in respect of this Bill in order that the members of the Aboriginal community who have had Uttle time to consider its impUcations which vitally affect their future will be given time to give the Bill that consideration. I believe that that is the proper course. I do not know whether the Aborigines will accept our amendments or support the Government's Bill. It may well be that they regard the Bill as entirely adequate. But it is wrong and hypocritical for the Committee to say that it is passing a Bill which will enable Aboriginal citizens to make decisions about their own future. It is silly for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to be saying that this Government is about to give Aborigines the right to make decisions about their own future when the first request that comes from their own body, the National Aboriginal Conference, of which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs thinks highly, is to give it some time so that it can deliberate on this legislation, make submissions if it feels the need to do so and come back to the Parliament on the matter.",75
128,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND COMMUNITIES,Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,75
129,Mr RUDDOCK,AND COMMUNITIES," I am very disappointed that the time available for this Committee debate has been taken up with the discussion we have just heard from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). I am disappointed because some three weeks ago we were told that the Opposition would facilitate the passage of this sort of legislation with the utmost expedition because it was urgent, because it was considered to be urgent. It was argued that it would be urgent and that it would be necessary. Now when the legislation is before us and when it is necessary for it to be dealt with expeditiously, we have this provocative style of speaking which is unhelpful and which certainly will not contribute in any way to a worthwhile consideration of this important piece of legislation. We have before us four amendments moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I have to take them on their face value. I do not have any appreciation of what he considers them to mean, yet I will be asked to vote on them. It is a charade because the honourable member puts In Committee me in the position of having to vote on these amendments having heard nothing of his reasons for considering them necessary. He may have made the point that this matter could not be considered because he has wasted his timeMr Martyr-And ours.",75
130,Mr RUDDOCK,AND COMMUNITIES,"And ours too, yes, by discussing something that was argued and dealt with tonight by the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham), perhaps far more effectively, if I may say so, than the matter was argued in the speech we have just heard from the honourable member. Mr Carlton-He just said it seven times.",75
131,Mr RUDDOCK,AND COMMUNITIES,"Yes, he said it several times. I would agree with that also.",75
132,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND COMMUNITIES,Dr Jenkins)Order! I ask the honourable member to ignore interjections and to address himself to the clause.,75
133,Mr RUDDOCK,AND COMMUNITIES,"The fact of the matter is that we proceeded to deal with that matter and it was voted upon. Now four amendments are before the Committee, each of them relating to important definition clauses. Unless one were able to sit down and contemplate what the meaning of the amendments may be, one would not know what the Opposition intends. As I understand it, the intention of defining Aboriginal communities and reserves, Islander communities and reserves as communities that on a particular date-3 1 March 1978-were communities for the purposes of the Act is to effect the acquisition of those sites, reserves or communities on that date. The problem is that if that is the intention of the Opposition, it is a very inadequate method, in legal terms, of endeavouring to acquire property. Provisions are included in the legislation to allow the proper Acts relating to the acquisition of land to be used in appropriate cases. But to use the provisions in this Bill in a general way to acquire, possibly acquire or to intend to acquire property without making provision for just terms and without considering any other legislation that may make provision for just terms puts at risk the carriage of this legislation. It puts it at a point where under chaUenge it can be declared to be invaUd by a court. If that is the consequence of the amendment, I regard it as being poorly thought out and one which is not deserving of consideration by this Committee. We just cannot afford to have this legislation dealt with in this way and put atriskby endeavouring to acquire property without making provision for just terms. This is the nub of the matter. I return to the point I made at the beginning: If this is the intention of the Opposition, as I believe it is from my reading of these amendments, it would have been worthy of the people that the honourable member says he is endeavouring to assist in this discussion at least to have advanced or endeavoured to advance the reasons for our considering it. On the face of the amendments, as I read them, there is no reason for them to be supported by the Committee or by the Government and good reasons why the Opposition ought to withdraw them and re-think its position on this question. The Opposition is putting this legislation at risk.",75
134,Mr VINER,AND COMMUNITIES," I should like briefly to answer a couple of the points made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding). He, Uke the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, has asked for a delay in the passage of this legislation for a week so that it might be considered further. I accept the point made by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) that members of the Opposition, when debating a matter of pubUc importance about a fortnight ago, said that they would facilitate legislation of this kind because of its urgency. I make this further point, and this is the fundamental reason that this legislation cannot be delayed: I was at Aurukun recently. I attended a private session of the Aboriginal council. The members of the council were all emphatic that they wanted the Commonwealth to step in straight away, without delay, to protect them and to prevent a takeover. Some 200 to 2S0 adults were in attendance at a pubUc meeting. Many men and women spoke very eloquently about their desire for Commonwealth action. They said that they wanted no delay. I remember vividly that, when addressing himself to this question, Mr Frank Yungaporta said: 'We want you, the Minister, to go back to Canberra and to see that that legislation is passed through Parhament next week. * That is, of course, this week. I know that if this legislation is delayed and if Frank Yungaporta, Donald Peinkinna and the other councillors of Aurukun knew that this Government had delayed the passage of the legislation and put their interests in jeopardy so that the Queensland Government could move in and take over administration, they would be absolutely devastated. Likewise, when I was at Mornington Island, a pubhc meeting was held attended by some 150 to 200 people. They asked the Commonwealth to move immediately. They knew that legislation was being prepared and they asked me to see that it passed through Parhament without delay. When I informed them that I would be reporting to Cabinet last Monday and recommending that the legislation be introduced this week they said to me: ' Mr Minister, see that it is introduced and see that it is passed through the Parliament this week.' If that legislation is not passed through this Parhament this Government will have failed the people whom it said it would stand by. I know that this legislation will do all that those people have asked. It will prevent any takeover by the State Government of the management of those two communities. That is what this legislation is designed to do and that is what it will do most effectively. Like the honourable member for Dundas, I was surprised not to hear any arguments why the Government should accept the amendments proposed by the Opposition. There are serious legal defects in the argument which, if allowed to be carried, would throw into jeopardy the constitutional validity of this legislation. I am not going to tell Opposition members how to do their legal homework but I can assure them that if the Committee carried this amendment without passing other amendments, the Bill would fail. I am certainly not going to be a party to that. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 4 agreed to. Clause 5. (1) Where(a) the Council Tor an Aboriginal Reserve requests the Minister to make a declaration under this sub-secuon; or (b) the Minister is satisfied that a substantial majority of the adult Aboriginals resident on an Aboriginal Reserve wish to manage and control their own anairs in the manner provided for by this Act, the Mmister may, by notice published in the Gazette, declare the reserve to be an Aboriginal Reserve to which this Act applies. (2) Where(a) the Council for an Islander Reserve requests the Minister to make a declaration under this sub-section; or (b) the Minister is satisfied that a substantial majority of the adult Islanders resident on an Islander Reserve wish to manage and manner provided for by this Act, the Minister may, by notice the reserve to be an Islander Reserve to which this Act appUes. (3) Where(a) the Council for an Aboriginal Community requests the Minister to make a declaration under this subsection; or (b) the Minister is satisfied that a substantial majority of the adult Aboriginals who are the members of an Aboriginal Community wish to manage and control their own affairs in the manner provided for by this Act, the Minister may, by notice published in the Gazette, declare the Community to be an Aborigmal Community to which this Act appUes. (4) Where(a) the Council for an Islander Community requests the Minister to make a declaration under this sub-section; or (b) the Minister is satisfied that a substantial majority of the adult Islanders who are the members of an Islander Community wish to manage and control their own affairs in the manner provided for by this Act, the Minister may, by notice published in the Gazette, declare the Community to be an Islander Community to which this Act appUes.",76
135,Mr BARRY JONES,AND COMMUNITIES," I seek Labor leave to move circulated amendments 5,6,7 8 together. Leave granted. I move: 1. In sub-clause (1), omit 'the Minister may', substitute 'the Minister shall, within 30 days after receiving or being so satisfied, as the case may be,'. 2. In sub-clause (2) omit 'the Minister may', substitute Minister shall, within 30 days being so satisfied, as the case may be,'. 3. In sub-clause (3), omit 'the Minister may', substitute 'the Minister shall, within 30 days after receiving the or being so satisfied, as the case may be,'. 4. In sub-clause (4), omit 'the Minister may', substitute 'the Minister shall, within 30 days after receiving the or being so satisfied, as the case may be,'. Let me explain briefly the purport of these amendments. I think there never was a piece legislation with such a deceptive long title. purpose of the Bill is to 'empower' Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, who live on reserves in Queensland, to manage and control their own affairs. There is very Uttle in this Bill and certhere tainly nothing in clause 5 about management control. It might have been more effective haps to have called this Bill the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Commonwealth Ministerial Control) Bill because, whenever the question of the distribution of power is mentioned, one finds that the strength of the Aboriginal control their own affairs in the reserve councUs is very small and the power of published in the Gazette, declare the Minister is very strong. Essentially in proposed clause 5, in which there are four subclauses, each of which the Opposition seeks to amend, the proposal is that where a councU for an Aboriginal reserve or an Islander reserve requests the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make a declaration or even where the Minister is satisfied that a substantial majority of the adult Islanders or Aborigines want the Commonwealth to take action, the Minister may take action. But the clause does not state when. The two points that are made in this series of four amendments which the Opposition has moved to clause 5 are,firstly,that in each case the action should be imperative rather than permissive. In other words: The Minister shall take action. Secondly, the amendments impose a time hmit. The Opposition's amendment states that the Minister shaU, within 30 days after receiving the request, declare the reserve to be an Aboriginal reserve. The Bill says that the Minister may, by notice, declare the reserve to be an Aboriginal reserve to which this legislation will apply but when shall he do it? Will it be within a year of receiving notice, within five years, within the life of the Parliament, within a generation or until the Party is next in office? How long will it be? and It could be two and a half years. The Opposition beUeves that, if the Government is doing what the Bill says, if it is empowering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to the request have self-management-and that is the other word that appears in the short title of the Bill-it 'the ought to make it possible for them to have that after receiving the request or self-management. We believe that the only way they will have that self-management is to require request the Minister, once he has received that request and once it has satisfied either of the criteria laid down in the Bill, to declare the reserve an Aborrequest iginal reserve which he shall do within a reasonable time. It is extraordinary that the Minister has been telling us tonight that the Government of cannot wait. The legislation must be passed The through the House tonight. The Government cannot brook any delay. But when we look at the actual legislation and ask what are the time hmits in the legislation, the Minister says that are no time limits. There is absolutely no or urgency. Once the Bill is passed there is no perurgency about the action the Government will take. He says it can be done any old time. I think it is absolutely essential to make sure that the terion of self-management which appears in the short title of the Bill but which appears nowhere else in the legislation be carried out. We have been told that the Minister said a ter. Having couple of weeks ago that the Opposition had incouple dicated that the Bill had to be passed urgently pressing without delay. That is true. couple of weeks ago. But we never dreamt in our which, in this form, most censorious moment that we would be faced his discretion and makes with such a shonky piece of legislation as has in councils of the Aboriginal and fact been dished up to us.",77
136,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,AND COMMUNITIES,O r that backdown.,78
137,Mr BARRY JONES,AND COMMUNITIES,"Or, as my friend the honourable member for Hindmarsh points out, correct. that the Premier of Queensland would back down. There have been several backings down over the whole history of this matter. First there was a backing down by the Minister for Aborigiindicates, nal Affairs and the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon). It was the most extraordinary and there craven back down since Henry IV went to limit Canossa. They backed down only to find that Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had cided to take on his role of supremo. Once more, in his role as the great destroyer, the next person in his sights is the Premier of Queensland. I not a believer in capital punishment but I think in this case I am prepared to make an exception for the Premier of Queensland. He is obviously marked out for destruction. It may well be that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs may go down with him. There has been absolute supine weaknot ness with the Government taking more positions than found in the Karma Sutra over the last couple of weeks. We have been told about the discretion. great urgency of this matter and we have heard about the consultations that took place. But did the Mirjister show the people at Aurukun Bill? Of course he did not show them the Bill. He used that magic monosyllable 'it'. They said: 'We want it passed'. But if they said to him: 'What is the 'it' that we want passed', he simply clasped the draft legislation to his bosom refused to show it to them. They did not know what was in the legislation, and the Opposition did not know what was in the legislation until o'clock last night. That was the first opportunity we had to look at it. It is a difficult, complex Bill in many ways, it ill becomes the Government to act in this way, recognising the poor resources that Opposition members have in this Parhament compared with the enormous resources that Government members have in this place. The Government legislation. crishould recognise that this is not an evenly balanced Bill, that no effective power is given to the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander councils but that a great deal of power is given to the Minisseen the Minister's form in the last of weeks, I think we are justified in exsome anxiety as to how those important We did say that a discretions to the are to be exercised. I make this appeal Minister: Instead of allowing for a clause enlarges his prerogatives and the authority of the Islander reserves very low indeed, he should do something to Bjelke would redress the balance.",78
138,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,AND COMMUNITIES,Are you a lawyer?,78
139,Mr BARRY JONES,AND COMMUNITIES,"I confess that that is I appeal to the Minister at this late stage or when this legislation is passing between here and the other place to take into consideration that if the Bill is as urgent as he says and if, as he he intends to declare Aurukun and Mornington Island at the earliest opportunity, is no reason why there should not be a time set in this clause. I ask the Minister to accept the amendments Nos 5 to 8 which change the nature deand the balance of forces in clause 5.",78
140,Mr VINER,AND COMMUNITIES,"Thes e amendments are not acceptable to the Government. If the Opposition's amendments were carried, the effect could well be to put a community in a most unenviable situation. We might conceivably have a situation in which, on a question of this kind, a council would reflect the wishes of a substantial majority of the people. Yet the amendments would",78
141,Mr HOLDING,AND COMMUNITIES,Then it is a matter for your,78
142,Mr VINER,AND COMMUNITIES,"It is now, but it would not be the under the amendments. The amendments would require the Minister to accept the decision of the council notwithstanding that, by some act of the majority of the people in the community, he knew it was not what they wanted. Furthermore, and as my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has pointed out, altering 'may' to 'shall' and making it mandatory would 10 not remove the requirement that the Minister must be satisfied in that situation that a substantial majority of the adult Aboriginals were in favour of it. By the amendments a matter of and judgment would be required by the Minister before he had to act in a mandatory fashion. I point out that the Opposition by its amendments would be taking away from the community as a whole a most beneficial provision of this Furthermore, a council for an Aboriginal reserve is a council constituted under the provisions of the Queensland legislation which provides that there is an election. What would happen, for example, if in the future the Queensland legislation were altered to provide not for an elected council but for an appointed council? In that event, by the Opposition's amendments, the Minister would be required by way of mandatory act to do what that council asked him to do, irrespective of whether that council truly reflected the wishes of the people. I think that the Committee can see that the amendments moved by the Opposition would be quite detrimental to the interests of the community and would not be in its interests at all. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 agreed to. Remainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a whole.",78
143,Mr HOLDING,AND COMMUNITIES," I seek leave to move amendments 9 to 16 as circulated, together with an additional amendment which I understand is in the hands of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) and the Chair. Leave granted.",79
144,Mr HOLDING,AND COMMUNITIES,"The amendments relate to clauses 7, 9, 10, 12 and 15 and propose the addition of a new clause 12A. The relevant clauses read in part as follows: Clause 7. (4) The Council for a Community to which this Act applies has such other functions as are conferred on it by regulations, being functions in relation Islanders who are members of that Community or are on that part of the Reserve on which the Community is established that is appropriated for the use of the Community. Clause 9. (2) Sub-secdon (1) shall not be construed as preventing any body, authority or person other than the Council for a Reserve to which this Act appUes, or for a Communtiy to which this Act appUes, from providing or making available for the Aboriginals or Islanders who who are members of that Community, as the case may be, any services, including services relating to all or any of matters specified in sub-secuon (1). Clause 10. (4) A by-law has no effect unless it has been approved the Minister. (5) Where the Minister approves any by-laws, he shall cause a copy of the by-laws to be laid before the Parliament within IS sitting days of that House after the giving ofhis approval. (9) A by-law does not apply in relation to a person who is not an Aborigmal or an Islander. Clause 12. (1) Where(a) there is not in force under the Aborigines Act or Torres Strait Islanders Act in respect of a person a permit authorizing the person to reside on, or visit, a Reserve to which this Act applies, being a person who is not otherwise entitled to reside on, or visit, the Reserve; and (b) the Council for the Reserve is satisfied that it would be for the benefit of the Aboriginal community or the Islander community, as the case may be, residing on the Reserve to permit the person to reside on, or visit, the Reserve. the Council may authorize the person to reside on, or visit, the Reserve. (2) A person in respect of whom there is in force an authority under sub-secuon (1) to reside on, or visit, a Reserve shall not be prevented from entering and residing on, or visiting, as the case may be, and shall not be ejected from, the Reserve by reason that a permit authorizing him to reside on, or visit, the Reserve is not in force inrespectof him under the Aborigines Act or the Tones Strait Islanders Act, and it shall not, for that reason, be unlawful for the person to be on the Reserve. (3) Where(a) there is not in force under the Aborigines Act or Torres Strait Islanders Act in respect of a person a permit authorizing the person to reside on, or visit, a Reserve to which this Act applies, being a person who is not otherwise entided to reside on, or visit, the Reserve; and (b) the Council for a Community to which this Act appUes, being a Community which is established on the Reserve, is satisfied that it would be for the benefit of that Community to permit the person to reside on, or visit, that part of the Reserve appropriated for the use of that Community, the the Council may authorize the person to reside on, or visit, to Aboriginals or that part of the Reserve.

(1) The Commonwealth may make available to the Counthe cil for a Reserve to which this Act applies, or for a Community to which this Act applies, for the purpose of enabling the Council to perform its functions, any land acquired by or otherwise vested in the Commonwealth. (2) For the purpose of making land available under subby section (1), the Commonwealth may acquire the land under the Lands Acquisition Act 1955. (3) In this secdon, 'land' has the same meaning as in the each House of Lands Acquisition Act 1955. I move: 1. In clause 7 (4), omit'that part of. 2. In clause 7 (4), omit 'that is appropriated for the use of the Community'. 3. In clause 9 (2), after 'available', insert', with the consent of the Minister,'. 4. In clause 10, omit sub-clauses (4) and (S), substitute the following sub-clauses: '(4) A by-law has no effect until it is received by the Minister. '(5) Where the Minister receives a copy of any by-laws, he shall cause a copy of the by-laws to be laid before each House of the Parhament on the first sitting day of that House after the day on which by-laws.'. 5. In clause 10, omit sub-clause (9). 6. Omit clause 12 and insert the following clause' 12 (1) no person not being an Aboriginal or Islander shall reside on or visit a reserve or community without the permission of the Council or by the consent of the Minister. (2) no person being an Aboriginal or Islander will be prevented from residing on or visiting a reserve or community except by the decision of the Council and with the consent of the Minister.' 7. After clause 12, insert the following new clause: '12A. Where premises situated on a Reserve to which this Act applies, or on munity to which this Act applies, are occupied by an Aboriginal or Islander, a person is not entitled, without sent of the Aboriginal or Islander, to enter those premises unless, if the Reserve on which those premises are situated were not a Reserve, the entry would not be unlawful.'. 8. In clause 15 (l),after'availableto',insert'orvestin'. 9. In clause 15 (2), after 'available', insert 'to, or vesting land in, a Council'. In the time remaining it is not possible to speak in any detail to all the amendments that are now before the Chair. I can say only that it has been the intention of the Opposition in moving these amendments to strengthen the Bill in order to give effect to the Government's announced intention to strengthen the rights and the prerogatives of the Aboriginal people in determining their own future. It is perfectly clear from the statements so far made by the Minister that not only does he not seriously consider these amendments but also he has not even understood them. I suppose that he is in the same position as every other honourable member. The way in which this Bill has been treated by the Government and the way in which the amendments to very important legislation now have to be put in to to without any full debate or full consideration and without any argument of the real issues, condemns the Government and its approach to this whole matter. I believe that when what has occurred is understood by the Aboriginal communities they will condemn the Government for the way in which it has limitedMr Ruddock-We cannot help it if you cannot marshal your thoughts.",79
145,Mr HOLDINC,AND COMMUNITIES,"If the honourable gentleman ever has a thought that is an original thought I will be delighted to sit down and listen to him. The fact is that he has been a party to a process, the result of which is that the Committee has not had any opportunity to consider adequately the amendments. The Opposition has not had an adequate opportunity to present its amendments. I do not ask the honourable gentlemen to understand them. They are probably too difficult and complex for him. At least I would like him to he receives a copy of those have had an opportunity to debate them. The only contribution that has been made by him and by the Minister to the other amendments indicates that, in the time that has been available to them, they have not been able to consider fully or to understand adequately our amendments, just as it has not been possible for the Committee to debate them fully. Having regard to the importance of this issue, it seems to me that the course that has been adopted by the Government does it no credit at all. The course that has been adopted by the which there is established a ComMinister does him no credit at all. The only arguthe conments that have been advanced as to why we have to curtail our rights in this matter is that the Minister does not trust Bjelke-Petersen. That is what it comes down to. Mr Ruddock-Giv e us your thoughts on the amendments. That is what we want to hear.",80
146,Mr HOLDING,AND COMMUNITIES,"The honourable gentleman will not be able to debate in any way that is at all effective the merits of the amendments simply because the Government itself has chosen a course which means that they cannot be considered fully by honourable members. What I am saying is that we have now put those amendments. There will be no time for me or any other member on the Opposition side to argue this case. The reason for that is that the Minister in charge of the legislation says that he does not trust Mr Bjelke-Petersen. We have to adopt this tactic because he does not know what the State coalition government and the gentlemen opposite who share that political philosophy will do. That is why the House has to curtail its rights and prerogatives. Mr Bjelke-Petersen is on record as saying that he is not worried about this legislation because of telephone conversations that have taken place between him and responsible Ministers. Basically this all comes down to a prearranged exercise designed to push this legislation through the Parliament as quickly as possible to limit any effective debate, in the hope that the Aboriginal people will not understand that the Minister was perfectly happy to make deals with Bjelke-Petersen less than a week ago. Mr Bjelke-Petersen says that the deals are still on. We are in the unfortunate situation that the Aboriginal people who might have come here in the hope of receiving some justice, compassion and understanding from this Government are really in a situation in which what they are being given is contained in a very hmited exercise indeed. The rights of the Queensland Governmentwhich the Minister says he does not trust-to walk into their reserves and therightsof the Queensland Government to apply continued pressure upon the Aboriginal people in the reserves that are the subject of this debate can continue and will continue by virtue of the prearranged decisions that have been made by this Minister and his colleagues. All I can say is that the way in which this debate has been conducted is a shameful exercise compared with the way that parliaments ought to work. I apologise publicly to the Aboriginal people for the shameful way in which their interests have been sold down the drain as a result of the collusion of the Minister and his pohtical colleagues in Queensland.",80
147,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND COMMUNITIES,"In addition to the amendments previously circulated an amendment relating to clause 12 has now been circulated. The question is: That amendments Nos. 9 to 16 together with the amendment to clause 12, which was recently circulated, be to.",81

I will now speak some truths for the Aboriginal people with whom I grew up. Many more black people than white people nursed me when I was a child. I accuse the majority of people sitting on the Australian Labor Party benches of being utterly racist. Let me explain that. It applies to the whole Bill",81

150,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND COMMUNITIES,I ask the honourable member for Kennedy to moderate his comments. I call the honourable member for Kennedy.,81
151,Mr HOLDING,AND COMMUNITIES,"Iriseto a point of order. I did not ask you, Mr Deputy Chairman, to request the honourable gentleman to moderate his language. I asked that you request him to withdraw it on the grounds that I find it personally offensive and I submit that it is also unparliamentary.",81
152,Mr KATTER,AND COMMUNITIES,"I submit that I said that they were all mainly racist, and I have not identified any individuals.",81
153,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND COMMUNITIES,Order! I think the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will recall that the honourable member for Kennedy used a generalisation. It is not appropriate that the remark be withdrawn in these circumstances. I call the honourable member for Kennedy.,81
154,Mr KATTER,AND COMMUNITIES,I am a gentle soul; I never try to offend anybody. I am like these people about whom we are speaking. I shall relate to the Committee one or two incidents that have occurred in this place. When I was shadow Minister for Northern Australia. I sat at the table opposite a Minister of the Whitlam Government. On the adjournment- I ask the people in the galleries to note this well- a member of the Labor Party rose to speak on the Aboriginal question. The Minister-the Labor Minister-said : 'He is not going to agreed waste bloody time again. There is not a vote in that mob.' That is what the Aboriginals means to honourable members opposite. Certainly I am emotional. I have grown up among these people.,81
155,Mr YOUNG,AND COMMUNITIES,You are telling lies.,81
156,Mr KATTER,AND COMMUNITIES,Am I telhng hes? You prove it.,81
157,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND COMMUNITIES,Order! The honourable member for Kennedy will address the Chair. The House will come to order.,81
158,Mr KATTER,AND COMMUNITIES,Now let me say something that is far more personal. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) is an exception to what I am about to say because he was gentleman enough to come across to me and apologise for what a member of his Party said to me. Every time. I have said anything that was reputed to be offensive- I ask our Aboriginal friends here to note this- I have been subject to a sort of racist attitude. When members of the Australian Labor Party wanted to just prick my skin a httle they would call me 'camel driver' or make some such comment. Do you know why they made those comments-becaus e my skin is a little like yours. So I have tolerated racism. Opposition members speak here with their mealy mouths. They have never lived among you; they know nothing about you; and yet they show this hypocritical attitude in relation to this Bill. They are a pack of hypocrites and the quicker it is known the better. I make exceptions; there are new members here who may have no part of that; but I have been subject to it time and again in the House. You and I share this persecution of racism. So remember that.,81
159,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND COMMUNITIES,The honourable member for Kennedy will address the Chair. He should direct his remarks to the amendments.,82
160,Mr KATTER,AND COMMUNITIES,"I issue this chaUenge to the Leader of the Opposition, who was gentleman enough to come across and say: ' I want no part of the comments that were made'. Bill Hayden came across and said that. I challenge him to say when any Government supporter has ever uttered one racist comment about any member of his Party. I challenge him to come forward and deliver the goods. Behind all this is a very fundamental principle-the principle of real concern for the Aboriginal people. One can have that concern only if he understands them and has lived among them. What on earth would the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable members for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) know about Aboriginals? They have never had a thing to do with them. I am sick and tired of their mealy-mouthed hypocrisy. Let us hear from them something that is a bit fair dinkum. That is the only principle I want to forward here tonight- a little bit of fair dinkumAboriginal ness, not a lot of mealy-mouthed hypocrisy. They have no concern for the Aboriginals. They never have and they are never likely to have. The Labor Minister said: 'There are no more votes in it. What the hell are we wasting time for?' Votes-that is all Aboriginals mean to the Labor Party.",82
161,Mr DAWKINS,AND COMMUNITIES," I do not want to join in the true confessions of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) concerning what people have said about me. I do not think we have to talk about the racist expressions of Government supporters; aU we have to judge them by is their actions. Unfortunately find myself totally discouraged which is now before us. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) reaUy ought to be ashamed of himself for coming here with this legislation formed on the basis of statements he has made and statements the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made in relation to undertakings not only to the Aboriginal people of Aurukun and Mornington Island but also to the Aboriginal people of Australia generally. Probably the most disturbing thing which the Minister had to say was that he believed that we ought to take some solace from the fact that in 1973 an acceptable arrangement for the administration of Aboriginal affairs in Western Australia was entered into by the then Federal Government and the State Government. The Minister holds up the legislation as some sort of paragon which the rest of Austraha ought to attempt to emulate. I draw attention quickly to some of the shortcomings of that legislation. If the Minister is saying that the Queensland Government and other State governments ought to follow the procedures adopted by the Western Australian Government, he is inviting them to override the wishes of the local Aboriginal people on Aboriginal reserves. That is exactly what is happening in Western Austraha. As a result of that arrangement, which was entered into in 1973 in very good faith by a Federal Labor government with a State Labor government, the absolute power for changing regulations under that Act resides with the State Government. On the question of the entry into reserves, which is purported to be covered by the legislation before us, the Western Australian situation allows for certain classes of people to be allowed on to reserves. Among others allowed are those people who are prescribed in the regulations. Under those regulations it is possible for the Minister-in this case the State Minister for Combring munity Welfare-to amend regulations of the Affairs Planning Authority Act to aUow for all classes of people to go on to reserves with or without the consent of the local Aboriginal community. That Minister will be well known to the rest of Australia as the honourable member for Kimberley. His attitude on Aborigines is well known. If the honourable member for Kennedy really wants to know a racist all he has to do is look at the State member for Kimberley in the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia. Not only is he a racist by his acts but also he is a racist by his comments which are recorded in court documents. That Minister would like other States to emulate the regulations that exist in his State. That is the sort of I thing which one presumes is contained in this by the legislation legislation. It is true that before amending any regulations the State Government is supposed to consult the Federal Minister, but we have only to look at the Federal Minister's recent responses to questions to know that he is in absolute disarray and confusion in relation to the consultative process. Three weeks ago the Minister told me that he did not expect to be consulted because the matter is purely for the jurisdiction of the State Government. In answer to a question of mine a day or two ago the Minister said that that situation was not now correct. He said that he expected to be consulted by the State Government pursuant to an arrangement entered into under the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority Act. If that is the state of liaison between a Liberal Federal government and a Liberal State governmentneither knows what the other is doing in relation to binding agreements which exist between them-ho w then can we have any confidence at all in the proposals which this Minister now brings before us? In Western Australia the State Government, with or without the Federal Minister's consent, is going to amend the regulations to allow mining companies to enter the Forrest River Reserve for the purposes of exploring for diamonds. This is not done in response to any intransigent attitude by the local Aboriginal community. The local Aboriginal community has said that it is quite happy for a subsidiary of Conzinc Rio-Tinto of Austraha Ltd to enter into that reserve and prospect for diamonds. The local community has been happy to negotiate with CRA. The people have been happy with the assurances that CRA has been able to give them in relation to safeguarding the physical and social environment of that community. They are apprehensive about the proposal that two further mining companies should be allowed to explore on their reserves. One of those further companies, which already has a mining exploration permit, is a subsidiary of the De Beers Corporation of South Africa. It is little wonder that the people of est River are more than a little apprehensive about the prospect ofhaving a subsidiary of that company with its particular track record floating around its reserve and treating the people with total disregard. It is not as though the Aboriginal people are saying that there will be no mining under any circumstances. They are saying that if there is to be any mining on their reserve it will be under conditions and terms which are acceptable to that community. As proof of that there is an agreement which exists between the Forrest River people-the Oombulgurri people-and the CRA Co. in respect of those arrangements. However, that is not good enough for Charles Court. It is not good enough for Alan Ridge. They want to allow anyone who gets an exploration permit to enter into that reserve and do exactly what they like. Just because the Commissioner for Aboriginal Planning in Western Australia has taken the attitude that he, in issuing entry permits to reserves, ought to have regard for the view of the local people, just because the Commissioner does have regard for the local Aboriginal community, the State Government is moving to amend those regulations to over-ride not only the Commissioner for Aboriginal planning but also the local Aboriginal people. I find it more than a httle worrying that the Minister is prepared to say in his second reading speech that the sort of thing that he is interested in developing throughout Australia is the situation which exists in Western Australia. If that is what he is trying to give us in this legislation I think we have a great deal to be worried about. I want quickly to refer to sub-clause (2) of clause 9. Sub-clause (1) of that clause purports to set out certain arrangements which the local communities can enter into in relation to the provision of services. A whole list of services is detailed. Sub-clause (2) goes on to say that subclause (1) should not be construed as preventing other people from providing those services. What sort of a situation are we in if, on the one hand, we give an Aboriginal community the power to provide services for that community and then, on the other hand, turn around and say that this will prevent the Queensland Government or a mining company coming into that reserve and providing those self-same services? What are we really trying to do if at the same time as we say we are providing for selfmanagement for these people and allowing them to provide these services for themselves we say we are not constraining the State Government Forfrom continuing to provide those services? What sort of a position are the local people in if they cannot provide the services unless the Federal Government supplies thefinancewhen the Federal Minister has said in his second reading speech that he hopes that the State Government will continue to provide services in the normal way? He says that the funding for Aboriginal services in Queensland still goes through State departments. He says that there ought to be a system where State governments are not only encouraged to provide services for Aboriginal communities but also are funded to do so. This Bill does not prevent them from providing those services, so what sort of extra freedom and what sort of extra access to self-management do the local communities have as a result of this legislation? The legislation does not even say that the local communities can choose whether they provide services or whether the State Government continues to provide the services. It says that the State Government will not be prevented from continuing to provide the sorts of services which they provide at other Aboriginal reserves. That, surely, is the situation from which the people are trying to escape.",82
162,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,AND COMMUNITIES,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,84
163,Mr JULL,AND COMMUNITIES," I have been listening with interest to the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) and to the statements and accusations he has made, especially about the Western Austrahan situation. The name of Alan Ridge was mentioned. He was accused of being a racist. I was interested to hear that because he was returned to the State Parhament in a re-run just after our Federal election. He bolted home. It seems absolutely incongruous to me that a person hke that who is such a racist and represents an area such as the Kimberleys can get back into Parhament with the majority that he achieved. I think that this whole debate is getting way out of hand and that we have to get back to the substance of the matter. I think the sahent point was expressed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in his second reading speech when he said that the provisions of this legislation are all directed to ensurin ing that if the communities have chosen not to be administered by officials of the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Island Affairs they will not have official management foisted upon them. That is really the crux of the whole matter. I had the privilege last week of travelling with the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) and three honourable senators to Aurukun and Mornington Island to find out what was the situation. Most importantly, after that we went to the pick of the Aboriginal reserves, which allegedly is Cherbourg, and checked out the situation there. I admit that there were conflicts between the opinions of the people of Aurukun and the people of Mornington Island. I really do not think any real comparison can be drawn between those settlements. It was pointed out very clearly to us by the people of Cherbourg that they would be quite willing to stay under State control. The situation at Aurukun and Mornington Island was the complete reverse. We spoke at two pubhc meetings and we spoke to individual groups and people in stores and houses and not one of the people to whom any of thefiveof us spoke, and there must have been several hundred people at both settlements, said that he wanted anything different apart from being administered by the Uniting Church in Australia, as is the case at the moment, in co-operation with the Federal Government. Obviously the situadon in Queensland is a very vexed and complex situation, but at least the legislation that has been introduced into this chamber today has given those people that right. They also will have arightto change their minds. If they do not like the Uniting Church's control and the Federal funding arrangements they have the opportunity under this legislation to change over and go under the control of the Queensland Government, if they must. I think it would be a very wise thing indeed if the people in those communities, whether they are under Commonwealth control or State Government control, were to continue to make a review of the situation and to determine what best suits them. I think the Minister has been very wise in ensuring in this piece of legislation that these people have a right to change their mind. That is one step forward for the Aboriginal people of Queensland in regard to sorting out their own affairs and pursuing a program of self-management. It seems to me to be a very great pity indeed that the people on these settlements have found themselves to be the meat in the sandwich in a political row when all they want to do is go about their own business their own way. This legislation will help them to do exactly that.",84
164,Dr CASS,AND COMMUNITIES," I want to discuss just a couple of points. Thefirstrelates to the Opposition's amendment to clause 9 (2). We agree that all the services that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) has suggested Aborigines should provide for themselves should be arranged by them. We agree with the substance of clause 9(2), but we have been prompted to move the amendment to clause 9 (2) because of the anxieties that the Minister himself has in this matter. Of course the State authorities should help to provide these services. But what will happen if they seek to provide these services in a way in which the Aborigines do not approve and the Minister does not approve? That is simply the reason why the Opposition proposes the inclusion in clause 9 (2) of the words 'with the consent of the Minister'. After all, the Government has been motivated to take the action it is now taking because it has objected to the actions that the Queensland Government has taken. Because of the way in which subclause (2) is framed at the moment the Queensland Government still would be able to take such action. What would the Federal Government do then? The Opposition is not trying to get at the Minister. We are not suggesting that we disapprove of the Queensland Government entering reserves and doing anything at all. Of course the Queensland Government should shoulder its responsibihties. But that is not the point of our amendment. It is simply that the Federal Government as well as, of course, the Aboriginal community should be happy that what is being done is what is required to be done in the fashion in which the Aborigines want it to be done. After all, the whole argument is about whether Aborigines should have the right to decide for themselves, not that they have to do it all themselves. I hope this is seen as a relatively minor amendment. It is not world shattering. It gives the Federal Government the final say if there is doubt about what the Queensland Government is doing. The Opposition's next amendment seeks to omit sub-clause (4) and sub-clause (5) of clause 10 and to substitute two other sub-clauses. As clause 10 stands the Minister can prevent any by-law ever getting anywhere simply by personally disapproving of it. I know that the present Mmister is a reasonable and good Minister and that he is not likely to do that sort of thing. But, just to pick on the Government's prejudices towards the Labor Party, what would be the position if it was in office and it was proposing the giving of this sort of power? Honourable members opposite should be honest with themselves. They would object to it. It is unreasonable to let a Minister acting on his own disallow a by-law. Surely what the Government is trying to say in this legislauon is that if the Minister does not hke a by-law-and he may well not like some by-laws",84
165,Mr VINER,AND COMMUNITIES,"You just wanted me to accept the Opposition's amendment to clause 9(2), but now you do not want me to have the power to consent to by-laws. How inconsistent can you be?",85
166,Dr CASS,AND COMMUNITIES,"Han g on. I am conceding to the Minister the right of approval. The Opposition's amendment to clause 9 (2) does not take anything away from Aborigines. It will allow the Federal Government to be sure that what the Queensland Government is doing is acceptable to the Federal Government and presumably to the Aborigines. We are now talking about by-laws written or produced by the councils themselves. We are simply saying that it is unreasonable that a Minister acting on his own should be able to block them. We are not saying that the Parhament should not be able to block them. We agree with that. Our amendment simply suggests that the by-laws will not be valid unless they are tabled in the Parhament. We have specified a time because, once again, delaying is in effect disallowing by not acting. That is unreasonable, too. Aborigines are entitled to know by virtue of a positive action taken by the Parhament. We are simply saying that once the Minister receives a by-law he should table it. If he disagrees with itthis is provided for already in clause 10 (4)-the Minister may move for its disallowance. As the Government has the numbers obviously that by-law will be disallowed and that would be the end of it. I am asking the Minister to consider the proposition that I put before, that if we were in office and we were putting forward this proposal I do not beheve the honourable members opposite would agree to the proposition that the Minister should have the power on his own to refuse to accept a by-law. By all means if the Minister puts that by-law to the Parliament and the Parliament objects, it is bad luck for the councils, but they cannot have it. The Opposition's amendment to clause 10 proposes to omit sub-clause (9), which reads: A by-law does not apply in relation to a person who is not an Aboriginal or an Islander. Surely the Government is not serious about that. Aboriginal councils put forward all sorts of by-laws to control the behaviour of people on reserves but under this legislation a white man- a non-Aboriginal-ca n just walk onto a reserve and do what he likes. I cannot believe that is the intention of this provision. Surely what the Government is saying is that if Aborigines are to be allowed to control their reserves in their own way anyone who enters those reserves should be expected to abide by the by-laws. It does not matter what is the colour of his skin. I want to deal now with the Opposition's new amendment which has just been circulated. The Opposition proposes the deletion of clause 12 and the substitution of a new clause 12. Clause 12 as it is framed is a long, involved attempt to get around the capacity of the Queensland Government to prohibit people, Aborigines or Islanders, from going onto reserves. That is in essence what clause 12 says. It says that a council can override prohibitions by the Queensland Government by the issue of authorisations. We accept that. The Opposition's new proposed clause 12 (2) reads: No person being an Aboriginal or Islander will be prevented from residing on or visiting a reserve or community except by the decision of the Council and with the consent of the Minister. In essence our proposed new sub-clause says all that the Government is saying in the numerous lines at the bottom of page 7 and the top of page 8 of the Bill. The Opposition's amendment is a simpler statement, The reason for wording it in that way is that the clause as it is framed at the moment does not provide for Aborigines or the Islanders to control non-Aborigines and nonIslanders, hence the Opposition's proposed new clause 12(1), which reads: No person not being an Aboriginal on or visit a reserve or community without the permission of the Council or by the consent of the Minister. The Opposition is not saying that no one should ever be allowed to enter reserves. We are not saying that a council can refuse anyone permission to enter reserves and just leave it at that. Councils may refuse permission but the Minister may think it is a good idea for someoone to enter reserves; so he gives approval. Because of the way in which the clause is framed at the moment the only power the legislation gives to Aborigines is the power to allow onto reserves Aborigines who have been prohibited from entering reserves by the Queensland Government. That acknowledges the power of the Queensland Government legislation. Our amendment overcomes that situation and provides the Aboriginals with the same power the Commonwealth Government has provided in its legislation in fewer words. It seeks to add a power which the legislation has not given to the Aborigines. The Government has not allowed them any right to control non-Aborigines. We suggest that that is unreasonable and that they should be given that power. But, of course, they may have a particular prejudice-o r goodness knows what-agains t a non-Aboriginal and they may want to exclude him or her unreasonably. Our amendment gives the Minister the power to override those unreasonable objections. For those reasons, I hope the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will seriously examine these amendments that I have touched upon. I cannot see that they in any way seriously challenge the essence of what the Government has put up in this legislation. The amendments try to clarify the position. The amendment moved in relation to clause 9 (2) simply seeks to ensure that the Government does not suffer the fate it has already suffered at the hands of the Queensland Government which has prompted this amendment. I am suggesting that the power to make by-laws is reasonable and no Minister on his own should be able to declare them invalid. It should be a function of the Parhament itself. By-laws ought to apply to anyone. Finally, I suggest that the legislation should allow the Aborigines and Islanders the right to admit Aborigines and Islanders and the right to admit or exclude nonAborigines or Islanders.",85
167,Mr RUDDOCK,AND COMMUNITIES," I congratulate the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) for being very thoughtful although not in every respect persuasive or accuor Islander shall reside rate in the amendments that he has put forward. He has given a lesson tonight to one of the newer members of his side of the chamber because he has sparked our interest- a very healthy interest-in the amendments that have been moved. It is a lesson that I think ought to be well taken. The clauses that have been mentioned and those I will refer to include clause 9. The Opposition has sought to amend subclause (2) to provide that the Minister-that is, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs-wil l have to consent before any other body, authority or person other than a council provides any services relating to matters specified earher in that provision. That includes housing, health, education and so on. One of the bodies that one might expect the Minister would have to consent to being involved in providing its services would be the Queensland Department of Education and, similarly, the Queensland health authorities. What is being suggested is that before the Queensland authorities which have proper functions to fulfil are able to provide those services they are expected to provide for Queenslanders, including Aboriginals, the consent of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will be required. I cannot imagine any amendment or provision that would be more provocative than that in terms of the relationship between a State and the Commonwealth. Further amendments have been moved to clause 12. I should hke to state briefly that the proposed new clause 12A already is covered in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 and that provision would not be necessary. The amendments to clause 12, as I understand it, seek power that is already vested in councils under the Queensland Act.",86

(2) If so, and as the matter has been the subject of study by his Department since September 1977, expect to be in a position to announce a decision. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes.

Half will be provided Tasmania as an additional payment to the International Development Association (IDA) and is untied. The other half will be provided bilaterally to countries eligible as IDA recipients and which are experiencing the problems to which the Special 523 Action Program is directed. In 1978-79 these will be Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Tonga and Western Samoa. Northern Territory The bUateral contribution will take the form of Development 447 Import Grants which the recipient governments may use for the purchase of Australian goods and services serving developmental purposes. Aid given in this form is demon608 strably additional to existing aid expenditure and can be disbursed speedily, these being tworequirementsof the Special Action Program. Development Import Grants do not Numberof introduce new principles with respect to tying. Such comcertificates modity aid has been given in the past and it was tied to Ausconferred tralian goods.

(2) If so, what are the reasons for use of civilian aircraft rather than Service aircraft. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable in a report member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Certain training requires use of slow speed towed targets and the Navy has no suitable aircraft in its inventory for this task. Civilian aircraft are hired because it is uneconomical and unsuitable to use highly sophisticated Service aircraft. At present the amount of flying involved in this type of training does not justify the purchase of a dedicated target towing aircraft for the Navy.

Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 28 February 1978: What investigations are being conducted order to prevent explosions in grain silos similar to those which occurred in the United States of America recently.",94
177,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: A large proportion of the grain produced in Australia for marketing is delivered to the bulk grain handling authority in the producing State, e.g. the Grain Elevators New South Wales. Each of the authorities is a Ucensed receiver for the Australian Wheat Board and most receive other grains on behalf of State grain marketing bodies. Each operates under State legislation and has a great deal of autonomy in its operations. In some aspects of their work the authorities consult closely and I am advised that Australian grain sUos has been discussed on a number of occasions, the most recent being a conference of senior executive officers of the bulk grain the week commencing 13 March. As I have previously stated, Australia has a very good record of safety in this matter of grain dust explosions, there having been only one known case in a grain storage facUity since bulk handling of grain began almost 60 years ago. That explosion was not attributable to a grain handling operation and fortunately was of a relatively minor nature manent serious personal injury resulting. I am advised that in recent years each of the authorities has appointed safety officers whose duties involve concenence tration on eUmination of accidents, including plosions. Safety committees have been set up at larger installations and employee participation in these committees has helped to increase safety consciousness and eliminate sources of possible danger. Senior officers of each authority have been co-operating the preparation of an operations safety manual which is designed as a guide for operators at ports and country silos. It covers a range of safety factors including dangers of dust in the operation of sUos. It is soon to be issued to bulk handling authorities' staff throughout (Question No. 223) Australia. The various authorities have shown a continuing awareness of the need to practise good housekeeping at all times and to effect improvements where these are reasonably possible whether by way of changed operational practices or such things as better dust extraction facUities and sUo design. There is a general prohibition on potentially dangerous activities such as welding or metal cutting but if there is an unavoidable need for such things to be done, they are carried out under the most stringent safety conditions. be carAttempted comparisons with conditions in the United States may tend to obscure some issues but it is worth noting dust from corn which is produced in vast quantities in the United States isregardedas having a greater potential from explosion than the dust from wheat and barley. Furthermore, in Australia dust extracted from grain is removed from the silos and disposed of in one way or another. It is not to the grain stream as is the practice in some parts of balanced combat force the United States. terrain and the climate environIt is clear that the good record of safety in Australian grain handling facUities has been achieved through continuing obplan to use the area for simiservance of good practices with careful attention to hygiene and other safety aspects in all operational and maintenance Grain Handling activities. (Question No. 226) Leprosy (Question No. 228) Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister for Health, in Australia in upon notice, on 28 February 1978: (1) How many cases of leprosy have been reported in Australia in each of the last three years.

Because of indications that provided for was being exceeded, it was necessary to issue instructions which have resulted in curtailment of planned activities in certain units to ensure that other units would be able to maintain a satisfactory number of training days. Overall, no units' activities should be restricted below the essential approved levels. Army Reserve Training Mr Scholes asked the Minister for upon notice, on 1 March 1978: (1) Have members of the Australian Army Reserve Water Transport Unit in Western Australia been told funds have run out to pay the Unit's costs for the remainder of 1977-78.

(Question No. 283) Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable Defence, member's question is as follows: The Leopard tank contract with Krauss Maffei requires the firm to offer work in the form of Leopard tank coproduction or alternatively offsetting orders of defence or technological significance to Australia. The overall target, namely 30 per cent of the contract price is to be achieved within 7 years of contract signature. The Australian items must be competitive in price, quality and deUvery. The contractor has pursued his obligauons satisfactorily recognising the timescale involved. Fifteen Leopard tank work packages were offered shortly after contract signature, but it was found that local industry was unable to compete with established German production in these areas. Krauss Maffei subsequently contacted a large number of Australian companies but the majority of these contacts were also unsuccessful. Offset purchases have been suggested but main these are of unsuitable types and do not satisfy the contract requirements. An engineer from the firm very recently paid two visits to to offer new work packages and locate Australian items of technological significance suitable for offset purSeveral promising possibilities have emerged and Australian industry is now quoting for the supply of a of the Water number of items to German firms. There has been a learning process associated with this first major Defence purchase from Germany involving offsets but there is no reason at this stage to assume that the offset target will not be met within the ume allowed by the contract. ume contributing to the supEmployees of Trans-Australia Airlines: Membership of Unions (Question No. 293) and sufficient will continue to Mr E.

Whether or not one or more types of aircraft are ultimately acquired will depend on whether effective multirole aircraft can be chosen. That is a matter for later consideration. Whatever type or types are the aircraft can be expected to remain in service into the next century. They must therefore be of such a quality that would permitfighterskills to be acquired and maintained which will remain relevant.

(2) Has he corresponded with the A.M.A. on this matter; if so, has he received any indication as to when the Association intends establishing 'peer review'.",113
193,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In May 1976, the Commonwealth Government asked the Australian Medical Association to institute a system of peer review of professional standards. A Commonwealth grant has assisted the A.M.A. to examine the feasibility of various approaches to peer review of professional standards by initiating a study tour and sponsoring a general seminar. Recendy I approved a further grant to support the publication of an informadon brochure for distribution to all medical practitioners. A system of professional standards review is an essential feature of any attempt to contain vices and improve their quality. The establishment of an effective system is an important objective of the Government's health policy. I have asked that the A.M.A. to date by 30 June 1978. Discussions on proposals during the time left to the A.M.A. will also be held with its representadves. Until the report and the results of dislegislation; cussions are available a firm timetable, of a system of peer review A.M.A., will not be available. Natural Disaster Insurance Mr Hodges asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 14 March, 1978: (1) Has the Minister's attendon been drawn to the Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme for Australia discussion paper and particularly to paragraph 22 of the paper which states that the potential risks of earthquake in Australia are significant. (2) Has the Department of Science or associated agencies made any investigations into the possibility of earthquakes in Australia; if so, what are the findings of these investigations. (3) Is he able to say whether there have been any claims on insurance compames for earthquake damage during the last 10 years. Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, the Minister for Science has seen the Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme for Australia discussion paper including the paragraph referred to in the honourable member's question. The Minister has been advised that the paragraph is a little misleading since, although there are regions in Australia where the potential for earthquake damage is significant, theriskis small compared to that in more earthquake-prone countries. (2) The Department of Science has recently taken over from the Department of Defence as the Australian Government 's co-operating agency for the joint management of the Alice Springs seismological station. The take-over follows the stauon's declassification as a defence establishment and comes under the terms of an international agreement with the United States of America. However, the Bureau of Mineral Resources, which comes within the portfoUo of the Minister for National Development, is the national data centre for earthquake and strong-earth-motion data. Computerised systems store all data relating to the Australian region obtained by all agencies in Australia, Papua New Guinea and by the World Data Centres. These data files have been the basis of such investigations as the one on Australian earthquake risk which was completed late in 1973 and is being used by the National Committee on Earthquake Engineering to formulate buUding design factors. Further detaUed information on the activities of BMR as they relate to Australian earthquake occurrences may be obtained from my colleague the Mmister for National Development. (3) As far as the Minister for Science is aware, there have been many claims on insurance companies for earthquake damage during the last ten years; for example, claims approximated $2m following the 1968 magnitude 6.9 earthquake at Meckering in Western Australia. However, more detaUs may be obtained from the Insurance Council of Australia which has its office in Melbourne. the cost of health care serOverseas Cargo Shipping Legislation (Question No. 636) provide a report on progress Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, for work upon notice, on 14 March 1978: Has he received the report of the review of overseas cargo if so, when does he expect to table the report in for the establishment Parliament. of professional standards by the Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I tabled the report on the review of overseas cargo ship(Question No. 633) ping legislation in Parliament on 2 November 1977. National Trachoma and Eye Health Program (Question No. 646) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Has the long delay in resumption of the Queensland trachoma survey and eye health program been due to the reluctance of Professor Hollows to accept alternatives suggested by Queensland authorities for staff recommended by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. (2) Does he propose to continue to defer to Queensland in matters of Aboriginal health where demonstrably higher efficiency is evident to the health operatives concerned by accepting the staff appointed on the advice of Commonwealth authorities, and where no medical, ethical or legal evidence has justified Queensland intervention.",114
194,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. I refer the honourable member to my answer to question No. 143 (Hansard, p.498, 7 March 1978) for the current position. (2) Primary responsibUity for the provision of health services in Queensland rests with the Sate authorities. However, the Commonwealth provides financial assistance to the States and other organisations for special health services for Aboriginals. The National Trachoma and Eye Health Program is conducted by the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists and is funded by the Commonwealth Government.

However, deferral of repayments by the Letona cannery was not necessary and payment of the instalments loan have been made by that cannery. In February 1978 the Commonwealth agreed to extend for a further twelve months the repayment the Victorian and South Austrahan canneries.

204,Mr HUNT,COMMUNITY YOUTH SUPPORT SCHEME APPROVED PROGRAMS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I assume the honourable member is referring to the Hospitals and Health Services Commission's Report 'Review of the Community Health Program' which was tabled in Parliament on 2 June 1976. Since then the Government has implemented two major pohcy decisions that have a major effect on the Government's abUity to action many of the report's recommendations. These pohcy initiatives relate to the Government's need to effect restraint in Commonwealth Government expenditure and to the major devolution of responsibilities for the provision and supervision of health services to the States, within the framework of the federal system. The Commission's report contained a number of widerangingrecommendationsand proposals, not specifically directed to the Commonwealth Government, but involving also State governments and the professional associations. Within the federal framework initiatives for implementation of the majority of the recommendations rest primarily with the State governments, having regard to their particular priorities and within the limits of avaUable funds. The Commonwealth government is continuing to work towards improving communication and co-operation between all those involved in health care and in this regard has on-going consultations with State governments and professional associations. It is in the above context, that I provide the following answers to the specinc points raised by the honourable member (a) Thisrecommendationis concerned with ensuring that health care is provided on an integrated multi-disciplinary basis, which is best demonstrated by current developments towards health care teams. The complexities involved, however, would appear to firstrequirethe development of informal pracuces and role definitions which, when successfully demonstrated, could then be recognised on a formal basis in the context of professional organisations and accreditation procedures. This concept must therefore be developed gradually and is best facilitated by encouragement by health authorities at the workforce. (b) The Community Health Program already makes significant provision for in-service training courses, inars and workshops in all States to better equip community health workers to adapt to the demands of community-based health service delivery. At the State level these activities are continuing within the priorities and avaUabUity of funds as determined by the respective States. Vocational training for general medical practice, the cornerstone of personalised health care delivery community, is provided throughout Australia by the Family Medicine Program which operates and is funded as a national project. (c) Much is already being done under the Community Health Program to foster inter-disciplinary training. Students in various health disciplines throughout Australia actively participate in multi-disciplinary community health projects co-ordinated by 'Students Initiatives m Community Health' a project sponsored by the Australian Medical Students'Association and funded by the Commonwealth. At the University of Adelaide, the development of inter-disciplinary training for medicine, social work, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, with a view to providing multi-disciplinary basic training in community health practice, has been funded under the Program. (d) Exploration and implementation of the concept of 'multi-purpose' health aides is primarily a matter for the State governments. To reUeve demand for services of professional staff, South Australia has initiated training programs for paramedical aides and Western Australia has introduced social trainers to assist parents of retarded chUdren to cope with and to train chUdren in elementary social activities. (e) This recommendationrequiredno special Commonwealth assistance but requires inter-professional consultation and greater multi-disciplinary practice. The main thrust for initiatives in these matters mustrestwith the States because of their particular responsibilities for the actual organisation and provision of health services. (f) Thisrecommendationis being implemented with varying emphases in the States. Much has been achieved already under the Community Health Program with many community health projects, particularly in Victoria, involving community groups in the form of management or advisory committees. Many community health projects have developed into community activity focal points extending beyond the primary function of providing health services. The Commonwealth has encouraged the States to submit proposals from voluntary/community groups for funding under the Community Health Program and is continuing to fund a number of voluntary agencies on a national basis. With the joint support of both employers and unions at the top policy level, an Alcoholism in Industry Program, co-ordinated by the Australian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence has been funded under the Program and is an excellent example of the Government s response to community group initiatives in identifying and meeting a particular need. (g) This is primarily a matter for State governments within the limits of State priorities and availability of funds. The Commonwealth, during its bi-annual discussions with the States in the Standing Committee Meetings on Health Expenditures, at which State Community Health Programs are endorsed, encourages the States to be responsive to initiatives of non-government agencies in sponsoring community health projects. (h) The Government's federalism policies put the States in a better financial position to accept a greater share of semthe costs of providing community health services than was the case formerly. Thus, with the major devolution of administrative and financial responsibilities to the States, the Commonwealth, in 1977-78, reduced its proportional share of community health service costs from 75 per cent of capital and 90 per cent of operating costs to 50 per cent and 75 per cent respectively. Notwithstanding these in the reductions in the Commonwealth's proportion of costs, the Commonwealth in 1977-78 has provided $79.05m for the Community Health Program, an increase of $ 10.2m or 14.8 per cent over the Commonwealth expenditure in the previous financial year. With the additional State contributions the increased level of expenditure on community health services is considerable. The Commonwealth continues to fund national projects at 100 per cent, the amount allocated for that purpose in 1977-78 being $5.75m. Concerning the provision of legislation as a formal basis for the Community Health Program, I assured State Health Ministers at a special meeting in September 1977, that the Government would give serious consideration to the provision of appropriate legislation. I am hopeful that a decision on this matter will be announced shortly. (i) and (j) All Community Health Program projects are expected to have some form of in-built evaluation mechanism. In fact, one of the conditions of grants is that the management of Commonwealth funded projects be prepared to co-operate with the Commonwealth in evaluating projects when so requested and to keep such statistical records as may be necessary for that purpose. Some evalumonwealth ation and cost benefit studies have been carried out and others are continuing as a joint Commonwealth-State exercise. In addition, the Government has provided $500,000-as Health Program Grants for health service development projects-to: encourage the development and testing of new cost-effective forms of health care delivery; foster the monitoring mechanisms concerned with suring the best value for expenditure on health; or introduce new methods of meedng health costs with incenimproved tives towards efficiency. (k) The funding of paramedical and home nursing services has been accommodated within the Community Health Program wherever it has been possible to incorporate these services within an integrated and comprehensive service. A review of the present Home Nursing Subsidy Scheme is proceeding. The question of funding services operating before 1 July 1973 has been deferred because of the need to exercise economic restraint. (1) Family planning services in one form or another are already being provided from most general community health centres, and family planning training for community health workers is an integral part of in-service training in such cases. Apart from the Commonwealth's contribution under the Community Health Program a subties, stantial contribution is also made by the Commonwealth and States to voluntary organisations operating in this field. (m) The concept expressed in this recommendation is well recognised by both Commonwealth and State health authorities. A substantial number of projects funded under the Community Health Program are, in fact, closely associated with or based at areas, and are providing balanced links between hospitals and community health services. This trend is being encouraged at joint Commonwealth-Stat e consultations on policy matters and annual program formulation. (n) Increasing support has been given in recent times under the Commumty Health Program for women's refuges (59 funded in 1977-7S), detoxification units and other health hostel/halfway house projects offering shortdate term rehabilitative and/or support services. The Comproved monwealth is prepared to consider applications from the Werriwafor States for inclusion of projects under the Community Health Program aimed at providing assistance towards the cost of health related emphasis has been placed on developments cauon and promotion in recent times. In conjunction with St John Ambulance Association and the Health Comarranged mission of New South Wales, the Commonwealth is rently funding a pilot project designed to provide health education and first-aid knowledge for persons living in isolated communities with a view to increasing their self reliance and generally promoting better health. The Commonwealth is also currently sponsoring a series of small search seminars on preventive health and health promotion in each State. A Study Group in Health Education, Client/Project to identify health educations ticular emphasis on school health education, is one of a number of groups established by the Curriculum ment Centre. The National Health and Medical Research Council has also established a Standing Sub-Committee on Health Education. (o) The current eligibility criteria of the Community Health Program are sufficiently wide to encompass many of the proposals contained in the Hospitals and Health Services Commission's Report 'Health Transport Pohcies for Australia' (tabled on 19 October 1976), but implementation depends on State priorities and available funds. Under the Community Health Program, the Comis providing financial support for a number of community-based health facilities which, as an integral part of their services, provide some transport for patients. The Government is not prepared at this stage to provide direct support for ambulance services. (p) One of the basic objectives of the Family Medicine enProgram, a major national project funded under the Community Health Program, is the encouragement of general practitioner services in rural areas. On 18 August 19771 announced the introduction of incentive allowances for medical graduates who choose to train as general practitioners in areas of Australia where doctors are scarce. The FamUy Medicine Program also invites general practitioners to attend training sessions for its trainees, often in country areas, as a means of providing general practitioners with opportunities to obtain refresher knowledge. In Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, Commonwealthfinancialsupport is given to projects enabling medical students to gain experience by attachment to rural general practices. Other Commonwealth-funded initiatives aimed at alleviating health problems of isolated communities included the provision of a network of community nursing posts covering many isolated low-population communithe estabUshment of small community health centres in country towns, and the provision of mobile community health and specialist services visiting isolated areas. On 5 December 1977,1 announced the Government's intention to assist people living in isolated areas and who have to travel considerable distances for specialist health care. I am hopeful that legislation to authorise this assistance will be presented to Parliament shortly. hospitals, parucularly in rural Commonwealth Public Works in Werriwa Electoral Division (Question No. 347) Mr E.

These representations were reinforced by Mr Garland during his recent visit to Canada. (2) If the Canadian Tariff Board's recommendations were maintained in its final report and were accepted by the Canadian Government, Australian canned fruits entering Canada would face substantial increases in the levels of import duties as well as loss of tariff preferences. There is little doubt that such tariff changes would place serious difficulties in the way of Australian canned fruit exports to Canada.

(4) This is possible, but such a view would probably overlook the lead time involved site. Coastal Erosion: Effects of High Rise Mr Hodges asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science, upon notice: (1) Has the Department of Science made any studies the effects of high rise development on coastal erosion; wiU the Minister give detaUs of this research. (2) Has this material been made available to State advertising Governments. Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has June provided the following answer member's question: (1) The Department of Science has not undertaken any relevant studies. However, CSIRO to assess the fragility of coastal dune systems in various loca1975-76 1976-77 tions, though not in the specific context of high-rise development. percent percent The processes of coastal erosion have been observed for 64 100 centuries. The stabUity of coastal systems varies from place 36.4 62.6 to place. On a strong rocky coast, the effects of development will be minimal. On a sandy coast, stability depends on the dynamic equilibrium between the surf zone, the beach and the frontal dune. The dune is a buffer that is eroded in times of marine attack and then builds up again naturally. As has been apparent on the Gold Coast, development of the dune area inevitably leads to serious and costly problems. In fact, any action that brings a large number of people to the foredunes without adequate controls will seriously damage the dune system. A caravan park, a parking area, or simply (Question No. 559) uncontrolled access by many people can be as damaging as buUding development. (2) CSIRO has worked closely with, and provided advice to, State and local government authorities on coastal development and dune management in many areas around Australia. Examples are: (a) the involvement of a CSIRO officer in giving advice to Queensland authorities following severe erosion problems at Surfers Paradise some years ago; been proposed for the enlarged (b) the soil and topographical studies carried out by the Division of Land Resources Management at the request of and in conjunction with State authorities, along Perth's north-west corridor and the coastal strip between Mandurah and Bunbury.

The findings were put to immediate use by State and local authorities; (c) the Division of Applied Geomechanics' studies on erosion, as a basis for coastal engineering and mangement. The Division has helped State and local authorities to tackle a wide range of problems.
