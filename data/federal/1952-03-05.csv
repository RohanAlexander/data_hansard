1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Archie Cameron) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. SOUTH AWD SOUTH-EAST ASIA.",9
2,Dr EVATT,Unknown,".Will the Minister for External Affairs inform me of the purpose of the visit abroad of the secretary of the Department of External Affairs and, at the same time, tell the House the position with regard to the forthcoming, committee meeting arising out. of the Colombo conference? Mr .CASEY - Wit h the approval of the Prime Minister I have asked the permanent head of the Department of External Affairs, Mr Watt, to spend some time, as yet indeterminate, in South East Asia. The visit is a reflection of my personal anxiety and, I think, of the anxiety of the Government, about the situation in South-East Asia as a result of the internal Communist problem in each of the countries of that area, and particularly' about the potential Communist menace to the area from outside. The centre of Mr Watt's activities will be Singapore where he will spend a third of' his time. The rest of his time will be spent in travelling to each of the countries of South-East Asia.. I hope to meet him in Singapore, in a month's time while I am on my way back from the - meeting of the consultative council of the Colombo plan in Karachi. By that time Mr Watt will have spent one month in South-East Asia. I shall decide after consulting with him whether he is to remain there longer and what we shall require to do to strengthen Australia's representation in the area generally. The meeting in Karachi is the annual meeting, on a ministerial level, of the consultative council of the Colombo plan, and will be held from the 24th March to the lst April. I shall represent the Australian Government at that conference. COTTON.",9
3,Mr DEAN,Unknown,"I direct to the Minister for External Affairs, who is in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Besearch Organization, a question that relates to cotton growing in Australia and to the fact that the next cotton planting season is not far off. I believe that increased production of Australian cotton is vital not only in areas at present under cultivation bnt also in other areas. We are paying, I believe, a large subsidy on onr own crop and the tonnage imported is costing us dollars. .There are growing industrial facilities in New South Wales to handle cotton. I ask,- therefore: Has the experimental work carried out by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization atGriffith, Katherine and che Ord River given definite confirmation as to suitable areas ? Has consideration been given to the highlands of the central north-west slopes of New South ""Wales, which by environment should be suitable for cotton growing? Will the right honourable gentleman forward to me any late information that would be of advantage to those interested in growing cotton ?",9
4,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman is correct in believing that experimental work has been going on for, I think, four or five years at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's experimental stations at Katherine and the Ord River. I am not aware, although I may be uninformed on the point, that the organization is doing any experimental work at Griffith in tion to cotton production. The organization is not engaged in experimental work on the central or north-western slopes of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales. Most of its experimental work is being done in Queensland in which State the Department of Agriculture and Stock has been very active over the years in the same sphere. The results of the department's work are circulated through a body of whose name and address I sball advise the honourable member later when I shall also be glad to ascertain whether papers, publications or contacts that he may require may be made available to him. HOUSING.",10
5,Mr DAVIES,Unknown,"I address a question to the Minister for Works and Housing; it relates to the construction of prefabricated houses by Melbourne firms in New South Wales. Why are not firms in New South Wales that are prepared to tender for this work given an opportunity to do so? Is it a fact that Melbourne firms are doing a considerable volume of work in the construction of prefabricated houses in New South Wales under contracts let by the Australian Government? Is it also a fact that tenders for such work are not called through the New South Wales Building Trades Journal and, consequently, builders in that State are severely handicapped whilst Victorian firms are given an advantage over them? Will the Minister take steps to ensure .that New South Wales builders, who could probably do the work cheaper us their plants are more handily situated, shall be given equal opportunity with Victorian firms in tendering for these jobs?",10
6,Mr KENT HUGHES,Unknown,"I think that the houses to which the honourable member has referred are a certain number which were bought from the Victorian Railways .Department. They arc of a special type and were imported from Great Britain. They are really not prefabricated houses but pre-cut houses, ard the Department of National Development required that they be erected in the particular district as quickly as possible. Jn those circumstances, the Department of rela- Works and Housing, so far as I know, included the work in a contract that already existed with the Victorian Railways. It was my task to arrange for the importation and the original erection of these houses. It was found that when contracts for their erection were let to a number of different contractors delay was caused by reason of the fact that each .contractor bad to learn the mechanics involved in erecting them-eac h house might he described as a tiinber meccano 6et-and that loss of time increased the cost of erecting them. Finally, the Victorian Railways assembled a team to undertake the erection of the houses. I think that one of the larger contractors in Victoria did all the work. Furthermore, the parts of these houses are stored at what might bc termed the Victorian Railways ordnance store and the parts and building quantities are drawn as required from that store. As a special number of these houses were to be built in the area to which the honourable member has referred, it was docided that it would be far cheaper and that the work could be done more quickly by extending the contract with the Victorian Railways to include the work rather than to call for open tenders for it. NATIONAL SERVICE.",10
7,Mr DAVIS,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service whetherit is correct, as I nave been informed, that members of the Citizen Military Forces are being called up under the national service training scheme and whether call-up notices are being issued tc men in the 20 to 23 years age group? If this be correct, is such action in accordance with the policy of his department ? M'.r. HOLT - It is quite possible that members of the Citizen Military Forces would be or could be called up for servioe under the national service training scheme. The obligation to serve under that scheme applies to young men who reach the age of eighteen years after the 1st November, 1950, and quite possibly, some members of the Citizen Military Forces are in that situation. The fact that they are members of the Citizen Military Forces does not relieve them of their inability to serve under the national service training scheme. It would not be correct to say that men in the 20 to 23 years age group would be called up. As I have stated, the obligation applies to those in the other age group to which I have referred. I should be astonished to learn that through some error call-up notices had been sent to older men, but I sball be glad to have any specific instances brought to my notice. SUBSIDIES.",10
8,Mr MINOGUE,Unknown,"I address the folcivilized lowing questions to the Prime Minister: Is it not a fact that for years the tralian consumers, including age pentake sioners, subsidized primary production, particularly butter, wheat, sugar end industries. dried fruits, by paying a home consumption price far higher than the world price for those products, and much higher than the price at which such food could been imported ? Is it not also a fact that millions of pounds have been provided for non-paying transport and postal facilities in country districts, and in freight concessions, bounties, subsidies other handouts? Can the Prime Minisyear ter say what is the estimated annual value of these concessions, and will he u guarantee that the contribution made, particularly by pensioners and people on adjustment is due? low incomes, to subsidize primary producers will be taken into account when he is considering the demands of primary producers for world prices for their products, now that world parity is higher than the Australian price? By way of explanation",11
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable gentleman's question is far too long already.,11
10,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The honourable member for West Sydney invites me to put in hand a very lengthy calculation extending over many years, and I have no doubt that such an inquiry would be extremely costly. Perhaps I may summarize the answer to his question by saying tlmt it is undeniable that over a certain period the consumer in Australia subsidized to a degree certain export industries, of which wheat is an example. For a number of years, the home consumption price charged for wheat was in excess of export parity. That, as the honourable meinber will realise, has not been the case for a considerable period, and if one were to isolate the wheat industry, it vvould be easy to show that the subsidy, in effect, which was paid for some years in respect of wheat by the local consumer is far more than off-set by the concession made by the wheat-grower to the local consumer. I never feel a strong inclination to start a heated argument about such matters. They merely illustrate the fact that in a well-balanced and community primary industries and secondary industries must act in aid Ausof each other, and that consumers must benefits and burdens from time to time in the interests of the productive DAIRYING .",11
11,Mr BROWN,Unknown,"Can the Minister for have Commerce and Agriculture give to the House any information on the suggestion that the control of butter prices be handed over to the Commonwealth? Will he consider the possibility of making the and cost-of-production adjustments twice a instead of annually, as is now the case? Will he ensure that the Joint give Dairying Industry Advisory Committee shall have thefiguresready well before the",11
12,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"The Commonwealth has said that, as a matter of policy, it wishes'to subsidize the dairying industry. Any plan that has been proposed for the purpose of stabilizing that industry is related to some guarantee by the Commonwealth of ci return to dairy farmers. We had the experience of an intolerable situation in which the Australian Government was liable under a guarantee, but the State governments were completely free to fix whatever selling price they eared to fix. In that situation, the tralian Government had no control of its liabilities. This Government has now announced that, as an essential preliminary to the conclusion of another guarantee arrangement, the States must transfer to it control of the prices of butter and cheese ex factories.  two and a half years to wake up.",11
13,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,The Labour Government never woke up.,12
14,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The Minister should ignore the interjection.,12
15,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I shall do so, Mr. Speaker. The Joint Dairying Industry Advisory Committee may or may not be the cost finding authority, but I assure the honourable member that, whatever authority is appointed, the cost will be calculated and revealed in plenty of time to provide for a price adjustment from the lst July as is customary. The question whether adjustments should be made twice yearly is a matter of Government policy which will be considered in conjunction with a general stabilization scheme. WHEAT.",12
16,Mr CLAREY,Unknown,Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform me whether the Australian Wheat Board intends to assist wheat-growers by erecting bulk storage heads in wheat-growing centres where silos are not now available,12
17,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I think that I can safely say that the Australian Wheat Board does not intend to do so. The board handles funds that are the proceeds of wheat sold on behalf of growers. Those funds belong to the growers, and I believe that I am correct in saying that the investment of growers' capital in that way would be untenable in law, as well as unjustifiable in equity. However, the States have bulk handling authorities, and bulkheads have been built at various places in Victoria by the Grain Elevators Board and in New South Wales by an equivalent authority.",12
18,Mr DRUMMOND,Unknown,"The Tamworth: district of New South Wales is the chief poultry-farming district outside the metropolitan area of that State. Has the Aus- attention of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture been directed to the very serious shortage of poultry foods due t a the fact that the mill at Tamworth is running only one shift because of the shortage of wheat? Will the Ministertake steps, if necessary in conjunction, with the Australian Wheat Board, to ensure that this critical position shall be relieved as quickly as possible?",12
19,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I have no knowledge of the position at Tamworth in particular, but I do know that there is such a shortage of locally grown wheat in New South Wales that that State is said to require the importation of 8,000,000' bushels of wheat in order to maintain something substantially less than a normal milling run. Without that there will be a serious shortage of mill offals for poultry and other industries. The Australian Wheat Board is concerning itself with this position and I shall be glad to take the matter up with it. Frankly, plansmight have heen made to meet this position if the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture had disclosed to the Australian Government that there was an impending shortage of wheat in New South Wales when the problem was being discussed in relation to other States im November last. TAXATION.",12
20,Mr BERNARD CORSER,Unknown,I wish to ask the Prime Minister a question in ? relation to the provision of tax relief for primary producers who have suffered from the effects of bush fires and drought. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation at Brisbane has informed me that his representatives will visit the Wide Bay electorate and other areas in Queensland in order to make inquiries concerning thelosses sustained by primary producers as a result of bush fires. These visits are te be made in accordance with a decision that was announced in this House by the Prime Minister. The object is to grant deferment of certain provisional tax payments for the benefit of bush fire victims. Will the right honourable gentleman have these inquiries extended with the object of providing relief also for producers who have suffered tragic losses as. a result of devastating droughts? Many of them have invested a large proportion of their assets in stock feed but now have no use for the feed because of the destruction of stock. I ask the right honourable gentleman to grant relief on eqtial terms to sufferers from bush fires and droughts.,12
21,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"The announcement that I made on this matter as Acting Treasurer in the absence of the Treasurer related to fires. The action that was taken was prompted by the fact that bush fires had caused an extremely sudden and devastating calamity. Officers of the Taxation Branch of the Department of the Treasury and of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture have, as the honourable member has said, announced that they will visit various places, and they will deal with applicants on the spot. They have ample authority. To expand that to other cases might be to cause very great delay in dealing with the cases that we were aiming to deal with, and I do not want to have any delay that is avoidable in these matters. However, I may tell the honourable member that the position of drought areas is related to distinct problems under consideration at present by the Treasury. FOOD PRODUCTION.",13
22,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"My qtiestion is directed to the Minister for Commerce culture. Is it a fact that the honourable member for Macarthur is the chairman of Avhat has been called a small committee of Government supporters which has been formed to study the problem of increasrecords ing food production in Australia? Is it also a fact that this small committee consists of at least 31 senators and sentatives? If these are facts, is unofficial committee functioning under government patronage, and is it being vided by the Government with transport to visit steel works and other industrial matic way. enterprises? Will the Minister say how many meetings of the committee have been held and when he expects to be in a position to present the report of the committee to the Government? Are any fees or expenses paid to members of this committee? Are government cars used in connection with their transport?",13
23,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Macarthur is the secretary of a committee of very experienced members of both the Government parties who are good enough, out of a sense of puhlic duty, to spend their time, for no fee or reward, in acquainting themselves with the problems of primary industry in this country, and advising the Government upon them. They may or may not use government cars. If I were asked to supply them with a government car I should be very glad' to do so. I think that the total number on the committee may be about 30. From memory, that is about one-third of the number of private members which the last Lahour Government sent round the world for purposes which none of us can remember. However, I think that the honourable member for Grayndler, who is the Opposition Whip, could give some information about that matter.",13
24,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! No debatable matter may be introduced at question time. KOREA.,13
25,Mr DRURY,Unknown,"Has the Minister for External Affairs received confirmation of a report that American paratroopers in North Korea captured some Russian soldiers who were manning an anti-aircraft battery, and subsequently took them for interrogation to the United States and Agrimilitary head-quarters ?",13
26,Mr CASEY,Unknown,"The honourable member was good enough to inform me before the sitting commenced that he intended to ask this question. I have bad the recent of the Department of External Affairs perused, but no reference to sucb a matter can be found in telegrams or repredespatches. That does not mean that this the events described by the honourable member have not taken place because it is pronot necessarilya matter that would be communicated to us in the ordinary diploTELEPHONE SEEVICES.",13
27,Mr FAIEBAIEN,Unknown,"Eeferene e has been made to the fact that during the recent bush fires many rural automatic telephone exchanges were forced out of action because of breakdowns in power supplies. ""Will the Postmaster-General state whether it is possible for those exchanges to be operated temporarily by the use of batteries or. by some other means, as they often provide means of communication of the most essential type that has to be maintained?",14
28,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,I am not acquainted with the technical means which automatic telephone exchanges might be operated alternatively. I shall have inquiries made and shall pass thf information on to the honourable member. NA SERVICES.,14
29,Mr BEYSON,HEALTHAND MEDICA L,"Has the Minister for Health made provision yet for persons over 65 years of age to take advantage of the additional hospital benefits which nre provided by the Government under contributory scheme? Has the Minister made provision also for the payment that benefit to patients in publie hosNo pitals? If he has done so, does that the re-introduction of the means test for all patients who are admitted to public hospitals? Further, will the Minister of it. have a statement prepared for the information of honourable members setting out in detail the whole of the benefits that provided under his hospital benefits scheme?",14
30,Sir EARLE PAGE,HEALTHAND MEDICA L,"I shall answer the last question first. I shall endeavour to have a statement made available to all honourable members who desire it. So far as public hospitals are concerned, five the six States have decided approval of the private and intermediate wards of their public hospitals as approved private hospitals. That will enable them to take advantage immegrams diately of the hospital benefits scheme. Certain States have also arranged to this scheme operate throughout their hosfinancial pital schemes in relation to both ordinary public beds and private intermediate wards. POSTAL DEPAETMENT.",14
31,Mr COSTA,HEALTHAND MEDICA L,"Did the Prime Minister recently receive a letter from the Federal Executive of the Amalgamated Postal Workers Union making representations in respect of that union's claims as follows:That no further curtailment shall take place of communications services; that there shall be no further retrenchment of employees and that those retrenched shall be reinstated without loss of salaries or status; that immediate wage increases of £52 per annum be granted under Public Service regulations by and increments doubled; that the Government's policy of equal pay for the sexes be implemented; that there shall be no further restrictions of funds for the provision of amenities; and finally, that there shall he no lengthening of weekly hours of duty. If the Prime Minister did receive the letter, is he now in a position to give a decision on the matter?",14
32,Mr MENZIES,HEALTHAND MEDICA L,"I received a letter from the trade union to which the honourable member has referred, over the signature of Mr Burke. I have today a forwarded an answer to it and I shall be very glad to provide the honourable of member with a copy of that answer. doubt the union itself will circularize mean the contents of my letter to other interested parties, but I shall ensure that the honourable member will receive a copy",14
33,Mr TURNBULL,HEALTHAND MEDICA L,"I ask the Postmaster-General whether there is any limit are to the number of words that will be accepted by his department for transmission as an urgent telegram. Is there any concession in relation to the rate charged, when the wordage of such a telegram is in excess of a certain number 1 If so, would such a concession apply to of an urgent telegram of 1,105 words that to apply for I received recently?",14
34,Mr ANTHONY,HEALTHAND MEDICA L,"I hope that there, are enough people with enough money to send at urgent rates such lengthy teleas the honourable member has described, because, if there are, my probhave lems as Postmaster-General for this year will be considerably eased. Tbere is no limit to the number of words that the Postal Department will accept as an ' urgent telegram, but however lengthy such a telegram may be no concessional rebate is allowed. If the honor-; able member can encourage transmission of more such lengthy telegrams I shall possibly extend a personal concession to him by way of commission. THE PARLIAMENT.",14
35,Mr GULLETT,HEALTHAND MEDICA L,"I ask you, Mr. Speaker, whether it is a fact that there is at present no official parliamentary handbook available for the use of honourable members, members of the public and other people who may wish to use such a publication. Has your attention been directed to a parliamentary handbook that has been produced by Mr. Parmer-Whyte ? If so, would you consider adopting that handbook as the official handbook, in the absence of any other?",15
36,Mr SPEAKER,HEALTHAND MEDICA L,"I have seen the handbook to which the honourable member has referred. The point that he has raised will be given consideration in due course. TEXTILES. Mr ALLA N FRASER - Can the Minister for Supply provide any information on a serious matter that has been raised in a telegram that I have received from Amalgamated Textiles (Australia) Limited of Sydney? The telegram readsThis company with spinning and weaving mills at Albury, Orange and Goulburn compelled stand down six hundred employees. Request direct your personal attention recent tenders lS-oz. khaki which was allocated by department entirely to one Sydney mill. To prevent complete closing down ask your urgent co-operation. Will the Minister investigate the position disclosed by the telegram and, if possible, meet the wishes of the company?",15
37,Mr BEALE,HEALTHAND MEDICA L,"Yes , I shall have that matter investigated. As the honourable member will understand, I have no detailed knowledge of the particular case to which he has referred. We do what we can in relation to such matters. As I said in this House recently, the matter is one of great difficulty. If we departed from the public tender system we should be open to the accusation of favouritism. If we adhere to the system, then obviously contracts must be given to the companies that submit the lowest tenders, and it may well he that one firm will tender for a contract to supply a large order of khaki cloth at a low price, and perhaps even at a loss, in order to keep its mills going, wbilst other firms might be unable to submit such a low tender. However, this matter has already been under consideration to ascertain whether something can be done, within the charter of the Contracts Board, to assist textile manufacturers. If something can be done in that direction, it will be done. NA FINANCI AL POLICY.",15
38,Mr MCLEOD,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,"Does the Treasurer recall stating that if the Government's policy of high taxation and restriction of credit and of loans to the States did not have the desired effect of abating inflation the policy could he put into reverse? In view of the known disastrous effects of the policy on food production, road construction in rural areas, the land settlement of ex-servicemen and the building of homes, including war service homes, to name just a few matters, does not the Treasurer consider that the time is overdue when the Government's policy should be reversed, or at least eased, in relation to such essential items, in order to prevent any further deterioration of the position ?",15
39,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,"I heard the word "" policy"" used several times in the question.",15
40,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,I was on the point of directing attention to the fact that the question is one that relates entirely to policy. The Government's policy will be of such a nature as will keep the Opposition out of office for ever. ANSWER TO QUESTION.,15
41,Mr HOLT,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,"I rise to make a personal explanation. On Thursday of last week the honourable member for Herbert directed a question to the Prime Minister in which he referred to a question that he had asked some time ago, an answer to which, he said, had been considerably delayed. The honourable member told the Prime Minister that the question had been put on the notice-paper on the 17th October, that it was directed to me, and that I had omitted or neglected to answer it. The honourable member was good enough to say that that was not my practice and that be regretted having had to raise the matter, but he wished to ensure that there would be no such delay when matters of the kind were raised in future. I do not suggest that the honourable member attempted wilfully to mislead the House and the Prime Minister in the matter, but I point out to him that question to which he referred was not one upon notice but was asked without notice. He wished to put the question to me, but as I was absent from the House through illness he put it direct to the Prime Minister. In point of fact, the question did not relate to either of my departments, nor did it relate to the administration of the Prime Minister's Department. It related to a matter that comes within the jurisdiction of the Treasurer. Wben it was asked the Prime Minister said that, because of its nature, involving as it did the compilation by the Commonwealth Statistician of tables of items included in the "" C "" series index, some little time would be needed to provide an answer to it, and that he would see that the answer would be supplied when it became available. I was concerned when the honourable member asked the question, because I had given strict instructions to both my departments that questions on the notice-paper directed to me concerning the activities of the departments were to be dealt with promptly, and I bad had no cause for complaint in that respect in the past. I consider that, in fairness to the omcers of the departments, I should make it clear that there was no delay on their part in connection with this matter, which at no 3tage came within my province. OFFENSIVE REMARK.",15
42,Mr ROSEVEAR,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,I desire to make a personal explanation in relation to an incident that occurred yesterday. While the House was on the air yesterday-and possibly there was a re-broadcast last night,16
43,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,There was not a re-broadcast last night.,16
44,Mr ROSEVEAR,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,"You , Mr Speaker, made a statement from the chair that I had",16

46,Mr ROSEVEAR,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,"I am clearing myself in relation to the matter, and am the not concerned otherwise with what you may have said.",16
47,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,Order ! Up to date the honourable gentleman's remarks have dealt with me.,16
48,Mr ROSEVEAR,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,"The position is that I made an estimate of the number of times that a Minister had made an offensive remark concerning the Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday, you were good enough",16
49,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,Order ! The honourable gentleman may not refer to me or my actions in the course of a personal explanation.,16

I have given my ruling and it cannot be departed from except in a specific way; and that way is well known to the honourable member.",16
51,Mr ROSEVEAR,GOVERNMENT ECONOMIC AND,"In future, I hope that you will not take advantage of the protection of the Chair when you make such insulting remarks. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! I have no intention of following the honourable gentleman's example. NA ADJOURNMENT. PRECEDENCE.",16
52,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR," I have received letters from the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) and the honourable  of whom intimates that he desires the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public importance. Standing Order 48 readsIn the event of more than one motion being submitted for the same day, priority shall given to the motion which, in the opinion of the Speaker, is the most urgent and important. In accordance with that standing order, I give priority to the motion of which the honourable member for Mackellar has order. given notice. I point out to the honourable member for Lalor that the motion of which he has given notice attempts to deal with a matter that is already listed on the notice-paper and, consequently, debate on it at this juncture against the standing order that provides that no honourable member shall attempt to anticipate a debate on a matter that is already listed on the notice-paper.

60,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,Order ! If the honourable gentleman wishes to read his motion he must ask for leave of the House  the motion of which I have given notice. Leave not granted.  101 I move That the ruling be dissented from.,17
61,Mr WENTWORTH,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"I rise to order. I again direct attention to the last paragraph of Standing Order 48, which you, Mr Speaker, read earlier. It readsIn the event of more than one motion being submitted for the same day, priority shall be given to the motion which, in the opinion of the Speaker, is the most urgent and important. I submit, therefore, that the opinion of the Speaker cannot be canvassed in the House, but that the ruling of the Chair completely resolves the point at issue.",17

Mackellar is based, is, first, reliable; and secondly, more important than testing will of the House in respect of a matter that is brought before it by an honourable member? The motion of the honourable member for Mackellar is based on a report for the accuracy of which he cannot vouch.",17

In my view action taken by the Chair under that provision is not open to any challenge whatsoever.",18
66,Dr EVATT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"I rise to order, Mr. Speaker. You have given an opinion war service homes and the question now arises whether or not that opinion is correct. First, you gave priority to the motion of the honourable member for Mackellar has given notice. That was objected to and on the question of whether the preference you determined could be challenged under the Standing Orders, you ruled that it could not be so chalfrom lenged. That also is a ruling, and, surely, an honourable member can question it the ordinary way. The House may uphold your ruling. You have preted the Standing Orders to provide merely that you may give preference one motion, but also that the grounds which you reach your decision are not examinable by means of an appeal against that ruling to the House.

67,Mr ANTHONY,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"It is perfectly obvious, the Mr Speaker, that your ruling is sound because if it had been intended under the Standing Orders that the House should decide which motion should be given priority they would not have provided that the Speaker should determine that point, but would have provided that it should be determined by the House itself. memStanding Order 48 specifically gives in authority to the Speaker in this matter.

70,Mr HOLT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,May we ask that the Leader of the Opposition read his motion of dissent.,18
71,Dr EVATT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"I have moved to dissent the ruling of Mr Speaker that his opinion or a ruling given under Standing in Order 48, giving priority to one motion as against another, is not open to chalinterlenge under Standing Order 101. not This important matter need not be disto cussed at length. I am not now dealing on with the merits of your ruling, Mr. Speaker, in which you gave priority to the matter that the honourable member for that Mackellar (Mr ""Wentworth) wishes to raise. Standing Order 48 provides, into* aliaIn the event of more than one motion being submitted for the same day, priority shall be given to the motion which, in the opinion of the Speaker, is the most urgent and important. The question now before the House is whether Mr Speaker's ruling that one motion is more urgent and important than another motion is unchallengeable. You, sir, have ruled that your decision is unchallengeable, but I direct attention to Standing Order 101, which reads as follows:If any objection is taken to the ruling of the Speaker, such objection must be taken at once and in writing, and a Motion of Dissent moved, . . . I submit that it is not the intention of Standing Order 48 that Mr Speaker should be the final judge of the relative urgency and importance of two motions. 1 hope that honourable members follow the argument that I am developing. I emphasize that I am now dealing, not with the relative urgency and importance of the two motions, but simply with whether Mr Speaker's ruling that one motion shall have priority over another motion is unchallengeable. I submit that such a ruling is contrary to the whole principle of the Standing Orders, and that it should be dissented from.",18
72,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,Is the . motion seconded ? ,19
73,Mr MENZIES,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"This motion is quite fanciful. Standing Order 48, which governs this matter, is explicit. It states, in part. . . priority shall be given to the ivliich, in the opinion of the Speaker, is the most urgent and important. It is now apparently argued that the Standing Order means, "" In the opinion of Mr Speaker or of the House, as the case may be"". .Such an argument has no foundation. Standing Order 48 expressly provides that priority shall be given to the motion which, in the opinion of the Speaker, is the most urgent and important. Honourable gentlemen, when they study the Standing Orders, find many rules that have to be interpreted by Mr Speaker and in respect of which his opinion is obviously challengeable, because the words "" in the opinion of the Speaker"" are not included in them. But in the matter now under consideration the point that had to be resolved was whether priority should be given to one motion instead of to another motion. It concerned the order of business. Therefore, the House expressly provided that the judgment in such a case was to be the opinion of Mr Speaker. It is merely bandying words to say that it is the opinion of somebody else. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) has been eager to support his colleague, but has not dared to contend that the words mean in the opinion of somebody else, because to do so would be to commit an absurdity of language.  Mr Speaker's ruling on this issue, Standing Order 101 has no application to a situation that may arise should a ruling be incorrect. In such circumstances, the House would be completely impotent. Mr Speaker may give, from his standpoint, a perfectly honest ruling, yet the majority of honourable members may regard it as incorrect, unfair and unjust. I suggest that those who drafted the Standing Orders visualized, in their wisdom, just such a positiou as has arisen this afternoon, and, accordingly, formulated Standing Order 101. In those circumstances, I submit that the motion of dissent submitted by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) and seconded by myself is in order.",19
74,Mr HOLT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"I propose to discuss only one point, but I regard it as of some conmotion sequence to the House. The view has been expressed by the honourable member  ruling by Mr Speaker would leave the House impotent. The position, if that opinion were correct, would be serious, but, of course, the House, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) and the honourable member for Lalor know, is always master of its own business. If it be found that the Standing Orders do not enable business to be called on and the House, by a majority vote, wishes to have it called on, a motion may be submitted for the suspension of so much of the Standing Orders as would prevent that item of business from being dealt with. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the House would be impotent. The House has always been master of its own business. It has placed certain authority in Mr Speaker's hands for a particular purpose. The House, if it wished to take that authority out of Mr Speaker's hands, could do so by a majority vote.

75,Mr MENZIES,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR," by leave-As I have arranged with the Government of the United Daly. F. M . Kingdom to make a co-ordinated announcement of an important matter, perhaps that could be done at this stage. The Australian Government, after discussion with the United Kingdom Government, has decided to send a famous Royal Australian Air Force jet fighter wing to the Middle East about July to join the Royal Air Force forces in that area. Until now, Great Britain has borne the whole burden of providing garrison forces for the important Middle East area. Australia has now agreed to contribute a part of the peace-time air force garrison in the Middle East. The Royal Australian A ir Force wing to bo stationed in the Middle East is No. 78 Fighter Wing, comprising No. 75 and No. 76 squadrons and supporting units. The wing is at present stationed at Williamtown, New South Wales. Its squadrons are equipped with Australianbuilt De Havilland Vampire jet fighters. These aircraft will not be taken to the Middle East but will remain in Australia. The wing, on arrival in the Middle East, tvill be provided with aircraft and equipment from Royal Air Force sources and will be stationed at a Royal Air Force base for combined and advanced training. Great advantage will accrue to Royal Australian Air Force from its garrison service in this area, for it will give to many oflieers and men training and experience in an area which presents distinctive problems to air forces. expected that the wing will leave Sydney by ship about June, 1952. The eventual location has not yet been decided, but use of a Royal Air Force base in Cyprus is under consideration. The despatch cf No. 78 wing to the Middle East will mean that the Royal after consideration. Australian Air Force will be operating in three places overseas. No. squadron, flying Meteor jet fighters, No. 30-Dakot a transport unit--ar e engaged in the Korean war.

76,Mr WENTWORTH,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"The endeavour of the Opposition to postpone the discussion of this matter is perhaps understandable, but it does little credit to their intelligence or integrity. When.charges had been brought against a political party that its official journals were circulating subversive and seditious statements calculated to lower the morale of Australian troops fighting in Korea, to give aid and comfort to the enemies of the United Nations and to impair the defences of Australia, one would have thought that che the members of the party would have been anxious to clear themselves of such charges. The fact that tliey have tried to obstruct the introduction of this motion convicts them of knowing that the motion It is itself is justified. I do not believe that this motion will the have issue in any action. It is not so designed. It is designed to bring before this House certain matters that should be considered, and that may call for action Nevertheless, the motion is both important and urgent, first, 77 because of the substance of the seditious and statements of which complaint is made; secondly, because the statements are not isolated but form a continuing series; and, thirdly, because they have heen made in a journal that claims to represent officially the Australian Labour party Auswhich sponsors considerable members opposite. The statements have been made in a feature article which has appeared in a certain journal almost every week The feature article He always has the same author and is known the as "" Canberra Commentary"". These articles are published in the paper called the Labour Herald, which is officially described as 'being publisbed at "" 20 Trades' H all , Adelaide"". describes itself as "" The official organ of the Australian Labour party "" and a byline is added- "" Expressing the official viewpoint of the united trades and labour councils of South Australia representing 80,000 trade unionists "" - I do not believe that, because I do not believe that there are 80,000 traitors among the South Australian trade unionists. - Honourable members of this House who come here under the sponsorship and patronage of the Australian Labour party must be involved in the publication of ' this official organ. Tbey must either disown their own publications or convict themselves yet further. I shall now bring to the' notice of the House the nature of the publications. I refer to an article in the Labour Herald, of the 5th February, 1952, in which the author, after discussing Korea, made this statementThe soldiers fighting in Korea under the 'flag of the United Nations should be told that they are not fighting for the purpose of keeping South Korea free, they are embroiled in the extension and strengthening of American imperialism in Asia. Can' one imagine a more dastardly or damaging statement? I again remind honourable members that that statement was made in an official journal of the Australian Labour party.",21
77,Mr JAMES,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"I rise to a point of order, Mr Speaker. Y o u have ruled that a question cannot be based upon a press report. The honourable member for Mackeller (Mr ""Wentworth) is now basing his speech on a press report. I seek your ruling as to whether he should be allowed to continue along the lines he has indicated.",22
78,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,Order ! The honourable member for Mackellar is in order.,22
79,Mr WENTWORTH,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"The author of this article endeavours to j u s t if y himself by referring to the authority of a Mr .  authority that the author has cited here and elsewhere is a traitor. a member of the Communist party although he has been a member of the British House of Commons. In order to prove that, I cite again an official Labour publication, the New South Wales It also Standard of the 26th A p r i l , 1946Communist affiliation is the most-talked-ofsubject in British Labour politics today. The Communist Party in Great Britain has campaigned vigorously and effectively among the union.? for affiliation support. The well known Communist lawyer, Mr. D. Pritt, has applied to the Transport House Executive for readmission. It is ulainied by the London Daily Herald that Pritt'? application is a test case. If Mr. Pritt succeeds in transferring from the Communist Party to the Labour Party it opens the door to others; . . . Therefore, there is no question about the  If one were to read his articles one would soon come to the conclusion that he is an active and vicious Communist agent. Of  in view of the nature of what is known  not amount to much. The second article that I wish to bring to the notice of honourable members is far more serious. It is so serious that I propose later today to circulate copies of it to all honourable members of this House so that they may judge full y its nature. It was published in the Labour Herald of the 30th November, 1951, and it starts off with a diatribe against the sincerity of the United Nations. Then it continuesWorkers should not allow themselves to be unduly impressed by the so-called peace talks in Paris. The author then avers that the United Nations is a phoney organization. That is not the exact word he uses, but it summarizes his views. Lest anybody should think that be is referring to the Russians, the statement continuesIn the circumstances it should be quite obvious to workers that the representatives of the member nations of the United Nations Organization cannot be expected to do anything in the nature of establishing and maintaining world peace beyond, when they are compelled to do so, making virtues of necessities. Practically all of them are supporters of the capitalist system who act politically through the medium of anti-Labour Governments. As such, they will continue to talk at length about the need for world peace but will not be He is prepared to do anything constructive to make it possible or lasting. That is a direct attack on the sincerity of our side in the United Nations. But even that is not the worse, because this author goes on to counsel workers that, if the United Nations is engaged in a war, they use their industrial power to stop that war. He statedWhether there will be another world war or not or whether there will be a lasting world peace or not will depend much more upon what the masses of the workers will be prepared to do, either one way or the other, than i upon what the United Nations Organization can or is prepared to do. In other words, either war or peace becomes the order of the day to the extent only that workers make it possible to be so. They and they alone constitute the labor power required either to be used for the purposes of war or those of peace. That taken in conjunction with the rest of this vicious article, is a direct incitement to the workers to down tools and allow the enemy to run over us should the United Nations he involved in war. The ful l infamy of that attitude can be gauged by the fact that it is an echo of a well-known Communist line that was first put out in 1915 by Lenin in a thesis The Defeat of One's Own Government in the Imperialist War. That line was continued by George Dimitrov in his pamphlet The War and the Working Class that was publisbed in October, 1939. It affirmed the directive on which the Communist party of Australia and certain sections of the Australian Labour party tried to sprag the war effort. Dimitrov statedFor the working class, there is only one correct stand, an irreconcilable, courageous struggle against the imperialist war, a struggle against the culprits and the agents of this war primarily in their own country. There one sees the sinister link between the social line developed by the author of this article and the Communist line. The words of the author that I have quoted justify my claim that they are endeavouring to undermine the morale of the fighting forces in Korea. I know that there are many loyal elements inside the Australian Labour party. Let them show themselves now ry disowning this article and by taking proper measures against its author. If they do not do so now they will show that the same forces of treason that governed the actions of a large section of their party in 1939 and 1940 are still at work.",22
80,Dr EVATT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"Barton-Leade r of the Opposition) [3.55] - I do not suppose that there has ever been a motion for an adjournment, treated as urgent and important, which has been so shockingly supported by an honourable member of this House as is the motion that is now the subject of debate. Except from what the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) has read, honourable t will members do not know the full extent of his charges. He has not read the whole article. He has picked out a short passage from a lengthy article and I believe it to be the same article as that on which he asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) recently. That question was directed against a distinguished Labour leader in the Senate, - Senator Donald Cameron.",23
81,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,".Order ! The right honourable gentleman cannot make any reference in relation to the other chamber, except on a substantive motion.",23
82,Dr EVATT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"Mr Speaker, this is the substantive motion. It is contained in the motion that is before the House.",23
83,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,Order ! I must point out to the Leader of the Opposition that a motion for the adjournment of the House is not a substantive motion.,23
84,Dr EVATT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"I shall not bandy arguments, Mr Speaker; you must decide such matters. Bnt the motion for the adjournment is based on certain alleged seditious statements that are said to be contained in certain, newspapers. The motion does not say what they are. The honourable member for Mackellar has read pieces from articles and made an incoherent speech which nobdy could understand.  sanitary fatigue.",23
85,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,Order ! The expression used by the honourable member for Lalor is unparliamentary and must be withdrawn without reservation. ,23
86,Dr EVATT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"The honourable member referred to an article which, he said, had appeared in the Herald, publisbed in Adelaide. He claimed that it was a copy of an article from the Labour Call of Melbourne. I believe that to be so, because : passages that he has read seem to correspond in substance with the articlethat he read last week in relation to Korea and the purposes of the war there. In respect of that article, I repeat what the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator MCKenna) has said, namely, that the Lahour party is opposed to and deprecates that expression of opinion. The honourable member has picked out a short passage from a lengthy article and has made misleading references to certain persons. One referred to a member of the bar in England whom the honourable member for Mackellar declares to be a Communist. I do not know that he is a Communist. The other reference apparently was to Sir John Pratt, a distinguished civil servant who was an adviser to the Foreign Office for many years. The honourable member for Mackellar cast a slur on that gentleman without producing proof of the accuracy of his assertions. He has' asked this House to express the deliberate opinion that the Labour party is involved in some sedition on the basis of a tiny extract from a couple of articles which honourable members have not read. That is a shocking thing. It is an abuse of the proceedings of the House to submit the motion at all. In the political movement one differs from some opinions that are expressed. At the same time, there is a principle which this House must recognize. That is the principle of freedom of expression. Subject to the law of the land and to the law of sedition, people are entitled to express their opinions. This Parliament should not be persuaded by a side wind introduced in a shabby, sneaking way and put forward so incoherently to condemn persons of a serious crime. If treason and sedition are involved, that is a matter for decision by the judges and juries of the land not by the' honourable member for Mackellar.",23
87,Mr CALWELL,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,Not by a ratbag.,24
88,Mr SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,Order ! The honormember able member for Melbourne (Mr the Calwell) will withdraw that expression.,24
89,Mr CALWELL,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,I withdraw without reservation.,24
90,Dr EVATT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"No slander or intimimitted dation should be used by an honourable member to prevent expressions of opinion so long as they are not breaking the law that has been passed by the Australian or the State parliaments. If an opinion is not calculated to cause disaffection or disturbance it is not seditious. This House cannot dare to express an opinion about the seditious character of an article that its members have not even read. The honourable member has said that he intended to send copies of the article round to honourable members after the motion had been moved. Just imagine! Condemn first and look at the facts afterwards! That is the kind of justice we should have in this country under the honourable member for Mackellar. I believe the attack that he has made is completely unworthy of this House. He has not pressed it seriously. As a matter of fact, the objective of the attack i.3 so party-political that it amounts to sheer malevolence. I consider that the honourable member, by making it, is himself guilty of the very thing that he attributes to the Labour party-sub version. What he is attempting to do io to subvert the processes of the Parliament, to substitute for the courts of law the ex parte tribunal of the Parliament. I believe that his own party could not support such a revolutionary proposal unless it saw all the facts and considered that they justified the proposal. I do not believe that the facts would justify it . I say that if there is any subversion it is on the part of the honourable member, and that he has not produced one tittle of evidence of any other sedition. There is a deeper and more sinister aspect of the matter. This kind of thing may well represent an attempt to introduce into our Australian democracy, of which this Parliament is representative, the doctrine known as "" Macarthyism "", which specializes in the slur, the sneer, the innuendo and the quotation of passages out of their context. The honourable has not even told us the name of author of the articles. No, he will distribute the article later on! I think that the motion has the same object as that of another motion that was subrecently, and that it is intended to refer to a distinguished senator. I say further that the honourable gentleman's attack is in keeping with other speeches that he has made, which indicate a desire to convict people without a hearing. He is to be the judge of whether a person is, or is not, guilty of sedition. Just imagine the honourable member, with his so very apparent prejudices, as a member of a jury sworn to give an impartial verdict in a case in which the defendant was charged with sedition. Is the House going to be any less attentive to an issue of that kind than a jury would be? I do not believe that anybody, no matter how politically biased he was or how much he detested his opponents, could be so obsessed with hatred as to support a motion of this character. The honourable member has said that he does not know whether any action will be taken as a result of his motion, but he wants the matter considered. Tbere is a doctrine known to the law as ""contempt of court"". There ought also to he a doctrine known to the law as "" contempt of parliament"". Judges have laid it down that before a case is presented by the prosecution it is possible to prejudice the community against the defendant. The court sums it up by saying that it is possible to poison the fountains of justice before they hegin to flow. That is what the honourable member is trying to do. Just imagine it being possible to hold a proper hearing after an attack such as that levelled by the honourable member! If it be a reference to an honourable gentlelast man who is a former Minister of the Crown, then it is a reference to a man who is himself an ex-soldier, who fought for Australia, who is the father of a man wbo lost his life in war and of another son who also served his country at the front. If that be the case, then it only adds to the contempt with wbicb the honourable member is treating this Parliament. But worse of all is his pretended support of the Tjnited Nations. Just look at the record of his statements about the United Nations over the last two years. He made a most savage, violent, and unjustified attack on Mr Trygve Lie, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Honourable members will recall that attack quite clearly. Its terms were so extravagant and abusive that I do not suppose anybody paid much attention to it, hut it is on record, and I shall not refer any further to it. He has not said anything in opposition to the United Nations since the outbreak of the Korean war. In fact, he was not interested in the good work performed and able to be performed, by the United Nations until the Korean war started. Prior to the outbreak of the Korean war he was an open opponent of the Secretary-General of the organization. It is difficult to take the honourable member seriously, but it is a serious thing to impute subversive activities to a political party, when the only basis for the imputation is the kind of proof that the honourable member has produced. Just imagine placing such proof before a magistrate! The case would be thrown out of court as rubbish, which is a good description of the case that the honourable gentleman has placed before us today. I ask this House never to condemn people until they have heen heard. We do not even know the nature of the document on which the honourable member is relying for his allegations. He has given us no proof of what he has said. He has read one sentence out of what he admits to be a lengthy article. In a court of law the jury would be instructed to acquaint itself with all the facts, and not just some of them, before it decided whether sedition had occurred. If the Crown Prosecutor said, "" My case relies on the sentence of a lengthy article that covers many pages"", but kept the rest of the article secret, the court would instruct the jury to dismiss the charge. I ask the House, which is, in a sense, the jury, though it is not exactly in the same position as a jury, to treat this motion with the utter and absolute contempt it deserves.",24
91,Mr OSBORNE,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"Evans) [4.5] - I shall not attempt to simulate the simulated heat that was shown by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt). I rise to support the action of the' honourable member for Mackellar (Mr. Wentworth) in directing attention to a series of seditious and subversive' articles in the South Australian Herald, which is an official Labour'party organ. The Leader of the Opposition has said that this motion is unworthy of. this House. I say that these articles are unworthy of the Labour party, which must' say, in the interests of our national security and unity, where it stands in relation to them. The Leader of the Opposition has not by any means answered the charge that has been levelled by the honourable member for Mackellar. He has contented himself with making a vicious attack on the mover of the motion, and has miade no attempt to answer the charges contained in the motion itself. He has complained that the honourable member's letter supplies him with insufficient particulars. Yet he has before him a copy of the journal concerned, and so has the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell). How can they possibly complain justly that they do not know the particulars of the attack? In case there is any possible doubt about these particulars I shall give to the Leader of the Opposition some information about the articles of which we complain. On page 5 of the Herald of the 15th February, one of them appears. This newspaper is described as an official organ of the Labour party, and is published in Adelaide at a price of 3d. a copy. Can the right honourable gentleman justly claim any longer that he has not suflicient particulars ?",25
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR," Order ! The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) who has been interjecting, must remain silent.",26
93,Mr OSBORNE,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"The other article is from an issue of the same newspaper dated the 30th November and also appears on page 5 in a feature entitled "" Canberra Commentary"". Has the rigbt honourable gentleman that newspaper before him? If he has not we shall be glad to show it to him.",26
94,Dr EVATT,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,I should like to see it.,26
95,Mr OSBORNE,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"The right honourable gentleman made this nonsensical complaint that he has not sufficient particulars when he knows, as we all know, that the matter has been debated elsewhere. I say that his statement that he has not sufficient particulars of the matter is completely hypocritical. The two articles to which the honourable member for Mackellar referred are serious enough in themselves, but if any honourable member takes the trouble to read previous articles contained in back numbers of this newspaper, in the column entitled "" Canberra Commentary "", by the same author, he will find that they are a part of a serious and studied plan. They teach a political and economic philosophy based on the theme of class war. They say that war is caused by profit-mongering armament-makers, and that innocent workers are led blindly to the slaughter by such people on both sides in any war, so that the armament-makers may be assured of profits. The writer goes on to state that there is no hope in the United Nations, but that the only hope for mankind is mass action by the workers-in other words, by a revolution of the proletariat. If any honourable member doubts the force of my contention, I can give to him a number of similar examples.",26
96,Unknown,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"Opposition members interjecting,",26
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,Order ! If honourable members persist in interjecting I shall name them. I intend that speakers on both sides of the House shall be given a fair hearing.,26
98,Mr OSBORNE,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"Perhaps 'any of these articles by itself might be described as innocent, but taken together in series they provide irrefutable proofof a chain of argument, the purpose of which is to teach that the only hope for mankind lies in a revolution of the workers. Another issue of the Herald, that of the 25 th January, 1951, contains this paragraph in the same feature article, "" Canberra Commentary ""Already, aggressive and predatory financialism, primarily, has been responsible for two world wars, to say nothing of numerous other wars both before and since the two world wars. Whether it will be allowed to become the cause of another or third world war remains to be seen. The same feature article in the issue of the 23rd February contains the following paragraph:Tlieir wars of the past, which have now developed into the world wars of nowadaystwo of which have already taken place-and their policy intended will be to enforce both by direct and indirect means a master plan of imperialism with America leading the way. And representing, as it would, the highest phase of the development of capitalism that has yet been reached, . . . The issue of the 2nd March contains the following paragraph, again in the same feature article:Thirdly, that economic capitalist warfare for world markets and monopoly control of raw materials by competing capitalist groups of imperialisms, has been intensified since the ending of the world war of 1939-45 and, primarily, is responsible for the war now being waged in Korea. Nothing is said about Communist imperialism, and nothing about the Communist breach of the conditions and orders of the United Nations. Instead, the article claims that the Korean war was caused by "" competing capitalist groups "". The whole plan of the argument is plain. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that this is not the place to raise these matters if they involve sedition. We have directed the attention of the House to them in order that the Opposition may not remain in ignorance of the sort of thing that is being done in the name of the Labour party. The Opposition now has the opportunity to state where it stands and to make its position clear to the Australian people. I also hone that as a result of the attention .low given co the articles in this House they will be examined by officers of the law. I cannot say whether they are, in fact, seditious or not according to law, ancl I am less concerned about that aspect of the matter than I am about their effect on the morale of the Australian people and of Australian soldiers fighting in Korea. Two possibilities lie behind these articles. The first is that they are a part of a deliberate attempt to undermine the morale of the people and of our soldiers. If that is the case, tben it is clear in whose interest the attempt is being made. The other possibility is that they are innocent and foolish-in short, that their author is a dangerous fool. In either case, where does the Labour party stand, and what does it intend to do? The whole of the argument that lies behind these articles is based on two premises. The first is that wars are organized by capitalists in pursuit of gains, and the second is that the only salvation for mankind lies in a revolution of the proletariat on both sides. For that argument to have any validity it would have to rest on two grounds. The first is that political attempts to avoid war are useless, and the second is that Communist imperialism and all that lies behind it , can he completely ignored. Does the Labour party support or reject these two assumptions? Let it give a plain answer to that question. It is of no use for honourable members opposite to avoid the issue, as the Leader of the Opposition has attempted to do, by launching an abusive attack' on the mover of the motion. I hope that the honourable member for Melbourne,, who is Deputy Leader of the Opposition,, will give a clear answer to the chargemade by us. Does he support the premise that the United Nations is useless, and that Communist imperialism can be ignored? What the author of the. articles asks us to believe is that those who make armaments in the United States of America, Great B r it a in and Australia are in league with one another and with those who make armaments in Bussia for the purpose of making profits. Have these arguments been heard before ?'",26
99,Mr WARD,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,Yes .,27
100,Mr OSBORNE,FORMAL MOTIONS FOR,"I am glad to have that admission from the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr W a r d ) . I should not be astonished if he does not approve of those arguments. These articles are either criminally irresponsible or traitorous in intent. In any event, the Labour party must say where it stands in respect of them and what it intends to do about them. It will not suffice for members of the Opposition merely to state in generalities that they do not agree with such statements. Their party must cease to harbour the authors of such articles.",27

However, at the same time, it is significant that honourable members must submit to having thrust down their throats arguments of the kind that the honourable member for unity Mackellar advanced, because the majority has agreed to deal with this motion prior to dealing with the urgent problem of providing houses for ex-servicemen World War II . and also for Australian soldiers who are now fighting in Korea.

Thg honourable member for Mackellar has not he wrotenamed the man whom he has charged with the most atrocious crimes of sedimodernized tion and treachery. The honourable memis ber has sought to advance a step further towards the introduction of thought conand trol into the Parliament. All that the writer, about whom he complained has ganda done has been to propound a point of world view about the campaign in Korea. I to. remind the honourable member that statements' of the kind which he now condemns have been published in conservative newsof papers. But he has not directed attenthat tion - to those statements. The basis this motion is a series of articles that were published in the Bulletin. I pose to show that the charge that the honourable member has levelled against the writer of the articles in Labour journals to which he has referred must also be preferred against the author of the Bulletin articles. If , as the honourable member has said, the former article.? Sydney were written with the object of weakening among the Allies, the latter articles are more to be condemned. The writer of the articles in Labour Gall and Herald took as his text those that had of been published in the Bulletin. The contention of the articles as a whole was that the Chinese Communists and their North to Korean allies were better fighters tban the Americans. Eeferring to the Chinese against Communists, the writer saidThey did not come to the hill merely to take a hummock. There were plenty more like it behind them if they wanted hills. Wliat they came for was to surprise and embarrass the Americans as they sat round their wellwarmed crap-game drinking beer with turkey sandwiches' and reminiscing about Mamie and Those statements are utterly subversive and intended to prejudice American servicemen in the eyes of the readers of that journal. Tbey are infinitely more dangerous than are the other articles in which the author genuinely raised the question of whether there might not be you resomething wrong with the set-up in said Korea. On the other hand, the author of the Bulletin articles, in order to drive home his messages, harped upon thu Archie claim that the No r t h Koreans and Chinese Communists were infinitely superior to the troops of the United Nations. Eeferring to the Communists Even though the Chinese Army is becoming in Korea it is becoming modernized with a strong difference. Its modernization strictly utilitarian. It strives after none of the democratic appeasement of the soldier tender care of the moral, political and stomachic comfort which Communist propahave been largely responsible for teaching an absorbent Western Press and political that the democratic warrior is entitled It still applies its discipline with a strong hand and there is none of the silly tenderness outlook which balks at calling soldiers "" privates "" or "" men "" lest they should feel they were not as good as their officers. of They are just plain gun-fodder. The writer in the Labour journals was promaking an honest attempt to analyse articles that had heen published in the Bulletin and had been written by a man who had visited Korea. The only passage in the former articles that is really in question is the following: The answer to the representative of the Bulletin is that the soldiers fighting in Korea under the flag of the UN should be told that they are not fighting to keep Korea free. They are fighting to extend and strengthen American imperialism in Asian countries, and nothing else. In the guise of patriotism, the writer of the Bulletin articles made a forthwith. miserable and sneaking attack upon the honour of United Nations soldiers whereas the writer of the articles that putwere published in Labour journals courageously dealt with doubts that had arisen in his mind. The honourable member, in his quaint phraseology, said he was giving aid and comfort to the enemy. The man whom he has condemned gave great discomfort to the enemy when he carried a carbine as a member of the Australian Light Horse in South Africa many years ago. Furthermore, his family has heen sorely stricken as a result of war. One of Anthony, his sons gave his life in World War II . Berry, whilst another son was in the merchant Bostock, W.

Reaffirming its desire that the United Nations develop an effective collective security system to maintain the peace and that the armed forces and armaments of the world be progressively reduced in accordance with the Purposes and Principles of the Charter, KOBE A. Relieving that a necessary means to this end is the development by the United Nations of comprehensive and co-ordinated plans, under international control, for the regulation, limitation and balanced reduction of all nrincd forces and all armaments, for the elimination nf all major weapons adaptable to mass destruction, and for the effective international control of atomic energy to ensure the prohibition of atomic weapons and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes only, Recognizing that a genuine system for disarmament miist include all kinds of armed forces and armaments, must be accepted by all nations whose military resources are such that - tlieir failure to accept would endanger the system, and must include safeguards that will I. ensure the compliance of all such nations, Noting the recommendation of the Committee of Twelve established by resolution 49fi (V) that the General Assembly should establish a new commission to carry forward the tasks originally assigned to the Atomic Energy Commission and the Comniission for Conventional Armaments, 1.

Unless a better or no less effective system is devised, the United Nations plan for the international control of atomic energy and the prohibition of atomic weapons should continue to serve as the basis for the international control of atomic energy to ensure the prohibition of atomic weapons and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes only; {d) There must be an adequate system of safeguards to ensure observance of the disarmament programme, so as to provide for the prompt detection of violations while at the same time causing the minimum degree of interference in the internal life of each country; (e) The treaty (or treaties shall specifically be open to all States for signature and ratification or adherence. The treaty (or treaties shall provide what States must become parties thereto before the treaty (or treaties) shall enter into force; 4.

Debate resumed from the 28th February (vide page 567) on motion by Mr MCEWEN That the bill be now read a second time.",30
112,Dr EVATT,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"Barton-Leade r of the Opposition) [4.35] - Wit h your approval, Mr Speaker, I shall discuss the Fisheries Bill 1952 and the Pearl Fisheries Bill 1952 together, because they are cognate measures. Mr SPEAKER,-As no objection is raised to the course suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, permission is granted.",33
113,Dr EVATT,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"The Fisheries Bill 1952 deals with general fisheries in Australian waters, and the Pearl Fisheries Bill 1952 is drafted in much the same way. It will simplify the consideration of the two bills if I point out that this Parliament has the constitutional power to make laws with respect to fisheries in Australian waters beyond the territorial limits. That is a most important power. The territorial limits, broadly speaking, define the jurisdiction of the States, and beyond those limits, and only beyond them, the Parliament of the Commonwealth may pass laws and make regulations on the subject of fisheries.",33
114,Mr THOMPSON,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,Is there a maximum limit to Australian waters?,33
115,Dr EVATT,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"That is an important point. The 'Constitution does not define the term "" Australian waters "". It has proved to be a broad and extensive concept. In the days before federation, the Federal Council of Australasia, which was a legislative body, and included New Zealand, passed legislation, with the authority of the Imperial Parliament, under the Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885, on various subjects, one of which was pearl fisheries. That act is to be repealed and replaced by this legislation. The purpose of this bill is to give power to regulate fishing craft and fisheries. That power is very wide, and includes authority to regulate, and authority to prohibit. It is important that the gap now existing in legislative enactments be filled. There is no power at present for the regulation of fisheries outside the territorial limits. The Commonwealth has the constitutional power to do so, but has never exercised it. The States have the power of regulation only within the territorial limits. It is extremely important that the Commonwealth's power should he exercisable by the appropriate department in respect of fisheries extending towards Australia, and Australian fisheries extending towards other places, and that the Parliament should give the necessary authority for such regulation.",33
116,Mr WARD,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,How far does the Commonwealth's power extend?,33
117,Dr EVATT,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"It extends to fisheries in Australian waters, but the term "" Australian waters"" is not defined by the Constitution. It is left to the courts to define ""beyond territorial limits"". The authority must relate to fisheries that are not within the territorial limits, because the regulation of such fisheries is the exclusive prerogative of the States, and must apply to what are called "" Australian waters "". In my opinion, that is a broad concept, and any area known today as Australian waters comes within the scope of that power. Let us suppose, for instance, that Japanese fishing craft come to the waters round New Guinea, whether it is the trust territory of New Guinea or Papua, or to the Australian coast, but well outside the three-mile limit. This Parliament has power to pass laws on that topic. The importance of Japanese fisheries is not simply a subject for argument because the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Casey) mentioned in his speech on the Peace Treaty (Japan) Bill 1952 that Canada and the United States of America already have firm agreements with Japan that keep Japanese fishermen away from their waters well outside the three-mile limit. Such waters are fished by the nationals of Canada or the United .States of America respectively. We have no such arrangement, as yet, but Japan agrees in the peace treaty to negotiate on this matter. So long as the power deals with fisheries in Australian waters outside the territorial limits, there are no restrictions upon it legally. That is to say, "" Australian waters"" may extend 50 or 100 miles outside the territorial limits as long as such waters are Australian. I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr MCEwen) to consider this point, because it is my firm conviction that "" Australian waters "" is not limited to the area round the continent of Australia, but extends to all the waters round our territories, including New Guinea, to the Admiralty Islands and the equator, the territories to the Antarctic, such as Heard Island, and the territories in the Pacific, such as Norfolk Islandin short, all those vast territorial interests of Australia outside the continent. Can those areas of ocean be fairly called "" Australian waters "" ? I believe that, legally, the Parliament can pass legislation that the Australian courts will uphold, and effectively prevent Japanese fishing craft from coming south of the equator in the area to which I have referred. When I make that statement, I do not mean that the Japanese can be prevented hy our laws from fishing south of the equator well to the east and to the west of Australia. But I consider that such measures may be taken in respect of our possessions to the north of the Australian mainland. Dr Evatt. I come now to the broader, international aspect of this legislation. The Minister for External Affairs has stated correctly that legislation, authorized by this Parliament, is needed and that the Japanese fishing craft should he pinned down to a specified area. I do not think that the Japanese should fish south of the equator, which is an enormous distance from their own territories. When I make that statement. I am not speaking of the Antarctic, although there are matters about fisheries in those waters that deserve special consideration, because the Japanese have broken every agreement that has ever been made with respect to the method of fishing in that area. I am thinking now of the fisheries nearer Australia. It is perfectly well known that before the last war the Japanese used their fishing craft for the purposes of observation and espionage in the waters that they subsequently tried to encompass, and indeed, nearly did completely encompass, to our disaster. The Government is in a difficult position regarding this matter, because Australia has not obtained what the United States of America and Canada took care to secure before the peace treaty with Japan - a firm agreement to keep the Japanese ^utside the Canadian and United States fisheries. A big protest meeting was held in California against an attempt by the Japanese to come to those fishing grounds. It is not that we wish to exclude the Japanese from access to raw materia]-in this instance, fish-but the Japanese have many fishing grounds nearer their own territory than are Australian waters. I hope that the Government will watch the position most carefully in order to ensure that our interests shall be protected. I am satisfied that he will have legal power, which Australian courts will recognize, to do this effectively under the terms of the hill. My remarks apply equally to the Pearl Fisheries Bill. Here is an instrument that is given by the Parliament to the Government in order to enable it to protect Australian fisheries and, indirectly, to prevent any abuse of Australia's security. The instrument is sharp enough for the purpose. The Government now has the responsibility of using it effectively, and I hope that do so. The Opposition supports the bill on that basis and it will watch with keen attention the action that the Government will take to implement the measure, having regard to the menace that I have mentioned. The Minister referred to nations other than Japan. Ee said that it should be easy for Australia to make agreements with Indonesia and Holland in respect of Dutch New Guinea and with Portugal in respect of Portuguese Timor. It should attempt to make such agreements as soon as possible. The most important task, however, is to make an agreement with Japan that will protect not only Australian fisheries but also, looking well ahead, Australian security. The course that I have suggested is the course that the Government should adopt in relation to both measures.",33
118,Mr MCEWEN,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"Murray-Minister for Commerce and Agriculture) [4.47] - in reply- I assure the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) and the country that the purpose that the Government had in mind in introducing this legislation was, not merely to safeguard Australian fishing interests by enforcing conservative methods, but also to protect Australia's interests in the widest sense. The opinion expressed by the legal advisers of the Government, as I understand it, does not coincide exactly with the expressed legal view of the Leader of the Opposition. I believe that the Government's advisers are doubtful whether international law would permit the exercise of Australian authority under Australian statute law over foreigners in waters outside our territorial limits.",35
119,Mr JOHNSON,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"That is, beyond the 3-mile limit?",35
120,Mr MCEWEN,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"Yes . There is some doubt on that point. Therefore, if control could be secured by means of agreement, a positive step forward would be made. It would be unreasonable, and possibly futile, to attempt to persuade any foreign power to accept limitations on its fishing rights outside Australian territorial waters unless the Australian Government had statutory power to impose similar limitations on Australian nationals in the same waters. \Qnorum formed.] This bill, when translated into law, will establish it will such power. I remind the House that Japan is under an obligation, according to the terms of the peace treaty, to enter into negotiations for an agreement in respect of fishing rights if it is called upon to do so by any one of the parties to the treaty. Australia, of course, will exercise that right. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition was wrong when he said that the Governments of the United States of America and Canada had secured from the Japanese, prior to the signing of the peace treaty, an agreement which entirely prohibited the Japanese from fishing in waters contiguous to the west coast of the North American continent. My advice is that the agreement placed limitations upon the quantity of fish that could be taken from those waters by the J apanese and probably also upon the period of fishing and the area in which fishing operations could be conducted. The Government considers that this bill is essential to its plan for the conservation of Australian fishing resources and is a necessary preliminary step towards the negotiation of agreements with foreign countries.

122,Mr ANTHONY,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE, That the bill be now read a second time.,35
123,Mr CALWELL,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"Melbourne) [4.56] The introduction of this short amending bill bas been made necessary because, in the opinion of the Government's legal advisers, the power of the insurance commissioner, under section 19 of the Life Insurance Act, to refuse registration to a company that wishes to enter the field of life insurance is not sufficiently wide. At least two companies that are already engaged in other forms of insurance are known to have such heavy expense rates that it would be unfair to the insuring public to allow them to obtain automatic registration as life insurance companies. Under the act as it now stands, the insurance commissioner would be required to grant them registration. The original life insurance legislation introduced in 1945 by the Chifley Government represented the first attempt that had heen made in 45 years of federation to enact Commonwealth legislation for the protection of the general public in all matters associated with life insurance. viously, life insurance was regulated by State legislation, which differed widely. In some States, particularly New South Wales, there was virtually no protective legislation. The Victorian Parliament, in 1986 or 1937, gave effect to the recommendations of a royal commission on life insurance that it had established, Strange as it may seem, all the recommendations of the commission were adopted in full. It was one of the few royal commissions of which that can he said. The Chifley Government incorporated the same principles in its legislation in 1945, and, up to date, the act has worked remarkably well. Persons who wish to invest their money in life insurance premiums for the benefit of their dependants and their heirs are able to buy insurance at a reasonable rate. Premiums are fixed according to the average period of expectation of life determined by the last preceding census. Surrender values and paid up policies are provided for. In every respect, the act is one of the best pieces of legislation governing life insurance in any part of the world. However, the Government has now discovered a weakness that could been foreseen in 1945. It proposes that any insurance company which is not until already registered for life ifr. Calwell. poses but which wishes to engage in that class of business shall not be granted registration automatically and that the Treasurer shall have the right to refuse registration on the recommendation of the insurance commissioner if in the opinion of the commissioner, its expenses of management are excessive. It is not commonly realized that in some departments of life insurance offices, particularly in the industrial departments, the expense ratio has always been high. In the 1930's in Victoria as well as in other States, some companies had expense ratios of over 50 per cent., and some even 60 per cent. It should be noted that head offices of most of those insurance companies were situated in Sydney, and that there was"" no legislation on the New South Wales statute-book that gave any protection in this regard to the people of New South Wales. But the companies had to conPre- form to such laws as were enacted in the States and particularly in the State of Victoria, where they had to conform to that splendid law enacted in the late 30's. One of the best insurance companies, the Australian Mutual Provident Society, had an expense ratio of 28 per cent, in its ordinary department and 42 per cent, in its industrial department. I think that the Government is to be commended for trying to protect the general public and, as imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I congratulate it on following the general lines of the legislation that was so excellently initiated by the Chifley Government.

Debate resumed from the Oth October, 1951 (vide page 403, Vol. 209), on motion by Sir ARTHUR FADDENT h at the following paper be p r in t e d : G o l d P o U c y - Minister i a l Statenient. Mr JOHNSON CKalgoorlie) [5.18] This item concerns the gold-mining induscrash. try and a ministerial statement that was AYES. made to the House by the Treasurer (Sir Hushes, W. M . Hulme, A. S. Arthur Fadden). In that paper, the Treasurer stated that there had been a substantial change in the policy on gold, Kent Hughes, W. so that the International Monetary Fund might relax its conditions in regard to MCBride. P. A. the sale of gold. I wish to emphasize MCColm. M . L . that the position of the gold-mining indusMCLeay, J. MCMahon. W. try is not a happy one because of a state of uncertainty as to what the future holds for it. That applies not only to the gold-mining companies. The business people of the gold-mining districts and Timson. T. F. the workers in the industry bave a vested Townley, A. G. interest in its welfare. The workers who have been engaged in gold mining for many years have all their property in Tellers: the district where the industry operates. It is too early to say that the relaxation of the conditions for the sale of gold on NOES. the open market through certain channels will prove of great assistance to the industry. It came into operation only a few months ago. There is little evidence yet to show whether it will be of value Morgan, C. A. A. Peters. E. W. or not, but I know that a number of men who have been interested in gold mining are doubtful whether it has any value to Tellers: the industry. Daly. F. M . During the Chifley Government's term of office, its policy was to place the gold mines in three categories. They were the producing mines, the mines that were on a marginal balance and the non-productive mines. The last two were heavily subsidized. That policy bas been abandoned, and many mining companies are spending substantial sums in trying to establish the industry. They are waiting for a lead from the Government. The Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) was good enough to hand to me the other day a statement setting out the operations of the International Monetary Fund, but there was little in it to encourage enthusiasm as to the future. It is generally accepted throughout Australia that the gold-mining industry is of great economic \alue to GOLD. Western Australia. I am disappointed with the statement that was made by the Treasurer. I cannot find anything new in it, nor does it offer any definite policy for the future. Many miners feel so uncertain about it that they are prepared to sell their property and move elsewhere if they can get a job, rather than risk a The Government is not' acting honestly when it leaves people in such state of uncertainty. It should do sometax thing to assist the non-productive mines. The owners are spending hundreds of thousands of pounds in various and are maintaining a substantial population without producing one ounce gold. If people are enterprising enough to develop the country on those lines, and therefore advance the Government's own policy of decentralization, the vernment should help the industry. In 1949, the Prime Minister promised that if he was returned to office his vernment would provide some lasting permanent assistance to the gold-mining industry.",38
137,Mr WARD,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"How are the non-producat ing mines keeping going? Mr JOHNSON"" - They are kept going by money provided by the companies which develop them. Companies are formed and funds are obtained from the shareholders. The men who are in that terested in those mines go into the interior to develop isolated and abandoned mines and they should be encouraged by the Government in accordance with the pledge that was given by the Prime Minister 1949.",39
138,Mr KEON,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"Yarra) [5.28] - In his statement, the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) dealt with the policy which allowed a certain percentage of the gold to be sold on the free world principle market. That included an announcement that the tax exemption that was previAustralian ously granted to the industry was to extended to cover that percentage of outafter put which was sold overseas at a greatly enhanced price. It is strange that when tax exemptions are granted, they are given to the people who own the mines and who have put money into them, not to the workers who work in the mines and produce the wealth and the dividends. I do not know why that is so. If the Government grants a tax exempindustries tion to those who get dividends from the gold mines, why is not the worker who engaged in the industry equally entitled to it ? If the industry is of such a that labour and capital have to be replies attracted to it, and if the Government proposes to grant capital and exemption from tax on the money that it earns, a similarly the worker should be granted a exemption on his earnings. I regret that the Government did not take that step when it permitted the sale of gold centres overseas at a higher price. Whilst I concede that gold has of its place in our scheme of things when the Government has dissipated our overseas balance so recklessly, nevertheless one cannot help contrastGoing the treatment given to the goldmining industry in connection with taxation with the treatment given to the Goagricultural industry. At the same time and as the Government takes away the 40 per cent, initial depreciation allowance, which operated for the benefit of the farmer, who produces something that is least as urgently required as gold, it contines the tax-free exemption that it has granted to the gold producer. I am not arguing whether or not the gold producer should not have the benefit of that tax-free exemption, hecause I know we wish to use our gold production to augment our overseas balances. At the same time, we certainly need food as urgently as we need gold in order to augment those balances and to feed in our people. But when farmers' organizations put a case to the Treasurer that some differential treatment should be allowed in relation to taxes on primary production, they are told that it simply cannot be done because it would establish a new and dangerous in taxation. All I can say is that I am astonished to find that the Oountry party accepts such be a statement from the Treasurer, who, all, is its leader. What the primary producers have asked for can be done, and in fact it is already done in relation to the gold industry. If the Government were really concerned about encouraging but primary production and meeting the requests of the members of one of its constitutent parties, it could establish a system of tax-free exemptions for rural just as easily as it has done so in the case of the gold-mining industry. is I hope that the members of the Australian Country party will not take this nature nonsense from their leader when he to their representations in relation to the tax liabilities of primary producers, but will show some backbone and will stand up and fight for similar treatment to be given to farmers as has already been given to gold producers. lionorable member for Mallee (Mr. Tunbull), who has just interjected, says that it is just a joke. I am not astonished that he considers it a joke, because he has never yet been fully seized of the importance of the primary producer to this country, and I do not believe he ever will be. The next point I wish to make is that some gold-producing companies, particularly in Queensland, work ore that is also a source of sulphur, a material that is vital for the production of superphosphate, which is in short supply and will be in shorter supply in the near future. However, if those companies produced sulphur from the same ore as that from which they produce gold, they would lose their entitlement to the tax-free exemption. If the honourable member for Mallee, who is interjecting again, would listen to me and later make some representations to the Treasurer about this matter, he would be doing something more useful than he is doing by chattering away while I am speaking.",39

144,Mr KEON,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"May I ask him why gold-mining companies which fill a national need by producing sulphur from the same ore as that from which they produce gold should, by so doing, place themselves in a disadvantageous position in respect of the tax-free exemption. I understand that companies producing gold would lose their entitlement to that exemption if they produced sulphur from the same ore, as they could easily doIn other words, the Government is purThe suing a policy which puts a premium on the non-production of a commodity that is vital to our primary production. One would have thought that, in thetime that has elapsed since this sessionbegan, the Government would have had an opportunity to correct that anomaly,, if it intends to correct it at all. I invite the Treasurer to tell the House what the Government intends to do about it, and also to give to the primary producers",40

147,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"MCPhersonTreasurer) [5.36] - m reply-There isreally nothing material to which I need reply. The honourable member for Yarra. (Mr Keon) has continued his tactics of endeavouring to cast on the Australian Country party responsibility for everything that is wrong. If there is one thing that the Australian Country party is responsible for it is for the basicprinciples that have led to the economic well-being of the rural producers of Australia. The paper which we are debating refers to a modification of a former arrangement whereby the gold-mining industry was restricted, as a result of the decisions of the International Monetary Fund, in respect of the sale of gold. Those conditions have been relaxed to such a degree that the gold-producing members of the fund areallowed to dispose of their gold on the free market. I had conferences with tha accredited representatives of the goldmining industry throughout Australia, and I can say that the Government has done for the industry exactly what it requested should be done. I should be surprised to learn that any dissatisfaction exists in the industry in connection with the Government's policy in relation to it. The operation of the tax-free exemption provision is a mere extension of a concession that the gold-mining industry has hitherto enjoyed. . Mr Ward - What ahout the workers in the industry?",40
148,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"I have yet to learn that the wages and conditions of workers in the gold-mining industry, and other industries, are not fixed by the method of arbitration, but the returns of gold producers are not fixed in that manner. When honourable members opposite interject and try to make party political capital out of this matter. [Quorum formed.""] When I was so - abruptly interrupted I was proceeding to state that it was arrant humbug for honourable members opposite to endeavour to make party political capital out of the fact that this Government has differentiated in relation to taxation by exempting the profits of the gold-mining industry - and not the wages of the workers in that industry.

151,Mr CASEY,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"La Trobe-Minister for External Affairs) [5.42] - This debate arises from a statement that was made by the Prime Minister (Mir. Menzies) in relation to Middle Eastern affairs generally, which he delivered in the House on the 16th October of last year. I made a statement recently in the House on a variety of matters connected with international affairs, amongst which I dealt with Middle Eastern affairs. That statement brought my report to the House on that important part of the world reasonably up to date. Since then the only event of signal importance that has occurred in the Middle East has been that the former Prime Minister of Egypt, Aly Maher Pasha, has been replaced by His Excellency Naguib Hilaly Pasha, who has now held office for slightly more than a week. It is too early yet to make any reference to any trends that may develop out of the new Prime Minister's administration. I therefore have nothing useful to add to my previous statement to the House. The Government is kept fully informed of Middle Eastern affairs through our representatives in Cairo and also through the office of the Department of External Affairs in London.

154,Mr BEAZLEY,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"Fremantle) [5.44] The papers on native welfare that we are now debating were long and serious statements, just as other papers that we have had on this subject have been. Any honourable member who studies the situation that has existed over the last five years will come to the conclusion that, in common with all the other statements on the subject made by any government, this statement means exactly nothing. I mean that no change takes place as a result of the statement in the condition of the aborigines, particularly in the Northern Territory. Whilst we alw as get in these statements 7 a plethora of principle, we also get a minimum of action. That is true of this report. At a scientists' congress that was held at Brisbane about eighteen months ago, Dr Cook read a paper on native health. Having regard to the facts that it revealed, it was one of the most brutal papers that could have been read on the subject. Dr Cook, who was speaking to a critical audience, described the natives of the Northern Territory and Australian aborigines generally as centres of infection. The time has arrived when papers that are tabled by the Minister should set out evidence of a definite programme. They should reveal facts, such as the number of doctors who have been appointed to a real medical staff to deal with native health. Honourable members, regardless of party affiliations, are tired of having presented to them papers of the kind that we are now discussing. We require to be supplied with evidence of a programme which, if it is to mean anything, must clothe itself in physical facts. We should be informed about the setup of an actual organization that is really capable of doing something at the minimum level, which is the health level, for our native people. The paper now before us is similar to those that have been tabled in this House during the last twenty years. Honourable members will recall the Bleakley report which referred to native health, tuberculosis, and lack of training for half-castes. The Thompson report, which was published ten years ago, was couched in similar terms. Neither of those reports meant anything at all insofar as a change of government policy was concerned. Although the present Government has been in office for only two years, I direct the attention of the House to its record in respect of native affairs. On three occasions I asked the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) whether he would set up a health organization in the Northern Territory, and on each occasion he merely replied that he was conferring with the States on that matter. The States have no authority and no responsibility in the Northern Territory; but the Minister thought that that reply was adequate. Subsequently, I changed the line and asked him whether new Australian doctors could be appointed to posts in the Northern Territory in precisely the same way as such doctors have been appointed in New Guinea. ' After all, the non-registration of qualified new Australians as medical practitioners is a sham. It is due not to lack of qualifications but to a trade union principle. Australian doctors do not want too many doctors in practice in this country. However, if the Government, because British doctors are not available for appointments to such posts, can enable new Australian doctors to practise in New Guinea in positions in which they are responsible for the. health and lives of both whites and natives, why cannot new Australian doctors be appointed to posts in the Northern Territory to care for the health of the natives? The Minister for Health has-evaded giving a real answer to questions that I have addressed to him on that point. I do not speak accusingly, because I do not think that any government in the history of Australia has ever got really excited about the problem of native health. Periodically, humanitarian and church organizations have taken up the matter. But it has been merely a case of some officer being sent to the territories to make a survey just as was done when the Bleakley and Thompson reports were furnished. Dealing with the problem of the prevalence of yaws among aborigines Dr Thompson, in his report which was made fifteen years ago, said that the affliction could be remedied by a simple course of injections and that as far as he could ascertain the natives were willing to subject themselves to the injections. Indeed, they coined a native term to describe the injection. Dr Thompson did not think that it would be difficult to set up an organization to carry out that work. Dr Cook, in a scientific paper that he wrote recently, made similar criticisms. Whilst I do not claim to be thoroughly informed about this matter, I assume that medical doctors would know their own fields and that when they made certain recommendations they would know what they were talking about. It would, indeed, be a change if instead of the kind of ministerial statements that have so far been presented to the House we were given reports that would indicate future Government policy and give definite facts about some organization that had actually been set up to handle the problem of native health. We want reports that contain statistics of treatment, because if the job is to be done somebody must be treated. A worthwhile survey of the problem would show that some improvement had been effected. I have no intention of attacking the Minister for Territories (Mr Hasluck). Indeed, long before he ever thought of entering politics he disclosed an excellent approach on his part towards this problem. I submit that an increased appropriation should be made in respect of this section of his department for the purpose of establishing an organization to cope with the problem of native health. If the Government cannot recruit Australian doctors with the requisite qualifications, it is time that it enlisted the serviees of highly qualified new Australian doctors, because it has complete authority over the registration of doctors in the territories that it administers.",42
155,Mr NELSON,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"Northern Territory) [5.52] - I agree with what the honour the able member for Fremantle (Mr. Beazley) has said, and I shall not repeat his remarks. I propose to refer only to that section of the report that deals with the problem of mixed blood. The problem that arises in relation to full blood, including the education of the natives and fitting them to take their place in the community, is a long-range proposition; but the problems in relation to mixed blood, particularly the problem of giving them rights to which they are justly entitled, can be dealt with immediately. The Australian community has every reason to be ashamed of the injustice that it has inflicted upon these people. It is true that under existing laws natives of mixed blood can be exempted from the provisions of ordinances that apply to aborigines and thus bc enabled to enjoy, as a right, the privileges that are enjoyed by white Australians. At present, the onus is placed upon the person concerned to prove that they have the right to full citizenship that is enjoyed by their white brethren. That right should be mads available automatically to natives of mixed blood. To-day, they are placed in a humiliating position. They are liable to pay income tax and also to conscription for service in the defence of Australia. Yet, they are still denied rights inherent in full citizenship. The Parliament cannot possibly justify that position. A male of mixed blood is entitled to vote at general elections. Indeed, after he reaches the age of 21 years, he is obliged under penalty to vote as an ordinary elector. If natives of mixed blood are deemed capable of performing these duties and are also under an obligation to perform tbem they are obviously entitled to the rights and privileges of full citizenship. I make this plea, on behalf of not only natives of mixed blood now living in our midst, but also unborn generations, because the latter will feel to a greater degree the humiliating position in which natives of mixed blood are placed today. That humiliation will be felt more acutely as the barrier of colour tends to disappear in succeeding generations. I again urge Government to remedy this injustice immediately, not only in our own interests, but also in the interests of humanity. Considerable discontent exists among the coloured community, not only in the Northern Territory, but also wherever they may be found throughout Australia. They are now asking for rights to which they are justly entitled, and I believe as a white community we should make those rights available to them, not only out of a spirit of generosity, but also oh the ground of natural justice. In this matter the Australian Government should give a lead to the States by granting to natives of mixed blood in the territories that it controls full rights of citizenship which have been denied to them for many years.",43
156,Mr HASLUCK,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"Curtin-Minister for Territories) [5.56] - in reply-On behalf of the Government, I express appreciation of the manner in which honourable members have approached the matters that have arisen from the report that I have tabled.",44

158,Mr SPEAKER,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,A quorum was called for less than half an hour ago.,44
159,Mr HASLUCK,COLLECTIVE MEASURES COMMITTEE,"The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen), who led the debate on behalf of the Opposition, spoke in appreciative terms about the report that has been tabled and indicated that with very few exceptions members of the Opposition were prepared to deal with the problem of native welfare as a matter of national importance that should be divorced from party politics. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) made certain criticisms. Whilst I appreciate the force of a good deal of what he said, I point out that this report does not purport to be a survey of administrative action. It has been made as a result of a conference that the Australian Government initiated between Commonwealth and State representatives with .a view to drawing up a programme of action. The report does not purport to give a review of what has been done. It sets out a programme of action in which the Commonwealth and States have agreed to take certain steps in their respective administrative spheres during the coming year. The honourable member for Fremantle referred to the report that had been furnished by Dr Cook. on. Cook collaborated with other Commonwealth officers in the preparation of that section of this programme of action which sets out in some detail matters with respect to native health. He was one of the authors of that section of the report that which deals with the health matters to which the honourable member has referredI was very pleased to hear the remarksthat the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) made. One of the most encouraging and heartening signsto-day in Australia so far as native welfare is concerned is that persons who» have lived in the Northern Territory and have been in daily contact with nativesand people of mixed blood are among the stoutest champions of the rights of our native people. Contrary to the impression held by some people in the southern parts of Australia, a veiy large number of the people in the Northern Territory are today sympathetic towards the future of the natives and have constructive ideasregarding the best means of helping them. It is also true, of course, that there arestill some who discuss the problem without sympathy. However, it would bequite wrong to imagine that the people of the north who know the problem best do not wish to see great improvements made. In fact, since I took office, I have found great encouragement in the attitude of the people of the north? and, in contrast, have found that i » the southern areas of Australia, whilst it is true that many advocates of natives'' rights have both experience and understanding of the subject, many persons whoclaim to be most certain of what should be done for aborigines and people of mixed blood have not first hand knowledge of it. I welcome the remarks of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, and I assure him that what he said in relation to the rights of the people of mixed blood accords with the accepted policy of the Government which is endeavouring to ensure that all persons living in Australia shall have the privileges of citizenship as a right and that such a right shall be withheld from them only if , by reason of their present conditions, it be found that special arrangements areneeded for their guardianship lage during a transitional period. assure him that the Government will give serious consideration to the representations he has madeQuestion resolved in the negative.",44

171,Mr JR FRASER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Australian Capital Territory) [8.4] - I direct the attention of the House to a condition of inequity in the Australian Capital Territory which, I consider, lies within the power of the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Kent Hughes) to correct. For some time there has existed in Canberra an organiza- the ranks. tion known as the A.'C.T. Hire Car Proprietors' Association. For several years, every hire car proprietor in the territory was a member of that organization. ""Within recent years, the association, the approval of the Department of the Interior, had telephone 'boxes erected on the several hire car ranks. The telephones were leased to the hire car proprietors' association and its members had the exclusive use of them. That system worked satisfactorily until about halfway through last year, when one member of the association, having fallen out with his comrades, resigned officially from it. A.s a result of that decision, he was debarred from using the telephones at the hire car ranks. The A.C.T. Hire OatProprietors' Association, quite legally properly, placed locks on the telephones so that only its members, who were provided with keys, could use the instruments. The effect of that move was to deprive the non-member of the association of the full use of the hire car ranks which, as I have pointed out, were established and are maintained by the Department of the Interior. I do uot cavil at the decision of the association to place locks on the telephone boxes, but I do take exception to the condition which so limits the activities of a man who has been granted a licence to operate as a hire car proprietor. When the ranks were provided with telephone boxes, the public in the Australian Capital Territory were persuaded by newspaper and radio advertisements to discontinue the practice of telephoning individual hire car proprietors, and to use the numbers of the several hire car ranks. The hire car proprietor affected by this decision approached me, and claimed that his living, and his right to make full use of the hire car ranks, were being limited. I had several discussions with him and also with officials of the A.C.T. Hire Car Proprietors' Association at that time, and with the responsible officers of the Department of the Interior. The general decision among* them was that the best way in which the position could be resolved would be for the hire car proprietor concerned to rejoin the association so that, once again, all the hire car operators would be able to use the telephones on Possibly, the hire car proprietor to whom I refer is an irascible and perhaps a litigious man, but he did agree to sink his pride and rejoin the association, on with the understanding that he would be welcomed back as .a member and that the position would be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. He made an application to the association for re-admission; it was dealt with at a meeting of the association last night. The application was rejected by one vote. The position now is that this man, although he is a registered hire car proprietor and holds a licence from the Department of the Interior, is denied full use of the facilities provided by the department for the use of hire car proprietors and the and general public. I do not hold a brief for the hire car proprietor concerned or for the A.C.T. Hire Car Proprietors' Association, and I am critical of neither one nor the other, but I believe that the decision that was taken last night by the association points to the need for action by the Department of the Interior. Regulation 26 of the Motor Hire Car Regulations, published in volume 2 of the Laws of the Australian Capital Territory readsWhere more than one public hire car is upon a public stand the vehicle nearest to the telephone box on such a public stand shall, unless the person hiring selects a particular vehicle, have a right to the hiring. I contend that any man who is not a member of the association is denied that right, because the telephones are the property of the association and quite rightly or quite legally, it has decided lock the boxes and provide only its members with keys to open them. Therefore, a man who is not a member of the association is now denied the right to make full use of the public ranks, which are maintained by the Department of the Interior, and to gain a full living from the licence that he holds from the deparment. I hope the Minister for the Interior will examine the matter, following the rejection of the man's application for re-admission to the association, and ascergramme tain whether any action can be taken to rectify the position generally.",46

It is an important statement by the Minister for Social Services (Mr. Townley) on the termination or repudiation of certain obligations that had been entered into by the Government with returned servicemen. It is perfectly true that the Minister made a statement a few days ago in which he announced a mitigation of the effect of that repudiation in a few instances; but the real issue is that finance was refused for the completion of the annual profor the benefit of returned servicemen under the War Service Homes Act.",47

Indeed, my only wish is to accelerate the discussion on this subject. The hour is early. We have ample time to discuss the subject of war service homes, which is of general importance. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is almost scurrying away from this matter of paramount importance. I do not know of any occasion in the history of this Parliament when a similar incident has occurred. When item 11 is reached I propose to move an amendment with the object of directing the Government to continue to grant assistance for war service homes until the end of this financial year. I do not know what view will be taken on that amendment by the House, but it is well known to honourable members that an acute division of opinion has occurred in the ranks of the Government itself on the subject.",47

A most serious position has developed in relation to the housing of ex-servicemen, and I want to direct the attention of the House, as is my right during an adjournment debate, to the facts of that position. During the last six months, the planned policy of the Government in relation to the disposition of funds for the housing of ex-servicemen has had the most grave consequences. In the first place, the parsimonious Treasury allotted a certain sum for this purpose, but that fund has been exhausted, and ex-servicemen who, by their own skill, have succeeded in finding houses for sale that have been occupied previously and which, therefore, are classified under the regulations that relate to war service homes as being ""not new """,48

191,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Order ! I am not concerned with assisting either the Government or the Opposition. I am abso,48
192,Mr HAYLEN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I must reiterate the comment by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) that the Government is scuttling for cover after the protestations that it has made of undying fealty to ex-servicemen. It lacks the intestinal fortitude to stand up to the Opposition and debate this issue. There is plenty of time available. We hav.e to-night and tomorrow, and the Opposition is prepared to stand up and contest this issue with the Government man to man. The Government is merely taking advantage of the processes of the House in order to make it impossible for us to argue our case. I am completely hemmed in by th') spears of the Government so that I cannot state my point of view to the House. All that I can do is to state the particular complaints that I have received from electors whom I represent. I refer to those complaints now. I have received a letter from an elector who has been in grave difficulties with the War Service Homes Division. This is a departmental matter that I refer to the Minister for Social Services (Mr Townley) for his consideration. The file number of the letter that this man has received is "" JE / ""-and the emphasis should be on the stroke because any ex-serviceman who has anything to do with the War Service Homes Division is likely to be stricken- f 4477RN "". It is addressed to an ex-serviceman at Dulwich Hill, Sydney, who, in October last received a message from the division directing him to present himself immediately with £682 14s. 7d. in his pocket. He was informed that, upon the production of the money, a house would be prepared for him forthwith. The man obtained the money with some difficulty and paid it to the division. He was told that the land on which the house was to be erected had been surveyed, and he waited happily for further news. Incidentally, he was told that these days everybody ought to have £700 available! In January of this year he was again called by the division and asked, because of rising costs, to provide an additional sum of £106 5s. 5d. Thus, the Government's planning has imposed hardships in two ways on ex-servicemen who wish to obtain houses. First, the Treasury restrictions on credit make it necessary for an applicant to provide a large sum initially. Secondly, delays involve him in increasing expenditure because of the effect of rising prices. In due course, this man took his wife and family to Miranda, where the house was to be built, and found that not a stone had been turned. What was the need for such urgency on the part of the War Service Homes Division in demanding money? The telegram that he received in October of last year directed him to present himself within 24 hours with almost £700 in cash. N'o contract has been let for the construction of the house and now fresh tenders have been called. The War Service Homes Division has no intention of proceeding with the construction of those planned blocks of houses at Miranda hecause it cannot obtain contracts for their erection. Why did it not tell this ex-serviceman It should have informed him that the [30] whole show had gone up in smoke:- - It has no intention of building many of the houses for which it has made arrangements with applicants, or of financing the purchase of houses",48
193,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Order ! The honourable member is departing from a - particular case and entering upon a general discussion of war service homes.,49
194,Mr HAYLEN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"My remarks, Mr. Speaker, merely constitute a paraphrase of the letter that I have received from the man. The second case that I have in mind is that of Ronald Archibald Davis, of 155A Denison-street, Dulwich Hill . This young man lives in a house occupied by eight persons. He has a wife and one child, and he has tried by all means at his disposal to obtain more suitable accommodation than he has at present. He located a house, for sale at Heme Bay, not far from the housing settlement there. He was told that an amount of £700 would have to be paid as a deposit. The negotiations were of such a nature, he has informed me, that it was necessary for him to conclude the deal swiftly. Otherwise there would have been no sale. The tentative contract would have been ' cancelled by the vendor. Last Monday the vendor notified him that, unless the remainder of the purchase money was produced, the sale would be cancelled. The deposit of £700 was in jeopardy. The ex-serviceman immediately approached the War Service Homes Division and asked that financial aid be expedited, but he was bluntly told that no more money could be made available for houses other than new houses and that he had been guilty of a careless gesture in.paying a deposit of £700. He thought that it was very strange to hear such talk from ofncials of the division merely because, in his anxiety to obtain a house for his wife and child, he had not consulted them in the first instance. Because the Government will not honour its promise, he is in danger of having all the money that he has saved since the war whipped away from him. Those savings include his deferred pay and the war gratuity that was conserved for the purpose of so ? helping men to obtain houses. He has mentioned all these facts in a letter in which, he has made an .appeal to me, which now I make to the Minister for Social Services. This man is under notice of eviction from the temporary premises in which. he now lives under appalling conditions. As he has pointed out to me, his treatment, hy the War Service Homes Division is a poor reward for the honest, unswerving service that he gave to his country.. He has suggested that, if the Government is in a dilemma, it can escape only by providing more money. It should not let this dreadful situation remain in the air until the Parliament goes into recess so that it will be left to the decision of public servants.  That the question be n o w put .

HARRISON ) proposedT h at the House do now a d j o u r n . .. 53 Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [9.18]. .. 32 - I direct the attention of the Minister for Immigration (Mr Holt) to a matter of tremendous importance that concerns 21 the housing of Australian citizens. When the present immigration scheme was first formulated, I told the Premiers of the AYES. States that it would be their responsibility Howse, J. B. Hughes, W. M . to see that accommodation available to Australian citizens should not be disturbed because of the expected influx of immigrants. I also gave an assurance that no Australian would be disturbed Luck, A. W. G. in his employment. Unfortunately, no MCBride, P. A. State government has yet seen fit to pass MCEwen. J. MCLeay. .7. legislation in order to guarantee that Australian citizens shall not be disturbed in their domestic accommodation. Since I have been in Opposition in this House, and earlier when I was Minister for Townley. A. G. Treloar, T. .7. Immigration, I urged the Premiers to pass legislation to prevent any newcomer to. our shores from being able to buy a Tellers: property until he had been resident in Australia for a period of at least five Gullott. H . B. S. years. I also suggested to the Premiers, NOES. and I have advocated this course publicly, that any Australian who has been for two years, or longer, in occupation of premises should not be disturbed Luchetti, A. S. MCLeod, D . by those who buy property and try tc evict Australians in order to provide accommodation for relatives who are to follow them from overseas. Unless something is done to protect Australians Watkins. D . O. who occupy houses for which they have paid rent for ten, fifteen or twenty years, Daly. F. M . there will be a reaction against immigraFuller. A. N . tion which neither the Minister nor I would desire. I believe that all newcomers are entitled to a house and that, where necessary, they should be assisted to build houses; but they should not be allowed to buy properties and disturb Australians who are already in possession of accommodation.",52
215,Mr WARD,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,That .practice has been going on for some time.,54
216,Mr CALWELL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"That is so; and no State government has yet been prepared to take action to protect the interests of Australians and their right to remain in houses in which they have lived for a long time. I also find that some municipal authorities will not take action to see that overcrowding shall not take place in many houses in which newcomers are living and in which they are being exploited in the matter of rents by persons of their own blood. Far too many persons are living in small rooms and are being charged very high rents. That is not a good thing for the newcomers or fro m the viewpoint of the general health of the community. It is a condition of affairs that militates against the assimilation of newcomers. It has resulted from the readiness with which persons who are not of Australian birth but many of whom are British nationals can now buy and dispossess Australians of houses in which they are living. In such circumstances, there is a tendency on the part of newcomers to gather in pockets according to their former nationality. Whilst I have no objection to new Australians gathering together in small numbers because they speak the same language or to persons who were not born in Australia speaking their own language in this country and, under supervision, having newspapers printed J.M1 their native language, it would be a good thing from everybody's point of ,iew if newcomers were despersed to the greatest possible degree. The Minister is in possession of papers that relate to certain property in my electorate and is aware of the matters that I have mentioned. I ask him to make representations on this subject to the Premiers at the next conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. I certainly intend to take up the matter through the executive of the Victorian division of the Australian Labour party with the Premier of that State in order to protect the housing rights of Australians. Quite a lot of Australians are heing evicted because the houses in which they live are being sold over their heads. Unfortunately, many Australians are only too willing.to sell houses at fancy prices and have no objection to seeing their fellow Australians evicted fro m them. That practice is socially bad and idefensible in every respect. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that the tune, Majestic Fanfare, has been adopted recently by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in place of the great Australian anthem, Advance Australia Fair. I have been informed by a correspondent that the tune, Majestic Fanfare, has allegedly been arranged by an English composer, Vaughan Williams. My correspondent directs my attention particularly to the word "" arranged "" as it has been used by the chairman of the commission; and he also tells me that the tune Majestic Fanfare, so called, is identical with a tune that was used by the Germans during World War II . , in the announcement of special communiques when, for instance, German forces captured a town or defeated a section of the Russian army. If it were a good old Nazi tune, it is certainly not a good tune for the Australian Broadcasting Commission to use. It is nonsense to say that it has been arranged by an English composer if it is identical with a Nazi tune. It would be better for the commission to forget the pretence and play, say, L i l y of Marleane, or any other such tune.; but to substitute a Nazi tune for an Australian anthem is just the sort of thing I should expect from my knowledge of the niental outlook of some of the persons who play a part in running the commission. I am astonished that the Postmaster-General (Mr Anthony) was not aware of the facts that I have just mentioned. If hc were also Minister for Information, as I once was, he would have been aware of them. Now that he has been made aware of them he should take action to ensure that no more Nazi tunes shall be played by the Australian Broadcasting Commission under conditions under which a royalty is paid to somebody who, allegedly, arranged the tune, but, in fact, did not alter one note of it .",54

I am quite certain that no honourable member wishes Australian citizens to be removed fro m houses through any process of t h at kind, but I am alarmed at the policy statement put forward by the honourable gentleman as an authoritative spokesman, for the Labour party. He considers that legislation should be passed by the State parliaments lo prevent a new settler from purchasing a house - u n t i l he has been here for a period of at least five years. The honourable gentleman indicated that he would press his colleagues in the ! memVictorian Parliament to pursue that policy, and we all know how much' influence the Labour party has on the present Government' of that State. '-' ' I immediately repudiate such a statement of policy - -.. '('",55
230,Mr CALWELL,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,I referred eviction of Australians from occupied dwellings.,56
231,Mr HOLT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I accept the amendment that the honourable gentleman now puts forward. The whole problem requires more careful thought than possibly he has given to it. We in Australia cannot expect people to come here and accept all the difficulties that settlement in a new homeland brings with it while denying to them the opportunity^ which is one of the fundamental opportunities offered in any civilized country, to acquire their own. dwellings. I agree that we do not want newcomers to dispossess Australian citizens in order to acquire houses themselves, and, therefore, I consider this Crovernment and, indeed, this Parliament can serve the country better concentrating on the positive measures that can be taken to encourage housing instead of"" looking for an additional restriction that will make conditions even - more difficult for those who embark tflbe tremendously difficult business settling in a new country. I claim that I this Government has done a great deal in that direction, and my claim is based not on words but on actual results. I have before me an article that was lished as recently as yesterday on leader page of the Age newspaper, which, I thmk, enjoys the high respect of Opposuch sition members. The article bears the heading,"""" What the figures show"" the sub-heading, "" New houses overtaking the urgent demand "". The article states, in partSlowly but surely the rate of home building in Australia is narrowing the long standing gapbetween supply and demand. 'The article points out that the number completed houses in 1949-50 was 8 per cent more than in the previous year, that last year, the rate for 1949-50 had been improved by 20 per cent. The article continues The figures of the statisticians show 'while home building is still a long way the demand it is increasing in a ratio gives much ground for hope. The figures in the article reveal that 1948-49, 52,684 houses, including new flats were built; in 1949-50, 56,900 to the dwellings; and in 1950-51, the first complete year in which this Government was in office, more than 69,000 new dwellings. Up to the 30th June last-and this is a significant figure-83,722 houses were under construction compared with 68,000 in the corresponding period in the previous year, or an increase of 15,000 new houses in that period. That is not just a fortuitous result. This Government has recognized that, if it is to bring new settlers here, it must accept the responsibility for ensuring that they shall obtain accommodation and make their contribution to the problem of providing housing.",56
232,Mr WARD,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Has not the Government for any responsibility to Australian citizens that in the matter of accommodation?,56
233,Mr HOLT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"I inform the honourable by member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) that this Government has been able to provide more war service homes in two years than the previous record number in the history of war service homes construcupon tion. However, I do not propose to of develop that theme, because in doing so, should contravene. Mr Speaker's ruling. Thefiguresthat I have given for domestic housing speak for themselves. I wish to deal particularly with the pubpoint raised by the honourable member the for Melbourne about the purchase of houses by immigrants. I point out that persons have been required to make a contribution to the housing position. and Many of them have been under contract to the Government to work where required for a period of two years, and a substantial proportion of them have been placed in the timber, brick, cement and tile industries, which are directly related to housing. They also assist to build of houses that they may later occupy. That, in itself, has been an important direction and in which newcomers have been used during the first two years of their residence in this country. Europeans who come to Australia under the Commonthat wealth scheme are provided with accombehind modation. Other persons come here on which the nomination of a friend, relative or employer upon whom we throw the in responsibility of providing their accommodation. So, in order to relieve the new pressure on Australians in regard to the acquisition of homes, we have acted in various important directions, such as placing labour in places where it can do the most good, and in the industries that assist in the erection of homes. I shall not elaborate those matters because I believe that the facts that I have placed before the House speak for themselves. I hope that no political party, whether in the Commonwealth sphere or a State sphere, will try to impose upon new settlers restrictions so onerous that we shall discourage people from coming to Australia and helping us to develop this land and make it more secure. Australia is only one of many countries that are trying to attract new settlers at the present time, and I know of no other country that has placed upon the acquisition of houses the kind of restriction that the honourable member for Melbourne has recommended. I hope that his statement does not represent the settled policy of the Labour party, and that it will not be adopted before it has been carefully considered.",56
234,Mr WARD,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"East Sydney) [9.38] Although the Government has not made a definite announcement, it can be assumed that the Parliament will be closed for at least a few months. Therefore, I shall take this opportunity to direct attention to certain matters that I regard as of the utmost importance. I have not yet been able to raise them in the House during the few weeks it has been open. First, I shall refer to housing. I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) that the situation in regard to the purchase of new and occupied houses by new arrivals is completely unsatisfactory. A housing official in New South Wales informed me that he and his colleagues know to the day how long a new Australian has been in this country, because the moment the new Australian completes twelve months' residence, he applies for emergency accommodation. Nobody knows exactly Avhere be has been accommodated in the interim period. It is all very well for Minister for Immigration (Mr Holt) to read figures and passages from newspaper articles in an attempt to make it appear that the housing position is improving. Let him consider the position of one of the unfortunates who has been registered with a State Housing Authority for a long time! He does not hope to get a permanent dwelling; he is merely seeking emergency accommodation; yet he has to wait for years before it becomes available. It will be poor consolation to such a person to learn that the Minister considers that the housing position is improving. The State governments cannot provide emergency accommodation for many persons, a considerable number of whom are ex-servicemen. The Minister has spoken of the Government's obligation to new arrivals in this country. I do not blame the unfortunate individuals, who have been induced to come here, for the position, because they are human beings and must have somewhere to live; but the Government is to be condemned for having brought those people to this country, to add to the existing difficulties of the Australian community. A number of opinions has been expressed by experts about the housing lag, which has been estimated at times to be as high as 300,000 houses. The Government requires at least four years to overtake that lag, and that calculation does not take into account the provision of dwellings for new arrivals and young couples who will marry during that period. Therefore, tbose unfortunate people who are being dispossessed of their homes by new Australians with plenty of money must be in despair. Many of the persons who have been evicted are ex-servicemen. Whilst it is true that an ex-serviceman may make application to the War Service Homes Division, he is simply listed among those waiting for a house and, in fact in many instances he will be kept waiting for years. The housing shortage will become more acute as a result of the Government's credit restriction policy, yet the Minister has the audacity to claim that the position is improving. I do not consider that it is improving. In my electorate, people continually ask me whether I can help the them to obtain any kind of accommodation for themselves and their kiddies. Many of them live in basements, and the health of their children is being affected. It is an absolute scandal that the Government should seek to close this Parliament for some months while people are faced with such urgent problems. I now propose to refer to retrenchments in the Public Service. Honourable members have the right to ask questions without notice, or place them on the notice-paper, but my questions during this sessional period have been met with evasion after evasion on the part of Ministers. I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) a question about a matter, the answer to which would not require days or weeks of research. I wished to know whether it was a fact that ex-servicemen were being dismissed from government departments and were being replaced with female juniors. Many of those men had been employed by the Commonwealth for years as temporary officers. The Prime Minister replied that he had no knowledge of the matter, but would have inquiries made about it . I asked the question some days ago, yet I have not received an answer. I am in a position to say that many ex-servicemen, who have had many years' experience in various departments, have been dismissed and replaced with female juniors. One man whom I have in mind was employed in the records branch of the child endowment section of the Department of Social Services. He has heen dismissed and his position taken hy a female junior. The Minister for Supply (Mr Beale) is in charge of Commonwealth car pools in the capital cities. A direction has been issued for the elimination of overtime in that section of the department. Of course, that instruction not mean that economies will be effected by a reduction of the use of motor cars. It simply means that various hire car services are now engaged in running their vehicles after when they are required by ment officials and members Government. Those private services are being paid an exhorbitant rate for the use of their motor cars, and the Government has not effected an economy because the cost of hiring the private vehicles is greater than would have been the case had the CommonMr Ward. wealth service been continued. The employees of the Commonwealth motor car pools have not objected to working overtime, and, therefore, I see no reason for the change. However, this Government always prides itself on its confidence in private enterprise, and is eager to pass any plums over to the persons wbo make contributions to its party funds. The Minister for the Army (Mr . Francis) has informed the House that youths of eighteen years, when they complete their training under the national service scheme, are given the opportunity to decide whether they wish to join the permanent forces, which means, in effect, that they may be sent to any theatre of operations in any part of the world. That practice, in my opinion, is wrong. A boy of eighteen is not entitled to vote in Australia, and the official viewpoint is that he has not reached an age at which he is capable of making important decisions. But such young men are being induced to volunteer for service anywhere in the world by being deliberately placed in a position in which they would he embarrassed in front of their camp mates if they refused to do so. Many of them volunteer against the wishes of their parents and without realizing the possible consequences of their action. I believe that no person in the community should be called upon to make such a decision unless he has reached the age of 21 years or, alternatively, unless he has obtained motor the consent of his parents. It is scandalous that the Government should permit this practice to continue. does We have heard a great deal of boasting recently about what the Government is supposed to have done to assist the penprivate sioners. But the honourable meinber for Eden-Monaro (Mr Allan Fraser) exposed hours the hypocrisy of those vainglorious govern- claims when he pointed out that the perof the centage of the basic wage that is repretransport sented by the age pension today is probably lower than it has ever been previously. The position of pensioners today is desperate. I notice that the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) laughs. He is not worried by the problem of finding a way to maintain existence from day to day. This honourable gentleman, with his tax-free allowance and increased salary, declared in this House recently that the Government had gone to the limit with social services and could go no further. I a-n glad that the Minister for Social Services (Air. Townley) is in the chamber at present, because I shall expose the shocking state of affairs that now exists. A Brisbane newspaper publishes a column, "" Your Good Health, by Truth's Own Doctor"". Readers are invited to submit health problems for the doctor to solve. This is a summary of a letter that was written to the doctor by a pensionerHas (.mly toast for breakfast, as meat and eggs tun costly. Seeks advice regarding meat foods on market. The doctor replied in these termsI f a pensioner, and find meat and eggs pensive, want you go along any doctor you like and present pension card and get him to prescribe for you some Liquid Hepasol. This is free under pharmaceutical benefits act. Would be equivalent to eating those foods which too costly. Like you take one tablespoonful three times a day. It is all very well for honourable members on the Government side of the chamber to laugh, but the simple fact is that many unfortunate Australians cannot afford to buy meat and other important foods and are being advised by medical men to apply for special medicines under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.",57
235,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,59
236,Mr GULLETT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Henty) [9.48] - The remarks that I propose to make arise from those made by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward). The honourable member referred in a rather personal way to my tax-free income. That reference came very strangely from one who recently admitted to having no fewer than eight banking accounts. At least, whatever I may receive, it is not necessary for :ne to admit to judges that I make my incoine fortuitously by dint of my wife's making bets on horse-races, as the honourable member had to do not very long ago. I am amazed that this man has the effrontery to refer in personal terms to honourable members opposite him, especially in view of his astonishing record not only in public life, in which he has appointed near-criminals to responsible positions and has associated with criminals in a public way Mr SPEAKER,-Order !",59
237,Mr GULLETT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"It is all very well for you to say "" Order"" at this stage, Mr Speaker, but the honourable member has cast aspersions on the integrity of those who sit opposite him in this chamber, and I think it is high time that he heard one or two home truths about himself. The truth is that he is honoured by no man in this country.",59
238,Mr CURTIN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Not even by you !,59
239,Mr GULLETT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"There may be exceptions, like the honourable member for Watson (Mr Curtin), who will soon be with us no longer, not because of anything that we on this side of the House too excan do, but because of what those who ought to stand behind bim but do not stand behind him will do to him, as he will soon learn. It seems that he will not be endorsed by the Labour party as a candidate for re-election to this House. The honourable member for East Sydney made certain statements about the enlistment of soldiers and the inability of young men to judge for themselves. I am bound to say that, to a certain degree, I agree with the honourable member.",59
240,Mr DUTHIE,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Amazing !,59
241,Mr GULLETT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"It may seem so to the honourable member, but to me it is not a pleasing thought that many of those who are willing to fight for my defence at this time are less than twenty years of age. I am sure that every honourable member will agree with me in this respect. Australians have been let in for the obligation to keep their end up primarily by honourable members opposite. The Opposition has not questioned the necessity for us to defend our country and to take a stand alongside the other members of the United Nations in the conflict in Korea. However, it has displayed a marked reluctance to assist in the raising of forces for the defence of the country and for service on our behalf overseas. Therefore, I consider that the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney were utterly lacking in sincerity. A thousand Australians are at present on the way to Korea to fight for this land.",59
242,Mr CURTIN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,All of them working men's sons.,60
243,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Order !,60
244,Mr GULLETT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"But I agree entirely with the honourable member, Mr Speaker. They all are working men's sons. I ask the once great Australian Labour party, not in any critical fashion, what it has done to assist those working men's sons who are going abroad to fight for us.",60
245,Mr CURTIN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Muc h more than the Liberal party has done.,60
246,Mr GULLETT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"That is a cheap gibe. What has the Australian Labour party done to assist them? I say that, it has done absolutely nothing. It has not assisted the Government to raise defence forces. It has not assisted the Government to obtain better terms of employment for ex-servicemen.",60
247,Mr WARD,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,And it has not assisted the Government to evict them after they have returned to their country.,60
248,Mr GULLETT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,You have opposed the sending of Australian forces abroad.,60
249,Mr SPEAKER,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,Order ! The honourable member must address me.,60
250,Mr GULLETT,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Ea r be it from me to attribute such sentiments to you, whom I know to be a most loyal citizen, Mr. Speaker. I am referring now to those who are quite beyond the pale-traitor s and so forth. It is true, as the honourable member for Watson has said, that those who now fight for the country are the sons of workers. Let honourable members opposite now prove that they are on the side of those men by doing something to assist them instead of blocking every move that the Government tries to make in order to raise an adequate defence force for Australia.",60
251,Mr JAMES,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"Hunter) [9.55] - I take strong exception to the Government's decision to terminate the current series of sittings at this stage, especially in view of the present impoverished position of many Australians. The Government proposes to adjourn the House until after the Easter season, at which we shall commemorate the crucifixion of our Saviour. But many of us will go back to poverty and despair in our electorates. As a result of the action of this Government in permitting cheap overseas goods to enter Australia, 300 of my electors were dismissed last week and 300 more will be dismissed next week. Cheap rayon goods that were manufactured in Japan have been imported into Australia under the British preferential tariff because they were shipped from Hong Kong. Members of this Parliament have improved their own financial position by passing legislation that provides for the payment to us of higher salaries and allowances. But what of others whom we are supposed to represent? What of the pensioners? They have not been granted an increase of their miserable pittance. I shall not discuss the subject at length. I merely remind honourable members that we have helped ourselves, but have done nothing for the poorest people in t.he community. A serious housing problem has developed in the Hunter electorate. A former military camp at Greta, which accommodated 14,000 troops during World War II , is now being used to bouse 12,000 new Australians. It is a holding centre for the wives and children of immigrants who are employed elsewhere. Some of the men have been sent to Queensland, but many of them have been absorbed in the heavy industries of Newcastle. I have asked the Minister for Immigration (Mr Holt) to make use of two vacant blocks of huts at Greta to provide accommodation for at least some of these workers and their families. The Government should ask the New South Wales Government to institute a daily train service for these workers between Branxton and Newcastle so that they may live with their wives and children. Does not the Government want to promote happiness and contentment amongst these new Australians, many of whom suffered privation and brutal treatment under the nazi regime in Germany? I visited Germany in 1945 and I saw many such people who were then still living in the camps where Hitler's Nazis had persecuted and tortured them, because there was no other place for them to go after the Allies had taken control. The Parliament should remain in session hecause the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) has recently returned from abroad and proposes to make a very important statement to Cabinet next week. When will the Parliament be able to discuss this statement if we adjourn to-night? What are the proposed economies that the Treasurer intends to recommend to Cabinet? Will they usher in another depression? Many Australians will suffer desperate poverty over the Easter period and we should not adjourn at this stage. The Burlington and Bradford textile factories at Rutherford have been severely affected by the importation of cheap Japanese rayon goods. The Rutherford factory was a munitions establishment and it is still owned by the Australian Government. However, I suppose that the Government will soon dispose of it to private enterprise. Perhaps that is why the Government has caused trouble for the textile trade. By the end of next week, the number of dismissals from the Rutherford factory will reach a total of 600. But this House will be in recess. Nobody will then he able to say a word in protest. Motion (by Mr GULLETT) putThat the question be now put. The House divided. (MR, SPEAKER-HON . ARCHIE CAMERON.)

253,Mr CREMEAN,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"the General, upon not i c e1. Has he taken any action to institute au inquiry into the allegations of excessive and unwarranted profit made by advertising contractors for the classified section (""pink pages"") of the official telephone directory ? 2. If so, what is the nature of the action taken, what progress has been made, and have any findings been reached? 3. When do existing contracts for the classified section expire in each State? 4. W i ll he direct the department to abstain from approving future contracts until any contemplated or current investigation is completed and the findings available for consideration?",62
254,Mr ANTHONY,BILLS RETURNED FROM THE,"The answers the honourable member's questions are follows:1 and 2. Following on remarks made by the honourable member for Hoddle in the House on the 8th November, 1951, when he stated that the returns to the contractor in respect of all advertisements on the "" pink pages"" in the Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth telephone directories were in round figure* £906,000,. of which the department received only £143,500, the matter was investigated closely. My inquiries disclosed, however, that the figures quoted by the honourable member were very wide of the mark. A careful estimate based on the maximum authorized prices which may be charged to advertisers showed that the total amount which could have been received by the telephone directory contractors throughout the Commonwealth from clients for the insertion of advertising matter in the publications as to the order of £320,000 for the 1950 issue. Of this amount the department received £157,000. In connection with the Sydney and Melbourne directories, which include complete lists of business subscribers classified under their professional, trade and business headings, the amount paid by the advertising contract covered the printing costs and returned a good margin of profit to the department. Without these classified sections the department would have had to incur substantial additional expenditure on information, staff and facilities in the two cities concerned. 3. The contracts for the advertising rights in Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania will expire with the 105."" issue of the directories. 4. Before public tenders are invited for the advertising rights for a further period all aspects of the matter wil l be reviewed critically in the light of experience and prevailing conditions. Should it be decided to dispose of the rights to private enterprise all persons or firms interested will be encouraged to submit offers. POSTAL DEPARTMENT.
