1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA West Block Approval of Work Motion (by Ms Crawford), for Mr Howe, agreed to: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 31 May 1995; namely, a disabled access ramp and handrails on West Block offices, Parkes, ACT. LOAN BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 June, on motion by Mr Sciacca: That the bill be now read a second time.",11
2,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"I join the debate today on the 1995 Loan Bill supporting my colleagues who have castigated the government in trying to manage the accounts-the accounts which, according to the budget papers, look a bit shonky. The bottom line is that, when it comes to money, this government, like all other Labor Party governments over the past decade, cannot cut it and just cannot seem to get it right. Labor Party backbenchers come in supporting the executive of their party. They have been given a line. But I do not see many from marginal seats coming in and extolling the virtues of this issue. The reason is that they are embarrassed to put their name to the ongoing poor financial performance and management of this government. The issue of debt and its management is a high priority issue in the electorate. This bill is supposed to be a mechanical bill which allows the government to draw upon funds to pay for its operation. In other words, the government requires bills like this to cover its holes in consolidated revenue. This bill allows the government to borrow more money. That is not unusual, but the government does it quite often. During the 1980s we heard all sorts of people saying that greed was good. 'Irresponsibility is okay so long as we enjoyed ourselves' was the cry of many, including, it .appears, those on the other side. Greed could lead to many things, but in Australia it has led to a period of instability and huge losses of funds. We are considered by other countries to be not quite up to it when it comes to financial management, which is a shame. The reason for this assessment is that the lead that Labor Party governments provided during the 1980s was nothing short of corrupt. The Labor Party just cannot seem to manage money. Let us take, for example, the Labor government of Western Australia, formerly led by the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), which lost huge funds during the WA Inc. period. It was a notorious period in Western Australia in which a former Premier and Deputy Premier were gaoled for theft of funds. These former Labor politicians, holding the highest office in parliament in Western Australia, played fast and loose with the state's till, and that state is now trying to work its way through the quagmire of huge public debt. The government was sacked by the people who wanted better management of their money. Moving a little east, we see that the former Labor government of South Australia drove the State Bank into bankruptcy. The Bannon Labor government could not manage the funds and lost enormous amounts of taxpayers' funds in doing so. It was sacked by the people who wanted better management of their money . Moving even further east, we see that the former Labor government sent the state of Victoria into virtual bankruptcy. The CainKirner Labor government cost the Victorian taxpayer enormous amounts of public fundsa sad reminder that the Labor Party cannot be trusted to manage funds correctly. The government was sacked by the people who wanted better. management of their money, and they did this by selecting Liberal governments in South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. Moving north into New South Wales we witnessed the Labor Party sending its own organisation broke by entering into ridiculous property deals which have cost its organisation and members enormous amounts of funds. It tried to play the property game and failed miserably. Of course, the senior members of this organisation walked the corridors of this place and the employed officers have been transferred to the New South""Wales state government payroll. I am sure the taxpayers of New South Wales would be extremely happy about the failed officers of the Labor Party now drawing upon their taxes. The fact is that the Labor Party just cannot get the money management side of things right. The Labor Party has the worse history of any modem parliamentary experience in Australia in managing money; yet day after day its members walk into the chamber and say that they are on track, the figures are good, the OECD is terrific and our comparisons are just wonderful. But the fact is that the Labor Party and its apparatchiks and fellow travellers cannot be trusted with taxpayer funds because they continually let us down. I had cause to survey many areas of my electorate recently and the replies were very similar to the responses that came back from a survey my colleague the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) conducted in his electorate recently. If they are similar in Western Australia to what they are in New South Wales, then the assumption can be made that they are similar in all electorates. The message is quite clear: the Labor Party cannot manage money and the electorate is concerned about it. If this message is being heard in marginal seats of the ALP, we can be assured of one thing: on this issue alone the coalition will have a resounding success at the next election. The fear and lies so effectively used by the Labor",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,Order! The honourable member knows better than that.,12
4,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"The fear and distortion so effectively used by the Labor Party in the 1993 election will not work again because the electorate has become cynical of the promises they get from the Labor Party. They want or they are beginning to demand responsibility-responsibility from their Prime Minister (Mr Keating), not false promises. They want hope and a future based on a sound financial base, not one based upon debt and its poor management. . My research has shown that the biggest issue concerning the electorate is debt and the way it is being managed. The electorate rates the coalition as the only party which can provide the sound management practices which are required to bring back some sort of equity to all Australians. Mr Speaker, the fact that the government is looking for more borrowings should come as no surprise to you and the people of Australia. Racking up debt is the trademark of this particular government. Commonwealth public debt interest has increased a whopping 32 per cent-a figure increasing from $7.1 billion to $9.387 billion. Debt interest is on the way up. In other words, to those in the gallery, we spend $9 billion or thereabouts in interest every year. This, of course, is in stark contrast to Liberal managed states which will see the public debt interest decline from $1.1 billion to $0.6 billion in 1996-97. What a difference a vote for the Liberal Party can make in some of these states. The comparison with the Commonwealth is stark and frankly not very favourable. The simple fact is that this Keating Labor government cannot manage finances and the result is the explosion of Commonwealth debt. The $9.4 billion we will pay in public debt interest equates to over $1 million per day we pay in interest. Each and every day of the year we pay over $1 million. This $9.4 billion does not go to hospitals or roads and cannot provide Australians those much needed tax cuts that have been promised before. It is all going to the financial markets. Not one benefit from the expenditure of $9 billion goes to the Australian people. Members will recall that former Premier Kirner and former Premier Bannon both had problems with their banks. The Prime Minister seems to be following the Victorian Labor line of selling off the bank-in this case the Commonwealth Bank-in a desperate move to improve the figures. The government is selling off the cutlery, so to speak, to help it out of the financial difficulties we are now facing. But what sort of challenge are we facing? Most of the members opposite compare Australia to the G7 group, or the OECD or the other industrialised countries of the world. This is the modem cultural cringe they have: 'My bank account is better than your bank account and my figures are better than yours.' But we are not truly an industrialised country, therefore comparisons are a bit out of proportion. Sadly, if one views our performance with other countries, the shocking news is that we are honorary members of the Third World. When one thinks of the Third World, .the images we see are the poor and suffering of Africa. We do not naturally see other images. Some countries we may not think of are in fact in the Third World. These include Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile and perhaps even Malaysia. I say that we are honorary members of the Third World when it comes to financial ma-agement, and to support this claim I would like to present the following figures. The percentage of debt to GDP in 1984 for Australia was 15.9 per cent. In Brazil it was 39.3 per cent; Mexico, 47.9 per cent; Argentina, 30.3 per cent; Chile, a whopping 73.3 per cent; and Malaysia, 35.9 per cent. These were the figures in 1984, just at the start' of the Labor Party management of our country, and it showed we were performing pretty well. In 1992, the percentage of debt to GDP for Brazil-these are the most recent figures available-instead of being 39.3 per cent in 1984, .was 17.8 per cent; Mexico, instead of 47 per cent, was 22 per cent; Argentina, instead of 30.3 per cent, was 15.4 per cent; Chile, which was 73.3 per cent, was 15;7 per cent; and Malaysia, instead of 35.9 per cent, was minus 1.5 per cent of GDP in 1992. Australia in that same period has gone from 15.9 per cent of debt to GDP to 36.6 per cent. So in a period of 10 years we have gone past what the Third World countries were doing 10 years ago. Many of those opposite talk about private debt and assure us that it is private' debt which is the problem, but it is not. The South American countries I have just talked about are performing better than us. The banana republic that the Prime Minister spoke about 10 years ago is perhaps here right now. Unless we seriously address the growing problem, it will get worse and we will be. come a fully-fledged member of the Third World. It is time we started to get serious about our financial woes and begin the long march back to some sort of responsibility. But this will not happen under this government-or any Labor government, for that matter-because it just does not have the will or the initiative. The current account deficit has been over $12 billion for nine of the last 10 months. Every month we payout huge funds for interest on past foreign borrowings. In fact, every month our current account is over $1 billion before we even start trading-that is, $1 billion going out and paying past debts every month. It seems that all we are doing every month is adding to that debt. The task before the government is to structurally reduce the debt, to lift national savings and to reduce its borrowing program. But the government seems incapable of providing the leadership and management to make this happen. To back up these allegations, we need look no further than the budget this year. It is really a great con. We must reduce our expenditure; yet the government cut it by only $700 million. At the same time, the government has lifted up taxes by $2.3 billion. Then it swapped our public savings for private savings by selling our assets. Assets do not lift national savings. They do not do anything other than get some money into pay off the operational costs this year. In the budget there is no lift in national savings, which is what the crisis in financial management is all about. The government needed to cut its spending but was unable to do so. When it comes to management and making some of the hard decisions, the government is unable to. Even last week there were examples of the government not being prepared to make some savings. Last week we had two Auditor General's reports highlighting the continuing management incompetence of the government. One report showed that seven per cent Commonwealth work force-that is, some 10,000 officers-are non-operational. What are these 10,000 Commonwealth employees doing? No-one seems to know. The other report showed that the tax ment failed to collect $50 million it was due in tax. What is the government trying to here? It is clear that it does not know what work force is doing, whilst it is prepared to collect the money that it is due. Could you imagine a small business, for instance, operatwe ing like that-not knowing what your emper ployees are doing and not worrying about your receivables? The point is that a small business run like this would close down. reminds me of a similar experience of a former government minister who ran a sandmember wich shop. He did .not know what his staff were doing and he paid the ultimate price. I think the sandwich shop closed down, and paid the ultimate price of having a minister. He is not alone. The entire front-bench the Labor Party has no business experience all. In fact, the Prime Minister was sacked David Jones some years ago. One of the reasons he was sacked was that he was savings, arrogant and was never around the place when you wanted him. The attributes that saw him sacked then could also apply to him right now-he is a bit arrogant, and he is never around the place so that we can see him. When the country needs the Prime Minister, where is he? He is strutting the world stage saying how wonderful it is that he can fix Japan's problems; and he puts up the Finansecret cial Times saying, 'Look, France is following my lead here.' However, his manager at DJs did say that he was a good salesperson. All Australia know that the Prime Minister is a great salesperson: he is like a slick snake oil salesperson, but we do not wanta slick snake oil salesperson running our accounts. Remember when Slick told us that he was not going to increase tax? We must that slick salespeople will say and do anything to get the sale, and that is what the Prime Minister did at the last election: he us a deal, and then he welched on it. He gave usa cheque, but the cheque was returned of the marked 'Insufficient funds'. Mr Speaker, there is no need to remind you of the 1993 Dawkins horror budget-it was a real' shocker not only for the people of Australia but also for the Labor Party backdepartbench. But I should. remind you that the second stage of the indirect tax rises will fall do into place on 1 July this year. These taxes, its which it was promised to us at the last elecnot tion would not· go up, will go up on 1 July this year in the second stage of increases. So will have tax increases ranging from three cent to 10 per cent, increasing prices of consumables out in the marketplace and in the eleCtorates. But Slick did not stop at the last It election when he broke a few promises.",12
5,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Order! The honourable for Cowan wants to be a little bit careful. I have allowed him some latitude in his contribution today, but if he is referring to he members of this place he will do it in the to resign as appropriate way. .",14
6,Mr RICHARD EVANS,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"Thank you for of your guidance; Mr Speaker. The Prime at Minister even raised taxes in this year's by budget-this is after saying that he would not. The budget this year did not lift national. but it did increase tax. Company tax is up approximately 10 per cent; the Medicare tax is up approximately 10 per cent; the Prime Minister said he would permanently reduce sales tax to 15 per cent, but the tax on cars has been increased 30 percent. The building industry, suffering' from a sharp decline in 'demand-reminiscent of . 1990-has been bludgeoned with a Keating tax., adding about $1;000 to the average cost of a house. So all the promises about lowering the hardship for businesses, especialin ly small business, has been a great con. The . biggest con is the, way the government tries to explain the accounts. It says that we are in surplus, but in fact· we are in debt--:-a bit of creative accounting which complements the sales job that the. Prime Minister has put to remember the Australian people; The Labor Party does not know how to handle accounts, especially our savings and sold our current account. The Labor Party's solution is to abandon higher growth and the unemployed and to try to get imports simply by slowing growth in demand. It has virtually given up; it cannot fix the structural savings and the current account problems, it has given up. It has neither the will nor way to solve these problems. Its plan is low growth-too bad for those 750,000 . will Australians who have been made unemployed and those who are hidden amongst the statisthave ics. Low growth means low employment tunities, so we are on the roller-coaster again. The reason that the brakes are on is that the government does not have the courage to make some hard decisions. Cutting spending and lifting savings can be done in Australiaone has to look no further than the Liberal state governments to see the positive results of those governments. We must get our debt under control, otherwise we will leave our children a terrible legacy. Every time Australia records another current account deficit, we time. further erode our sovereignty. The Prime Minister talks about this concept, yet his talk is very cheap, for he is actively giving sovereignty away to foreign banks. The coalition is very clear about its commitment to the Austra:Iian people. We will not lift taxes, and we will control our spending. All areas of spending will be put through detailed assessment and examination. If there is not a clear purpose or benefit to the Australian people, the expenditure will stop. The budget papers will not hide or distort financia:I situation. The coalition will commission an audit of the Commonwea:Ith's finances as soon as we are elected by the people Australia. We will ascertain the· correct picture of our finances. The Labor Party wa:Iks away from the truth, and we can see evidence of this within budget this year. The coalition will be about real solutions and real decisions. The governlevy ment has failed. It has failed to bring credible budget. It has failed to tackle nationa:I savings in any meaningful way. It has failed to address its own spending. It has failed tackle the current account. It has failed to foundations for higher growth. It has failed adequately reform the labour market to maxigreater mise employment opportunities. It has failed down the Austra:Iian people. But what is more galling is that it has failed its own constituency. It now clings to power so for greed's sake. At the next election the the Australian people will pass judgment on the for Labor Party and their judgment, I am sure, be: failed! Let the Austra:Iian people elect a government that does have ideas, that does energy and does have the will to do what is required. Let the Austra:Iian people opporelect a coalition government. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor-Genera:I recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Gear) read a third NA BILL 1995 Cognate bill: NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Consideration resumed from 9 May. Second Reading",14
7,Mr GEAR,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1995 of proposes to amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the rate of Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent for the 199596 and later income years. The bill will also the increase the low income thresholds below which people will not be required to pay any and increase the upper thresholds for down a which special phasing-in rules apply. Medicare levy receipts as a proportion of Medicare outlays have fallen from over 30 per to cent in 1988-89 to an expected to 24 per cent lay in 1994-95. The adjustment to the rate will to ensure that Medicare levy receipts make a contribution to the cost of government health programs. The benefit to revenue of the increase in the Medicare levy is estimated to be $230 million in 1995-96, $240 million in 1996-97, $260 million in 1997-98 and $280 million 1998-99. The estimated cost of raising the low income thresholds will be $10 million in each of the years 1995-96, 1996-97, 199798 and 1998-99. The bill also makes a minor technical amendment to the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the upper limit threshold for trustees of a trust estate for the 1993-94 and 1994-95 financial years. There is no cost to revenue of these changes. NA BILL 1995 The Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995 will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the rate of fringe benefits tax in line with the change from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the Medicare levy rate commencing from 1 July 1995. However, to avoid two different rates in the 1995-96 FBT year of tax the rate to apply to the year commencing 1 April 1995 is to be a composite rate of 48.475 per cent. From 1 April 1996 and all later FBT years the rate will be increased to 48.5 per cent. The benefit to the revenue of the increase in the rate is estimated to be $5 million in each of the FBT tax years 1995-96, 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99. Full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bills to .the House.",15
8,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"I rise today to speak to the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1995. I note that, given their interdependence, this bill is being treated cognately with the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995. My colleague the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) will be concentrating his remarks on fringe benefits concerns. Let me say right now that the coalition will oppose this Medicare Levy Amendment Bill and will call for a division on it. We will do this because the budget increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent represents no less than another broken promise by Labor to the Australian community. It is another breach of faith that this government has dumped on the heads of the battlers of Australia-the working men and women who are not overly well off, who are struggling to make ends meet and who. are striving to raise their families. Let me share with the·House a press release dated 19 June 1994 issued by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) with the interesting title 'Claims of levy increase ridiculous says Lawrence'. It states: ""Claims in this morning's· newspaper that the Government is set to increase the Medicare levy are demonstrably untrue/Federal Health Minister, Carmen Lawrence, said today. ""There is no proposal to increaSe the levy and there won't be,"" Dr Lawrence said. ""Both the Prime Minister and myself have repeatedly ruled out any increase."" We know what the word of· the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is worth. Let me repeat that key sentence for the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) and his colleagues on the other side: 'There is no proposal to increase the 'levy and there won't be.' From a government that has consistently promoted the use of plain English in official communications, this sounds pretty plain to me and to anyone else who has heard the minister on the subject. Let us make no mistake about this: the ntinister. made her unequivocal statement on 18 June 1994, a month after Labor brought down its budget.. So, within the space of a single budget cycle, her word has been turned on its head. What this bill does, in the brief and matterof-fact way outlined by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his second reading speech, is tQ take yet another swipe at the battlers of Australia. People in the western suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney, in.the south of my own electorate, in other. capital cities and in the bush must be wondering where they are going to be hit next. . The raising of the Medicare levy is not just a broken Labor promise; it is a serious policy miscalculation. It takes and it gives back nothing in return. Let me explain. One of ·the myths that Labor has sold to the community with some success is that· we pay our Medicare levy and our health needs are taken care of. In other words, Labor has sold to the Australian people the false impression that the Medicare levy receipts cover the total cost of publicly funded health care-that the two sides of the Medicare budget in fact balance. Nothing could be further from the truth. If we look at the 1993-94 financial year, last completed financial year, to get a picture of just how the Medicare levy revenue compared with expenditure on health care benefits, both public and private, we find the following: in 1993-94, according to the 199495 budget papers, the final estimate of the Medicare levy collected by the government is $3,030 million-let us say $3 billion. This is actually less than the contribution income received by private health funds in the same period, which was $4,150 million, or about $7.2 billion all up. That is just the revenue side. On the outlay side, in the same period of 1993-94, the final estimate of Medicare benefits schedule payments was $5.4 billion: The final estimate for PBS outlays was $1,670 million and, just as important, the benefits paid out of private health funds in 1993-94 amounted to $3.5 billion. Simple arithmetic tells me this combined benefits outlay for 1993-94 is abbut $10.5 billion and it is another easy calculation to subtract that amount received through the Medicare levy from this total payout. The quick answer is that $7,400 million of benefits, or 73 per cent of the total public and private benefit outlays, are not funded by the Medicare levy. This does not take into account the many millions of dollars paid by people who directly pay for their own medical or hospital care. The government has always tried to sell the Medicare levy as' an essential part of its strategy to contain the costs of delivering health care. I do not dispute there is a need for reasonable action by government and private insurers to contain costs of private insurance as far as it is consistent with effective quality care and fairness. But I think the simple exercise I have just done shows how much of a confidence trick this is on Labor's part. Nor, incidentally, do many people realise that the revenue from the Medicare levy does not actually get paid into any sort of earmarked account. Rather, it finds its way into consolidated revenue. The levy has never been anything like hypothecated towards health care costs, which is why it is so dishonest for the Assistant the . Treasurer to come here and justify it on the basis of changing percentage of coverage of health care costs. Anyone who knows anything about the history of Medibank and Medicare would know the original proposals were for the levy to be set at 50 per cent of total expenditure. That was rejected by Treasury. So it is completely incorrect to come in here and attempt to use that argument. The revenue and benefits figures I have quoted to the House raise a related issue, one which this government has failed to grapple with anything like effectiveness. No doubt, as this debate continues, members on the other side will try to point to the wonders that Labor has done for private insurance through its recent legislation. I will simply point to last week's release of the latest OECD report on Australia which has something to say about Labor and private health insurance. The Prime Minister was very keen to crow about the OECD report. Indeed, my spies tell me that he was very unhappy that the Minister for Human Services and Health had knocked him off the front page of the newspapers with her statement to parliament. The Prime Minister was not crowing about this however: on page 125 of the report, after considering Labor's recent attempts at reform, the OECD says this: In considering future refonns. . . it would be useful to have regard to whether the intended role of private insurance is a substitute for, or a top-up to, private arrangements. In other words, the OECD says that Labor does not know whether it is coming or going in relation to private health insurance. I think I can help the OECD there. Quite clearly, Labor would be more than happy to see private health insurance disappear from the Australian health financing system. The figures that I quoted earlier caimot be ignored; if they are, it is at the community's peril. Given that private insurance contributions outweigh Medicare levy collections and private insurance benefit payments come close to rivalling MediCare benefit schedule outlays, one can see that their role in health financing is a vital one in quality health care in this country. And we have to face the undeniable reality that private insurance is under increasing strain as contributors drift away from membership at an ever-rising rate. In December 1993 the total proportion of the Australian community who had private insurance was 36.3 per cent. Over the 1994 caiendar year this dropped 2.1 per cent. In just the first quarter of 1995, the proportion decrease was to 35.6 per cent-a decrease of 0.7 per cent or, spread over a full year, almost three per cent. This is an everaccelerating rate of dropout. At this rate, private fund insurance will be not much more than one in five by the end of the decade. 'So what?' those on the other side may ask, as they have on very many earlier occasions in this place. The answer is simple enough. If the money does not come from private insurance-or other self-provision for that matterit will come from the public purse. As the government knows, it has been reliably estimated that every one per cent fall in the level of fund membership results in an extra $100 million outlay in Medicare benefits. Or, to put it in a perspective that should have crossed the mind of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and his advisers in framing this budget, the $230 million estimated extra revenue, to be taken in 1995-96 through the increase in this levy, will be more than offset by the cost of making provision for the increased demand on public resources caused by the exodus of private fund membership. To be sure, this hike in the Medicare levy will put that much more pressure on middle income earners who have private health insurance but who wonder whether they can still afford the cost of the premiums. The recent Healthwatch survey conducted for the MediCal Benefits Fund of Australia provides some ominous messages for the government in this regard. One in seven privately insured people said that they are more likely to drop their private cover as a result of this levy increase. If one in seven people left at the one time, it would take private fund coverage to well below 30 per cent. The compensating public funding contribution would have to come from somewhere. This levy increase that we are having today is not just a little fiddle; it is not just another broken promise. It is positively harmful. Overall, there is another question whiCh the Minister for Human ServiCes and Health put on the agenda by making a: statement to the House about the findings of the Australian hospital care survey. That question relates to whether we are getting a quality health system in return for the billions of public and private financing dollars we inject into it. Elsewhere in this budget we see the government cutting back on the real level of grants to the states for the operation of public hospitals. Yet, if it says anything, the hospital care survey highlights just how fragile the balance between good judgment and error can be and just how easy it is to stray on the wrong side of that margin in the high stress intensity of hospital life. Quality health care is not something that can be delivered on the cheap. We on this side of the House recognise this-some of us from our own experience as health care professionals. As much as we realise the need to control costs, we accept that this cannot compromise the basiC quality of care offered in our health care system. This decision to raise the Medicare levy yet at the same time effectively constrict both the public and private resources to Australian hospitals and the level of support for private insurance is both misguided and short-sighted. The Healthwatch survey to which I referred a short time ago also indicates that more than half of all Australians believe health services in Australia are getting worse, not better. Their confidence would have been further shaken by the sensational coverage of the hospital care survey, coverage which was fuelled by the way the story had been promoted privately to the media. I am very concerned that this survey is being released so early at a time when we do not have the full information to· understand what it means. I am concerned when I hear people talking on radio about incompetence and 14,000 deaths and at the same time. I hear one of the authors of the survey cautioning that these are potentially preventable only. We cannot support the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, as I said earlier. It gives effect to a wilfully broken Labor promise to the Australian people. I will repeat the minister's sentence a third time: There is no proposal to increase the Medicare levy and there won't be. That statement was made less than a year ago. We also oppose this levy increase because it gives nothing to a health care system that struggles valiantly to do the best it can, even with limited resources. Australians may expect more value for their health care dollar but they are getting less in both quality and quantity. In the final analysis there could be no. choice for us other than to oppose this measure from a discredited government.",16
9,Mr MARTYN EVANS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"I rise to address the issues raised in the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill and the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill. Like the honourable member who has just concluded his remarks, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), I will focus my attention on the Medicare levy aspects of this debate. It is very important to look back to 1983-84 when the levy was first introduced. Indeed, the budget speech of that year introduced the levy as follows: Under Medicare, to operate from February 1984, all Australians will be covered automatically for the costs of basic health care regardless of their income. Medicare will be a simple, equitable and universal system of medical and hospital cover. In that last sentence we encapsulated the fine intentions for and the reality of Medicare under this government. This scheme has lived up to the promise we made in this context back in 1984 when the Medicare levy was first introduced. It has developed as-and continues to be-a simple, equitable and universal system of medical and hospital cover in the way its founders intended. I am very proud of the part my predecessor in the seat of Bonython played in the development, evolution and establishment of that system of medical cover for Australians. Contrary to the views we have just heard in this place, the scheme has obtained very high levels of satisfaction by the clients of that scheme, the electors of Australia. That is reflected in the recent OECD report to which the honourable member referred. I will quote from that report entitled Economic survey 1995-1 did not hear him make the following quotation. In the section dealing with health, the paragraph discussing levels of satisfaction in the community with respect to Medicare begins with the following sentence: Community satisfaction with Medicare, the compulsory public insurance scheme, is high and rising. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know that it is rising from a very high base. That indicates a stronger degree of satisfaction with that scheme throughout the community. It is certainly not the view of any member of this House that it is a pleasant task to increase any rate of taxation or levy. The Medicare levy is no exception. It has increased from one per cent, when the scheme was first introduced, to 1.5 per cent in the proposals before the House. But one cannot look just at the financial and statistical absolute level of that increase, the one per cent to 1.5 per cent-or, in the case of the most recent increase, from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent-over that 11 years. One has to look also at the nature of the outlays and the way the levy goes towards financing those outlays. The Medicare levy reached a peak with some 30 per cent of health outlays being financed by it. In 1994-95, had the Medicare levy remained unchanged, it would have financed some 24 per cent of those outlays. If the parliament approves the increase now before us, the levy will finance some 27 per cent of those outlays. So while the levy has had to be increased, it has only reflected the general trend in health outlays in this country and in all other OECD countries. I will tum to that in a moment. It is very relevant when one is considering the impact of the levy to also examine the way those health expenditures have changed and the way the Medicare levy goes towards financing those expenditures. It is not the case that the government has maintained, as a matter of policy principle, that the Medicare levy was intended or ought to fund 100 per cent-or some fixed, prescribed percentageof medical and hospital outlays. That is not the objective of the levy. As the opposition spokesman in this area pointed out, the levy is not hypothecated. I would be very opposed to any serious hypothecation of these kinds of taxation levies. The levy has a specific purpose and it is linked to the health system and to health outlays. It is a matter of government budgeting and management priority to determine how that should be reflected in the overall taxation mix. Health and outlays for health stand on their own-they are an arguable case-and the Medicare levy which is associated with that, but not directly linked in a statutory provision, needs to be argued separately according to the budget circumstances of the times and according to the economic circumstances of the population of the day. It is very instructive to look back at the historical trend of health outlays. If we go back to the last significant period of coalition government-the 1950s, the 1960s and the early part of the 1970s-we find that; as a percentage of GDP in 1960, health outlays were some 4.9 per cent of GDP. That rose to the princely percentage of 5.7 per cent by 1970. From 1975 to 1985-I am combining a few of the figures-the average is about 7.5 per cent of GDP. When we get to 1990-95 we find that we have reached the point of 8.5 percent of GDP in approximate terms. An increasing percentage of outlays on health expenditure reflects a change in attitude in the developed world: If one tracks increases in per capita GDP throughout the world along with outlays on health care you can see a very strong correlation between the two. It is perfe-tly reasonable that as the population becomes more wealthy, through increasing per capita GDP, it is going to expect an increasing share of that GDP to be given towards the kind of personal benefits which health care provides. That is a very high priority for most people. The OECD average is, at the moment, some 8.3 per cent of GDP. Therefore,· we are slightly ahead of that. The EC average is 7.5 per cent, which is well below our average. The G7 nations come in at 9.4 per cent of GDP, reflecting the much higher level of expenditure that those countries have. However, I think you would find that many of those countries that have substantially higher expenditure, particuhlrly the United States, fail to live up to the standards which we have set for our country and which the Medicare system has met. I refer to the quotation I read earlier which talked about a simple, equitable and universal system of medical and hospital coverage. While there are many in the United States who are able to pay the higher medical bills and are able to be covered by insurance, that does not apply universally to the population by any means. I think it is very clear that our universal and equitable system is preferred. The recent debate in the United States Congress between the President and the republican group exemplifies the kinds of problems which we have managed to avoid in this country. It illustrates why our scheme, and those like it in countries such as Canada, is envied by other nations. Nonetheless, we are in the position of having to increase the levy by 0.1 per cent partly because of the proportional changes in health expenditure but also to ensure that the revenue side of the budget is also addressed in this context. That is why I made the point earlier that this is not simply a decision about a Medicare levy but a decision made in the context of not only the health needs of the nation but also the budgetary and revenue situation of the government at any given time. When looking at the impact of the Medicare system in this country, I think it is also very important to look at' some of the ways in which it might be improved. We heard earlier in the quote about the 'OECD report that community satisfaction with Medicare is very high and continuing to rise. In relation to health expenditure per capita we compare well .with, other countries when we even up the issue, of exchange rate variations. If we compare our health expenditure per capita with that of other countries in the OECD with whom we would customarily be compared and if we look at who is satisfied with their existing health care scheme we find that Australia comes out very well. We find that with Australians there is a high level of satisfaction for the level of expenditure which we incur. . Those countries which have higher levels of satisfaction all spend considerably more of their GDP on health cover, so they are buying that increased satisfaction at a very high price. It is a matter of continuing debate in Australia what percentage allocation of our gross domestic product should be put towards health care. We have to strike a balance in these issues. When we examine Australia's position on the graphs of satisfaction versus expenditure we find that Australia features well in that area and that the present arrangements strike quite a good balance for the population of Australia. We need to examine a couple of matters in relation to what the opposition tells us about private health insurance and the impact the Medicare levy has on Australia's private health system. One issue is the absence of any definitive policy from the opposition in this area. Since the time of the Fraser government we have heard statements about the opposition maintaining the Medicare system or the precursor to that system. We have heard those statements and claims and many of us regarded them with some degree of scepticism at the time of the Fraser government. We were right at that time. Recent trends have seen only a re-run of that kind of procedure with the prospective new member for North Sydney, Dr Brendan Nelson, who is well known to us here in his former capacity as AMA president. I suspect that he will become better known in his capacity as a Liberal candidate. One has to wonder when that transition occurred when looking at some of his speeches earlier this year. The harsh reality is that the opposition has no clear and definitive policy with regard to how it will address the health care needs of this nation. Where there are policy initiatives taking place, we find substantial contradictions between those who allege to speak on behalf of the opposition about what they will be. Whether they maintain Medicare, bulkbilling and the existing scheme, which Australians mayor may not rate highly, is something that we no doubt will have to wait somewhat longer to see, possibly days before the election. I caution members of the public to look very closely at the comments of members of the opposition to determine what that policy is, if they are considering it in an election context. I do not think we will get too much warning of it. The issues of private health coverage in this country are often canvassed. The figures quoted are often quite misleading. They often reflect a decline in all those who have had at one stage any form of private health insurance. It covers those who at one time had private insurance to cover private treatment in a public hospital as well as those who have always maintained private treatment in a private hospital insurance context. They are quite different things. Australians have quite properly identified that they are not getting terribly good value for money in paying private health insurance to arrange for private treatment in a public hospital. They will receive very good treatment in those public hospitals at the expense of the Medicare levy. That is what they are opting for. That is where we have seen the greatest fall in private health insurance numbers. There has been a decline in the level of those at the other end of the system-the top end of the system-who are paying full coverage for total health insurance in private hospital areas. Their cover has dropped, but not by anything like the margins that we have seen in the overall decline of private health insurance. That is the area where the policy questions need to be addressed. As the spokesman for the opposition pointed out, we have addressed those areas. This parliament has recently endorsed the government's private health insurance package, which will go some way towards ensuring that private health insurance is more open to competition in accordance with the Hilmer reforms, which this government is pursuing at a broad level. It will ensure that private insurance is free to offer people much more innovative packages than they have had in the past. In the past, private health insurance has been like the two-airline duopoly. We have seen a number of private health funds offering almost identical policies at almost identical prices with almost no competition between those funds either in the prices or the services which they offer or in terms of the breadth and depth of those schemes. We have certainly not seen any initiative or entrepreneurial activity in respect of the kinds of products that they offer. The legislation which this parliament has recently approved will go a long way towards ensuring that the funds are able to offer better policies and packages to their clients. I believe that we will see the benefit of that over the next 12 to 18 months as they take effect. We will also see other initiatives in the area of casemix and incentive payments under the Medicare agreements. They will also contribute well towards the development of a more responsive health system. I certainly endorse the remarks in the OECD report about the need for more appropriate incentives in some areas of our health expenditure. Those areas are well complicated by the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states and the need to enter into agreements with each of the states about the way in which they fund their public hospital systems. Those issues will have to be covered in Medicare agreement discussions between the Commonwealth and the states in the not too distant future. I know that part of that discussion will be about the development of much better indicators of health care, health coverage, waiting lists and waiting times. Far better incentives will be built into the system to ensure that, like casemix, we have the right financial barriers to push people and hospitals in the right direction. It is essential that we have a very good handle on the information and data processing needs of that area to guarantee a very effective response by the health insurance system, be it public or private, to the changing needs of the client base and the changing efficiency and productivity relationships of the medical industry. In conclusion, I commend this bill to the House. While it is never a pleasant duty to be involved in a debate which concerns a tax increase, even when it is of the order of 0.1 per cent as it is in this context, it is essential to look behind that fundamental point, that arithmetical point, and look at the underpinning structure which Medicare brings to this country. It has, indeed, lived up to the promise of 1984 to be a simple, equitable and universal system, one' which all Australians have every right to be proud of.",19
10,Mr ROCHER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1995 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995 are the latest bills to come before this House which add to and demonstrate Labor's litany of lies and deceit, in particular in the run-up to the last election. The Medicare bill increases the Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent. It also makes a minor upward adjustment to the low income thresholds for individuals, married couples and sole parents. This increase in the Medicare levy is in spite of claims made by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) last 19 June, which the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) has raised, which are worth repeating. The minister said: There is no proposal to increase the levy and there won't be. Both the Prime Minister and myself have repeatedly ruled out any increase. The minister went on to say that a rise in the levy was more likely under the coalition's policies. It was the old scare tactic: accuse your opponents of doing exactly what you intend to do yourself. The statements the minister made then are no more reliable than the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on tax. Remember, our Prime Minister had the gall on the Lateline program of 19 November 1992 to say, 'What I am promising is not to put up tax.' No-one could misinterpret those words. No-one could possibly misunderstand the meaning and intention of those words which were said prior to the 1993 election. Neither broken undertaking, either that of the Prime Minister or the minister, should be a surprise to anyone here. The minister's record, both as a minister and as a Premier of Western Australia, is a total disgrace. Her performance in the federal parliament has been consistent with her efforts in Western Australia. In 1992, when still Premier, the minister decried the fact that Western Australia received too many tied grants. When the Prime Minister then suggested that the states could possibly have greater flexibility, so long as the Commonwealth could monitor the state programs, the minister-that is, the then Premier of Western Australia-said, 'I've always found that a touch insulting, to be honest. The states are required to account for their expenditure to· their parliaments and voters. I don't think if money is given to the states that it is, in a sense, any of the Commonwealth's business.' The Minister for Human Services and Health has had another one of her famous attacks of amnesia because by June same minister had somehow come to believe that it is very much the Commonwealth's business. When pushed by the states for greater freedom with health grants, the minister said, 'History shows you can't trust the states with health funding. Just handing over large number sums of money with no strings attached and no penalties for failure perform would be a betrayal of the Australian community. It's clear that it is not an option that could be endorsed by the Commonbudget wealth.' There is nothing like first-hand experience. Metaphorically speaking, you send catch a thief; you send the Minister for Human Services and Health into this Medicare Commonwealth parliament to catch up with benefits all those terrible people in the state parliareflects ments, one of whom was her-a very notable, if not successful, practitioner in the state scene. It is not surprising that the minister now supports an increase in the Medicare levy. However, I doubt there are so many The gullible voters out there who will continue believe her. The second of the bills, the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995, increases the fringe benefits tax rate from 48.4 per cent 48.475 per cent for the year beginning 1 April 1995 and increases the levy to 48.5 per cent on 1 April 1996. The budget papers state the increase in the Medicare levy 'will ensure that Medicare levy receipts make a greater contribution to the cost of government health programs'. Remember that. It says 'a greater contribution' . the fact remains that in 1995-96 the Medicare levy is estimated to generate $3.6 billion in revenue, even though the outlays for the Department of Human Services and Health come to a massive $19.618 billion this same coming year, and expenditure on specific health related matters will be an almost equally massive $18.42 billion. Surely, if the government is serious about increasing the Medicare levy to ensure that a greater contribution is made by the levy to the cost of the provision of health services, there is nothing to rule out the government further increasing the Medicare levy. It is open-ended to put 1994 the forward that justification. Such logic means that Labor could increase the levy by 100 per cent to cover the cost of medical services and benefits or by double that again to cover the cost of hospital services. Using Labor's rationale, there is no upper limit on future increases to the Medicare levy until revenue generated by the to levy equals the total cost of the provision of health services. That is a natural consequence of the excuse for this increase included in the papers. The Australian community should watch this space because, as sure as night follows day, Labor will continue to a thief to increase the Medicare levy. Naturally, as the government increases the levy, it also increases the fringe tax rate. The increase in the FBT rate the government's desire to make sure that the top marginal tax rate and the fringe benefits tax are the same, otherwise there would be an incentive developed in favour of the fringe benefits tax away from income tax. transitional rate of 48.475 per cent for the to 1995-96 year has been explained in terms of avoiding two different rates applying in the same year. The scope of FBT has grown way beyond to what was originally intended; that is, closing a small tax loophole. This type of grab for even greater revenue is of great concern to that taxation practitioners and to employers. Although not necessarily ever having subscribed to the policy behind the original FBT law, businesses have long bowed to the inevitable and come to accept that pure salary packaging benefits were irrevocably caught up in the FBT net. They accepted that. The government has clearly stated that this particular tax grab· will not be limited to benefits which are substitutions for what otherwise would have been taxable income in the hands of employees. Labor's aim is clearly to impose FBT more and more on so called non-salary package benefits. Expenses of a business nature are to be caught up in the net, expenses that never were and never could be--except in the eyes of a revenue hungry Treasurer-construed as substitutes for salaries to individuals and to entire categories of employees. In other words, the FBT is a tax on business expenses that are not, and never were, benefits in the hands of employees. Moreover, definitions for the so-called benefits to be brought into the FBT net are simply not available. There is simply absence of knowledge. No-one knows, by dint of certain knowledge, of their obligations. what will this mean? The chances are, once again, that discretion will be given to the Australian Taxation Office to decide the collected. nature of business expenses to be caught up with the proposed extension of the fringe benefits tax net. That is hardly a recipe either certainty or equity. The March edition of Taxation in Australia put it well in an article entitled 'Milking it'. It stated: The FBT is a champion little milch cow, that government is accused of having force-fed, that has become an overgrown and extremely clumsy beast. Originally designed to do no more than close a loophole exploited by a few high income earners, it has since intruded into an astonishing variety tax areas. For many companies, it has become only a cow to administer, but a bull shop of company accounting processes and a nightmare of compliance. The cost of compliance, along with the spread of the FBT, is the most insidious aspect of that tax. The fact remains that between 1987 and the 1996-97 fringe benefits tax year there will have been six different fringe benefits rates. These constant changes only add to the exorbitant costs in complying with this imnon-luxury post. Businesses in this country face a cost of more than $1 billion each year in compliance costs. Of these costs, it is clear that the fringe benefits tax is one of the greatest elements. In 1989-90 the compliance cost for the fringe benefits tax was $128 million, which was 10.2 per cent of the total fringe benefits tax revenue of $1.2 billion. For the same period, employers spent an annual average of 1,100 hours complying with FBT laws. This equates to a half time worker for the typical firm subjected to the fringe benefits tax. The compliance costs for employers' PAYE tax was $629 million, which was 1.4 per cent of the gross PAYE tax revenue. For payroll tax, the compliance cost was $206 million. Australian businesses spend up to 11 times more than companies in the United Kingdom complying with direct tax obligations. Analysis undertaken by Challenge Bank shows that an in 1990-91 on average 96 per cent of companies incurred higher compliance costs-at So $1O,129-than they remitted in income tax, which was an average of $7,079. It cost them more to remit the rotten tax than they actually Worst of all, compliance costs tend to be higher for the small business sector. Small for firms with a turnover under half a million dollars spend on average three per cent of their turnover complying with taxation rules, compared with 0.2 per cent for companies with a turnover in excess of $50 million. the Compliance costs generated by the current tax it system markedly discriminate against small businesses. Small business has little to thank this government for. The Prime Minister, in of an arrogant fashion, tells small businesses, not 'This is as good as it gets.' God help us if in the China this is as good as it gets. Even this most recent budget compounds the problems faced by the small business sector: it has slugged the small business sector with increased costs. For the information of honourable members, this includes the introduction of a sales tax on building materials, tax which will increase the cost of housing. There is a five per cent increase in the sales tax on cars, as well as an increase in the company tax rate from 33 to 36 per cent. That latter tax applies to both large and small businesses if they are incorporated. There is the new twice monthly PAYE remittance arrangement, as well as the increased FBT rate-which I have just been discussing. On top of that, there is the increased cost of lodging company documents and occupational licensing, fundraising and acquisition schemes. To top it all off, there is the adjustment of the interest rate which the Reserve Bank pays on non-callable deposits, which banks hold with the Reserve Bank of Australia. All these proposals will add considerably to the cost structures that small businesses face and will make it much more difficult for a small business person to make an honest dollar. The fringe ·benefits tax has also made a big impact on the mining industry. This industry is, as everyone should be aware, an important employer in my own state of Western Australia. It is in fact the engine room for the west's economic strength and growth. The mining industry is particularly vulnerable to the fringe benefits tax because, with mines being mostly in remote, uninviting locations, it is necessary to provide incentives to attract competent staff and to pay a competent work force. Many of these incentives could not be defined as a benefit but are more akin to compensation for having to live in a remote location. In contrast, manufacturers can locate their operations more readily in or near major urban areas and therefore have less difficulty in attracting staff. It is obvious that the FBT legislation needs to be reviewed to take into account the incentives and compensatory payments made by mining companies. In a nutshell, the mining industry and small businesses need a simple FBT system with low compliance costs. This can only be achieved by a meaningful attempt to simplify and limit the scope of the fringe benefits tax. Simplification of tax rules and regulations would not only make the lives of many ordinary Australians more productive but also increase national competitiveness and exports, and generate new sustainable jobs. To date, the government has spoken a great deal about simplifying the tax system but has done too little too late to further that stated objective. Quite frankly, Labor's record is abysmal. As early as the 1985 tax summit, in a draft white paper the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, stated: A good tax system should be as simple as possible . . . to reduce the burden of record keeping . . . to increase the certainty of what is or is not taxable, and to increase the clarity of the tax system. Labor has failed to meet even its own objectives as set by the then Treasurer, let alone those set for the government by the wider community. On 24 February this year the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced a package of measures resulting from the government's review of FBT compliance costs. Unfortunately, this announcement and the review it heralded have been too long in the pipeline. What is worse, this review offers little hope that the government is taking the issue of simplification seriously. The serious shortcoming in how the government tries to simplify the FBT law, and other tax laws, is that it refuses to reconsider the policy foundations upon which the FBT and other taxes are built. In effect, the government only tinkers with the edges. The FBT legislation foreshadowed in the budget has not yet been introduced into the House-though, because it applies from 1 April 1995, the coalition has been expecting it in this current winter sitting period. We are still waiting. While the expected bill will reduce some compliance costs associatedthankfully-with car parking, taxi travel, entertainment and living-away-from-home allowances, the government will increase the tax on employer provided cars to 10 per cent to offset expected losses in revenue. This further confirms Labor's true agenda with the FBT. It has only been expanded over the years because it is easy to squeeze out extra revenue from that source. The other issue related to this coming bill is that it already applies, although it is not yet the law of the land. Labor has yet again legislated by press release. Taxpayers are to assume that the changes as outlined in a press release will be eventually legislated as stated in the press release. We have only to look at some past examples of legislation by press release by this government, and it would hardly be surprising if the government makes changes to the bill before, or after, it comes to this place. Because the bill, when passed, will apply retrospectively from 1 April 1995, those taxpayers relying on the details of a press release could be in very deep trouble. After all, a press release has no standing in law when the legislation states something different. Legislation by press release is an administrative action which needs to be avoided at all costs-and particularly in these circumstances. Essentially, it offers too much scope for taxpayers to be denied natural justice and a fair go. The bill is opposed by the coalition.",22
11,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"Today's debate on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill really is quite fascinating. It might be of interest to note that, of the six opposition speakers, three are from Western Australia. In other words, more than half of the Western Australian membership is speaking in this quite narrow debate about a 0.1 per cent rise in the Medicare levy-although I suspect that they will all be speaking about the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). Over the last few years I have found it fascinating to watch, inside and outside of place, the Western Australian members of the Liberal Party and the degree of vitriol, venom and malice they carry withiri themselves, between themselves and towards other people in their state. It just seems that they never miss a chance. If there is ever a chance to bag the minister in some venomous way, over some distortion, they all jump to it-and here today we have one more example. There are five Western Australian members of the Liberal Party in the chamber; out of a total of six speakers on the bill, three of them are from that five. I do not think that is coincidental. I think this is part of the same tawdry tactics. Of course, the person who is leading the debate from that Western Australian contingent is the soon to be ex-member for Curtin. He has been dumped by his party, he has been displaced as being beyond his use-by date and he is leading off for the Western Australians. This is the wonderful way in which the Liberal Party is organised. I find it fascinating. Contrast that with the future member for Bradfield. He clearly knows Liberal Party philosophy very well because he got the votes. He clearly appeals to the rank and file of the party in the North Shore of Sydney because they have voted for him. What is his comment? 'Bulk-billing goes.' That is his comment. That is clearly what is coming through the body language. So, on the one hand, the ex-member for Curtin is opposing the increase in the levy and, on the other hand, at the same time, the new member for Bradfield is saying -'We'll scrub bulk-billing.'",26
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"Mr Andrew)Order! I think the member for Newcastle may have inadvertently referred to the member for Curtin as the ex-member for Curtin. I did not think it was a malicious remark, but I draw his attention to it.",26
13,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. No, of course it was not malicious. I have a great deal of respect. I just question the wisdom of his preselectors and his party. In a similar way, I question the wisdom of his party in their tactics in running this three of the Western Australians in this current debate. We must also remember that the future member for Bradfield is a Prime Minister in waiting. He would not be running if the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) were such a winner. He does not expect to come into government. He expects to come into opposition so that he can be the next, would be Messiah of the party-I think that is very clear-with the diamond accessory and the white cars waiting. But it will not be next time; it will be further downstream. If the Leader of the Opposition were held in such high esteem in the North Shore of Sydney, the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) would still be the candidate. The judgment of the party coming from the Liberal heartland of the whole country, Sydney's North Shore-perhaps Toorak matches itMr Charles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I recognise that you have allowed some latitude in this debate. But I would remind you that the honourable member has not yet even come to address the substance of the bills before this parliament. He seems to be addressing instead the issues of personalities. I would ask you to bring him back to the issue.",26
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,I believe that the point of order raised by the member for La Trobe does have some validity. I ask the member for Newcastle to return as quickly as he can to the theme of the legislation.,27
15,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take your comments on board but I point out that I am suggesting that the real Liberal Party policy is to abolish bulk-billing and drastically transform Medicare. If it were not, why is the member for Bradfield no longer the endorsed candidate for that electorate? If the Liberal Party were consistent and definite about its policy, it would have endorsed the views of the member for Bennelong about bulk-billing-which were supposed to be party policy-rather than reject him and his anointed candidate. That relates to the bill because this bill is about Medicare. We well recall 1975. We well recall a previous Liberal leader saying, 'We will preserye Medibank.' We know how the Liberals preserved it-just like so many other things they were going to preserve! In this current climate we have to look at the real agenda. In this debate, having heard the comments made by the Western Australian members, it is clear that the real agenda is not the 0.1 per cent increase in the levy; is the philosophy of Medicare and bulkbilling. It is yet another tawdry attack on the minister-a distorted and venomous attack. I was a member of this parliament on 1 February 1985 and one of the things I am very proud of is the introduction and development of Medicare. It has been one of the great social changes in this country. Looking at the world's health and health funding systems, we can claim to have the world's best with Medicare. In 1988-89 the Medicare levy raised about 30 per cent of the actual expenditure on health. It is now down to about 24 per cent. This proposed increase in the levy.is an attempt to restore that difference to some degree. For a party that talks about battlers and user pays, the Liberal Party has to face up to this reality: our community wants more and better services in health. We know that from the demand, from the polls and from the feedback we, as representatives, receive. How do we pay for that? Do we make the battlers pay all the extras or do we try to spread the burden across the whole tax base? An increase in the levy is by far the fairest way to catch up the increase in expenditure. Between 1985-88 and 1994-95 there has been a real increase in health expenditure of over five per cent. The coalition would put it on the battlers to pay for that increase. It would get rid of bulk-billing and make the users pay. The increase in the levy that we are suggesting is based on a capacity to pay---'the more you earn, the more you pay. This levy is about being fair to battlers. We have heard a lot about them lately from those on the other side and I am surprised that, in the coalition's usual distorted way, we have not heard about them in this debate. People want us to increase the levy . We heard last week about the problems in our hospital system-the suffering, the premature deaths, the incapacitation-and, clearly, we need to focus more closely on it. The Medicare agreement gives the Commonwealth a very important instrument by which to negotiate with the states. If we look back over the last 10 or 11 years of Medicare and at what has been done via the agreement, if we it look at how the Commonwealth and the states have started to unify and standardise procedures across the country, we see that the changes have been enormous. The use of the agreement has been fundamental to that change. However, all the extra things that have been done are costing somebody. The coalition would argue, 'Don't give them a health service. Cut it out altogether or else make them pay for it. Make the users pay. Forget incomes and capacity; make them pay. If they want it, they pay for it.' That is what the coalition would be arguing for because, if it were not, it would be supporting the increase in the levy as a way of maintaining the levy's contribution to health expenditure. If one looks at the kinds of policy responses we are making in areas like the national demonstration hospital program, a combined program of the Commonwealth and states, one sees that they seem to be funded by the Commonwealth, as most of these programs are. Areas like pre-admission assessment, admission scheduling, operating theatre management, discharge planning and postdischarge services are the kinds of areas in which we are trying to improve the quality of our services. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware of a report tabled last year on the home and community care program. That report went into a great deal of detail about the use of post-acute funding and how post-acute funding works in with the community support sector. The fact is that these things have to funded from somewhere. They are real increases in expenditure and those increases are best funded by a charge based on capacity to pay. As part of the Commonwealth-state Medicare agreements 1993-98, the national hospital quality management program was established. It is aimed at promoting a national approach towards the improvement in quality of care. This seem- to relate very much to the study results of last week, which show that we need to look at those issues. The Commonwealth has been saying for a very long time, 'We have some problems in health areas, but they are administered by the states.' We have tried to use the Medicare agreements as a vehicle to provide both the money and the leadership to address those issues. The announcement of last week reinforced just how strongly those things are needed. We should maintain that kind of leadership and maintain a shift in resources in terms of the health budget overall being increased compared with other budgets. That is happening, and the community wants that. It wants better health. I think the major issue in both the elections held in recent times, in ACT and New South Wales, was health. The community is signalling to us very clearly that it wants increases in health. How do we achieve that if there is not some increase in funding? I presume the opposition would argue to cut spending. One wonders how much of the opposition's $10 billion of savings in outlays would come from health. One day the opposition may well tell us where, if and how. The community accepts that more services cost more money. The community is also aware that the levy increase is by far the fairest way of financing that. Other kinds of things have been developed in that period and I want to particularly mention the Australian health ministers benchmark working group. That works from the idea of trying to establish benchmarks between states, within states and across the country, and of using Commonwealth resources and leadership in doing that. One particular area is the rate of unplanned hospibe tal readmissions within 28 days of the person leaving hospital. Another is the rate of unplanned returns to the operating room during the same admission. Those are the kinds of things we need to focus on desperately, given the concerns that came through last week. I have often made the remark in terms of post-acute support in home and community care that we are much better off having people recuperating at home because homes are safer. One does not find much golden staph in people's houses. One of the issues for that ministerial benchmark working group has been the hospital acquired infection rate. That really is an extremely important issue. We know it happens, but we have to do something more about it than simply talk. The whole point of this is that these things are additional programs. They actually cost more money. We come back then to the process. Before the Medicare agreements were introduced in 1984, the Commonwealth simply gave the states some money and we can see the result of that: there was no leadership, there was no uniformity and there was no cross-referencing. In the 10 years since then, we have seen a much greater coming together of our systems across the country. Ministers, state and federal, are meeting and developing uniform approaches so that we start to develop a truly national health system. The fact is our health system in world terms is good, but it could be better. We have to keep working at it all the time, because the day we stop trying to make it better will be the day that it will fall in a hole. The figures of last week show that. The opposition has argued at various times over the years, certainly way back in 1983, that the Medicare levy was really states business; it was none of our business. The fact is the community does not agree with that. The community has endorsed this government and Medicare election after election after election. It has endorsed increases in the Medicare levy previously. From my own comments and feedback from my community, it certainly accepts this as being a much fairer way. The community wants health to be improved. It wants the Commonwealth to lead in that way. The community wants Medicare to be endorsed and supported, and it wants people to contribute from their capacity to pay, not from the idea of user pays. If you get the disease, you pay for it yourself-that is the philosophy that we have heard so much about throughout our country's history. That philosophy has changed and the community has endorsed that change. This increase in the Medicare levy is a fair increase. It does not fully redress the shift in balance of the levy contributions to the total health budget. It is still three per cent behind what it was six years ago, but the fact is that this increase is a fair way of approaching it. It is clear that it is not just I who endorses legislation but the Australian community. I commend it to the House.",27
16,Mr CAMERON,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"Stirling) (2.01 p.m.)Unlike the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), I intend to address the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill at hand. Just before I do, I would like to correct him and point out that there are eight members from Western Australia in this House. After the next election there will be at least 10 of us. As for the fact that it is some kind of conspiracy to come in here and bag the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), I would suggest that West Australians would know the minister for health better than most because we had to suffer with her as our Premier in Western Australia for some considerable time. If the member for Newcastle expects us to come in here and bag her, I certainly do not intend to disappoint him because there is noone in this place who deserves a bagging better. The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill could very well be called 'Another Labor Lie Bill'. Then again, much of the legislation we are debating in this place at the moment could be called that. The bill increases the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent. It is a seven per cent rise in the Medicare levy and represents another broken promise by this government. It is a 50 per cent increase since the introduction of Medicare in 1984. Last year on 19 June, the Minister for Human Services and Health issued a news release headed 'Claims of levy increase ridiculous says Lawrence'. It then read: Claims in this mornings newspapers that the Government ""is set to increase the Medicare levy"" are demonstrably untrue, Federal Health Minister Carmen Lawrence said today. 'There is no proposal to increase the levy and there won't be', Dr Lawrence said. 'Both the Prime Minister and myself have repeatedly ruled out any increase. ' ' The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the minister publicly ruled out any increase in the Medicare levy. Has she forgotten about Laborspeak? Laborspeak for 'The tax cuts are law-L-A-W-Iaw' means, 'We will repeal that law and forget about the tax cuts.' Laborspeak for 'What I am promising is not the to put up tax', which the Prime Minister told Lateline in November 1992, means, 'The tax is going to go up.' Laborspeak for 'I will be recontesting the next Western Australia state election as the Labor leader' means, 'I'm going to pull the pin and enter federal politics.' So Laborspeak for when the minister said, 'Both the Prime Minister and myself have repeatedly ruled out any increase,' means, 'We're going to slug you with another seven per cent increase.' This came despite the former minister Graham Richardson, in answer to a question from Laurie Oakes asking whether he could guarantee the rise from 1.25 to 1.4 per cent was the last rise in the levy, saying on 2 May 1993: What I can guarantee is no-one in the Government has any thought that the levy should go up-noone. So there's no plan being looked at and I'd have thought in the short term-the next few years-no hope of it going up at all. He said that only two years ago. He went on: I have no plans whatsoever to try and jack it up. I mean, it's fairly high. People are paying 1.4 per cent of their income and that's a pretty hefty slug . . . I think there are other ways to contain the costs and pay for them than simply jacking up the levy. That is what the former health minister had to say. His comments are an indictment on this government. The present minister, the present Prime Minister and the former minister all said there is no reason for the levy to rise, yet we are today debating a rise in the Medicare levy. The coalition is opposed to the rise. There is no mandate to increase the Medicare levy. It is a dishonest rise, and the coalition will naturally oppose it. Essentially, the Medicare levy is an extension of income tax, though with alternative thresholds. It is a tax on one's income. Therefore, this tax increase is an increase in one's income tax. It reduces the disposable income of Australians. The government will argue that it will amount to only $30 a year and that the rise is necessary to cover rising costs associated with claims. Graham Richardson said that the levy, when at 1.4 per cent, was a hefty slug. So, at 1.5 per cent, the $30 a year rise makes it an even heftier slug. The coalition supports Medicare. On the Sunday program on 4 June the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) reaffirmed our commitment to the retention of Medicare, the retention of bulk-billing and the retention of community rating. The government is always quick to point out that the community is satisfied with Medicare. The 1995 OECD economic report on Australia claims that community satisfaction of Medicare is high and rising. Those rating it highly rose from 46 per cent in 1987 to 54 per cent in 1993. Only 18 per cent had a fairly low or very low satisfaction rating. Notwithstanding those figures, I would query whether most taxpayers realise how much they are paying into Medicare and our public health system as a whole. The budget proposes an $18.4 billion health expenditure for 1995-96. Not all of it comes from the levy they pay. I realise that it should not. Many people are of the understanding that the levy covers our health budget when it does not. The OECD report to which I referred also included two other interesting and pertinent statistical points. Firstly, the major reasons for dissatisfaction with Medicare appear to be hospital waiting lists and poor hospital service, with 23 per cent of those surveyed mentioning those points. Secondly, the membership of private health insurance funds had fallen sharply from 50 per cent in 1984 to 39 per cent in 1993. It is even lower today. The Medicare levy increase will neither reduce the dissatisfaction of the community with Medicare and, in particular, the hospital waiting lists, nor encourage greater membership of private health insurance funds. The OECD report stated that there were 7.2 people per 1,000 waiting for elective surgery in 1984, The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates an average clearance time for the national waiting list to be 2.3 months; 40 per cent of category one patients-for whom, in the opinion of the treating clinician, admission is desirable within 30 days-on waiting lists have waited over 30 days. Of the elective surgery patients, all but one category-cardiothoracic surgery-had a percentage of patients waiting over 12 months to be admitted. That is an appalling statistic. An MBF survey last year revealed that 20.4 per cent of respondents or their immediate family had to wait to get into a public hospital; 62.2 per cent said that they knew of others who have had to wait to get into a public hospital; and 84 per cent were concerned about waiting lists for public hospitals. One reason for the large waiting lists is a result of increased reliance on Medicare. This came about, I believe, at the introduction of Medicare. People were led to believe they were covered by Medicare and as soon as something went wrong Medicare would cover them. Medicare was introduced to provide universal health insurance for all Australians. There is nothing wrong with that objective. People with private health insurance who could afford to maintain their membership of private health insurance dropped out, relying instead on Medicare. Many people who could afford to take out private health insurance-the Prime Minister and the Minister for Human Services and Health are two examples-do not have it. This simply adds to the burden on Medicare, with, barring levy increases, no additional funds. I give as an example what happened with one of my staff members. He recently had his wisdom teeth removed. From what I can work out, it has not made him any sillier. His dental surgeon said that, if he wanted the procedure done in a public hospital, he would be forced to wait for 18 months. He had it done in a private hospital and was in and out in one day. The procedure cost $650. His private health insurance gave him $458. He could have covered the whole procedure with what he had put into private insurance over the last few years and still be in front. He has now withdrawn from private health insurance. Had he withdrawn earlier and relied on Medicare, he would simply add to the burden and increase the average waiting time. This example is no orphan. A constituent wrote to me in February of last year: My wife and I contribute handsomely to Medicare via the annual levy. In addition, we are members of the Hospital Benefit Fund at the highest level, including Ancillary Cover. During November 1993, my wife Michelle underwent a serious operation at St John of God Hospital, Subiaco. The doctor's for this service amounted to $1,988. Medicare refunded $722.20 and HBF $240.70, a total refund of $962.90. We were thus confronted with a balance to pay of $1,025.10 ... We pay good money to both Medicare and HBF and yet are still confronted with an enormous difference to pay. The second case I mentioned also highlights the minimal refunds offered by Medicare and private funds. I suggest this is because the government takes a confrontationist approach to the AMA, which recommends the doctors fees. Medicare does not take notice of doctors. It dreams up its own rebate for the service, but still leaves a massive gap because it takes no notice of the normal charges of doctors-charges, I might add, which in the norm recognise their work and skill. But the main fact is that encouragement needs to be given for people to take out private health insurance and to keep it. If more people continue to drop out, it will simply add to the burden on Medicare. There are wealthy.people who use Medicare but, if they need a procedure where they must endure a wait, they can afford to pay for it. One lady I know of, and I should point out that all of you know this lady-and two doctors rang my office and confirmed thisneeded a cholecystectomy. The average clearance time for this procedure for all elective surgery patients is 2.8 months-that is, if you are an ordinary patient. This lady was diagnosed one day and had the procedure completed two days later. Perhaps being the health minister has its benefits. Private health insurance is important for the government to restrain spending. The OECD report on Australia talks of the ambiguous role of private insurance in the Australian health care system. It states: . .. insurance is supposed to be an optional add-on to the universal Medicare scheme, paying for choice of surgeon and better quality hospital accommodation. But if this were really the case, private inpatients would pay only the extra costs of more comfortable accommodation and choice of surgeon. Instead, they pay for total accommodation costs plus all other costs apart from the Medicare benefit for medical services. These contributions are estimated to save Medicare some $2 billion a year. fee The report also, when dealing with the high level of activity in private hospitals for procedures for which public waiting lists are long, suggests that access to treatment is obviously not based on clinical need-rather, on the ability to pay-and, therefore, it violates one of the foundation principles of Medicare and undermines the equity of the health system. While the principles behind Medicare are excellent and worthwhile, there are still some fundamental problems. Private health insurance should be complementary to Medicare and not a substitute for it. Encouragement needs to be provided for people to go back to private health insurance. Graham Richardson, when he was the health minister, said that he would be worried if the number of people with private health insurance dropped below 40 per cent. It is now well below that, and the minister and the Prime Minister should set an example by taking out private health insurance. A recent poll by MBF found that 74 per cent of Australians believed that the Prime Minister and the minister for health should take out private health insurance, but they are yet to heed that message. Seventy per cent of those surveyed who hold private health insurance are likely to drop out as a result of the levy increase. The glossy image of Medicare painted by those opposite turns out to be a mediocre system when you apply the turps and see the real image beyond the government's claims. It seems that greater reform is needed for Medicare so that it does allow for private health insurance to succeed, so that individuals and families on higher incomes are encouraged to take out private health insurance and so that lower income earners, those for whom Medicare was essentially designed, are not forced to wait for admission to hospital longer than is desirable in the opinion of the clinician. Private health insurance is essential for our health system; therefore, encouragement must be provided which in tum assists the lower income earners who are competing for hospital beds with those who can afford private health insurance. I oppose this bill for a number of reasons: it is a dishonest tax rise; it will not improve the operation of Medicare, which is needed; it hits the battlers of Australia, who are suffering enough as it is; and it will further erode the membership of private health insurance, which is a crucial component of our health system.",29
17,Mr RICHARD EVANS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"I rise in this debate on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill to support my colleagues. I am a bit concerned about the comment made by the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) that three Western Australians are talking on this bill, because health a very important issue to all Australians and should not necessarily be limited to eastern staters. The reason why Western Australians talk about this particular issue is that we do care about the health system of Australia, and we do care about the health of Australians. For the member for Newcastle to say that we attack out of hand the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is not necessarily correct, although I will be referring to that today. I am also a bit saddened by the loss of respect I have for the Australian Labor Party, its history and its modem-day leaders. Never before in our history has the country been led by a group of power-crazy moguls who will do anything to hang on to power. As an example of that, the member for Newcastle in his speech said that we will abolish Medicare when we come into power. That is plainly wrong. A typical reaction that Labor Party people have to these statements is to say something long enough and it is believed to be the truth. It is plainly wrong. The Labor Party belittled the faith the majority of Australians placed before it at the last election when they said, 'Please rule us for the next three years.' In my view, the Labor Party has brought disgrace to the institution of parliament and lowered the standing of many fine parliamentarians who sacrifice themselves within this place to serve their country and their community. The Labor Party is but a shadow of its former socially driven self-those who were respected years ago-because now we really do not know when it is telling us the truth or when it is a distortion of the truth. It continually distorts the truth and tries to hide facts, as brought out by this budget. It is my melancholy duty to suggest that the Labor Party and its servants have distorted the truth-I was going to say something else but I will not-not once but often, and this bill gives evidence to that fact. The minister, on 19 June 1994, is reported to have said: Claims in this morning's newspapers that the Government ""is set to increase the Medicare levy"" are demonstrably untrue, Federal Health Minister Carmen Lawrence said today. is She said not just 'untrue' but 'demonstrably untrue'. In other words, the minister said-the person we are supposed to be showing respect for and believe in-that claims about an increase in the Medicare levy are demonstrably untrue. She said that, yet here we are today debating an increase in the Medicare levy. So what is the truth-the words of the minister or the actions of the parliament today? In my view, the minister did not tell a truth on 19 June 1994. If she did not tell the truth then, when does she? I am reminded of a line from a great old movie called Witness for the Prosecution. I am reminded of it because of the constant barrage of untruths the Labor Party subjects us to-not only those of us on this side of the parliament but also the community-almost on a daily basis. Here today we have clear evidence that the minister distorted the facts, because on 19 June last year she said something different from what we are debating today. The line in the movie is: 'Were you lying then or are you lying now or is it that you are just a chronic, habitual liar?' Mrs Crosio-It is a good line.",32
18,Mr RICHARD EVANS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"The Parliamentary Secretary· to the Minister for Social Security, who is at the table, says it is a good line from a good movie. But it is so apt when we speak of the minister and of the Labor Party's history in power: they will say and do anything to stay in power. What did former Senator Graham Richardson say? He said, 'We will do whatever it takes.' Mrs Crosio- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. A previous point of order was taken by the opposition when one of our speakers was on his feet, the member for Newcastle, in not referring to the bill and in not bringing the facts before us in the debate. I would ask you to draw the honourable member's attention to the debate that we have before the House and also to the contents of the bill. As I have said, we are debating a particular bill. If he has not got the understanding of it and has to go to personal abuse, perhaps he should go back and ask to speak later on.",33
19,Mr TUCKEY,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, not understanding order 145 which, of course, relates to question time.",33
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,I do ask that the honourable member for Cowan adheres to the particulars of the bill as closely as possible.,33
21,Mr RICHARD EVANS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have in fact referred to the bill on a number of occasions. The parliamentary secretary is accusing me of personal abuse. I have not actually got into personal abuse yet, but I will stick closely to the bill.",33
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,I suggest the honourable member does not get into personal abuse.,33
23,Mr RICHARD EVANS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,I certainly will not. Yesterday we again saw an example of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) placing his own interpretations on reality and calling it truth. Mrs Crosio-What is the bill about?,33
24,Mr RICHARD EVANS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"It is a tax increase. Your government is very good at increasing taxes and trying to hide it as some sort of great social order. It is a tax increase. The Prime Minister was found out yesterday-and this is the same Prime Minister who promised l-a-w tax cuts; the same Prime Minister who promised that all senior Australian citizens would be off the tax system; the same Prime Minister who said he would not raise taxes; the same Prime Minister who said that he did not believe in a consumption tax but used stealth to raise tax for the indirect wholesale sales consumption tax, which, for the parliamentary secretary's benefit, increases on 1 July. The Prime Minister just cannot be believed when it comes to these sorts of quotes. He has a great quote which I would like to use in this forum on debate on this bill. He said: The other basic social ill facing Australia. . . is the problem of workers having two jobs ... It is bad enough for the working man to be dragged away from his home at night when he should be with his wife and family but it is even worse when he has to send his wife out to work in order to make ends meet ... Husbands have been forced to send their wives to work in order to provide the necessaries of life. Young mothers have been forced out of their homes by economic pressure . . . In the last couple of years the Government has boasted about increasing the number of women in the work force. Rather than something to be proud of, I feel that this something about which we should be ashamed ... Is it doing anything to put the working wife back in her home? It is not. The Prime Minister said those words early in his career in this place. How true they are of today. The Minister for Human Services and Health also has a few skeletons in the closet when it comes to those sorts of issues. But the fact is that Australians have lost faith in their politicians---:and we can blame none other than the Labor Party for that. This bill amends the Medicare Levy Act. But why are we amending the act? Frankly, it is to raise the Medicare levy. The reason a universal health scheme was introduced was to help those Australians who could not afford the medical system. It has been welcomed by many Australians, and the message the coalition has is that we will not be altering the basic bulk-billing requirements of the health system. It is working for a lot of Australians. In fact, the appointment rate has increased. The average appointment rate prior to Medicare coming in was about four appointments per year. It is now up to about 10. So more people are using the health system. But in Australia we also need a viable private health system, and it is unfortunate that it seems to be driven down by those opposite. Even the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) agreed earlier today in this debate that Medicare was never meant to cover everyone; rather, it was supposed to. supplement the private health system or vice versa. When former Senator Graham Richardson was health minister, he said that should work towards having a private health system that retained 40 per cent of health users within the private health system and that, if we did not, we would create operationment al difficulties within the health system. the number of people with current private health insurance equates to only 36.3 per cent. Over the year of 1994, the total drop was per cent. But just in the first quarter of 1995 the proportion decreased to 35.6 per cent. At this rate we can expect that private health insurance fund membership will not be much more than one in five within a decade. Yet the former minister, former Senator Graham Richardson, said that we needed 40 per cent within the private health system. On its own estimates, the cost to the government is $60 million per year for every one per cent reduction in private health fund membership, but I am sure many people would agree that it is more like $100 million a year. This is an increase in the cost of health. This bill tries to regain some of these costs. But what sort of impact will it have on the battlers of Australia? This is a tax collection rort and a great distortion, because the Medicare levy does not go any way towards paying for the total cost of health outlays. We need private health users, yet this government seems set on reducing the number of members of private health funds. I believe the government is taking its own constituency for granted and that this will be reflected at the next election, particularly in marginal seats. It is very interesting that Labor Party marginal seat holders never seem to speak about tax issues and tax increases in here. In fact, they are hardly ever here. They are probably out electioneering. Last year the approximate levy collection was about $3 billion. The total collection for private health funds was about $4 billion. In other words, a total of $7 billion was collected to pay for health costs. How much did we pay back? Through Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits we paid out about $7 billion and in private health payouts we paid a total of about $3.5 billion. Simple arithmetic says that the combined we benefits outlays of approximately $10.5 billion are a bit different from the amount of the total collections. So raising a levy is no panacea of problem solving. All the governis doing is adding it to consolidated Yet revenue. This adds more to overall expenditure requirements, which seems to be a government requirement because it really is 2.1 overspending in a lot of other areas. The member for Bonython mentioned the OECD and its report on Australia. Those opposite always mention the OECD, the G7 and all these other great organisations. However, they never compare themselves with other countries. As I said, the member for Bonython mentioned the OECD. However, he failed to mention page 125V of the report, which said: In considering future reforms . . . it would be useful to have regard to whether the intended role of private insurance is a substitute for a top-up to public arrangements. In other words, from what I can gather from the debate so far, the government really does not have an idea as to how to operate a viable private health system. The government has been warned that it needs a viable private health system, yet it continues to fail to act. People are falling out of the private health system very quickly, but the government still does not act Members of the Labor Party would be happier if the private health funds closed up shop for they have not listened to what is happening within the health industry. The bottom line is that, if we do not get supplementary funds from the private system, we will have to draw on the public purse. Quality health care is something that cannot be delivered on the cheap. The coalition recognises this. As much as we realise that we need to contain costs, we accept that this cannot compromise the basic quality of care offered in our health care system. Labor, by contrast, seems to have lost sight of this wider view of health care as it seeks to increase its revenue take on the one hand and screw down health care resources on the other hand. The decision to increase the levy is misguided in my view. Most Australians believe that health is important but it is getting worse, not better. If one surveys one's electorate, as I do often, besides debt management, health care is an important issue. Let me give an example of health care and how it seems to have gone off the rails. A constituent of mine, a lady called AnitaPerceval, has a son called Sam. Anyone with young children will realise that an ear· infection is very common in young children. Her young son Sam waited with a painful ear infection to get some grommets put into his ear. They were put in his ear, six months later they fell out, and he now has an infected ear again. The point is that he has an eight-month wait before he can get those grommets put back in, otherwise he will have to pay $500 up front to have them put in now to relieve the pain. Although the health system is universal and it does help most Australians, as the parliamentary secretary probably would agree, the point is that most Australians have to wait for health care. Why should a person like Sam, who is only three years of age and who is in constant pain, have to wait eight months to get elective treatment? There are some problems with the health system and we are not necessarily addressing them. Putting up tax levies is not necessarily addressing them either. We oppose this bill. We oppose this tax increase because it gives nothing to this health care system that struggles to do its best with the resources that it has--even with them stretched to the limit. Australians quite rightly expect more value for their health dollar but they seem to be getting less in quality and less in quantity. The bill does not address the particular needs of health care. In my view it is a broken promise by the minister. Therefore, I support my coalition colleagues in opposing this amendment bill.",33
25,Mr BRADFORD,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"As the member for Cowan (MrRichard Evans) said, the opposition will vote against both the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1995 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1995. I will deal, firstly, with the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. Perhaps the opposition needs to keep spelling out why it is going to vote against these pieces of legislation. The answer, very simply, is that they result from broken promises and we refuse to be. a party to broken promises. We believe that our credibility in this place is at stake if we vote in favour of broken promises. One of the reasons for politicians being held in low esteem in the community these days is that promises and statements are made by ministers and prime ministers and, not long afterwards, the reverse is done. We will not condone that. All of us on this side of the House will be in here when the division is called to show the Australian people that we are opposed to these tax increases. I make the point very clearly that in June 1994 the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) completely ruled out any increase in the Medicare levy. She was not ambivalent about it. She did not say, 'It is a possibility that in the budget we will have to get more money via this means.' She ruled out an increase and was unequivocal about it. What is now happening? We are going to vote on a proposal to do exactly what she said would not happen. In my view-and this criticism has been made by some Western Australian members-the minister has no credibility at all in this regard on account of her activities in Western Australia prior to coming here. I will not pull back from criticising her on a personal level for her support for the famous safe sex guide because, in my view, that was deplorable. I am pleased that my colleague Senator Herron has already collected 100,000 or more signatures condemning the health minister for spending $250,000 of Australian taxpayers' money on a publication that endorses sodomy. How can a health minister have any credibility when she has endorsed on a number of occasions in this place, in answers to questions, a most unhealthy practice? She certainly has no credibility when, six or nine months ago, she said that there will be no increase in the Medicare levy and now we are being asked to vote for an increase in the Medicare levy. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) aided and abetted that process because prior to the last election he said unequivocally that there would be no tax increases. He was not ambivalent about that. He was taking advantage of a political situation. The opposition was proposing what, in my view, were some very important and, what would have been, very beneficial improvements to Australia's tax system. The Prime Minister then went to great lengths to perform a stunt, but I will not go through it again. Effectively, he brought in legislation-he did not simply say there will not be any tax increases-which was intended to make <;ure that there would be no tax increases .. - Ie also promised Australians that there would be tax cuts. We all now know, a couple of years down the track, that he reneged on that promise. He has twisted his way around it and he has tried to divert attention away from that fact. But, by any measure, he has quite clearly failed to deliver on that promise. This legislation is glaring evidence that the Prime Minister and the minister for health have broken their promises that there would be no tax increases and no increase in the Medicare levy. Let us be certain that when we talk about the Medicare levy we are talking about a tax. People might wonder when a levy is a tax. Let me tell you: a levy is a tax. You can call it anything you like. Whatever it is-a charge or a levy-it is a tax. In many respects there are very good reasons, or arguments, for abolishing the Medicare levy completely and incorporating it within the tax structure. That would be a fairly honest treatment of it. The Medicare levy is far away from raising anywhere near the cost of health care in this country. I have not done the calculation but you probably need a Medicare levy nearer to five per cent, six per cent or seven per cent.",35
26,Mr TUCKEY,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,Twenty-four per cent.,36
27,Mr BRADFORD,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"You probably need a levy as high as 24 per cent to go anywhere near raising enough money to directly pay for health care costs-not that there is any honest attempt, as the shadow minister said earlier, to hypothecate the Medicare levy towards the cost of health care. In that sense there are arguments for incorporating it in the tax scales and for recognising it for what it is: part of the tax system. The increase from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent increases the top marginal tax rate to 48.5 per cent-one of the highest in the world, and we wonder why people in Australia cannot save. People cannot save simply because we have a government in this country that constantly tells us that it is better at spending our money than we are. This big taxing government has done it again in this budget at every tum. Through increasing the Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent, it will raise $250 million per annum on average over the next few years. This comes at a time when many people are struggling to retain their private health care cover. In the last five years, 1.2 million people have dropped out of private health care. Now only 35.6 per cent of Australians across the board have retained private health care. When these 1.2 million people dropped out of private health care, where did they go? Quite obviously they went straight into the public system and onto the end of the queues and the waiting lists. The member for Cowan referred to one particular instance, but each of us can refer to many examples in our own electorates of people who are on waiting lists for surgery of all sorts for varying conditions. I wonder why people are not given a true opportunity to choose between being in private health insurance and not being in private health insurance. Almost all of the 1.2 million people who have dropped out over the last five years would probably tell us that they were forced to drop out simply because they could no longer afford to maintain their private health insurance. One question that keeps coming to mind is why the Prime Minister does not have private health insurance. Surely somebody who earns as much as he does should not be loading up the public system. He of all people should be setting the example by having private health insurance. I presume that if he needed surgery of some sort he would simply take the view that he could afford to pay to go into a private hospital. The fact is that he should not be loading down the public system. Many people wonder why the Prime Minister does not have private health insurance himself. Speaking on behalf of a number of my own constituents, I know that many older people and many pensioners struggle to retain their private health insurance. The bulk of people in the private health system are older people. Almost by definition they see the very clear need for private health insurance. There is a problem in the private health system in that it is harder to encourage younger people to get into it. Clearly the users of the system also the ones who are in it, and they are mostly older people. People dropping out of the private health system will have the effect of making it more expensive. Once the costs are spread across a smaller number of subscribers, private health insurance will become more expensive despite the government's latest ham-fisted attempts to try to fix the problem. Many aged people, pensioners and self-funded retirees will struggle to maintain their private health insurance. Unfortunately, many of them will be forced-not as a matter of choice-to drop out of private health insurance simply because they can no longer afford to be in it. Self-funded retirees-l have many constituents who are in that category-will have to pay this increased Medicare levy. We need to concentrate for a moment on the plight of self-funded retirees in this country. I take every opportunity to do so because I have a large number of them in my electorate. Let me make the point: these are the people who have done exactly what we want every Australian to do. Let us not cast aspersions on those who have not done it, but let us be aware of the fact that these people have been fortunate enough in many casesand frugal enough in others-to have provided entirely for their own retirement. But what reward do they get? They get absolutely nothing. In fact, they get the reverse. They have been consistently treated badly by this government for having done the right thing and provided for their own retirement. They will pay the increased Medicare levy. They will be slugged by that. They will struggle to continue to pay their private health insurance. They get the double whammy of this budget: they get an increased Medicare levy but they do not get their promised tax cuts. Obviously, by definition, they have already retired, so they do not benefit in any way from the government's you-beaut plans to convert the tax cuts into some sort of superannuation contribution down the track. So self-funded retirees miss out there. Things become increasingly difficult for them. Families, despite some minor changes to the thresholds of this legislation, will pay the are increased levy. Many families who are in private health insurance-these are often families with young children or young married couples intending to have children-want to be able to make the choice of going into a private hospital. They will struggle to maintain private health insurance, and they will pay the increased Medicare levy as well. There are lots of very clear reasons why we should oppose this tax increase. I make that point very purposefully. We are talking here about a tax increase. We were promised that there would not be any tax increases, and we will not allow the government to get off scotfree. One member of the government is in this House at the moment, the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay). As my colleague observed, very few government members will come in here to face us in these debates on tax matters, probably because they are hanging their heads in shame. But we will drag them in here to vote on the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill, and they will vote in favour of it. We will sit on this side during the divisionwhich I assume will occur early this afternoon-and vote against these tax increases. Hopefully, the people will observe government members sitting on that side voting in favour of tax increases. We will also oppose the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill for pretty much the same reasons. It is a consequential amendment bill because it relies on the top marginal tax rate. It is also simply another broken promise. For the same reasons I have already outlined, we will vote against that bill. That is our objection. What is a promise worth? Obviously not very much. I suppose that most Australians who have listened to the government making these promises or who have read about them will shrug their shoulders and think, 'Well, that is a political statement of some sort.' where is the credibility? There is none. The government made promises. They were not ambiguous promises, ambivalent promises or even equivocal promises; they were promises that something would not happen, yet it did. That is why we are objecting to this. What is the difference between a broken promise and a lie? I suggest to you that there is absolutely nothing. That is why we had the debate in here yesterday after the Prime Minister made a statement accusing the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) of having said something which he had not said. Naturally, the Leader of the Opposition took exception to that. I think we had to have that debate. I suppose this was the debate that we 'had to have', if I can borrow that terminology. We clearly exposed to the people of Australia-as if it needed any further exposure-this Prime Minister's incredible capacity to tell other than the truth and to attempt to get away with it. But he did not get away with it yesterday. That little exercise exposed him for what he is and he was caught out. Mr Lieberman-He was stunned.",36
28,Mr BRADFORD,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"Yes, as my colleague says, he was stunned by that yesterday. We will continue with that type of exposure in the run-up to the next election. I believe that this election will be about credibility. This debate today is about credibility. We are debating today what seem to be, in a sense, in terms of revenue measures, fairly small issues-but they are huge in terms of the question of credibility. The debate today really focuses on the credibility of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Human Services and Health who could make absolutely clear statements about tax increases and Medicare levy increases, yet we are asked today to vote in favour of these increases. We will not do that and, in this particular matter, we will show all government members up for what they are. The fringe benefits tax, which we are dealing with here, has been a resounding success for the government since it was introduced in 1986. I note from the budget papers that this year it will raise almost $3 billion. I say that it has been 'a success', but But I am not sure whether that is the right way to describe a tax. It certainly has been successful in collecting a whole lot of money. There have been many inconsistencies with the way the government has gone about applying that tax, and the government has reversed some of those in recent legislation. However, there remain three areas of concern: the application of the assessment process; the application of fringe benefits tax to business expenses, which are not exactly benefits to employeesI noticed that my colleague the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) in his contribution to this debate dealt in some detail with that-and the impact on the fringe benefits tax on the pattern of spending, particularly as it affects restaurants and the tourism and accommodation industry. As a result of this legislation, fringe benefits tax now is set and will be set retrospectively, incidentally, by a couple of months to 48.475 per cent. It will go the full way to 48.5 per cent from 1 April 1996. One of the problems is that this is higher than are some employees' tax rates-and that, of course, would apply mostly to part-time employees. So cashing out from any employers is not an option-and that, of course, means that this is just one way in which the FBT mechanism is flawed. There is no doubt in my mind that the imposition of this tax has been extended way beyond its original intentions. It might have been one of those things which was a good idea at the time, although I never supported the way it was imposed on employers rather than employees-but I think the horse has bolted well and truly on that. The fact is that it has gone way beyond its intentions. We now see situations, particularly where award requirements or deals are negotiatedenterprise agreements between employers and employees-that actually provide for certain conditions, where they then are clearly not fringe benefits. Yet there are still a number of instances where employers are being required to pay fringe benefits tax on benefits which are not in that sense benefits at all but are requirements of the employee's job. I will finish on that point. I am very pleased and proud to stand here today and say that we will vote against these tax increases. I hope it will be appreciated by the people of Australia that we want to restore integrity to the political process. I hope we will; I believe we will. I believe that we will not promise things we do not intend to deliver. When we win the next election, we will not have our leaders running around saying that things are other than they are. I want to see integrity restored to the process and, in my view, our vote today will be evidence of that.",38
29,Mr LIEBERMAN,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX AMENDEMNT,"The legislation increasing the Medicare levy, the subject of part of this debate, is legislation to increase taxes-taxes the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised he would not bring in. Under this legislation, the Medicare levy is to be increased from 1.4 per cent to 1.5 per cent. The fringe benefits tax legislation-I will refer to this very briefly because I mainly want to talk about the health policy, the budgetary policies and the broken promises attached to that-will only reinforce in the minds of many people in Australia, particularly in small business, that this government is intent on raising more and more revenue from the very people who will provide the greatest hope for recovery in Australia and will provide the greatest job opportunities for our unemployed, particularly our young. Of course, I refer to small business. Wherever you go in Australia- Mr Deputy Speaker Snow, I know that you are attentive to the needs of your constituents-you hear small business people lamenting the high cost of compliance imposed on them by government taxes. In fairness, they are not just federal taxes; they are also state taxes-but certainly they are predominantly federal taxes. These people mention their dismay at the ever increasing costs, particularly in relation to fringe benefits. I take the opportunity to again record my dismay on behalf of many Australians at what this government is doing. I also take the opportunity to place on the record again, in the few minutes I have, that on 26 February 1992 the Prime Minister announced in his One Nation statement that he would deliver tax cuts in two rounds, costing $3.5 billion each. He said that new tax scales would be introduced in two stages-on 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996. On 9 February 1993, in another statementthe Prime Minister has a propensity for launching statements with rather generous descriptions of them; this one he called Investing in the nation-at the National Press Club, when questioned about the promised One Nation tax cuts, he said: They are not a promise, they are law-L,A,Wlaw. And the difference between a legislated tax cut in some Opposition speaker's manifesto is all the world of difference, and they were signed into law at the end of the last parliamentary sittings. After the election, back at the National Press Club on 22 July 1993, the Prime Minister announced that 'the tax cuts now legislated are to be paid in two parts-one in July 1994 and the second in January 1996'. In the August 1993 budget, the then Treasurer announced that the timing of the income tax cuts rate scale changes announced in One Nation would be altered but that the tax cuts would be delivered. That is on the record. What do we find now in June 1995, a little over two years since the Prime Minister made these commitments on 9 February 1993, when he reminded Australians that legislation had been passed through this parliament to ensure that his promises would be delivered? We find that in its first two budgets this government has, in fact, broken its major promises regarding no new taxes and has increased taxes substantially. I will briefly review them. In the 1993 budget the Prime Minister introduced new taxes to reap about $3 billion a year in unused long service leave taxes and annual leave lump sum payment taxes, it increased tax on credit unions, it increased fringe benefits taxes and it brought in an increased general rate of wholesale sales tax-up two percentage points. I remind honourable members that one per cent came in last year and the other one per cent comes in on 1 July this year. Those things are as a result of last year's budget. We have not even seen the effect of the increases in the budget being debated during this session. The Prime Minister increased the general rate of wholesale sales tax, as I said, by two percentage points. He put an extra sales tax on wine and cider. He increased petrol excise by 7c a litre for leaded petrol and 5c a litre for unleaded petrol. The country people of Australia, some of whom I represent in my electorate of north-east Victoria, would love to tell the Prime Minister personally how that has impacted on their family budgets, their businesses and their costs because of the extra fuel that country people have to use in their everyday living, let alone in their employment. He increased tobacco excise in the 1993 budget and introduced a departure tax. Those were the taxes that he said he would not introduce but were in fact introduced. Now in this budget, in this bill, we see an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent, which he promised he would not increase. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) gave a commitment on behalf of the government that Medicare would not be increased, even after the election, even after the months when it was obvious that the government knew it was in a financial dilemma and that it was pulling the levers the wrong way in mismanaging the economy and had to stem the haemorrhage but was not courageous enough to stem the haemorrhage and manage the services of government efficiently. In this budget, apart from the Medicare levy, we see an increase in company tax from 33 to 36 per cent, which will raise another $320 million. I remind honourable members again that much of that extra revenue will come from small business, which has not, in many cases, recovered from the recession, which has depleted its reserves-most small businesses are operating on an overdraft and higher interest rates which have increased three times in the last 12 months. This government is now asking those people who create new employment in Australia to bear a greater tax burden, after he promised them he would reduce their corporate tax rate to 30 per cent. He now wants to increase the rate to 36 per cent. The extension of sales tax in this budget to certain building materials raises another $215 million and will impose extra costs on many people, particularly young home buyers, up to about $1,000 or so. There is some debate about the amount. I think the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) would know that I am about right when I say that figure. The sales tax on passenger motor vehicles will raise $330 million and a greater sum over the four years of something in excess of $1,400 million. With that scenario we then look quickly at the health position and we see that what the government is doing is adding to the costs of running families-in this case an increase in the compulsory Medicare levy. - he.direct effect of that will be an acceleratIOn m the number of people who will exit from priv.ate health insurance. We are already headmg towards 700,000 to 800,000 Australians who have exited in the last 18 months or so. In the 12 years of Labor government, we .h-ve probably seen in excess of three mIllIon Australians exit from private health insurance. The consequence of that is that it has added to the cost of running the Medicare system, added to the cost of the provision of public health care in Australia. So it is sheer madness for a government, without putting in place some means of ensuring that families will remain in private health insurance, to increase taxes through the Medicare levy at this stage. It will only accelerate the number of people who will depart from private health insurance. - onse­ quently, it follows as a n;tatter of. lOgIC t?at more people will be seeking publIc hospItal care in the next year or so. The cycle will then get worse as more and more people join the queues in public hospitals, as more and more people seek essential services, as more and more people want to know why they cannot get it straight away, as more and more problems occur, such as the one the minister for health referred to in her ministerial statement last week about mistakes in hospitals-perhaps even worse-where, unfortunately, some 14,000 Australians appear to have suffered great misfortune due to problems in hospitals. Many, not all, of those problems were attributable to hospitals being unable to cope with the increasing demand on them due to the number of people exiting private health insurance and looking for what the previous Prime Minister Mr Hawke promised on behalf of the Labor government-access to public health care whenever you want it because you are part of the Medicare system. It is clear that this legislation is only to make the position worse. The health minister, I am sure, if she were given the opportunity to be frank, would exclaim that this legislation should be defeated; would agree with the opposition that it is only going to make her task harder to provide these services.",39

32,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Do you concede that Australia's high foreign debt, which the Labor Party took from $23 billion in 1983 to $167 billion today, is one of the main reasons why Australians pay the highest commercial interest rates amongst major industrialised countries? Is it the case that an Australian with a $100,000 mortgage is paying $5,000 in interest more than an American with the same mortgage on the US adjustable home loan rate? Is this as good as it ever gets for home buyers in Australia?",41
33,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact that Australia has increased its foreign debt over the last decade and a half is something which is attributable to the deterioration in our savings performance going back to the middle of the 1970s. going As has been acknowledged by a member of the Liberal Party executive, the fastest rate of growth of foreign debt in Australia was during the period when the now Leader of t-e Opposition was Treasurer. That growth m debt is something that we would rather not have happening in this country, but it has to do with the fact that we allowed that weakness to develop in terms of savings during the period of the late 1970s and early 1980s. I refer to Treasury statement No.2, page 35 of Budget Paper No. 1. Talking about the current account deficit, it says: Whereas in the 1960s and 1970s the deficit averaged 21,4 per cent of GDP, in the 1980s and 1990s it has averaged 4Yz per cent, with much of the deterioration occurring in the late 1970s and early 1980s.",41
34,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Who was in government then?,42
35,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The late 1970s and early 1980s was when the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. That is the Treasury's view of when the deterioration occurred. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, essentially since we have been in office, after the first two or three years, the level of debt as a proportion of GDP has largely been stabilised. In fact, in recent years-in the last year or two-it has come down from a bit over 40 per cent to 37 per cent. Yesterday's figures showed only a slight increase. That was solely due to valuation effects-not to any underlying increase in debt in Australian dollars, but just valuation effects due to the devaluation of the Australian dollar. The foreign debt situation has improved in recent years-in the last couple of years. It has been this government's job to try to make up for a situation of substantial deterioration which occurred during the period of the previous government. In terms of the future, obviously it is important that we get that current account deficit down. In the budget I have announced major steps towards achieving that. Those steps will involve our being able to tackle our not too flash savings performance, by way of improving our budget dissaving to get the budget deficit into surplus and to bigger surpluses in the out years so that we do not have public sector dissaving and that major drag on the national saving performance; and a major boost to private sector savings through the superannuation initiatives, which will certainly have a dramatic impact on household savings in the course of the next decade or two. Those are fundamental, sound structural changes to savings in this country which will have enormous impact in terms of our current account performance in the future. As the Treasury has pointed out in statement No.2, the major factor behind the current account deficit moving to 4Yz per cent of GDP average in the eighties and nineties was the public sector decline, and it is the restoration of that public sector savings performance which this budget brings into absolute focus. In terms of the wholesale market, interest rates have been moving down notably, and anyone who looked at the papers today would have seen that the 90-day bank bill rate is less than the official overnight rate-less than 7Yz per cent-and that the long-term bond rate has come down to about 8.6 per cent from over 10 per cent not so long ago. Clearly the markets are looking at Australia and saying that inflation is substantially under controland of course it was a lack of control over inflation, going back over the last couple of decades until the latter part of the 1980s, which gave Australia a burden to wear in terms of higher interest rates. The markets have made it clear that, unless we restore credibility over a long period, we wear the burden of higher interest rates. We have established lower inflation in this country. We now have.a strongly growing economy with low inflation, and that is something that could not have been dreamed about a dozen years ago when we came into office. It is something which is absolutely in place now. We have had low inflation for the last several years, and a continuance of low inflation is certainly something that the markets now expect. As we earn our spurs, we will see our interest rate performance get better and better. Member for Deakin",42
36,Mr LANGMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Justice. Has the minister seen media reports today of comments made yesterday under privilege by the member for Deakin concerning serious allegations of criminality involving the laundering of money by the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade? What is the government's response to these allegations? What steps should be followed by members who believe they have material disclosing offences against Commonwealth laws? Have they been followed in this instance?,42
37,Mr LAV ARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No doubt all honourable members are now well aware of two speeches which the member for Deakin maqe yesterday outlining the most extraordinary allegations against not only the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Costello, but also other officers of that department as well as Mr Leibler, a private citizen and well-known lawyer involved in the ethnic communities of Australia. The gentlemen concerned-certainly Mr Costello, Mr Leibler and the other gentleman named by the member for Deakin-have very strenuously denied the allegations made against them. Those allegations have also been strenuously denied by the responsible ministers, Senator Evans and Mr Bilney. Members of parliament do enjoy certain privileges, and one of the most fundamental is the right to come into either chamber of the parliament and make statements without fear of civil suit for defamation. That is an important privilege which members of parliament should, rightly, enjoy. However, if that privilege is to continue to be enjoyed and if its use is to be respected by the Australian community, there has to be an exercise of responsibility on behalf of members when they avail themselves of that privilege. The exercise yesterday by the member for Deakin is quite clearly an expressed breach of that responsibility. If any honourable member, including the member for Deakin, has matters which he or she believes disclose offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, the appropriate course of action is to refer those matters to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. There are obviously two clear reasons for this. The first is that, in our legal system, people are presumed to be innocent until proven gUilty. People are entitled, if charges or allegations are made against them, to have those allegations pursued by the police without the glare of publicity and without the consequent damage to their reputation. The second, equally obvious, is that, if there were some grain of truth to these allegations, as bizarre as they may seem, the making of such public statements-an abuse, in my opinion, .of the forms of this House-would prejudice to some extent the capacity of the Australian Federal Police to conduct an investigation without the subject of the allegations being forewarned and maybe taking appropriate steps. I am pleased to note that a number of members of this parliament, including prominent members of the opposition, have completely dissociated themselves from the member for Deakin and his remarks. I note the very full statement issued by the shadow foreign affairs minister outlining his support, after speaking to Mr Costello and accepting his assurances on this, and dissociating himself from the remarks made. I also note the comments made by the member for Chisholm this morning: Mr Aldred would have to be very careful that his information is solid or he'd be in very serious trouble. I don't think it's a very good use of the parliament. It is a clear abuse of the privileges which members of parliament enjoy. The honourable member does no credit to himself and to this institution by the way he performed yesterday. Wage Levels",43
38,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. On 30 May in parliament you referred to the problems in the US 'in terms of falling real wages and the vast number of working poor'. The unemployment rate in the US is much lower than in Australia. Real average weekly earnings in Australia are now lower than they were in 1983. According to the Union Bank of Switzerland's latest survey of prices and earnings around the globe, an unskilled builder's labourer in Los Angeles earns wages 90 per cent higher than a comparable labourer in Australia. How can you say to those labourers that this is as good as it ever gets?",43
39,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What an absolutely ridiculous question. On 30 May I was referring to statements made by the US Secretary of Labor at the OECD in which he said that he was greatly concerned about the fact that the United States labour market had produced relatively low unemployment, which was a good thing, but at a price which he saw as being very high. He was greatly concerned about that price-that price being that there was tremendous disparity in wages within the labour market and that disparity had meant that there were lots of working poor. Mr Costello-And they have better wages than we have in Australia.",43
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked his question.,44
41,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the kind of outcome which is there in the United States. I am doing this from recollection. The figures produced in the OECD job study show that, if you take the wage at the top of the lowest decile of wage and salary earners and compare it with the wage at the bottom of the top decile, the disparity for Australia was about 2.23 times and for the United States was about 5.4 times. So there is a markedly greater disparity in wage outcomes. This means that within the United States there are many people doing very well and many others doing very poorly, even though they are in full-time employment or are largely employed. Pointing to one building workerMr Costello-No, it is the rate! It is the rate!",44
42,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"building workers, of course, being one of the highest paid groups of manual workers in any society-obviously does not say anything. They are comparatively well paid in Australia. Mr Costello-But 90 per cent lower than in the United States!",44
43,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Building workers are well paid in Australia in comparison with other workers of a similar skill level. We all know that to be the case. It is true in the United States and everywhere else that building workers are generally relatively well paid for their skill level. This comparison of the wages between two countries, of course, is fraught with all sorts of dangers, and one cannot simply make that comparison validly. Mr Costello-You started it.",44
44,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I didn't. Mr Costello-Yes, you did. You did!",44
45,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,44
46,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is an idiotic circumstance. What I said on 30 May, referring to the labour market in the United States, was, 'We don't want that labour market here.' You do; that is what you want. You want a totally deregulated labour market. You want a labour market which would have the outcome that the Secretary for Labor in the United States went to an international forum and said was a bad outcome and one that he was greatly concerned about. That is the kind of outcome that you would like. The opposition is trying to imply here that there are some higher wages in the United States than there are in Australia. Certainly it is true that GDP per person employed in the United States is higher and that the wages probably on a translation across to Australia are higher. That is because it is the richest country in the world in terms of income per head. Of course it has got higher real wages taken as an average. The important point is that, if you are concerned about battlers-as you say you are-then the United States labour market is the one which does nothing for battlers. It is the market which produces these enormous disparities and which produces an outcome of large numbers of working poor in circumstances where real wages, which is part of Mr Reich's comment, had not been increasing for years. In the United States the median wage had not been increasing at all. In fact, the wages of many people were going backwards. That is the kind of circumstance which the United States government is rightly concerned about. We do not want to see here the kind of deregulation of the labour market which the opposition has called for over time and was there in large print in Jobsback. That kind of real labour market, which would be produced by that kind of outcome, by stripping away the safety nets, would certainly bring about much more of a US style disparity in terms of wage outcomes than we have known historically in this country. It would certainly bring about large numbers of working poor and large numbers of battlers. There would be a lot more battlers for a Liberal-National Party government to be concerned about. Government Debt",44
47,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House about the current level of debt by Australian governments and how this compares with other countries? What are the prospects for future debt levels?,45
48,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the case that Australian government debt is low by international standards. I thank the honourable member for asking me a question about this issue, because the impression is being created that Australia has large amounts of government debt. That is simply not true. Net debt in Australia for all levels of government is about 27.3 per cent of GDP in 1995 compared with the average for OECD countries of 44.3 per cent. We are at 27.3 per cent and the OECD countries on average are at 44.3 per cent.",45
49,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is that good, Ralph?",45
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor!,45
51,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you look at some particular countries, Germany is 46.8 per centGermany, which stands there as a countryMr Downer-So now we have a comparison.",45
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mayo!,45
53,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"representing the epitome of financial rectitude in most people's eyes, a much higher level of government debt as a proportion of GDP than we have. The net debt in France is 35.5 per cent; Italy, 124.3 per cent; the UK, 47.8 per cent; the United States, 40 per cent; Canada, 66 per cent; and New Zealand, 37.9 per cent. Since comparisons are increasingly being made between us and New Zealand, the House might like to take particular note that net debt in New Zealand is 37.9 per cent of GDP while ours is 27.3 per cent. So, quite clearly, Australia's debt is well below the levels of other countries. I am talking here about all levels of government, not just the Commonwealth. If Australian debt levels were equivalent to the OECD average, our additional debt would be some $78 billion. The recent budget ensures that our debt will reduce considerably over the next four years. That is because we have moved to a budget surplus in 1995-96 with increasing surpluses over the out years-building from $700 million in 1995-96 to $7.4 billion in 1998-99. Those surpluses will lead to a reduction in Commonwealth general government debt by almost 30 per cent as a share of GDP, taking us down-this is the Commonwealth only-from 19.1 per cent of GDP to 13.7 per cent. These are very considerable reductions. On current projections, general government debt for all levels of government in Australia will fall to 20 per cent of GDP by 1998-99bearing in mind that the OECD average is currently 44 per cent. This would represent a very rapid reduction in public sector debt by international standards. The only other Western country looking at substantial debt reduction over the next few years is New Zealand. I think it is worth the House bearing in mind that New Zealand's revenue to GDP ratio for 1995-96 is 37.7 per cent. Mr Harry Woods-How much was that?",45
54,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is 37.7 per cent, which is five per cent higher than the ratio in Australia for all levels of government-that is, tax revehue, as a proportion of GDP in New Zealand, is five per cent of GDP higher than in Australia. If Australia had a revenue to GDP ratio equal to that of New Zealand, we has would be raising around $24 billion more revenue and we would have a budget surplus of $24 billion or five per cent of GDP. Of course, we would have taxes higher by $24 billion. The government has obviously taken the view that we do not need to have taxes that high. Our revenue is already at a level which is enabling us to move, with the additions in the budget, to a position of surplus, and we will be moving into-as I have already mentioned-considerable debt reduction over the next few years. I will conclude by saying that it is perhaps useful for the House to note that the European monetary union has established a set of convergence criteria which member countries have to satisfy before the process of monetary union can proceed-before they can move into the third stage. Those criteria currently are: that inflation should be less than 3Y2 per cent; that bond yields should be below nine per cent; that a general government deficit should be less than three per cent of GDP; and gross public sector debt should be below 60 per cent of GDP. There is only one European country that meets all those criteria at the present timeand that is Germany. Australia, however, does meet all those criteria. That, of course, indicates that we meet the standards of good governance established by the European Union for states wishing to move into the third stage-with a good performance on inflation, bond yields, general government deficits and public sector debt. Australian Dollar",45
55,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also directed to the Treasurer and is an interesting followon from his answer to the last question. Does the Treasurer acknowledge that the Australian dollar has declined in value, in this year alone, by eight per cent against the US dollar, 10 per cent against the British pound, 11 per cent against the New Zealand dollar, 16 per cent against the German mark, and 22 per cent against the Japanese yen? Does this continual fall in the value of our currency not mean that the government's boast that it has built Australia's economic strength over the last 13 years is a myth?",46

61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right! The member for Calare!,46
62,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is the case that there has been a devaluation of the Australian dollar against all of the currencies that the honourable member mentioned in his question in the course of this year. That follows an appreci- . ation against all of those currencies, except probably the Japanese yen in the latter half of last year.",46
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ha, hal",46
64,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We get idiotic laughter from the Leader of the Opposition. It is undoubtedly the case that there was that appreciation. Mr Costello-Where was the dollar in 1983?,46
65,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There was that appreciation. What we have seen in the first half of this year is an unwinding of that appreciation. We have also seen most countries in the Western world-in fact all of them-devalue against the Japanese yen, so there is nothing particularly exceptional about that. The unwinding that has occurred this year is an unwinding against our appreciation last year plus the particular impact of the Japanese yen appreciation against everybody. The Japanese yen is of particular significance to us because it is so important to us on a trade weighted index, given Japan's importance as our No.1 trading partner. I do not think it is particularly helpful to enter into a discussion with the House about the future of the dollar, and I do not intend to do that. But I can say that the policies that have been put in place by the government are for the betterment of the Australian economy. We have policies which see us attacking savings to improve our savings performance in ways that I have already mentioned in answer to a previous question and which see us growing substantially with low inflation in a circumstance where market interest rates are declining. These are circumstances which are governing for the good of the country. As I said in answer to the previous tion, on the basis of the good governance criteria established by the European Union, we meet all of those criteria. Therefore, we affairs. are in a position where, despite adverse terms of trade and the drought, we are able to produce some fundamentally good economic . performance. Our difficultly is in relation the current account. The policies that have been put in place in relation to savings are fundamental to an attack on that. With breaking of the drought and that approach national savings, we are set fair for improveservices ment in the current account in years to come. Health Costs",46
66,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the· Minister for Human Services and Health. Is the minister aware of reports that the Western Australian Minister for Health, Mr Graham Kierath, has plans 'to embark on a big campaign to shift health costs onto the federal government'? What is the government's response to these comor ments?",47
67,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Perth for his question. I did see those comments in this morning's paper. It is extraordiWestern nary, given the attitude of the other ministers at the health forum on Friday, how out of step Mr Kierath is. He has threatened 'to embark on a big campaign to shift health costs onto the federal government' and he has threatened a showdown at high noon in Alice Springs next week unless the Commonwealth delivers. That is very much a confrontational and, think, irresponsible approach that is at odds with the attitude taken by other ministers. In the light of the Australian hospital care for study, all of the other states have indicated that they want to work cooperatively with another and with the Commonwealth. We minister have had an assessment of the effects of private health insurance changes on governments and also the extent to which they have engaged in cost shifting to What was seen from the Western Australian minister, although he did hear some of the discussion of ministers via telephone, was typical shoot from the hip reaction which have come to expect of that government in Western Australia-the cowboy actions of quescowboy government, its eyes off the ball again, out of step with the rest of country and increasingly erratic in the way it conducts its Any move by the WA health minister along the lines that he has outlined to promote cost shifting will certainly backfire. I would like to to draw his attention not only to the fact that the Commonwealth provides very substantial funding to the states under Medicare to enable the them to provide a comprehensive range of to public hospital in-patient and out-patient but also to the fact that we will adjust the hospital funding grants if they cost shift to that extent, and that is listed in this year's budget. More than that, the particular arrangement that Mr Kierath points to would result in doctors being prosecuted. They would be in breach of the respective Commonwealth acts. We intend to take very firm action indeed against any states, individual public hospitals doctors who cost shift to the Commonwealth in that way, using provider numbers inappropriately and illegally. Mr Kierath says that he is interested in Australians and does not want them to suffer. I must say that I have not noticed that in any of his previous policies. Let us look at the facts which surround the claim that he is interested in their well-being. First of all, the Western Australian government should particularly look at its very dismal record on health expenditure to find the real I causes of the problems. For example-and I will table the appropriate graph-in 1993-94, its first full year in government, state funding hospitals from its own sources fell by 20.6 per cent in real terms. It took $100 million one out of Western Australian hospitals. The has the temerity to suggest that he is going to shift costs onto the Commonwealth. the state It has already removed them. It is very clear that Mr Kierath either does date. not know what is happening in his own budget or simply refuses to acknowledge it. I think that what he is actually doing is a shaping up for the upcoming budget because we all the signs are that the state government intends to cut funding further. We have seen a a 20-odd per cent reduction in funding from the state government in the face of a 31 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding. This in one draw and out the bottom draw policy is apparently going to be exacerbated under this new minister. This is an environment where Western Australia is growing rapidly and its revenue is growing rapidly, yet the government there is prepared to penalise hospital funding in that state. Taxes are going up as well. This is very cynical and tawdry politics and is very much at odds with the views of all the other health ministers. I point out that, far from being innocent of this practice, Western Australia has already attempted to cost shift by threatening last year to close down the radiation oncology unit at Royal Perth Hospital and pass on the costs, at that stage, to the consumers and the Commonwealth. Fortunately, we heard about this and the Commonwealth stepped in directly . We are now providing funding to enable a continuing radiation oncology service in one of our major teaching hospitals in Western Australia. In that case, arrangements are in place to recoup any additional Medicare benefit schedule outlays. I call on that minister to withdraw those charges and make sure that his actions do not actually result in doctors being charged and their tax records perhaps being examined as a result. If they are using their provider numbers and claiming income that is not theirs, I am sure that there will be other people interested in this matter besides the health minister. Company Tax",47
68,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. In answer to a question on 30 November last year, you said that the government's reduction in company tax to 33c was 'done with an eye to structural change' which was 'to provide some longer term encouragement to investment'. You further stated: So I don't think it would be a case of simply saying, 'Well, now the economy is growing we can rip all that away'. Is the increase in company tax announced in the budget not reversing that structural change? Why should any battling small business believe anything you say when you are doing precisely what you said you would not do'rip all that away'?",48
69,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are not ripping all that away. Let us look at the history of company tax since we have been in office. When the now Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer he had a company tax rate of 46 per cent. Under us that rate was increased at one stage to 49 per cent, but in the context of there being full imputation for dividends. The Leader of the Opposition had a. 46 per cent rate and double taxation of dividends. We increased that rate to 49 per cent, but in the context of bringing in full imputation. We took away double taxation of dividends. That was a major boost to shareholders in this country and a major attraction for people to invest in equities. We then moved to reduce that rate to 39 per cent and then, later on, to 33 per cent. There have been major steps taken in the area of company tax to reduce the rate by some 13 per cent below what it was when we came into office and to remove the double taxation of dividends. In addition, the investment allowance, brought in as a temporary stimulus to investmentnevertheless, with the effect of cutting effective company tax rates-the development allowance and the 150 per cent write-off capacity in research and development, which is an increasing attraction for companies to undertake research and development and reduces their effective company tax rate, have been very stimulatory for companies in this country. In this budget we. have increased the company tax rate by three per cent, which takes it back to 36 per cent, but it is not, as the questioner implied, a reversal of the previous decision. We made that decision to take it back to 36 per cent as a means of saying that, in terms of the current need for us to increase revenue, the best and obvious place to look is to those areas where major concessions have been given in the context of the recession and its aftermath. Clearly, companies have been given that substantial benefit. As also mentioned in the question, we are concerned to have a structural change in company tax for competitive reasons. When we reduced it from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, we had an eye on the rates in other OECD countries and in the region. Clearly, in looking at the possibility of increasing that rate again, we were concerned not to move too far away from the rate of 33 per cent because of those competitive factors. The movement up to 36 per cent still leaves us in the competitive range, particularly in the context of there being full imputation still applying in this country. We are one of the few countries in the developed world that gives full imputation for company tax. That is still there 100 per cent. The other allowances, such as the developmental allowance, are still there. The investment allowance is now starting to phase out but it is still affecting levels of company tax being paid. There is no ripping away of the benefit, as mentioned by the questioner. The fact is there was some reversal of that decision but only a partial reversal. In looking at the need for there to be fiscal tightening in this country, it is appropriate for companies who have high levels of profits, and had major concessions on their company tax rates effectively, to bear some of the burden of that increased need for fiscal tightening. In the circumstances that we face, the decision taken is thoroughly reasonable. There has not been a great deal of complaint from the corporate sector about it. Commission of Audit",48
70,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also directed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen proposals for a commission of audit into the Commonwealth's financial position? What is the Treasurer's response to those proposals? Is it intended that those proposals will be adopted?,49
71,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. I have seen a proposal for a commission of audit from a Mr Des Moore in a publication last February from the Institute of Public Affairs. Mr Moore proposed the establishment of an audit commission as part of a proposal to cut Commonwealth government expenditure by $15 billion to $16 billion. He said that such a commission would comprise a panel of independent people, such as himself no doubt, to evaluate Commonwealth expenditure. Mr Moore is full of ideas as to what such a commission could recommend.",49
72,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why are you attacking him?,49
73,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In his view, massive savings . could be made in government expenditure.",49
74,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Michael, stop him, please! It is quite personal.",49
75,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for O'Connor!,49
76,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He suggests the following: an 11.8 per cent cutin social security, a 13.4 per cent cut in health, a 39 per cent cut in labour and employment, a 43 per cent cut in housing and community amenities, and a 66 per cent cut in culture and recreation. They are the sorts of broad cuts he envisages in order to get $15 billion to $16 billion out of this commission of audit. In social security, he proposes a 12-month limit on unemployment benefits to save about $1 billion. So after one year on those benefits you will receive no more benefits-saving about $1 billion. On the age pension, he proposes to end the automatic indexation. So, apart from an odd one every now and again if you felt like it, there would be no more indexation. He also proposes that eligibility for the age pension be raised from 65 years to 70 years. On child care, he proposes to do away with means tested fee relief and have a regressive 25 per cent tax rebate to save $500 million. He also proposes the following: for health services, a $5 per visit charge to the doctor to save a billion dollars; in public hospitals, a full charge for the first day's treatment to save $460 million; the abolition of the general system of pharmaceutical subsidies to save $434 million; for education, reduce the number of beneficiaries of Austudy by 100,000 to save $300 million; on culture, sell the ABC and end taxpayer funded film finance to save $79 million, phase out the Australia Council; and cut out government expenditure on sport and recreation and so on. That is the kind of agenda that Mr Moore said would be possible through a commission of audit. I can assure the member for Werriwa that the government does not intend to adopt Mr Moore's proposal. We already have one of the smallest public sectors amongst developed countries. Because it is well targeted, we have been able, nevertheless, to ensure that we have an adequate social wage which provides substantial support for people on lower and middle incomes. As the Minister for Social Security said in question time yesterday, the social wage has been greatly increased under this government, with a 75 per cent real increase per capita under us compared with a 17Y2 per cent decline under the previous government when the current Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. I have noticed that the establishment of a commission of audit has been proposed by the opposition since February, by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his post-budget speech at the National Press Club. In proposing this commission of audit, the opposition is following a well worn track of Liberal oppositions at the state level in this country. They have done it in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia. In every case, it has been used as a device to hide their real intentions to impose swingeing cuts in government expenditure and to increase taxes. In other words, they have said, 'We can't tell you what we are going to do. We will have this commission of audit. When we have the commission of auditfrom independent people, of course-we will know exactly what we are going to do.' In each case, it has resulted in these swingeing cuts in expenditure and increased taxes. So it would be in this case. If the Leader the Opposition were being really honest with the Australian people in his so-called headland speech tonight, the speech would probably be called 'Cape Tribulation' for the great affliction it would impose on the Australian people--especially on the so-called battlers whom the opposition so cynically claims to represent. Housing: Sales Tax",49
77,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of complaints by the member for Page that the price of homes worth $75,000 have gone up by more than $3,000 in his electorate as a result of the government's 'battler bashing' sales tax on hardware? The member for Page has complained that about half of that increase should be attributed to the sales tax increase-that is, about $1,500. Why is the Treasurer deliberately targeting battlers, as identified by the member for Page, in the taxation rip-offs of the 1995 budget?",50
78,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There has not been an increase in tax yet.,50
79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yet! Mr Costello-Four weeks to go.,50
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,50
81,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The building tax increases announced in the budget will come in from 1 July, so any increase in prices that was already being imposed would obviously be imposed before any tax obligation was in place. It is just a rip-off of the home buyer. It is deplorable if that is occurring in the economy at present. I thoroughly condemn such behaviour. There has been a lot of argument about what the actual impact of the building tax extension would be. The government has maintained that the minimum impact would be in the order of $300 for a very modest home.",50

83,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Both sides will come to order!,50
84,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said, $300 for the cheapest home and something in the order of $450 to $700 for a median new house across of Australia, and in the capital cities probably a little higher than that-something in the order of $500 to $800. Those are the sorts of figures that the government has discussed with the industry. Mr Bruce Scott-So you were right, Harry.",50
85,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Maranoa.,50
86,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The industry has tended to argue that the impact would be much higher than that. We do not accept its argument. There has been detailed refutation of those industry claims by the Taxation Office and the Treasury. The government stands by its forecast as to what the impact on the average home would be and the budget forecast which would be for this year-that is, 1995-96-to raise something in the order of $215 million. So there is no impact at that stage. It does not come in until 1 July. When it does come in, we stand by the figures that were used in the budget. Commission of Audit",50
87,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Has the minister examined six recommendations on the work required of a Commonwealth commission of audit? What do these recommendations entail? Is the government intending to implement them?,51
88,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honourable member, I have seen six recommendations on the task for a commission of audit. It was contained in that speech plagiarising Des Moore by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, when he got up, as the one policy announcement, the one proposition that he put forward as his response to the federal budget. He wrapped himself in the cloak that he loves to wrap himself in of deep knowledge of the budgeting processes of the Commonwealth. Naturally, one would be tremendously impressed. Naturally, all things are new that he proposes. Naturally, the government, of course, has failed to implement any of the suggestions that have been put forward-which are, after all, just the list he got from Des Moore of common sense propositions in terms of accounting processes as opposed to his 'uncommon' sense propositions in terms of what cuts he wanted to put in place. Let us take a look at each of them so that I can settle in his own mind that there is no requirement for his occasional night reading in this regard. 'The first task for the commission of audit,' he said, 'will be to identify contingent liabilities of the Commonwealth, including public service superannuation.' Perhaps he might like to refer back to the statements made by my predecessor as Minister for Finance which established accrual accounting as the basis of Commonwealth reporting for Commonwealth departments from this point on, and note that all Commonwealth departments from this point on are doing precisely that. Perhaps he might also like to have a look at the actuarial reports on superannuation liabilities of the Commonwealth superannuation and public sector schemes, the Defence Force retirement and death benefits and the military super and benefit schemes which were tabled in parliament in June 1994. Mr Costello-When the Auditor-General said he would not name the liabilities, you dropped him.",51
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Finance will wait.,51
90,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He does not know what he is talking about so I always enjoy his interjections.,51
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you will wait for a minute. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition does get some grace in this place by virtue of his position; and it is starting to wear a touch thin.",51
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grace in this place from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was not a term I would have chosen to use, Mr Speaker, but nevertheless I would not quarrel with you. As to the impacts of demographic change on Commonwealth outlays and how to make provision for them, I should just suggest that he read through the budget statements as they go through, for example, all the family policies that we have put in place, the assessments which are placed on where we see the development of families going, the $12.6 billion that are put into deal with their problems. Perhaps he might even move on from that and take a look at the superannuation propositions associated with the budget, and listen perhaps to the statements we have been making about the ageing of the population, the the impact that that has on health, the impact that that has on potential liabilities of the Commonwealth in the years out there in regard to the old age pension, and start to acknowledge the fact that we are addressing it and he is not. Then he goes on and says 'the preparation of a full Commonwealth balance sheet'. As he would know from having seen those statements on the movement of all departments to accrual based accounting, the Commonwealth is in the process of preparing balance sheets which do precisely that. He also says 'the state of the Commonwealth infrastructure and the private and public measures required to restore it to the levels required for the next decade'. He should look at the EPAC report. EPAC has reported, in draft form, into the Commonwealth on where it sees infrastructure spending going. EPAC is seeking comments prior to presenting a full report on that later this year. He then says 'the financial performance targets for Commonwealth departments'. Virtually all areas of budget now do that, as a result of moving over to accrual accounting. Then he says 'the level of duplication between Commonwealth and the states in the delivery of services and measures to promote more efficient delivery' . He should ring his colleagues from the various state bureaucracies. There has now been undertaken for some considerable time, associated with COAG, a roles and responsibility review on precisely these matters. I can give him a figure if he is actually looking to this to provide him with some area of comfort as to whether or not there is a costly overlap which might produce a saving. My department, on the examination it has made so far on this, announced a while ago that it sees a saving in running costs of some $30 million in this area. That is about $30 million associated with a number of Commonwealth bureaucrats overseeing the distribution of resources. Given the answer made by the minister for health, I am not at all sure we can afford to lose those bureaucrats and the running costs that are associated with them, given the performance the states are starting to show up on attempts to shift to the Commonwealth the cost of their own obligations. He has clothed himself in this set of propositions, which were supposed to make him look like an economically responsible opposition spokesman-a man with a plan when he gets himself into office. Every single proposition he put forward was covered off years ago by the Commonwealth. If it was not covered off years ago, it is in the process of implementation. Housing: Sales Tax",51
93,Mr CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I ask my question on behalf of Mr Lu of Mirrabooka, an area of battlers that has been savaged by your government. Mr Lu signed a contract to have a home built on 3 May this year. He moved out of his present home to sell, and rented a house while waiting for his new home to be built. Mr Lu has now been informed that the cost of his house has gone up and he says, 'I cannot meet the difference to the actual cost of the building to be built. I will have to stay on the rented premises and pay rates on the vacant land as well.' Why should Aussie battlers be forced to fund your government's bribes through a tax on the great Australian dream? Before you tell us that the impact of your up all dishonest tax is only $400 on a $100,000 house and land package, please tell me in which Australian capital city one can get a new house and land package for $100,000. Finally, do you suggest that I say to Mr Lu: 'Keep on renting, mate. This is as good as it gets?' Mr W1LLIS-1 think you should tell Mr Lu to be thankful that the coalition is not in government, as he would be wearing a 15 per cent GST on his house. This is a minor extension of tax in relation to building materials, a tax of 12 per cent on a small additional number of items, compared with the 15 per cent tax that the coalition would have imposed, were it in government, on all building materials, including all those not taxed by the government. This includes all of the main structural items like the bricks, the roofing tiles, the cement, the gravel, the walls, the doors and the windows. All of the main structural items which are not taxed by the government would have been taxed at 15 per cent by the opposition. I think you should tell Mr Lu to be very thankful that the government is in office, because if the Liberal and National parties were in office he would be paying much higher taxes than he will be paying with this extension of tax on building materials, which is of a minor nature. National Competition Policy",52
94,Mr SIMMONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant' Treasurer. Is he aware of concerns that the national competition policy threatens local government and the deli very of essential community services? How is the government proposing to address those concerns?,53
95,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Calare for his question. When all governments signed up to the national competition policy in April, we all agreed to publish policy statements on the implementation of the competition principles agreement by June of next year. In other words, we all agreed to layout a blueprint of what we would be doing individually to achieve a more competitive economy and to ensure that competition serves the public interest. The protection of the public interest and the delivery of community service obligations, or CSOs, are just as important as the drive for efficiency. As I said last week, those state governments which are rushing to privatiseand that is not part of the competition agenda-should be taking the time to read their agreement carefully and to spell out how they will be delivering their CSOs into the future. I am aware of concerns that community service obligations are under threat, that the disadvantaged may suffer with the removal of concessional pricing of water and electricity unless governments have effective CSO policies in place. Unlike the states, the federal government has policies on CSOs and, might I say, a proud record of delivering them. We have introduced competition but retained the universal telephone access and the standard letter rate across Australia. State governments need to spell out how they will be looking after their disadvantaged citizens and they need to spell out how they will be delivering their CSOs into the future. Each state government also has to consult with local government on how these reforms will apply to them. I note that members of the National Party in particular have been going around to local government authorities scaring them, such as the member for Maranoa, who said in a .press clipping, 'Reforms could hasten the death of rural communities.' The only thing that will hasten the death of rural communities is headlines like this that are generated by scaremongering or if state governments do not accept their responsibilities. To assist governments develop their detailed implementation statements, I have sent a reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, whose chairman asked me this question. I will be asking that committee to look at the application of the public interest tests. I will be asking it to have a look at the implications for federal government. I will also be asking it to see how governments are currently delivering community service obligations and to look at options for ensuring that they continue to be delivered efficiently into the future. I am looking to the inquiry to provide firm guidance on how the economically and socially disadvantaged can be assured of access to basic services such as electricity and water just as we provide access to the postal and telecommunications systems, while the community as a whole receives the benefits of the competition policy package. I wish his committee well. Attorney-General's Department: United Nations Committees",53
96,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Attorney-General. I refer him to the Senate budget estimates committee meeting of last week when his department refused to provide details even of the nature of complaints taken by Australian citizens to three United Nations committees. I remind the Attorney-General that the officers of his department refused to provide the information to the parliament until they had checked with the United Nations committee. Did Australia end appeals to the Privy Council to ensure the independence of the Australian legal system? Why has your government now abrogated Australian sovereignty by denying information to the Australian parliament without first getting permission from a United Nations committee?,53
97,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the honourable member is referring to complaints made under the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which allow Australian citizens to make complaints to the Human Rights· Committee of the United Nations. This is the process which led to the Toonen complaint and the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, which no doubt the honourable member recalls quite well. The standard requirement which this particular optional protocol calls for is to respect the privacy of the individuals who make complaints to the UN committee. Given that there are many regimes in the world where a complaint against the government by a citizen may lead to some unfortunate consequences to that citizen, one can understand why there may be such a requirement imposed by this particular optional protocol. I did become aware of the questioning of the departmental officers in relation to the disclosure of the general nature of the complaints. I have in fact advised my department that I did not think the response given by the officers was satisfactory. I believe that the Senate committee and, indeed, the parliament are entitled to be given certainly outline material as to the nature of the complaint, obviously respecting the privacy of the individual. I will ensure that. happens. Australian Broadcasting Corporation",54
98,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Would the Minister inform the House about the recent decision by the ABC to continue its Australia TeleVIsion service? Would he advise the House about any actions the government may be taking to support this decision ? Would the Minister also inform the House what progress has been made in implementing the parliament's decision to award the ABC a licence for two pay TV channels?,54
99,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ABC agreed to establish Australia Television for three years as a condition of receiving $5.4 million from the government in 1992. It is no surprise, I am sure, to the honourable member for Leichhardt and to members on this side of the House that the ABC board should be looking at the future of Australia Television since we are now reaching the end of the period covered by agreement between the government and the ABC to provide the Australia Television service. After reviewing Australia Television's revenue and expenditure, the ABC board considered a number of options at its meeting last week, on 31 May. Professor Armstrong, the chairman of the ABC, has advised me that at this stage the ABC board has decided to continue the Australia Television service. That is something which I know a number of members strongly support. The board has announced that the operational costs of Australia Television will be reduced. As an interim measure, up to $2.5 million would be provided by the ABC board to continue the service for 1995-96. I can advise the House also that the government has agreed to the ABC board's request to bring forward the program evaluation of the ABC's international broadcasting services. This will include a review of the performance and funding arrangements for both arms of that international broadcasting service-that is, Radio Australia and Australia Television. The government will also look at options concerning Australia Television's satellite transmission costs and any potential savings in the National Transmission Agency's international transmission costs as part of this review. I can assure the House that the government enters this review as a supporter of the contribution which Australia Television has made in raising Australia's profile in the region. I am very pleased that today in the Senate Senator Tambling, perhaps after a lead given by the member for the Northern Territory, indicated his personal support for the continuation of Australia Television. I would hope that an increasing number of members of the opposition would also indicate their support for Australia Television. This might be slow forthcoming, given the fact that the coalition's spokesman on communications has not missed a single opportunity to take pot shots at the service and the audience reach that it has established in the last three years. To refer to the second part of the honourable member's question, a very important initiative of the ABC recently has been the establishment of Australian Information Media, the ABC's pay TV subsidiary. Honourable members would be aware that AIM has already acquired substantial investment from Cox Communications and John Fairfax Inc. In addition, it has been able to secure programming and financial contributions from CNN and Nickelodeon to build up those two channels-the two channels being the news channel and the combined children' s/entertainment channel. I would invite all members of this House to take the opportunity next time they are in Sydney to visit the ABC's Gore Hill studios and look at the new premises which have been put together by the ABC to provide the news channel. I was impressed by the quality of the facilities. I understand that this particular newsroom will be only the fourth in the world to be using complete digital technology from go to whoa. That is something for which the ABC and its commercial partners should be commended AIM is currently negotiating with a number of distribution mediums to distribute their pay TV services. I understand commercial negotiations are continuing with Galaxy, Foxtel and Optus Vision. AIM is looking at a startup date of 1 September this year for its two channels. Honourable members would understand that the government has placed a pretty onerous local Australian content requirement on those two channels, and we think that, given the ABC's past performance in providing good quality programming, we can look forward to the start-up of these two channels. The government's support for this can be contrasted with the views of Senator Alston, the opposition's spokesperson, on pay TV. Senator Alston, in one media performance, made .the following comment: To have a very substantial news channel as the ABC is proposing in pay TV must inevitably have serious consequences for the quality of its free-toair services. So Senator Alston on that occasion had very serious concerns about the ABC being involved in pay, yet he is the very senator who moved the amendment in the Senate that forced the ABC to be involved in pay TV. Just like everything else that Senator Alston has said on media policy he continues to be incoherent and inconsistent, and we look forward to a new spokesperson some time soon.",54

The spokesperson told the West Australian that only $4.9 I million would be spent over four years on advertising the Working Nation program. In answer to a question on notice, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training said: . .. total funding allocated in 1994-95 to meet costs for the Working Nation media campaign is $4,950,000. Further, in answer to question number 2041 placed on notice by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the minister said: The total budget for advertising and publicising the Working Nation package is $14.2 million to be spent over three years, commencing 1994-95. I assume the $4.9 million is one year's funding from the total of $14.2 million.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",57
124,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hindmarsh) (4.12 p.m.)In this matter of public importance debate, let us first of all be clear about what is under discussion. It is not Aboriginal heritage, it is not Professor Cheryl Saunders and it is not Doreen Kartinyeri; it is the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Tickner) and his responsibility as minister for the fair and just administration of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act and for what he has done, as a consequence of his action, to Aboriginal heritage. The first question, Minister, is: did you the evidence before you made your judgment on Hindmarsh Island, or is it true you made up your mind irrespective of the evidence? Minister, did you ever have it in your mind not to ban the bridge? There were 400 representations, none of which you saw and none of which your staff member could have read in the short time that was available to her. Indeed, Justice O'Loughlin found that you had not considered the evidence. His judgment states: in my opinion, the evidence that had been before the court in these proceedings has as a matter of probability, that the Minister not give any ""consideration"" to the representaMinister, you said you made up your mind on the Saturday morning, 9 July, to ban the Hindmarsh Island bridge. What evidence do we have that you made your mind up after considering all the evidence? We have none, because you have produced none. But we have lots of evidence to suggest that you had already made up your mind before the Saturday. First of all, there is the fax on 7 July to the Office of Legislative Drafting confirming that the declaration would be for 25 years. It is true that Justice O'Loughlin has considered this, but let us consider it a little bit further, shall we? How on 7 July, if you did not make up your mind until 9 July, could your office fax to the draftsperson that the declaration would be for 25 years? Presumably, Minister, because declarations are usually for 25 years. Is that true? Minister, when we go back your previous two declarations, what do find? Twenty years and five years. So, was just a draft declaration in case you had make it, why did we not go by past preceup dents? There is something else. Is it not true that ATSIC had recommended a ban for four years on this Hindmarsh Island issue on 7 July? Here we have previous declarations made for 20 and five years, ATSIC recommends four; and what does the minister do: he puts out a draft that says the declaration will be for 25 years. This is somebody who has not made up his mind. Did he ask for two drafts, one maybe for five or 10 and one for 25? No, just the one for 25. That is the first piece of evidence. Second, there are I believe five statutory declarations-and I am sure another member could produce the three if you would like them tabled-which state that on Friday night, 8 July, at an Aboriginal ball a statement was made that the Hindmarsh Island bridge would be stopped, the information coming either from you or from your office. How could that it, announcement be made at an Aboriginal ball if you had not conveyed that information? Was the person who said it not telling the truth? Why would anybody get up in front of a ball and say· that if it were not the truth? There are five statutory declarations. The person supposed to have made the has not denied it-and funny, Minister, I have not really heard you deny it. Next, we have the conversation with Dean Brown-do you remember that?-last Thursday. That was the absolute proof. You said Dean Brown knew that you had not made up your mind at 10 o'clock on the Saturday morning. But what do we find? Mr Tickner-'Had' or 'had not'-which one is this?",57
125,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That you had told this parliament that you had not made up your mind on 10 July at 10 a.m., or close to 10 a.m., when you spoke to the Premier. That was your defence on Thursday to the allegations made against you. What did Premier Dean Brown say? He said, 'I was so conto vinced that the minister had made up his we mind that I called the Prime Minister and if this tried to speak to him.' So much for to Thursday's defence. In conclusion, you made your mind before seeing the evidence. In fact, you had never any other intention but to ban the bridge. Let us have a look at something even a little more serious than this, and that is the declaration itself. When we look at the declaration, the story becomes curiouser and curiouser. First of all, we have the declaration that you are to sign faxed from your Canberra office to your home in Sydney. It is faxed there. You get the fax and you sign it with your signature to send it back. What happens to this fax in your home, Minister? It has disappeared. It has been suggested that the baby ate it. Is this the way you conduct your official business? Do you have a dog? If you have a dog, do we conclude that the dog could have eaten it as well? An official fax disappears from your home. What is more, there is not one fax log record to show what time that fax arrived. What happens next? The minister has signed then it gets lost. But it is faxed before it is lost back to the Canberra office with the date and time on it. This is the second record. We have lost the first; now we have got a record as it goes back to the Canberra office. What does the Canberra office do with it? It cuts the top off it. Minister, do you always cut the declaration tops off your faxes?",58
126,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Every day.,59
127,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Every day. I will tell you when you cut the tops off your faxes, Minister: it is when somebody asks you to disguise something. This is not just an ordinary fax. Minister, you are aware that you are talking here about a $175 million deal, the developers are talking litigation and you have discussed the litigation with the Prime Minister. So you know what is at stake, but your office cuts the tops off the faxes. You then fax the mutilated copy off to the Gazette. What does your office then do with that fax it has just faxed off? It loses it. It loses the next fax. The lawyers asked for it, appealed for evidence, and no-one can find it. ATSIC does not have it; you do not have it; and your office does not have it. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I seek to draw your attention to the fact that the member for Hindmarsh has, from the beginning of her presentation, repeatedly spoken directly to the minister instead of speaking through you.",59
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins}-I remind the member for Hindmarsh to address her remarks through the chair.,59
129,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let us have a look at the minister's next fax. ATSIC does not have it; the minister does not have it; the minister's office does not have it; and we presume the baby does not have it-we are only assuming also that the dog does not have it. So what do we have here? At the very best interpretation, we have a sloppy minister who runs a very sloppy office and, at the worse, a deliberate attempt to destroy the only means by which we can establish the timing of the decision making process. We have three fax catastrophes-and I remind you that Lady Bracknell said that one mistake is unfortunate; two is careless. Why should we not conclude that three is deliberate? Let us have a look at your defences.",59
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member will address her remarks through the chair.,59
131,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let us have a look at the minister's defences. His first defence was that his office cut the top off the faxes because they were to be camera-ready. That is not how I make faxes camera-ready. I photocopy them and tidy them up. Indeed, Minister, is this not what they had to do at the Gazette anyway to insert a map in the middle of the declaration? Your second defence is that Justice O'LoughlinMr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a further point of order. I must insist that the procedure in this chamber be pursued by the person speaking-that is, that member speak through the chair.",59
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Hindmarsh will address her remarks through the chair.,59
133,Mrs GALLUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister's second defence is that Justice O'Loughlinhad cleared him. But Justice O'Loughlin said: The consequence of these findings is the conclusion that there has been a fundamental failure by the Minister to comply with the statutory obligation that he consider the representations before deciding whether to exercise his power to make a declaration under section 10 of the Commonwealth Heritage Act. So much for that defence. Then there was Dean Brown, but we know what happened to that defence. We also have the minister's statement that the case is under appeal. Is it not true that the reason the case is under appeal has nothing to do with any of the things we have discussed? That is a particularly spurious defence. The fourth defence is probably the most pathetic of all-that is, in attacking the minister the coalition is attacking Aboriginal people. Next, Minister, we have your failure and refusal to look at the contradictory evidence. Surely, it is important for the minister that, when Aboriginal people rediscover their traditions and culture that have been lost through dispossession, forced resettlement and migration, they discover the truth. To suggest otherwise is to debase those traditions and that culture. Any person interested in the truth and anyone concerned with the integrity of Aboriginal culture and its preservation would surely want such claims investigated. Yet an investigation has been denied, even condemned, by you, Minister. To dismiss the concerns of Dorothy and Dulcie Wilson, Bertha Gollan and other senior Aboriginal women as unimportant and irrelevant must be one of the strangest sleights of hand perpetuated by a minister who claims to support all Aboriginal people. Under the guise of supporting Aboriginal people, you have taken sides and you have deliberately dis empowered one group of Aboriginal women. Certainly, Dorothy Wilson must be today contemplating the high personal cost she has had to pay. She might ask: why is the minister not prepared to speak out against her vilification? Why is he so silent about what has happened to the most defenceless of Aboriginal people? What does the minister suggest is her motive for speaking out-money, glory, fame? Perhaps, Minister, it is the desire for truth. I make no judgment about the truth as Dorothy Wilson believes it or as Doreen Kartinyeri believes it, and neither should you, Minister. The real tragedy of the whole Hindmarsh Island debacle for Aboriginal people is that, without an investigation that settles the controversy one way or another, this confusion and these contradictory stories can be exploited elsewhere to cast doubts on Aboriginal heritage issues. The cause of Aboriginal people can only be served by the truth. It is because truth was abandoned in favour of political expediency that myths such as terra nullius were perpetuated. In getting rid of past lives, let us not into the trap of adopting a process that would allow us to perpetuate new ones.",59
134,Mr TICKNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (4.27 p.m.)-All over Australia Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are quivering in their boots at the prospect that the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) might one day assume the office of Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The fact is that on every single occasion that the coalition has a choice between defending the heritage values of indigenous Australians and supporting other interests-whether they be developers or someone else-the coalition supports the bulldozer above the rights of indigenous people. We have seen a tawdry track record from the coalition in dealing with this Hindmarsh Island bridge issue within the parliament and outside the parliament. In the course of my remarks, I am going to say something about the opposition's conduct in dealing with that issue. First of all, let me put on the public record that my actions in this matter, in issuing the declaration to protect the area from desecration, have been supported by no lesser authority than the Commonwealth parliament. Both houses of the Commonwealth parliament have endorsed my actions and have refused to support the disallowance motion moved and supported by the coalition in both houses. I can say to indigenous people that, when I speak, I speak with the support of the parliament. They ought not to think that because the coalition in this place refuses to stand up for their interests the rest of us do not care about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and are not prepared to speak out and stand up for what is right. I want to pose a challenge to any member of this House, any member of the press gallery or any member of the public to read the judgment of Justice O'Loughlin in relation to the heritage declaration and, as appropriate, read the transcript of the court case that gave rise to the judgment. I wimt to say that, almost without exception, every single issue that has been canvassed extensively by really fall only two major media outlets-the Adelaide Advertiser and Network Ten-and by a few columnists like Piers Ackerman, was received, considered and rejected by Justice O'Loughlin. I will give you five or six examples of the slurs that have been issued against me and against indigenous people in this matter and the way they were independently considered by the court and rejected. I stand here on the floor of the parliament with the support of the parliament having gone through a judicial inquiry. I have been there. My actions have been before the court, scrutinised to the most minute detail and I have walked through that process and emerged with my integrity intact and my actions in respect of the matters challenged by the coalition vindicated by no less an authority than the Federal Court of Australia. I will take members through some issues. One issue that has been raised in the media is that I issued a declaration for a different period than that recommended in advice to me. Yes, this is true, but this is also a matter that has been considered by the Federal Court of Australia. Mr Justice O'Loughlin made it clear that the decision maker in this matter was not some bureaucrat and not some staff member but me as the relevant federal minister. It was my decision. How did I issue a declaration different to some of the advice put to me by some of the bureaucrats? I had regard to the Saunders report. If you look at the Saunders report, you will see that she did not support a declaration for a limited period. For days on end we have had this slur against former members of my staff-people who are not in a position to defend themselves and who have gone on to other careers-that somehow or other they mutilated documents to destroy evidence. That was raised in front of Mr Justice O'Loughlin. Every word and every minute detail on the timing and date on which faxes were sent and how documents were dealt with was raised in front of Mr Justice O'Loughlin. Every single scrap of evidence that has been hurled publicly by some of the columnists in the Adelaide Advertiser and by some of those on Network Ten has been raised in the Federal Court. What did Mr Justice O'Loughlin decide? He decided that I had not prejudged the matter. He decided that that evidence was not to be supported. It has been alleged in the course of public debate on this issue and supported by the coalition that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in some way provided improper advice to the applicants in this matter. Mr 1ustice O'Loughlin considered that too. As the member for Barker (Mr .MCLachlan) ought to know and certainly the member for Hindmarsh ought to know, he rejected any impropriety on the part of ATSIC. . It has been said consistently that I prejudged this matter. All this nonsense that I somehow predetermined the matter was argued like Blue Hills in the Federal Court. It went on for hours and hours. Members of my staff were cross-examined. What did the judge say? The judge said that I had behaved properly in this matter. It was alleged in no lesser an authority than the Adelaide Advertiser, I think on Saturday, that the fact that I had caused the preparation of a draft declaration was somehow prejudging the matter. Mr Justice O'Loughlin considered this and he said that I had behaved prudently. He made it clear that I was working to a tight time frame. If the South Australian Premier had said to me, 'Look Robert, we will have a cooling off period. We will call off the threat,' then things might have been a bit different. But that was not what it was about. My best recollection of what the judge said in relation to this matter was that it would be a dereliction of my duty if I did not act in such a way as to ensure that there was no gap between the expiry of a section 9 declaration and the issue of a section 10 declaration. He said that I used a prudent course of action in ensuring the preparation of a draft declaration. The Adelaide Advertiser knew all that. If Colin James, who I understand has won a Walkley award for his efforts, keeps going the way he is going he should send back the award. This guy knew when he wrote the story that the court had expressly considered this matter, yet the Adelaide Advertiser put this on the front page of its paper. Another accusation has been made by journalist Geoff Easdowne who most of the time wrote all of his stories without even bothering to talk to my office. If I recall the article appropriately, he said that somehow or other I had ignored legal advice with respect to compensation. I have done nothing of the sort. Read what Justice O'Loughlin said about my actions in this matter. He said that I was a prudent minister and that I cared about the taxpayers. Read what a judge of the Federal Court of Australia said. There are some other matters I wish to raise in the course of this debate, but one thing that I would like to say is: is it not extraordinary that whenever there is an opportunity for the coalition to exploit a political issue then respect for the independence of the judiciary and the judicial process go out the window? You are supposed to be the upholders of the traditional views in this country. You are supposed to be the upholders of standards of propriety and ethics. We are talking about a case that is still before the Federal Court of Australia. What we have seen from what I have already said is a conspiracy between a number of key members of the Liberal Party and, I believe, the solicitors for the Chapmans. Some members of the media have either been conned into being a part of this or have been unwittingly used as stooges in this. What they have done through a series of newspaper stories is re-run the arguments expressly rejected by the Federal Court of Australia. I will say some things when I am ready about the nature of conduct that has gone on behind the scenes and the way this has been run. I happen to believe that the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), despite the fact that we have disagreed on some things, is, in a number of respects, an honourable man. I ask him to read the judgment of the Federal Court and look at the evidence. I saw what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said when asked about the conduct of the member for Barker. A journalist said to him, 'If you got someone's private documents, you would deal with them the same way, wouldn't you?' The Prime Minister said no. Of course he would not. I would not either. Do you think that if we happened to be in opposition I would do what you have done in respect of these assertions and re-run this court case?",60
135,Mr COBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Daryl Melham did.,62
136,Mr TICKNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is an entirely different story. I will tell you the difference. Firstcourts ly, the document in question was a single page and this was eight kilograms of documents. Secondly, the document in question did not relate to a current court case. Thirdly, it was a highly political document. There are a number of other key distinguishing factors. This was a case of misdirected, highly confidential, private mail that contained legal documents. Let us judge the difference between the standards of the shadow Attorney-General, whom we do not always agree with, and the member for Barker. One thing that the member for Barker can be sure of is that when you are down and you are troubled, as the song says, you have got a friend. Your friend is the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). No matter what you do and what you have done in respect of this matter",62
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The minister will address his remarks through the chair.,62
138,Mr TICKNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course. The Leader of the Opposition has nailed his colours to the mast in respect of this matter. The colours that he has nailed to the mast are not those of the shadow Attorney-General; they are those of the member for Barker. He has put in writing, despite all his atrocities, that his respect for the member for Barker remains undiminished. In the limited time available to me I want to tum to some more general matters raised by the widely drafted matter of public importance, but which have not been addressed in the course of the remarks made by the shadow minister. She has been critical of my administration of the federal legislation-not the Hindmarsh Island bridge issue but generally. I want to say something to this House about the approach that I bring to bear in dealing with that legislation. I am deeply conscious of the responsibilities that I have, as the federal minister, in dealing with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Heritage Protection Act. I have incredibly onerous responsibilities and they weigh heavily on my shoulders now as they always have done in my time in this office. I do have to balance competing interests, but I am also guided by in how I administer the act. In the case of Bropho and Tickner there is very clear guidance to me about key aspects of how I administer the act. While I have been administering this legislation, I have always tried to bring about mediated or negotiated arrangements to settle matters. I particularly refer to the Broome crocodile farm; the Strehlow collection; and my efforts-even in the face of all the warnings from the member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), who told me it was literally an impossible task-to work with the Northern Territory government to resolve the Northern Territory-Alice Springs dam issue. In all those matters, I tried to operate in a way to bring people together. I ask the people who might read the Hansard to consider the way I have administered the act. Have I appointed some lackeys, some people who are best friends or close allies of the Labor Party, in calling for reports as I am obliged to do under the legislation? I appointed Fred Chaney for goodness sake. I appointed a former judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hal Wootten. I would have thought that Professor Cheryl Saunders was a very eminent Australian for whom we would all have regard. Mr Downer-Is she married to a Labor minister?",62
139,Mr TICKNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If you do not believe me about the independence, competency and integrity of Professor Saunders, read the judgment of Justice O'Loughlin because he praises her independence and integrity. That is the general philosophy I have sought to bear in respect of the administration of the act. Let me conclude on this note. Here we stand in the run-down to a federal election .. What area of public policy is significant for the coalition to address among key issues of public policy as we go to the election? It would have to be Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, which led to the member for Mayo perishing as the Leader of the Opposition. But it is eight months since the member for Hindmarsh promised the public that she would come forward with a policy in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. It has been eight months since the former policy sank in the deserts of central Australia. Eight months later, we have not heard one word of policy. We do not even know whether those opposite would support the continued existence of the federal legislation. I hope this debate will close this matter. it does not close this matter, if you want to keep coming at me, I can assure you I will keep coming back at you with the truth as I have at all times. (Time expired)",63
140,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Barker) (4.42 p.m.)The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) has asked us to look at Justice O'Loughlin's judgment. We should do that because Justice O'Loughlin overturned the minister's declaration. In doing so, he said a number of things. One was that the minister had failed 'to properly consider the representations that were made to him'. I remind everybody in this House that section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Act says that the minister should have taken notice of those representations. He also said that, 'as a matter of probability, the minister did not give any consideration to the representations at all'. The minister has asked us in this House to look at that judgment. We are looking at that judgment. I might also remind him, and I am not particularly critical of her, that Justice O'Loughlin said that his senior adviser's evidence was vague and nebulous. In answering a couple of those rather general justifications, the minister gaveMr Snowdon-What did he say about Chery I Saunders?",63
141,Mr MCLACHLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We will get to that. This minister is the man with no answers. Our shadow minister, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), is right. Did the minister's office give instructions to ATSIC to change the declaration from four years to 25 years? If the minister's office did give instructions to ATSIC the day before the declaration was issued, why was it worded that the declaration will be for 25 years? Why was there no 'if'? The minister is going to go out of here because he will not answer any of these questions. That just shows that he is sure short of the stuff in the middle of the stomach-absolutely gutless. The first point is that the instruction for declaration said, c'You will issue that declaration for 25 years and you will put a map on the declaration.' The next matter I wish to raise is that the minister said he made the declaration on If Saturday, 9 July. All the evidence, he says, points that way. However, Premier Brown rang him on the morning of 9 July, and the phone call finished at about 11.08 Eastern Standard Time. Talk about giving somebody a cooling-off period! After the Premier of the state had given his best view, the minister gave him a cooling-off period of seven minutes. He then rang up his adviser and said, 'Make the declaration.' The truth of the matter is that he made that decision days before. Everybody knows that he made it days before, including Mrs Doreen Kartinyeri who announced it at a ball in Adelaide the previous night. It is absolute nonsense for the minister to get up here and say that those things had not been done. I want to take this minister not only to matter I have just raised, or to the matter the auto scissors cutting the top of the fax or to the matter that he has a whiteboard machine which manages to dispose of faxes either into the nappy or out with the baby's bathwater, but also to the very fact that this matter started back on 9 May because some men from the Lower Murray Aboriginal in Heritage Committee asked 15 Ngarrindjeri women from Murray Bridge to come to a meeting. The purpose of the meeting was because, in their view, the report done by anthropologist Neale Draper-and the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) has a copy of that report, she was quoting from it here November; I do not have a copy but she has-was not good enough for them to get a declaration made. That was the purpose of the meeting. So they invited 15 women along and 'We've got a lady called Doreen Kartinyeri and she is going to tell you what the women's business is about.' She told them that Hindafter marsh Island was a place where white men's babies had been aborted and so forth. So they wrote a letter to the minister on that without describing the exactitude of that. They went to the other side of the island the people from the Aboriginal legal movehistory ment said, 'That's not good enough.' So they wrote some more words. Do you know what those words are? I the words are in the Sydney Morning Herald of 27 May. The words are direct quotes of the Draper report. Who wrote the Draper report? A man. That was the first letter. All that stuff went to the minister. So the minister had in his ken a letter which quoted a man about secret women's business. Mrs Kartinyeri is seminal to this debate because, as Cheryl Saunders said in her report, 'She is a Ngarrindjeri elder whose knowledge about the women's business central to this report came from her grandmother and her Aunt Rosie, her mother's older sister.' The second invaluable point in this discussion is that three days later, in a letter dated the 12th that the minister had and still has, Doreen Kartinyeri said two things. She said, 'I have recently become aware of the the exact place to which this women's busiof ness refers.' Of course, it was Hindmarsh off, Island. She quoted three sources: her grandfax mother, long since dead; Laura Kartinyeri, currently known as Nanna Laura; and her Aunt Rosie, who died in 1981. So there was only one person alive who was the source of her information. Remember, she was quoted the Saunders report as 'the person who is central to this report'. When Cheryl Saunders was asked in court in December last whether she had ever seen the letter of 12 May that the minister had, she answered that she was very surprised and had never seen it in her life. When you read the in 56 pages of the Saunders report, Nanna Laura-as I will call her-is never mentioned. So what happens? You cannot blame Cheryl Saunders unless she was told by somebody and did not do the work. Maybe you have to said, think about the evidence that Doreen Kartinyeri gave to Cheryl Saunders. But the one person who knew-and his office knewhe read the report, albeit in a couple of days, which he received on 7 July, that the only person alive who could have verified the basis women's business was never asked. So .if you call that doing the job in detail and and changing 140 years of anthropological on the basis of it then that is the sort of detail that this minister went to. And he will not answer that question. He had two think letters-one on 9 May and one on 12 Maywhich played a formative part in his appointout ing Cheryl Saunders, which he did on 23 May. He took notice, presumably, of the fact that a woman should do the thing, because the letters to him referred to women's business. When Cheryl Saunders' report came up, the one woman on earth who could have verified . the truth or otherwise of this thing was not asked. Unfortunately for this minister, a woman by the name of Dorothy Wilson was at that first meeting. She signed the first letter saying that she thought it was a sacred place and so forth. But on her way home that night she thought more about it and it worried her. She went to see Nanna Laura- Mrs Laura Kartinyeri, who was 88 years old last year and perfectly healthy at that time-and she asked her about the women. Remember, Nanna Laura is the most senior elder and known amongst the Ngarrindjeri people as that. Dorothy Wilson asked her whether it was true, and she was told that it was rubbish. The old lady had never heard of it. Let me say a couple of things before I close. This issue has for a long time battled the consciences of these women who have now come out after a long time, because they realised it would cause disruption amongst the people in the Ngarrindjeri group. But they have at least put honour back into this operation. I have to say that, if this minister is an accomplice in this operation, he is probably compliant in some sort of conspiracy. He has not answered the questions that he should have answered. I did not hear him answer one single question. How is it that Saunders did not get near the anthropologists in the Adelaide museum? How is it that the only anthropologist was Deane Fergie, who was putting forward a representation for one of the protagonists? How is it that the minister made a recommendation for a declaration or made the declaration when only four women had ever heard of this? It could have been four; it may have been only one. How is it that last week the senior anthropologist at the Adelaide Museum came out and said that these things are blowing in from the desert? How does the minister answer these questions? How is it that he did not notice that Cheryl Saunders was wrong in saying that Mr Justice Jacobs' recent report had said something about women's business when, of course, we all know that it did not? The fact of the matter is that he has not done the work, and this minister is going to lose out over this matter. (Time expired)",63
142,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (4.52 p.m.)-I am embarrassed that we have had to hear the opposition members this afternoon, because it has been a pitiful attack. We need to understand that this is not about an attack on the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). The interesting thing about this is that the fundamental element in all of this is misogynism. The common element is that this inquiry into the Hindmarsh Island bridge was carried out by a woman, who was disparaged by the opposition and disparaged by the member for Mayo (Mr Downer). The member for Mayo happened to say just a while ago in an aside across the table, 'We shouldn't trust her because she might be married to a Labor member of parliament.' I don't know if she is or she isn't. You implied that she should not not be trusted; that Cheryl Saunders, an independent person, should not be treated as an independent. We heard you. Mr Costello-Who led the debate? A woman.",65
143,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Just sit down, Biggles. The consultant was a· woman, Dr Deane Fergie. The matters of concern to Ngarrindjeri women are matters of women's knowledge. Three women have come under intense attack in a variety of guises, the most common being an attack from the opposition on either their independence-in the case of Professor Saunders and Dr Fergie-or their authenticity, in the case of Mrs Doreen Kartinyeri. This attack has come from three people-the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the member for Mayo and a number of his acolytes, including some who purport to be journalists, such as Piers Ackerman and other people writing in South Australian newspapers. All of them have taken this approach of disparaging these women. They have not attacked their virtue. They have attacked these women as individuals, and they have tried to undermine the fact that these people have authenticity in their own right and have valid, recognisable knowledge which is recognised beyond the community. This is something which they will not accept. This is not about the minister. This is about the opposition's attacks on the independence of these women. The fact that they are women concerns the opposition. The member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) is an unwitting dupe to the tactics of the opposition. She has been led down the garden path by the member for Barker, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Mayo. These people are responsible for a despicable attack on people who are not present in this House and able to defend themselves. Yet continually they make these attacks. It is worth pointing out a comment about the member for Barker by Alex Kennedy in the City Messenger of 24 April 1995. He said: Since resigning MCLachlan and his staff have been working overtime to discredit the Aboriginal claims on which the Federal Government's bridge veto was based. Last week he turned up five Aboriginal women who would say just that. But why? How much has it to do with attempting to resurrect his own career? How much has it to do with making Federal Labor look silly in election year? How little it seems to have to do with whether building the bridge is the right decision SA. It has become a Federal election year issue and a vile one at that. And all this is so very far from where it began-with a bridge the Libs were determined to halt, a bridge one Labor premier had tried to halt, a bridge which a previous Labor premier had been as determined to deliver. That is what this is about. It is about the member for Barker. It has nothing to do with the minister. It is the member for Barker, the member for Mayo, the Leader of the Opposition and their misogynism. That is what this is about. They have made it abundantly clearMr Downer-And the member for Hindmarsh.",65
144,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"An unwitting dupe. What she needs to do is examine what has happened in this debate-the motives of the opposition, the statements of the opposition and, indeed, the statements of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition was on Alan Jones' 2UE program on 22 May. The interview included the following: Mr Jones: Indeed it is Doreen Kartinyeri seems to be the person who is a spokesperson? Mr Howard: No. Well, I mean the most serious allegation in this whole thing is a suggestion that it was just completely concocted because there was no other way of stopping the construction of the bridge. What is he saying about that woman? He is saying that she concocted the story. What did the member for Barker, this clown sitting up the back, say in this place on 9 November last year?",66
145,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark.,66
146,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am happy to withdraw it. The member for Barker said: On the subject of the veracity of Doreen Kartinyeri, I am not doubting that she believes what she says. Nobody seems to doubt that in any way at all. He seems to have changed his view about that. We just heard him also suggesting that she concocted the story. Not only is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting she concocted the story, but the member for Barker is also suggesting she concocted the for story. What does Justice O'Loughlin have to say about it? He made statements about Doreen Kartinyeri, and he made statements about Cheryl Saunders. Cheryl Saunders is an interesting person, because she was the person chosen by the government to provide the independent advice, a person who has been attacked by the opposition. In the Weekend Australian on 27 May 1994, Justice Maurice O'Loughlin said about this person: I reject the aspersions that have been cast on her and on the manner in which she performed her duties. There are areas in which I find myself unable to agree with her but they are matters of law; such disagreement does not reflect in any way on her integrity. That is not what opposition members are saying; they are saying that her integrity is to be questioned. They are asking questions about her advice. They are suggesting she was not giving independent advice. They are trying to undermine her position as an eminent lawyer in this country and blame her. It is a very tawdry attack on these individuals and their rights. Mrs Gallus-I haven't said a thing about Cheryl Saunders.",66
147,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You have. This afternoon we had the member for Mayo interrupting-I do not know how to describe his actions. He was just a yapper. The member for Barker and the Leader of the Opposition were saying that these stories were concocted. Then the shadow spokesperson said that she was not prepared to make a judgment. Someone has made a judgment. The member for Barker has made a judgment and the Leader of the Opposition has made a judgment. Are you saying that you have not made a judgment? You have not made a judgment on the veracity of the claims of either sideyet the member for Barker most certainly has, the Leader of the Opposition has, the member for Mayo has, the acolytes of the South Australian media have, but she has not. What does that say about you? You are an acolyte.",67
148,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair.,67
149,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You are an acolyte. You have been duped by this. Mrs Gallus- Mr Deputy Speaker, I hate to draw your attention to this point of order, but it has been raised earlier today that addressing a member across the room as 'you' is not to be accepted in a matter of public importance.",67
150,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! I have drawn the attention of the parliamentary secretary to the fact that he should address remarks through the chair.,67
151,Mr CADMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,But he never takes any notice of you or anybody else.,67
152,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Mitchell is not assisting.,67
153,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to make the point about Mr Howard. Mr Howard saidMr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. In the same spirit as that of the member for Charlton, I draw your attention",67
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! I think I can predict this one. Mr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am allowed to make my point of order. In that same spirit, I would like to point out that the parliamentary secretary has referred to the Leader of the Opposition as Mr Howard. I think it would be appropriate if he referred to him as the Leader of the Opposition.",67
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The parliamentary secretary will refer to members by their titles.,67
156,Mr SNOWDON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy to refer to him as the Leader of the Opposition-a pretender at most. Again in this interview with Alan Jones, in relation to the independence of the inquiry which had been taken, he said: I mean, what a government should do is abort the appeal and have a proper independent inquiry-not some politically correct acolyte running it but some independent individual who can examine the truth of it. He is saying, is he not, that Professor Saunders is an acolyte of the Labor Party? Is that what he is saying? He is undermining her independence. Yet the shadow minister sits at this table trying to defend not only the Leader of the Opposition but also the member for Barker, the member for Mayo and all those other people who have made judgments, and she maintains that she has not made a judgment. The shadow minister has said, 'I have not made a judgment about the veracity or otherwise of the claims made by either side.' his That is not a position which has been adopted by the Leader of the Opposition, that is not a position which has been adopted by the member for Barker, that is not a position which has been adopted by the member for Mayo and that is not a position which has been adopted by our opponents. It is a position which has been adopted by the shadow minister-a shadow minister who has been duped into a position where she has been overrun like a mad train by the member for Barker who has gone out and colluded with his mates to try to concoct a story. I might just make this point about 'Kookaburra', an item in the Sydney Morning Herald of last weekend which talks about documents. It relates to Mr MCLachlan as President of the National Farmers Federation, as he then was, and to the revelation that there was a document in relation to Pendarvis. He stated: You are playing around with documents you shouldn't have. You would know about playing with documents! (Time expired)",67

Public Works Committee Approval of Work  Science and Personnel) (5.07 p.m.)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed works which were referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: the refurbishment of Australia House, London, United Kingdom. The main elements of the proposed works are the implementation of a staged program of internal refurbishment providing tenancy conditions which meet the requirements of occupational health and safety with the replacement of outdated and obsolete equipment and providing office accommodation which meets current data and communications needs, and the refurbishment of areas surplus to high commission requirements for leasing to state governments and other agencies. Total estimated cost for the works as at May 1994 prices is $A14.25 million. To meet the timetable for linking Australia House with the new DFAT offices at York Park, some interim works have commenced. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has made the following conclusions and recommendations in its report. The committee again draws attention to the continuing difficulty it faces in assessing overseas projects as, under current legislation, it is unable to meet outside Australia and its external territories. Mr Ruddock-They don't want an inspection, do they?  Until this legislation is amended to enable site inspections to be carried out overseas, the committee continues to reluctantly give approval for construction of projects which it has been unable to properly assess. The Public Works Committee Act 1969 be amended to remove the restriction on the Public Works Committee meeting outside of Australia and its external territories. There is a need to retain Australia House, London, as the focal point of Australia's representational activities in the United Kingdom. There is a: need to refurbish the interior of Australia House, London, as proposed by the Overseas Property Group, as much of the existing office accommodation is in poor condition and does not meet the needs of a modem working environment. In addition, many of the building's surfaces need replacing, as they no longer meet current regulatory requirements. On the evidence provided to the committee from the Australian High Commission· in London, the sixth floor of Australia House is not suitable for conversion to provide long term residential accommodation but is suitable for transit accommodation or office accommodation. The sixth floor of Australia House, London, should be converted for use as transit accommodation or office accommodation. The committee recommends the refurbishment of Australia House, London, at a limit of a cost estimate of $A14.25 million as at May 1994 prices. I note the committee's recommendation that the Public Works Committee Act 1969 be amended to remove the restriction on the Public Works Committee meeting outside Australia and its external territories. I am sympathetic to the view that there would be advantages to the committee's consideration of overseas projects if it was able to gain some first-hand, on-site knowledge of them. There are some legal impediments to the committee conducting hearings overseas which cannot be dealt with by simply amending the act. However, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) is prepared to consider ways of facilitating the committee's investigations into overseas projects. The committee's recommendation concerning the sixth floor is noted. The Minister for Administrative Services agrees that the vacant space should be put to the best possible use. Part of the sixth floor is currently used to accommodate the· regional office of the Overseas Property Group and the refurbishment consultant's site office. It will also provide staging space if required during the refurbishment. At this time, the project is not funded to implement the committee's recommendation while the refurbishment and the fit-out of space for Australia's centre to accommodate the state representatives is progressed. I will review the demand for additional office accommodation and cost benefit of using some of the space for transit accommodation, including funding options for any additional work that may be necessary. I thank the committee for its report and commend the motion to the House.",68
159,Mr CONNOLLY,ATION TO EGYPT AND ISRAEL AND THE,"The opposition does not oppose any proposals to upgrade the facilities at Australia House in London. It has been, and no doubt will continue to be for a long time, the centrepiece of Australian presence in that great city-the mother of the empire, and so forth. It is a very fine old building. I personally do not like it, but of course it was built in a much earlier age. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity or the need to work in it. It is a substantial amount of real estate and it is extremely valuable. We have over recent years sold, as far as I understand, all the land and all the buildings in the general vicinity of the Strand and this is really the only piece of real estate we have left. Any proposals which involve incorporating state offices in with the High Commission building I think are definitely steps in the right direction. I would hope to see in the future, if there is any further diminution in staffing, which has been quite substantial over recent years, opportunities made to provide actual living accommodation-the construction of flats, for example, in part of the building, which I think would be a step in the right direction-taking account of the extraordinarily expensive residential accommodation charges which are carried by the High Commission for staff of numerous departments which are attached to the High Commission. Mr Leo MCLeay-Put up a block of flats on Stoke House.",70
160,Mr CONNOLLY,ATION TO EGYPT AND ISRAEL AND THE,That is a possibility. We have actually sold all our flats in recent times. Mr Leo MCLeay-We have still got Stoke House.,71
161,Mr CONNOLLY,ATION TO EGYPT AND ISRAEL AND THE,"Stoke House is too small to put a block of flats on, I should think. All of the other flats have been sold and, consequently, I think one needs to take a long-term view of real estate values in London, which are obviously going to go up and not down. Australia's presence in that city will obviously continue indefinitely. Therefore, I think we need to take a long-term approach to these issues, not just on an annual budgetary cycle basis. As I said, the opposition does not oppose the proposal and we shall watch future developments with interest.",71
162,Mr HOLLIS,ATION TO EGYPT AND ISRAEL AND THE,"The comments made by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) were indeed investigated by the committee. We even looked at perhaps selling off Stoke Lodge and . moving the High Commission onto the sixth floor, but that was not well received, not least by the high commissioner. I point out to the honourable member for Bradfield the general difficulty of dealing with accommodation. The configuration of the building, with a well in the middle and the matter of the windows, makes it virtually impossible to do that. Even with this work, there will still be several vacant floors. We have been concerned about that vacant accommodation. The real difficulty we face is that the office market in London is oversupplied. We had to spend $14 million to bring those three floors up to rentable standard. A real difficulty we face is that we have to spend quite a lot of money on those buildings to bring them up to a standard for letting. The committee looked very carefully at turning part of the building into flats. It really is not practical. That is why we suggested in the final analysis that part of the sixth floor be converted to transit accommodation, but only transit accommodation. It is not suitable as long-term accommodation, with people having to live where they work and the configuration of the building being such. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA",71
163,Mr LEO MCLEAY,COMMITTEE,"Watson) (5.15 p.m.)I move: That the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: (1) the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for consideration: Aircraft Noise Levy Bill 1995; Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill 1995; Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1995; Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill 1995; Beef Production Levy Amendment Bill 1995; Cattle Transaction Levy Bill 1995; Cattle Export Charges Amendment Bill 1995; Exotic Animal Disease Control Amendment Bill 1995; Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill 1995; Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1995; Meat and Live-stock Industry Bill 1995; Meat and Live-stock Industry Legislation Repeal Bill 1995; National Residue Survey Administration Amendment Bill 1995; National Residue Survey (Cattle Export) Levy Bill 1995; National Residue Survey (Cattle Transactions) Levy Bill 1995; National Cattle Disease Eradication Trust Account Amendment Bill 1995; and Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1995; and (2) the following orders of the day, committee and delegation reports, be referred to the Main Committee for debate: Employment, Education and TrainingStanding Committee-Report on the role and effectiveness of group training-Motion to take note of paper: Resumption of debate; and Community Affairs-Standing Committee Report on aspects of youth homelessnessMotion to take note of paper: Resumption of debate. I advise the House that, because of the number of both government and opposition speakers on the list for Wednesday and Thursday in the Main Committee, it is the government's intention that the Main Committee should continue till 2.30 p.m. on both of those days to ensure that more members have a chance to contribute to the debate on such interesting bills as the Aircraft Noise Levy Bill, the Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Bill and a number of meat bills. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL 1995 Cognate bill: NA AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed.",71
164,Mr LIEBERMAN,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The thesis I was putting to the House before question time was that as a consequence of the increase in taxation, not only in this Medicare Levy Bill but also in respect of the Keating government's increases in tax in previous budgets and this budget, many more families are going to be forced out of continuing private health insurance. That will put greater pressure on the public hospital sector and will increase costs. Therefore, the merrygo-round will continue with increasing demand on taxpayers' funds to sustain Medicare. The government has produced a giant haemorrhage and that can only get worse under the government's policy. The trajectory of this government in budgets up to the current budget has been to increase taxes in Australia, despite a promise not to increase taxes, by around $3 billion a year. I outlined those taxes before question time. In the budget before the House, taxes will increase by $2.4 billion in 1995-96, rising to $7.8 billion in 1998-99. I remind honourable members. I notice that no government members are here other than the parliamentary secretary and another minister who is always attentive to my comments in the House, and I appreciate that-of some of the individual tax measures in this current budget, apart from the raising of the Medicare levy. The first is to increase company tax from 33 per cent to 36 per cent, which will take $3,970 million out of the private sector-money to invest in jobs and in the expansion of business and industry in Australia-over· the next four years. The Medicare levy will raise $1,010 million over four years, which will come out of the pockets of all Australians-PAYE taxpayers, wage earners, small businesses, families and farmers. That amount of money would be otherwise spent by those families in looking after themselves, being self-sufficient and, for many of them, continuing to pay private health insurance instead of being totally reliant on public health schemes, at a greater cost to the taxpayer. The extension of sales tax on building materials will raise a total of $1,015 million over four years. Again, let us pause to reflect where that money is going to come from. Predominantly, it will come from young people who are trying to get their first home, who will now have to pay hundreds of dollars-according to one of the Labor members during question time, at least $1,500-per modest home for wholesales sales tax on building materials not presently covered by the wholesales sales tax legislation. In respect of passenger motor vehicles used predominantly by families, by battlers in Australia, by small business, again I remind members on the other side, the sales tax proposals in this budget propose to raise $1,470 million over the next four years. The consequences of taking those vast sums of money out of families, out of the productive side of the economy, out of small business are clear-that can only result in less investment, less savings and more demands on the public purse. It is obvious that that is the case when you consider the tax base that we already have and the fact that these people have had to suffer high interest rates during a massive recession and now regretfully a return to higher interest rates with three interest rate hikes over the past 12 months. If, as I fear, we follow the trend of the American economy, and with our huge debt and therefore the forces at work on the Australian economy, we are going to find, perhaps in the very short term, a slight dip in interest rates followed by a rise in interest rates as this government, if it is still in power-heaven forbid-grapples with the levers of managing this economy in the clumsy way that it has over the past 12 or 13 years. I conclude by reminding the House of the sorts of statements that this government has made to the Australian people over many years. In the next few weeks as the election draws nearer and Australians have the opportunity to reflect and cast their vote on the sort of government they want for the future, not so much for themselves but for their children and grandchildren, I remind them of these sorts of statements and ask them to make a judgment on their own. In the 1985 budget speech, the then Treasurer, our present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), promised: I've outlined the Government's strategy for the new financial year. It's a strategy that builds upon our very significant success and puts further behind us the despair and economic failure of the former government. The outcome-within months Australia was in the middle of the infamous banana republic current account crisis. In the following July, the Australian dollar collapsed to less than US60c, the lowest level on record. Since Labor came to power the Australian currency had lost almost 40 per cent of its value. In his 1987 budget speech, the chronicle continues, the present Prime Minister promised: Notwithstanding the enormity of the trade difficulties we have faced, our economic strategy is now bearing fruit. The outcome-within two years Australia was experiencing the largest current account blowout on record. In the 1988 budget speech, the present Prime Minister promised: The nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation ... this is the one that brings home the bacon. Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. The outcome-over the following year, net foreign debt rose by 22 per cent. Within two years Australia had entered the worse recession in 60 years. On 24 August 1988, after his budget speech, the present Prime Minister said: We are now well on our way back to prosperity. The outcome-within two years Australia was in recession. In the 1989 budget speech, the present Prime Minister promised: As a result of the Government's economic policies, Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving. The outcome-within one year Australia was in the worse recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The present Prime Minister further promised: Vital business investment will stay strong with growth in plant and equipment component expected to remain robust. The outcome-in 1989-90, business investment fell by 0.2 per cent. The plant and equipment component fell much faster, by 4.2 per cent. The present Prime Minister also promised: This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up ... delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession. The outcome-in 1990-91, employment fell and Australia entered a recession which saw the unemployment rate rise to the highest level since the Great Depression. In his 1992 speech on the budget, the present Prime Minister said: The Keating government's economic strategy is to accelerate recovery from recession, and at the same time build a stronger Australia. It is a four year plan. It begins now with an immediate boost to spending and employment. It ends in 1995-96 with the budget back in surplus and dramatically reduced marginal income tax rates for most Australians. The outcome-the government has admitted the budget will not be in surplus. It is selling off assets to fudge the balance of account. Within a year, Labor had broken its promise to deliver the second round of income tax cuts on 1 January 1996 and in fact introduced a range of new taxes, that I have outlined, in the last two budgets. In the 1994 budget speech, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said: Our forecast deficit for 1996-97 is now less than one per cent of GDP, and we expect the budget to be in surplus soon thereafter. In achieving this outcome, we have not increased general taxation. The outcome-the 1994-95 budget papers estimated that total tax revenue was 21.9 per cent. (Time expired)",72
165,Dr THEOPHANOUS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"Cal wellParliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister. for Human Services and Health) (5.26 p.m.)I want to thank the members for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), Curtin (Mr Rocher), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Stirling (Mr Cameron), Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), MCPherson (Mr Bradford) and Indi (Mr Chynoweth) for their contributions. Obviously the member for Indi ran out of things to say about the bill and decided to give us his wisdom on general economic issues for about 10 minutes. Mr Chynoweth-Don't you think that is relevant to the health of Australians?",74
166,Dr THEOPHANOUS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"Yes, these issues are relevant to the health of Australians, but you did not show their relevance in your speech. I want to reply to some of the comments, especially in view of the fact that the shadow minister for health, the member for Chisholm, has indicated that the opposition will oppose the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill. I regret the course of action taken by the opposition in relation to this. I particularly regret the fact that this action has been taken by the member for Chisholm, who has had a chequered history in this place but is one of the sensible and moderate members of the Liberal Party. Mr Lindsay-Who's that?",74
167,Dr THEOPHANOUS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"This is the member for Chisholm. Unfortunately, he seems to be going the way of some of the other moderates in that party. They come under pressure from the extreme right and what do they do? They buckle under, give way and do not stand up. Then they end up doing things which they later regret which goes on their record for a number of years. It is very unfortunate that the member for Chisholm has not been able to say, 'It is a nonsense for us to oppose this very small increase in the Medicare levy.'",74
168,Mr GEAR,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,And justified.,74
169,Dr THEOPHANOUS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"And justified, as the Assistant Treasurer says. You would be interested to know that the Medicare levy receipts, as a proportion of Medicare outlays, have fallen from over 30 per cent in 1988-89 to an expected 24 per cent in 1994-95. This increase in the Medicare levy does not even make up for that fall; it only partially makes up for that decline. We had lectures from members opposite about fiscal responsibility and about responsibility and the management of the resources of the nation. What sort of responsibility do they show whenever they have to make a hard decision, such as a very small increase in the Medicare levy? What do they do? They run away from it and then they want to vote against it here and in the other place. That is a disgrace. The member for Chisholm did not produce a single argument to support his position. What did we have from him ? We had from him belated support for Medicare. After five election losses by the coalition parties in which Medicare was a central issue and in which health policy was a central issue, they finally recognise that the Australian people actually like Medicare, the Australian people support Medicare, the Australian people think Medicare is a very good policy. It is a lot them to swallow, given their philosophical predilection, especially the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). It was very difficult for him to swallow. He said, 'I support Medicare.' That was one of the hardest he has ever had to do in politics. Given his new right philosophical basis-he does not believe in anything universal, especially universal health care-it was a very difficult thing for him to do. He is so desperate to government that he said it. It was like his attempted reversal of his statements on multition. culturalism and ethnic affairs. Never mind, will discuss that at another time. The Australian people know that any embracing of Medicare by the opposition is very reluctant and is not based on any philowill sophical commitment to the principles Medicare. The first opportunity members of the opposition get, whatever excuse they get-if they were to get into governmentspeech they would run away from the universal nature of Medicare. Remember when MalNew colm Fraser went to the people in 1975. He said, 'We will retain Medibank.' Within months of getting into office, Medibank was out the window-the universal health system was out the window. We had to bring it back in 1983 in a new form, to sustain the health system. For the shadow minister to talk in here about the virtues of a health system and say that the minister is mistaken in cies because of the issues of private health insurance, which do not concern this bill, is moderates. amazing. Let me address those questions at this level. We will listen to the shadow minister in some serious way, and the Australian people will listen to the shadow minister and the opposition in some serious way, when they come up with some proposal. Every time this idea of a policy free zone raised, the opposition leader chuckles and thinks it is a big joke. If you think joke not to have a policy on this private health area-and they have none; they have ditched the previous one; God knows what it is now-and then to get up and say that there are some problems in private health insurance which the minister has not dealt with is a for joke. The minister has pushed through this chamber and through the dreaded Senate a bill to put into place a new system to deal ·with the issues concerning private health insurance. Let us not hear any more nonsense things from the shadow minister about this. I come back to this fundamental point: the moderates in the Liberal Party had better start standing up, because there will not be any left. Mr Deputy Speaker Rocher, you are one win of those moderates. What has happened to you? You have been knocked off for preselecWhat about the other moderate who is we here now, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly)? He has been knocked off for preselection. The way things are going, the moderates in the Liberal Party be able to meet in a telephone booth. of That is how bad things are in the Liberal Party. They have knocked off all the moderate members, and then tonight we are to hear a about how they are going to move the party to the centre ground. All these hard, Right people have suddenly discovered the centre ground. If you believe that, you will believe anything. Whenever they have had an opportunity to preselect members that really believed in some moderation and in some traditional small 'I' liberal principles, what have they done? They have knocked them off at preselection. I say to the member for Chisholmunfortunately, he is not here, but he has to tendered his apologies; he wanted to be her polihere-he had better be careful.",74
170,Mr GEAR,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,Macphee and Chaney were,75
171,Dr THEOPHANOUS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The Hon. Ian Macphee was one of the most distinguished members of this House. The Hon. Fred Chaney was one of the moderates. In the meantime, we are asked to believe they are is going to bring in some kind of policy that makes sense in the area of health and human it is a big services. We will wait and see. Let us tum to the comments of the honourable member for Curtin, who is in the chair at the moment. He raised the question about the limit to the levy and said that it would be book. logical for the government to go on increasing the levy until it covered the whole cost of health services. With respect, those comments are based on a misunderstanding. At no time has the government ever stated that the intention of the Medicare levy was to cover all the health costs. From the beginning we recognised that the Medicare levy was only a contribution towards health costs. to be so. Therefore, the levy is only making part of that contribution towards the fundamental cost. Unlike the opposition, we understand that additional measures are required in order to raise sufficient funds for health and human services-fundamental issues in social justice, health and human services. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to understand what the social wage is about. Health and human services are the fundamental elements of the social wage. It is very interesting that in a 20-minute speech attacking the Prime Minister yesterday the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the words 'social wage' a number of times, but he did not explain a single thing about it-not what it means and what it is all about. He was very happy to use the word 'battlers'. When it comes to serious policy and to discussing the issues of social justice and the social wagethe human services component of the social wage and the health component of the social wage-what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He does not have a clue. He did not talk about it. He left it to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), to try to say something about it. For 15 or 20 minutes the Leader of the Opposition attacked the Prime Minister personally about this issue, but he did not in any way say what it really means or give his understanding of it. If you go to the record and look for the two words 'social justice' under the words 'John Howard' you cannot find anything. He never talks about that, unlike the member for Bradfield and several others who have talked about it; unlike the member for Curtin who has talked about some of these issues. Mr Connolly-Tell us the name of your",75
172,Dr THEOPHANOUS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The honourable member wants to pay me a compliment. I will not go into that. My book does discuss this issue at length, unlike the Leader of the Opposition.",76
173,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"It is all right to mention it as proceedings are It continues not being broadcast. Dr THEOPHANOUS..ztJnfortunately, Mr Deputy Speaker, the proceedings are not being broadcast. Let me talk about the comments of the member for Stirling. He raised no real issues in relation to this matter. I am not sure whether he or another member of the opposition who came afterwards attempted to attack the minister personally. I considered that an outrage. He tried to attack the minister personally by somehow implying that the minister had used her influence to have an operational procedure done without waiting very long. Let me make these points about this matter: firstly, it is true that the minister underwent a procedure. She did so while she was Premier of Western Australia. It was done in a private hospital, not in a public hospital. She certainly did not push her way through to the top of the queue. She paid for the operation herself. She chose this course of action in order to avoid putting any additional burden on the public health system. This is the position which a number of Australians have taken. For whatever reason, they have chosen not to have private health insurance but to pay the full cost in private hospitals of operations and the like. Whichever member raised this issue-the member for Stirling or another member-it was disgraceful to raise the issue in the context of this debate. The minister acted in a totally honourable fashion. The government is not interested in these personal attacks of the kind that we are getting from the opposition. We are interested in getting on with governing this country. I know you all think that at the first sign of our going up in the polls we will call an election,but that is not the issue at all. Our main concern is to govern this country well. Mr Lindsay-We want good governance of Australia.",76
174,Dr THEOPHANOUS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"Good governance, as the honourable member says. In the area of human services and health, as in a number of other social areas, we have developed volumes of policy. We have developed a large range of programs, vast networks of administration that are delivering the policies and even in certain cases forcing conservative, reactionary state liberal coalition governments into social policy. In some cases we have had to drag them. A good example of that is the fact that we have had to drag the Kennett government into the child-care system, after 2- years, and we also tried to drag the Fahey government into the scheme. It took the Adams, D. defeat of that government before New South Beazley, K. C. Wales would become involved in the proBevis, A. R. gram. This is the attitude towards social Brown, R. J. programs which the conservatives have had Chynoweth, and will always have. In the area of health, we should have been Cunningham, B. T. developing a bipartisan approach. Instead, we Duncan, P. have had from the shadow minister determinaElliott, R. P. tion to oppose this measure. I regret that. It is Fatin, W.

They will not escape this Knott, P. J. proposal, because the Australian people in Latham, M. W. general accept the fact that Medicare is a Lawrence, C.

R. grounds and people with particular problems. Tanner, L. J. All these programs will be very positive and Tickner, R. E. I believe that increasing the Medicare levy by Willis, R. this small amount, while not paying for all these programs, will help to pay for some. This legislation is a very responsible measure and should be totally supported by any party which claims that it would have any responsibility in government. I bitterly regret the fact that the opposition is opposing it, and totally reject the argument of those opposite. Question put: That the bill be now read a second time The House divided.

175,Mr GEAR,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The bills will modify the sales tax law to give PAIRS effect to certain announcements in the 199596 budget. Passenger motor vehicles The bills will increase the rate of sales tax applying to non-luxury passenger motor vehicles from 16 per cent to 21 per cent. The rate of sales tax applying to the portion of the value of lUXUry passenger motor vehicles below the luxury threshold will also be increased in line with the rate for non-luxury passenger motor vehicles. These changes will take effect from budget night. The sales tax applying to non-luxury passenger motor vehicles was reduced from the general rate as an anti-cyclical measure in the 1992 One Nation statement. Strong growth in the economy has removed any need for the concessional rate. The gain to revenue of these measures is likely to be $18 million for 1994-95, $330 inillion for 1995-96, $355 million for 199697, $380 million for 1997-98 and $405 million for 1998-99. Safes, musical instruments and ornaments The bills make clear that safes, musical instruments including pianos and other keyboards, and ornaments in the nature of bric-abrac are not entitled to the concessional rate of sales tax applicable to household furniture. These changes will take effect from· budget night. The modifications are necessary following recent disputes where taxpayers have claimed that these goods, which have long been considered taxable at the general rate, should be treated as furniture and, therefore, subject to the concessional rate of 11 per cent. The government considers it necessary to legislate to ensure that these goods continue to be taxed at the general rate. These modifications will prevent the potential for revenue leakage rather than directly increasing revenue. Model aircraft The sales tax law provides an exemption from sales tax for aircraft. A recent court decision has resulted in this exemption being extended to model aircraft capable of flight. This is at odds with the long standing policy on the treatment of model aircraft The bills will ensure that all model aircraft are again taxed at the general rate of sales tax, along with other toys. This modification will take effect from budget night. It has not been possible to quantify the gain to the revenue for this measure. Scaffolding components, wall and floor safes, shelving systems The bills will reverse the effect of recent court decisions, which have expanded the scope of sales tax exemptions for building . materials beyond what was originally intended, with regard to scaffolding components, wall and floor safes and shelving systems. That is, the bills will ensure that these which have long been accepted as being subject to sales tax, will not be eligible for sales tax exemptions. These changes will take effect from budget night. These modifications will prevent the potential for revenue leakage rather than directly increasing revenue. Building materials The bills will make certain categories of currently exempt building materials taxable at the concessional rate, which will be 12 per cent when the modification comes into effect on 1 July 1995. This measure will apply the 12 per cent rate to a wide range of building materials used in the completion of buildings, including goods such as wall and floor tiles, plaster, taps and nozzles, timber floor coverings, paints, putties, fillers, wallpaper, builders hardware and some items of prefabricated joinery. The gain to the revenue of the measures is likely to be $215 million for 1995-96, $245 million for 1996-97, $265 million for 1997-98 and $290 million for 1998-99. Recycled paper Certain goods made from recycled paper are exempt from sales tax provided the goods are made entirely from recycled paper. The government considers that this sales tax exemption is inefficient and likely to impede efficient industry development. The bills, therefore, remove the sales tax exemption for goods made from recycled paper. This modification will take effect from I November 1995. The gain to revenue of these measures is likely to be $7 million for 1995-96, $13 million for 1996-97, $14 million for 1997-98 and $15 million for 1998-99. Full details of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bills to the House.",78
176,Mr ANDREWS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"Menzies) (5.59 p.m.)The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Modification (Excise) Bill 1995 and cognate bills, together with the previous bill relating to the increase in the Medicare levy and subsequent bills relating to taxation which the government will deal with in this place this week, are in effect the mechanism by which this government commits electoral goods, fraud on the people of Australia. In this legislation we have an increase in sales tax on two items about which the government had intimated and indicated there would be no such increase; namely, an increase in tax on cars and also an increase in tax on building products. As the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) pointed out, we find in these bills an increase in sales tax in a number of areas: an increase in sales tax payable on passenger motor vehicles to the general rate of 21 per cent, up from 16 per cent; a modification of the sales tax law to remove the exemption for a range of building materials which will become taxable now at the rate of 12 per cent; and a series of other tax increases or modifications to make it clear that tax applies to free standing safes, musical instruments, ornaments, model aircraft, scaffolding components, wall and floor safes, racking and shelving systems; and last, but not least, a modification in sales tax law to remove the sales tax exemption for certain 100 per cent recycled paper products. I indicate to the House that the coalition will vote against, will oppose, those increases in sales tax on building products and on cars. We will be voting against these items because, in our opinion, the implementation of these proposals represents an electoral fraud on the people of Australia. I am reminded in this debate of a conversation that I had with my daughter recently. She said to me in her childhood way, 'What does it mean when someone says to you, Dad, ""A man is as good as his word""?, I said, 'Well, it's about being honest. ""A man is as good as his word"" means he'll keep his word and he'll be honest.' I said by way of example, 'If I said to you, ""I'll give you $5 extra pocket money if you'll help clean up your room and help clean up around the place,"" but when it came time to pay it to you the next week I said, ""No, you've done all the work but I'm not going to pay it. I'm going to take it back,"" would that be honest?' She said, 'No, of course not.' I said, 'If I gave you a doll and then I said later, ""Listen, I'm taking it back. I gave it to you but it is not really yours to keep. You've had it for a day. I said you could have it but now I am going to take it back,"" would that be honest?' She said, 'No, of course not, Dad.' So I said, 'Well, that is what it means when we say, ""A man is as good as his word."" When something is said in relation to a certain proposal or proposition, it means that that word will be kept.' What we can say in relation to this legislation is that a man is as good as his word-but we see that the word is simply not being kept. Let me deal with some of the actual proposals in the legislation; first of all, the increase in sales tax on cars. Let us go back to the famous One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 26 February 1992. In the ministerial statement that the Prime Minister stood at this dispatch box here and delivered to this place and to the people of Australia, he had this to say about motor vehicles: From tomorrow the sales tax on new cars currently subject to the 20 per cent rate will be perrnanentlypermanently- . lowered to 15 per cent-a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800. . With cheaper cars we will drive newer cars, which is good for the environment, good for road safety, and good for one of our most important industries. He said there would be a permanent lowering of sales tax on motor vehicles from 20 to 15 per cent. What does this piece of legislation propose? It proposes that we increase the sales tax on motor vehicles from 16 to 21 per cent. When we ask about the impact of this, we do not have to go any further than what the Prime Minister himself said in February 1992: ... a saving on a new Commodore or Falcon of around $800. So the impact on ordinary purchasers of motor vehicles of this particular measure, if the prices are about the same as they were in 1992, is an increased cost of some $800 on a new Falcon or a new Holden.· This is just part of the increasing cost of transport under this government. We have seen fuel excise rise from some 6c to 34c per litre. A survey by the Royal Automobile Club of Victoria showed that the cost of running a car over the last year has gone up for a private vehicle by some $13 and for a commercial vehicle by some $48. This is a measure which will have an immediate impact once it is introduced-if it is not defeated elsewhere-on ordinary purchasers of cars. My local dealer in Holden Commodores in Doncaster has already said that he has detected a marked shift in the attitude of buyers in relation to this particular measure. In a country that has an aged vehicle fleet-a country whose vehicle fleet is much older than those in most of the developed world-this measure will make it more difficult for people to buy cars. What about the environmental concerns? If we have already got an ageing fleet and this proposal makes it more difficult to buy cars, then we can expect that fewer people will buy cars, which will add to the environmental problem. In answer to a question about this in parliament in the last week, the Prime Minister said that no-one in the motor industry should be surprised by this. No-one would be surprised because it is a: complete reversal of a policy from the Prime Minister, and that is what everyone-those in the motor industry and elsewhere-has come to expect; that when he says one thing he will actually turn around and do another. The word 'permanent' has no realistic meaning at all in the language of the Prime Minister of this country. The word 'permanent' becomes meaningless; it becomes a word that means temporary. The moral of this story, if we go back to taking a man at his word, is that the word of the Prime Minister of Australia that something is permanent means that it is temporary. So much for the word of the Prime Minister. The next proposal deals with the increase in sales tax on building materials. Prior to the 1993 election we were told over and over again in this place and on every media outlet, on radio and television stations around the nation, that we did not need an increase in sales tax. The Prime Minister and members of the government campaigned the length and breadth of this nation saying, 'We don't need increases in sales tax and in particular we don't need a goods and services tax.' Remember the advertisements that were played on television stations night after night of a cash register with 15 per cent jingling up? The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) remembers them very well. The whole purport of those advertisements was, 'We're not going to have a GST. We're not going to have a 15 per cent increase in GST. We're not going to have in any wayan increase in sales tax.' The one clear, unambiguous message that came from the government, from the Prime Minister, from the Treasurer (Mr Willis), from the front-bench and from the backbench was that there would be no increase in sales tax. In November 1992, the Prime Minister said clearly, in words which one could hardly put a different meaning on, 'What I am promising is not to put up tax.' If you look at Hansard transcripts, you will see that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) on 5 May rejected categorically any tax increases on the housing .industry; as did the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, on 30 April 1992. 'No sales tax on the building industry,' said the Deputy Prime Minister and the then Treasurer, 'We're not going to do that. We promise the opposite, just like the Prime Minister said.' What do we make of the word of the Prime Minister? Can we take the man at his word? In this legislation a whole raft of items commonly used in the building industry are now going to be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. Let us just look at what those things are. Plaster, used in raw materials in construction and repair, and the ingredients for plaster mixes will all be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. Builders' hardware such as nails, rivets, washers, screws, bolts and nuts will all be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. Every time a builder hammers a nail into a piece of wood-and how many nails go into building an extension to a house, let alone building a new house?-there will be a 12 per cent tax on that nail as well as on every bolt, nut and screw that goes into that building. At the present time some floor coverings are subject to tax, but all wall and floor tiles will now be subject to a 12 per cent tax. So far we have got the plaster going into raw materials in construction and repair, the nails, bolts, screws and nuts that hold together all the wood that goes into the building of a house and the wall and floor tiles that make up the construction of a house or a renovation going to be taxed. In addition to that, timber floor coverings and parquet blocks will also be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. If that is not enough, the list goes on: paints, putties and wallpaper will be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. So, if people are going to paint the bathroom or put up some wallpaper in the spare room, as of 1 July 1995 the Prime Minister will rip off from them another 12 per cent in sales tax. Not only that; taps, nozzles, tap handles or shower heads installed in houses will be subject to a 12 per cent sales tax. Of course, the tax is not going to stop at the residence. Office partitions, workstation panelling, fittings, accessories and attachments for office partitions and office workstations will also be taxed. Every time people in small business anywhere across Australia want to modify their premises, open a new office or in any way change the structure of their office, they will be taxed. This is' another tax being put on small business in Australia. What will probably hit most people if they are not buying a new house or doing general renovations? A 12 per cent tax on kitchen cupboards and other storage units. It sounded like the tax would just be on kitchen cupboards, which was bad enough, but all prefabricated timber cupboards, cabinets, storage units-including bathroom vanity units-and kitchens of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes are included. The one thing that most people do at some stage in the ownership of their house is to renovate their kitchen or bathroom. People save their money for months and years-years and years in some cases-to be able to renovate their house, their kitchen or their bathroom. What do we.have here? We have a tax on that renovation-a 12 per cent tax. All this is going to add to the cost of housing, not just new housing but also renovations. We had the Treasurer saying that this would only be about an extra $300. But in question time today he admitted, 'Yes; well, that is actually on a very modest house.' About the only house it would add $300. to would be a doghouse. If we look at medium houses, the Treasurer says the increase will be in the order of $500 to $1,000. The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, told the Senate the other day that it would be about $1,000. But we get the real message when one of the backbenchers goes out and tries to actually deal with the constituents in his electorate. Today the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), in his local newspaper, the Daily Examiner, tried to defend this measure in front of the housing industry, the builders and the home owners of Page. I will read the whole of the three paragraphs so there is no question of my taking what he said out of context. The article states: Federal Member for Page, Harry Woods, has urged new home buyers to ask builders for itemised increases in building costs, because of an increase in sales tax on some items. Mr Woods said he was appalled that some home builders had been advising of increases of more than $3000 on a home worth about $75,000 and blaming the Government. ""Figures from the Home Building Industry and Treasury officials suggest it should be less than half that amount,"" he said. ""There is no place for the 'get rich quick' rip off merchants. "" The Treasurer tried to say today that it would be ridiculous if builders were trying to rip off home purchasers and renovators, even before this measure came in, by adding on an extra $3,000. Of course, if they sign contracts now for houses to be built in July, August or September, naturally the builder will want to be building into that contract for renovations or a new home the extra sales tax that will be charged on those items. But the telling thing about this is that the member for Page is saying not that it will be $3,000 but that it should be less than half that amount; not the $300 we were quoted by the Treasurer, or even the $800 he is conceding today, or the $1,000 that Senator Schacht, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, announced elsewhere, but that it should be-a hope-something less than $1,500. That, of course, gives us some idea of the real cost involved in these measures. Kitchen builders see some problems: for example, some retired pensioners will have waited 30 years to get a new kitchen. To them it is a big deal if they can play one company against the other in order to save $300. These are real people out in the real world. We have had this debate about battlers and who represents them. Here we have pensioners who have saved for years and years and who look around for the cheapest quote so that they can get $300 off the cost of renovating their kitchen-and the government is going to rip them off somewhere between $300 and $1,500, according to the member for Page. Mr Latham interjecting",79
177,Mr ANDREWS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The member for Werriwa can wave and say that this does not matter. When he goes back to his constituents and deals with them, how is he going to explain to them what the government is actually doing in relation to these building costs? What we have here is the government's GST on building materials. You know it and the people of Australia will know it as well. . We also have here a tax on services. Members should note the way in which this will actually operate. If somebody builds a kitchen-spending maybe a day or two or three, whatever it takes to build a kitchen, in the workshop-and then, as is commonly done, brings that kitchen into the home in components arid spends just half a day or a day installing it, 12 per cent sales tax will be charged on the components brought in. Mr Lindsay-Not on the labour costs.",83
178,Mr ANDREWS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology says, 'Not on the labour costs.' There will be a huge problem in differentiating between what is expended on labour-whether it is brought in or whether it is built on the spot-and what is expended on the actual products that go into the kitchen. This will add further disincentive to small business in this country, because it add more compliance costs to their actual operation. Housing and building approvals in Australia are falling. The government is adding to that by ripping off Australians with a further 12 per cent tax on building materials. This is government's GST on building. It is nothing more or less than that. What is the moral in this? What can we say about taking a man at his word? When the Prime Minister says, 'What I am promising is not to put up tax,' he actually means that he is going to put up tax. When he says one thing, he actually means another. It reminds me of Lewis Carroll's old story, Through the Looking Glass. Humpty, who is a bad-tempered egg, says to Alice, 'There's glory for you!' 'I don't know what you mean by ""glory"",' Alice said. Humpty said, 'I meant there's a nice knockdown argument for you!' 'But ""glory"" doesn't mean a ""nice knockdown argument"",' Alice objected. 'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to meanneither more nor less.' When the Prime Minister uses a word, it means just what he chooses it to mean-neither more nor less. But you can be assured that it will mean one thing one day and, if it suits him, it will mean another thing another day. There is only one more moral that we can draw from that story, and we all know what happened to Humpty. The current measures have resulted in an increased cost of compliance by small business all the time. For example, the accountants Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu pointed out that under the sales tax system companies are being 'squeezed with 60and 90-day payment terms by retailers'. They said: . .. wholesaler companies must remit wholesale tax to the ATO up to six weeks before they are paid by the retailer, thariks to a law unchanged since 1931. They continued: Wholesalers are being forced not only to collect sales tax on behalf of the ATO but to fund the working capital of the largest retailing organisations in the country. They indicate that that is forcing a number ?f companies into debt because of the way 10 will which these archaic tax laws operate. These measures will only add to these problems. There are some measures in this bill that we will not be voting against. Those measures fall into two categories. What we are voting against in this place and in the other place are the those fraudulent actions on behalf of this government in saying one thing in order to win an election and then coming in here afterwards and doing the opposite. We will not be opposing the measure relating to modifications in tax on safes, musical instruments and ornaments. This measure arose out of a decision of the Federal Court in Chubb Australia Ltd and the Federal Commissioner of Taxation, which clarified the law. Similarly, we will not be opposing the measure in relation to scaffolding, racking, shelving and wall and floor tiles, which arose out of the court decision in GKN Australia Ltd and the Federal Commissioner of Taxation. The final measure in this bill relates to the change in the tax status of recycled paper. The exemption which currently exists for certain 100 per cent recycled paper products came into operation in October 1989. The aim of the exemption was to encourage the recycling of paper. In June 1992 the federal government accepted that the exemption had had unforeseen consequences and should be narrowed to address problems that had arisen and to direct better the measure to environmental concerns. Accordingly, at that stage, the exemption was removed for facial and toilet tissue; certain books of paper, such as exercise books; and paper bags. The government provided some transitional assistance to a number of small tissue manufacturers who claimed they had made investments based on the introduction of the tax exemption. In 1993 the then minister for the environment and the Environment Protection Agency determined that recycling should be only one criterion for assessing the environmentally preferred status of paper products. However, a subsequent EPA review in 1984 recommended continual financial support for the paper recycling industry. There have been arguments amongst those involved in this industry as to the effectiveness of this measure but, given the outcome of the Industry Commission recommendations in relation to recycling paper, we will not oppose this measure. However, I should say in passing that in this budget Labor's net reduction in support for recycling is some $43.5 million over four years. I wonder how this government intends to support recycling with that sort of withdrawal of funds from its programs over the next four years. I wonder how it will ensure that jobs are created-not destroyed-in recycling industries. So we will not be opposing those measures. I will return to the main point. The question that I pose to this parliament and to the people of Australia is: what do we mean when we talk about a man being taken at his word in terms of national debate? If we look at a whole series of statements of the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister, we see a reversal at every tum. Mr Latham-You've said all this.",83
179,Mr ANDREWS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The member for Werriwa says that I have said this before. I have said it before, and I will say it again. The coalition will say it all the way to the next election. We will continue to say it. Mr Latham-Tedious. repetition.",84
180,Mr ANDREWS,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"You may say that it is tedious repetition, but we will point out to the people of Australia day in, day out that what is involved here is an electoral fraud by this government on a huge scale. This Prime Minister is prepared to say one thing for the purpose of being elected and then to reverse that situation later on if it suits his purposes. You may well get sick of hearing this because it will be preached and shouted from the rooftops of Australian houses, factories and businesses all the way to the next election, but that is what we have in terms of the leadership of this government. Let us consider the promises made over the last six, seven or eight years by this Prime Minister in relation to the economy. On every occasion he has turned around and said something different. We have the famous l-aw tax cuts. The Prime Minister could not simply say to the people of Australia, 'I'll promise you this.' He knew that that implied that his promise would not be believed. He could not go to the people of Australia at the National Press Club and imply, 'These are not promises. I can understand my promises may not be understood and may not be believed. People might bea little sceptical or cynical about anything that I say.' Instead, he went to the press club and said, 'This is l-a-w, law.' Of course we know what happened to l-a-w, law. It became l-i-e, lie. That is what we have in relation to this legislation and the measures which I have indicated that we will vote against. This government has continued to increase its sales tax and its tax revenue. Since 1983 total individual tax has risen by 136.8 per cent; total company tax has risen by a massive 370 per cent; total indirect tax has risen by 149.8 per cent; sales tax, which we are dealing with here, has risen by 305.7 per cent; and total tax revenue is due to go up by 189.8 per cent. This 189.8 per cent increase intotal tax revenue will occur over a period when inflation rises by only 68.4 per cent. So we have a real increase in tax revenue above inflation of over 120 per cent. So much for the record of this government. The reality is that we have a huge increase in tax once again. You will not build a nation by pulling down those who try to create wealth in this country. That is what you are doing here. You are attacking small business again and you are attacking those who are trying to save for such basic things as remodelling their kitchen and putting a new vanity unit in their bathroom. The great English Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli once made the famous statement to the House of Commons, 'Lies, damned lies and statistics.' If Disraeli were here today, would be sorely tempted to say, 'Lies, damned lies and sales tax.'",84
181,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"Mr Andrew)Order! Before I call the member for Werriwa, can I just point out to the member for Menzies that I chose not to interrupt him but his remarks were rather more directed to the member for Werriwa than to the chair. I would prefer not to be interrupting the member for Werriwa on the same scale. SoJ just point that out prior to calling the member for Werriwa.",85
182,Mr LATHAM,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"I thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am always much better behaved than the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and I will try to adhere to your very high standards through the course of my speech on the sales tax bills. The previous speaker tried to convince the House that this is an important measure for the opposition. There he was puffing himself· urr-a little man trying to sound big and trying to say that this is an important taxation measure for the opposition. He is exposed by his own presence in the chamber. The measure is obviously not considered important enough for the opposition to send its shadow Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello), to make a speech in the second reading debate. It is not important enough for the OpposItIOn to send its finance spokesperson, the member for Forrest  reading debate. The opposition sent a junior backbencher to do no more than read out nursery rhymes about Alice in Wonderland and Humpty Dumpty. This is not an important measure for the opposition. It is a trivial issue for the opposition which it is trying to make sound big in an attempt to scare people and score a few points in the lead-up to a federal election. If it was an important issue those opposite would not have the mouse that roared, the member for Menzies, at the table, they would have their spokesperson on finance issues or their spokesperson on Treasury and taxation measures. Nobody listening to this debate or considering this matter should think that for the he opposition it is any more than a chance at election populism. This tells a sad tale of where the opposition has come from and where it is going. In respect of taxation matters, it started out just a few years ago as economic rationalists with a big book based on a 15 per cent GST. Those opposite are policy fundamentalists because the book was the wrong book and it had in it the wrong policy and the wrong approach to taxation. So being policy fundamentalists they have gone to the opposite extreme-that is, no book, no policy and nothing but cheap attempts to try to scare people and score political points. That was reflected in the comments of the member for Menzies. He was out there a few years ago selling the virtues of the 15 per cent GST. We would have had a 15 per cent GST on all building materials in the home, not just on a limited array of building materials. The GST would have been imposed on the vanity cabinet, the roof, the floor, the walls and every other part of the building. He was out there telling the people of his electorate that the 15 per cent GST on all those items was good for them. There has been a remarkable transformation by this party of economic rationalists who had a big book on tax policy. Those opposite now come into this House and say that those taxes are no good. Those opposite say to the electorate, 'We have made this incredible transformation from economic rationalists to election populists. ' It would have been not just a 15 per cent GST on building materials, it was a 15 per cent GST on the garden fertiliser, the pool chemicals, the garden shed, the garden hose, the clothes in the house, the books in the house and the food in the house. The member for Menzies was at the forefront of the campaign when they said that all those policies were good for the Australian people. What do we have from the opposition today? It is out with the big book and the 15 per cent GST. We do not get the shadow Treasurer or the shadow spokesperson speaking in this debate, but instead we have the lowly, downgraded backbencher, the member for Menzies, saying that the opposition has changed its position, it is no longer a party economic rationalists, it has discarded that sort of approach and it has now decided to become election populists. Those opposite are out to scare the people of Australia in every way possible so that they can sneak across the line at election time. They have become complete populists. Those opposite should be denounced in this House for such a shameful transformation. There is nothing wrong with a bit of economic rationalism and a bit of spine when it comes to a savings strategy or a rational taxation regime, but it does not have to include a 15 per cent regressive GST. That is where those opposite went wrong-they had the wrong policy approach. They do not know how to put rational economic and taxation policies in place but this government does. That is strongly reflected in these sales tax measures currently before the House. The measures also relate-and this is why I am supporting the legislation-to the government's sophisticated savings strategy. The truth is that you should not be in public life and in parliament in 1995 unless you have got a savings strategy in your pocket. If you have not got a savings strategy to counter the current account deficit and to deal with Australia's external problems you should not be in public life or in parliament and, in the case of the opposition, you should not be arguing your credentials for the next election. The truth is that economic policy in 1995 rests on the fundamental issue of addressing the current account deficit-the underlying rate of 4.5 per cent of GDP. When cyclical variations affect the underlying rate of the current account deficit as they did in 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1995 and when the proportion of GDP approaches six per cent, for sensible reasons, growth has slowed. There are only two answers to that constraint on Australia's long-term economic growth. The first is to make the economy more competitive. The government is doing that through the national competition policy reforms. The Industry Commission has estimated that those reforms will lower the current account deficit by two per cent as a proportion of GDP and that is very significant. The second point is-and of this where I am relevant to the legislationthat we have to have a savings strategy. Mr Rocher- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Despite the last minute bid by the honourable member for Werriwa, the remarks he was addressing to you were totally irrelevant to the measures before the House. If he wants to make a speech at the second reading stage, he has had his opportunity and I suspect he has already made it.",85
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,Mr Andrew)I was not offended by what the member for Werriwa had to say. I call the member for Werriwa.,86
184,Mr LATHAM,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,I was putting my remarks in context and the previous speaker was allowed to read out nursery rhymes about Humpty Dumpty and Alice in Wonderland. How relevant are they to a debate about sales tax?,86
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,The member for Werriwa will resume his seat. I have ruled in his favour. I call the member for Werriwa.,86
186,Mr LATHAM,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The member who raised the point of order was not in the chamber when we heard the nursery rhymes about Alice in Wonderland and Humpty Dumpty. In terms of economic policy for 1995 both sides of the House need to have a savings strategy. It is only possible to have credible economic policies if there is a savings strategy in place to address the current account deficit. This legislation is a very important part of the government's savings strategy that is designed to bring the feder-l budget into surplus. These sales tax measures will add to public savings. That is important because the current account deficit is a reflection of Australia funding investment by using the savings of other nations. We can only close the gap between national savings and national investment by lifting the savings stock in Australia. We always hear from the opposition that public savings are very important to achieve that. Moving the federal budget from a deficit in 1994-95 to a healthy surplus in 1995-96 is the biggest contribution to public savings that has been seen in the fiscal policy area for a long while. You have to go back to the mid-1980s to see such an important contribution to public savings. This is a genuine nation building task to allow the Australian economy to break free of any growth restraint on the external account. It can only happen by increasing national savings which by definition means lowing the share of consumption. There is one thing that should be tattooed onto the foreheads of those opposite-this would allow the press gallery to read it every day when those opposite go to their press conferences-and that is that GDP is equal to national savings plus national consumption. Any party that comes into this place with a savings strategy needs to be aware that improved savings as a proportion of GDP mean a lower share for consumption. That is an undeniable and unavoidable economic rule. It demonstrates the point that in terms of a credible savings strategy there is no quick fix and there is no magic pudding. Savings can only be achieved as a proportion of GDP at the expense of consumption. These sales tax measures before the House are a very important improvement in public savings that also acknowledge a decline in private rates of consumption. They add significantly to Australia's economic strategy. Part of the government's savings strategy on the one .hand is to move into a structural surplus in the budget after this, having had this budget in technical surplus, and on the other hand to introduce a superannuation savings strategy that the opposition could only dream about when it was last in government. The first measure of the legislation is to increase the sales tax payable on passenger motor vehicles to the general rate of 21 per cent-that is, to move it from 16.5 per cent back to 21 per cent where it was prior to One Nation. This acknowledges another economic truth that the opposition should accept-that is, the One Nation statement was designed for counter-cyclical reasons. It was designed to lift Australia out of a period of low consumption and low aggregate demand and get the economy growing again, which it did so magnificently. Having achieved the countercyclical purpose of One Nation, and with the economy now growing so strongly, it is perfectly legitimate for this government to change policy three years after One Nation and bring the passenger motor vehicles back to the general sales tax rate. How has the car industry changed in those three years? Three years ago, at the time of One Nation, the car industry was suffering from a lack of consumption, a lack of aggregate demand, in the Australian economy. But now, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out last week in question time, we have waiting times of six months for some Australian cars. If you decide to purchase an Australian produced car in 1995, there is up to a six-month wait for some models to be delivered. That is how strong the demand and the consumption have become in 1995. The very reason why the sales tax was reduced three years ago has disappeared totally because industry changes. Market conditions are constantly evolving, and it is only sensible that a government would react to those changes. You are a dumb lot if you make no response in policy to changed circumstances. The first principle of good government is change with the times. If aggregate demand and consumption are running away too strongly, if they are spilling over into problems on the external account, the nation needs to address its lack of savings . It can do so by re-establishing the sales tax rate for passenger motor vehicles. It is a very sensible and simple proposition which should be embraced by the opposition and not be the subject of scare campaigns, cheap election populism, or cheap point scoring exercises. So too is the application of sales tax to a numher of building materials sensible. The revenue gain estimated in 1995-96 is $215 miIIion. At various times, both sides of the House have conceded that an important goal for the national savings strategy is to narrow the distortions in the taxation treatment of alternative forms of saving. It is a very simple proposition. This was reflected most clearly in the FitzGerald report on national savings which was at the time heralded by the then shadow Treasurer, the member for Mayo (Mr Downer), as a landmark report, something the government should act on. So here is the government in the 1995-96 budget trying to narrow the distortion by lifting the effective tax rate on owner-occupied housing, but only by a modest amount. StiII it is moving in the right direction. What is so outstanding about the government's saving strategy is that it is moving in the right direction. A wiIIingness to increase national savings, particularly public savings, and just take the top off private consumption at the very peak of the economic cycle is good economic policy.· It is outstanding economic policy. The real task in· Australia in terms of the housing sector is to knock the top off conspicuous housing consumption. Every dollar in this country that goes into conspicuous housing consumption is a dollar that is not going into bank savings, share equities or employee superannuation contributions, where it could be used to finance Australia's aggressive rate of investment. My experience with this goes back to my days in local government when one of the business people in the city of Liverpool made a windfall gain on a property development exercise. I asked that business person, 'What will you do with your windfall gain? Will you put it into value added investment, a bit of manufacturing, a bit of share investment? Will you put it into other forms of equity, into bank savings or into a superannuation scheme where it could be accessed for investment purposes?' He said, 'No, I am not doing any of that. I am building a bigger house.' The fellow at the time lived in a place about a third of the size of this one. He lived in a big house and he was going to build an even bigger house because he acknowledged that it was free from any form of taxation. That is the problem we have in Australia. Conspicuous housing consumption at that lUXUry level of the market, when it is dragging on the pool of savings and adding to consumption in such an economically useless fashion, is against the national interest. This government recognises that fact, as did the opposition years ago. At the time of Fightback and John Hewson's leadership of the Liberal Party, he set this as a legitimate . goal for public policy-that is, to narrow the distortions in the effective taxation treatment of alternative forms of savings. In the national and public interest, this parliament should not be afraid of taxation measures which affect the housing sector, particularly measures as modest as this 12 per cent rate on a narrow band of building materials. To listen to the opposition, you would think that the roof was going to fall in, literally. The truth is that this is for the average home buyer an entirely affordable sales tax regime. It is important to move at that top end of the housing market and knock the top off the conspicuous housing consumption so admired by members opposite. For the national economic interest, it is of very little value. It is in fact a drain on the national savings pool. My conclusion on these measures, and I wish it was reflected in the contributions of opposition members, is that there is no quick fix, no magic pudding, no easy way in which to improve this nation's savings pool because as a proportion of GDP it means improving savings at the expense of the consumption share. The Australian people understand that. Over the 12 years of the internationalisation of the Australian economy, Australians have become more sophisticated in understanding the economic debate. They are looking out for the carpetbaggers, the election populists and the opportunists and they will finger them at the first available opportunity. They will finger them at the next election for who they are and what they represent. In the sophisticated debates that our trading nation should have, they understand that national savings policy is a key test of leadership. When they hear the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) say, as he did recently on radio 2UE, 'Conceptually of course we favour national savings,' the Australian people ask, 'Where's the substance? Where's the policy to tum the concept into reality?, It is not in the attitude the opposition is taking to this legislation because it is saying that it will try to knock it back in the Senate. Those opposite will try to knock it back in the Senate but, if it is passed by the Senate, they will not give a commitment to knock it off if they were to win the next election. The Australian people know how shallow that sort of response is. If it is good enough to oppose in the Senate, it should be good enough for the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer to give a public commitment that, in government, the Liberal and National parties would abolish these sales tax measures. They will not give that commitment. Neither the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow finance spokesperson nor the shadow treasury spokesperson will come into the parliament to debate these issues on the second reading. So the Australian people, in our sophisticated economic debate, can finger that as an abdication of leadership. The Leader of the Opposition is again following the old motto employed by Jim Hacker: I am their leader, I must follow them. That is the sort of attitude that the Leader of the Opposition has embraced. When he says, 'Conceptually of course we favour national savings,' the Australian people ask him, 'Where's the policy to tum the concept into reality?' When people see the members of the opposition moving in the wrong direction, as they are on this legislation, they are exposed totally as oppositionists, populists, carpetbaggers, opportunists and absolute policy flakes.",86
187,Mr ROCHER,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"These three sales tax bills, as my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) amply demonstrated in his remarks, are part of the core of Labor's litany of broken tax promises. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), refuses to acknowledge the point and excuses the lies proffered by the Labor Party prior to the 1993 election as the cause of our concern and at the root of our opposition to these and other measures, which are simply broken promises-that is, lies told during the run-up to the previous election. As for equating sophisticated debate with the presence of a particular person in this chamber, let me remind the honourable member for Werriwa that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) came in here and read a sixminute speech prepared by others to justify these bills: that is the sophisticated debate that we are offered by that mob over there. Why would someone like the shadow Treasurer or the shadow minister for finance bother to come in here when this parliament is treated with the disdain it is by the government and its ministry? What a lmid of codswallop. Of course we want to improve the public savings in this country. We particularly need to improve them, because your mob has got Commonwealth borrowings up to nearly $90 billion in its short time in office. Of course we have to improve the damn thing. We are never going to get into the black though. The government has got us bleeding red ink on the Commonwealth borrowings. It is $90 billion. Talking about sophisticated debate and the contribution to the affairs of this great country, my good friend the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is sitting in here again without any knowledge of what is being discussed. I do not mean that as a criticism; he has other duties. That fellow, the honourable member for Werriwa, just carried on about these bills, but let us recognise the fact that the poor old Minister for Aboriginal and Torres. Strait Islander Affairs drew the short straw. He is on duty. He does not give two hoots about what I am going to say or what the honourable member for Menzies just said. He does not care. Nor will the Assistant Treasurer, the man who is responsible for this legislation, be listening. tinues to be built into the cost of business inputs. This is because in many cases wholesale sales tax is not paid directly but indirectly through the higher prices charged by suppliers who themselves must pay sales tax. The available system of exemptions has done little to reduce the amount of sales tax cascading throughout the production process of too many firms throughout our economy. There is also a whole range of other indirect taxes, such as fuel excise and payroll tax, which business must pay for either directly or indirectly through the higher costs passed on by their suppliers. These taxes are built into the price of a whole range of goods and services that are purchased in the course of conducting business activities. The general criticisms of the sales tax system are many. But the government's ad hoc approach will not solve the problems. The reality is that this government merely ignores the problems in the sales tax system. It ignores the distortion of production and consumption decisions that come about because some goods are hit by sales tax while other goods are not. It ignores the further distortions that result from having a multiple indirect tax rate structure which includes very high rates of tax on some goods. The new measures fail to address the vast array of anomalies that have emerged under the wholesale sales tax, both in the sales tax treatment of certain goods and in the range of exemptions made available to some users of these goods but not to others. There is no recognition of the cascading effect of sales tax, and other indirect taxes for that matter, through the production process. Sales tax will continue to fall heavily on intermediate business inputs, investment goods and exports in addition to the burden placed on consumers. The wholesales sales tax system thus serves to undermine the productive and export potential of Australian businesses. Anomalies in the sales tax system are widespread and, without doubt, beyond resolution by this government. Wedding rings are exempt from sales tax, yet engagement rings are taxed at 31 per cent. Cordial is taxed at 11 per cent, but soft drinks are taxed at 21 per cent. Some household wares are taxed at 11 per cent, but cleaning and other products are taxed at 21 per cent. Biscuits and snack products are taxed-they are also relatively more often consumed by lower income people-yet caviar, crayfish, expensive meats and exotic fruits, which are more likely to be purchased by higher income groups, are not taxed. On a slightly different tack, why should a sign painted on a wall not be subject to sales tax while a sign painted on a board and then attached to the wall is? Why do these anomalies remain in the sales tax system? David Vos of Coopers and Lybrand has stated: It is understood the Labor Party and the Democrats believe in the selective taxing of different goods based on their relative nature. However, the greater number of classifications, the greater the complexity. Sales tax is presently complex because governments over the years have moved the rate of sales tax. on particular goods up or down to appease some whim or to settle some perceived anomaly or inconsistency. Solve one anomaly, and the government creates another. What is the best way of fixing the problem? The simplest way to solve the tax problem would be to abolish sales tax and introduce a consumption tax along the lines of a value added tax or a goods and services tax. This method would even fix the issue of tax payable on the sign that I mentioned earlier. However, the people of Australia rejected that at the last poll. It is off the agenda, and it will not return. The only other viable solution, therefore, is to scrap the existing sales tax system and rebuild it from scratch with simplicity being the No.1 priority. There is a need to have only one sales tax rate apply across the board so that sales tax applies as widely as possible and exeinptions are kept to a minimum. The only exemptions that should be built into the sales tax system are those for business inputs and exports. To have sales tax and excises built into the price of exports is simply a disgrace. It handicaps Australian exporters trying to operate in an extremely competitive international market. In conclusion, sales tax needs a major overhaul. The government's so-called streamlining is inadequate. Labor must make the necessary changes to the sales tax system to reduce the cost of compliance and get off the backs of Australian businesses-in particular, our exporters. Unfortunately, Labor has no policy direction with the present Prime Minister at the helm. Only the election of a coalition government will bring about the necessary reforms.",89
188,Mr OCONNOR,FRINGE BENEFITS TAX,"The sales tax legislation now before the House gives effect to certain revenue raising measures announced in the 1995 budget. In that budget, the government announced a combination of cost-cutting measures and revenue raising measures that have brought the federal budget into surplus well ahead of schedule. The primary aim of this strategy has been to reduce, as nmch as the government can, those market pressures on interest rates. Recent interest rate trends in the marketplace indicate that the government's strategy has been largely successful. Reports in today's national media indicate that short-term rates have fallen below the Reserve Bank official rate of 7.5 per cent and that long-term rates were slashed by 0.4 of it percentage point in response to the budget. As far as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the coalition are concerned, this good news is the stuff nightmares are made of. The opposition's position has always been to blame the government when there are interest rate rises and congratulate everybody else when interest rates fall. These falls are good news for Australian households and businesses throughout the Geelong region, and especially for those hOPle buyers who are now reaping the benefits of a price cutting war on fixed home loan rates in the marketplace. As I said before, the primary aim of the budget was to reduce, as best the government could, the pressures on interest rates and we have been spectacularly successful in that respect. The sales tax legislation before the House relates primarily to the following goods: recycled paper, building materials, model aircraft, passenger motor· vehicles, scaffolding, racking and shelving and floor safes. It is the proposed increase in the sales tax on motor vehicles that I would like to comment a bit more on in this debate. While I understand and appreciate the overall strategy of the government of bringing the budget into surplus this year and reducing that pressure on interest rates, the sales tax increase has meant that several of my constituents who had placed their orders for vehicles as far back as December 1994 and January and February 1995 must now deal with a set of economic and commercial circumstances they did not anticipate when they placed their orders. I have given those constituents an undertaking that I would raise this matter in debate in the House and I am doing so here tonight. In a sense, they have been caught in a commercial crossfire. It is their particular circumstance which prompted me to request the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to examine any possibility at all of exempting these constituents Who had long standing orders for motor vehicles from the sales tax increase. I will expand on their circumstance. As I mentioned earlier, many placed ordersespe.;. cially with Ford dealers to purchase Ford cars as far back as December 1994 and February 1995. Some of those people were Ford employees who, because they receive some concessions on purchases of company ,vehicles, are continually rescheduled to the bottom of the dealer's customer list when the general demand is strong and vehicles are in short supply. What we have seen in the marketplace in recent times is a strong demand for Ford cars and a difficulty on the part of the company in supplying that demand. I am reliably informed that Ford was unable to achieve more than 10 production days in April 1995 due to industrial action that occurred outside of the company, with the BTR Nylex dispute, and some internal industrial disputation Ford itself faced. These factors, coupled with the public holidays that occurred in April, simply meant that the company did not get any more than 10 production d-ys, which set its production schedules back enormously and has led to this pent-up demand in the marketplace. These factors exacerbated Ford's supply problem and, coupled with the strong demand for its vehicles, has brought about a vehicle delivery situation which has stretched to months. One would have thought that Ford customers would have been allowed to renegotiate their purchase contracts with the dealers, given these extraordinary circumstances which have occurred beyond their control. But, unfortunately, that is not the case. The fine print in the dealers' contracts makes the customer liable for increases brought about by factors such as the ones we are debating in this House tonight. The unfortunate thing about it is that many of those customers were not made aware by the dealers of the fine print in those contracts and are now liable for any increases. Dealers, of course, have refused to absorb even part of any increase that has occurred. Many of my constituents have been caught in that commercial crossfire. We have seen strong demand for the Ford product and difficulty in supply and delivery by that company which has been quite beyond the customers' control. They have had to deal with the fine print in the dealers' contracts, which does not enable them to get any redress from the dealers, and they have had to contend with the increases in the sales tax that have been brought down in the budget. As I have stated, I wrote to the Treasurer outlining the particular circumstances many of my constituents found themselves in, and I did request him to explore the issue of bona fide exemptions. The Treasurer has advised me that such exemptions are not possible because of the precedents that they set, and that the government has followed on this occasion the practice of previous Liberal governments and previous Labor governments in scheduling any sales tax increases from budget night. I understand, also, that such exemptions would be extremely complex to administer, given the point at which the tax is levied a?d given the arrangements that dealers make WIth their wholesalers, or their wholesaling arm, to delay to the last possible moment the point at which the consumer actually pays the money over to the r-tailer. The Treasurer holds the view that the financial integrity of the budget has to be maintained on this occasion. I guess that, if we examine the positive market reaction to the budget where we have seen an actual lowering of interest rates already in some sectors of the financial markets, that situation certainly bears out the veracity of the Treasurer's views. I listened with a great deal of patience to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and his diatribe against the government. But the simple fact of the matter is that the coalition, when it left office at the federal level, was a big taxing, big spending government. The members of the coalition do not like to hear people on this side of the House levy that charge. But it is, of course, an accurate charge borne out by the national accounts statistics. While the honourable member for Curtin might seek to levy criticism on the government, he does not levy the same criticism - t the highest taxing Liberal state government m the Commonwealth-in my state of Victoria. It is that particular government which is imposing quite enormous burdens on Victorian taxpayers by virtue of the policies that it is pursuing. The opposition hypocrisy on this matter just does not extend to the taxation area. It really extends to its whole view of the car industry and its synthetic concerns for car customers and car workers in this industry. If we cast our minds back down the time tunnel to 1983 and we look at the profile of the car industry in Australia at that time, we can see that we had an archaic industrial structure. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) correctly pointed out in question time, we h-d a precious piece of industrial archaeology m this country as far as the car industry is concerned. ' For customers in that scenario, we had the car industry producing high priced cars, which meant that ordinary working people paid far more for their cars than they should have. The industry was typified by low levels - f inve-t­ ment in new technology. We had an mdustnal relations system in operation and a culture in the car industry that was nothing short of disgraceful with high levels of industrial disputation and conflict in the enterprises within that sector. The export capability of the sector was simply uncompetitive and not into the export marketplace at all. From 1983, when the coalition went out of government, to 1993, the coalition's view of the car industry changed from one of a do nothing policy to one of having a crack at car workers and decimating the industry . We do not have to go back too far to remember the famous Captain Zero and his plan to wipe out the Australian car industry in this country. That particular policy was opposed by the industry itself. It was opposed by unions in the industry. It was opposed by local governments. It was opposed by local communities, which would have been seriously affected by the coalition's policy if it had been on the treasury bench now and had been implementing the zero tariff policy. The government's plan for the Australian car industry is a sensible, practical one that is designed to restructure the industry to meet the competitive challenges of the future. We have ushered in a new era of industrial peace to this industry. We have changed the work practices to improve productivity. We have given the industry a competitive focus and reoriented the workplace culture to achieving greater productivity. We have overseen massive investments by the major car manufacturers in the industry and it is now exporting to the rest of the world. We have strong exports of components as well. But it is in the area of industrial relations that the hypocrisy of the opposition is most clearly exposed. Recently Ford workers struck an enterprise bargain with the Ford Motor Co. The essence of the benefits that will flow to Geelong car workers from this enterprise deal are: negotiated wage rises of between $2,500 and $4,000 per year; 13 weeks long service leave after 10 years; paid maternity leave; the introduction of family leave; increases in sick leave; the introduction of a relief operators allowance; and improved superannuation provisions. But these award improvements would be slashed by John Howard with a Kennett style individual contract system for the Ford workers at the Geelong Ford plant. In the Geelong Advertiser of 1 June 1995, the union representatives had this to say about the deal that they struck with the Ford Motor Co: AMWU vehicle division secretary Mr Ian Jones said the agreement was good for the future of Ford employees and consolidated the future of Ford in Australia. AMWU vehicle division regional organiser Mr Russell Gardner said . . . ""It is the best deal-it makes Ford workers the highest paid workers in the vehicle manufacturing industry in Australia,"" But what would the coalition do with that set of award conditions which the company and the workers have recently agreed to? It would rip the insides out of that enterprise agreement. It would strip away the award conditions and throw those workers at the mercy of a Kennett style industrial relations system that would lower their wages and take away their conditions. I see the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) smiling away at the dispatch box at what I have just said. But he knows, as well as the workers at Ford, exactly what is in store for the Ford workers if the coalition ever achieves control of the treasury bench in this country. We would have an industrial relations system that would see Ford workers yet again in conflict with their employers on the factory floor. We would see an industrial relations system that would rip the heart out of their hard-fought wages and conditions. We would see an industrial relations system that would return this industry to the condition that it was in when we took over in 1983: a decrepit piece of archaeology that belongs somewhere in an industrial structure of the 1950s and the 1960s, not one appropriate to the competitive challenges and needs of the 1990s and beyond the year 2000. The measures that the government has announced in this budget, including the sales tax measures, are primarily designed to give Australian households and Australian families a crack at the title. The budget is aimed at reducing the pressure on interest rates and ensuring that Australian families in the long term are able to afford homes. It is aimed an ensuring that Australian businesses are given a predictable economic environment in which to plan expansion. Nothing that I have heard from the member· for Curtin or other opposition members in this debate tonight suggests to me that the coalition has either the intellectual capacity or the administrative capability to run the Australian economy in a way that will continue to bring benefits to Australian workers. There is good reason why we do not get the opposition announcing any policies on the floor of this parliament or in any other forum throughout the length and breadth of this country. It is simply because the opposition does not have any policies at this point in time. Those opposite give us a golden opportunity to belt them over the head while they do not have the policies and to have another crack at them when they do announce their policies. We know that when the policies are announced they will not be accepted by the Australian people and will be summarily rejected by Australian workers. We get a double crack at those opposite. We get an opportunity to belt them while they do not have the policies and then come in with the uppercut when they do announce them. Make no mistake you people on the other side: when you do announce your tariff policies, your industrial relations policies and your taxation policies as they relate to the Australian car industry we will be watching them closely. All workers on the floor of the Ford company will know very well when they go into the polling booth on election day exactly what is in store for them if the coalition wins the election.

190,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"Wills) (7.29 p.m.)Regrettably, I must respond to that scurrilous attack on my good self by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) last night. The whippet from Werriwa really was lap-dog Latham as he trotted out that boring, sanctimonious, schoolboy guff. What a joke! There he was, the classic wowser, whining about the fact that I had a cheap glass of pionk at the airport before jumping on a plane to Melbourne. What am I supposed to do? Down half a dozen stubbies in a bus shelter? All this from the same bloke who was in the process of soliciting a trip across the Tasman paid for by the New Zealand taxpayer. Everyone knows what he will be doing in New Zealand: yes siree, he will be studying Rogernomics and working out how to further deregulate the labour market, cut wages and destroy unions. What an absolute hypocrite! No wonder he is a laughing-stock around the place! This is a bloke who has nothing better to do than pore over his database in an attempt to make a big man of himself in the parliament, and in the end his analysis shows that he is just a little boy. 'The member for Wills missed two votes on the appropriation bill in 1993,' he cried, like a tout. That is what an Irish republican calls an informer. He does not realise that oppositions do not in any real sense vote on appropriations. Fancy a bloke who has been handed Gough WhitIam's seat making such stupid statements about the appropriation bills. As for the two divisions on Appropriation Bill (No.1), weren't they profound? One was a silly amendment by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), to reduce the expenditure of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet by $10. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not vote on this stupid division. Nor did the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). The other division was on a motion to grant the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) an extension of time. Again, neither the Prime Minister nor the Deputy Prime Minister voted. Predictably, lap-dog Latham was not in here castigating his Prime Minister or his Deputy Prime Minister or asking them to return part of their big salary. No way known. He is a party man. Are these the kinds of earth shattering motions taxpayers expect their representatives to be dividing on, wasting time on and playing schoolboy games with? If only the taxpayers knew about some of the nonsense that occurs in this place! It gets worse for the whippet from Werriwa. He deceitfully claims that I bypassed the so called landmark Industrial Relations Reform Bill and four votes on the Native Title Bill. In fact, I was on a parliamentary delegation to the subcontinent. I understood there were no proxy votes. I could not swim across the waters. Mr Latham-A junket!",94
191,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"You are going to be on one in New Zealand shortly, mate. When the Native Title Bill was finally passed in this House I voted with the government, a fact that he again deceitfully ignored. Here is a case of a silly boy who does not have the decency, integrity or research skills to get his facts right. What a shame staunch Labor electorates have to have members of this kind foisted on them by the branch stackers. It gets no better for the whippet from Werriwa. Here is a bloke who thinks that the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) was about tariffs on imports. Can you believe it? He does not know the difference between an excise tariff and an import duty. Someone in the party needs to educate him, not only about policy but about common decency. Puffed up with self-importance, he has offered himself as the messenger boy for the ALP in its campaign to win back Wills. 'I'm your man,' he has obviously told the Centre Unity warlord from the other place and the ALP candidate who is himself a refugee from the state parliament. I can only say that the more the whippet opens his mouth, the more confident I feel. Of course I do not participate in every stupid division in this House, and I do not apologise for it. The electors of Wills do not expect me to vote on childish motions of condemnation of the Prime Minister of the kind moved by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. Last night the member for Werriwa confirmed that he is a dill. Fancy stooping so low as to talk about my having an extravagant life style in Melbourne when he knows absolutely nothing about my private life, and there is absolutely nothing extravagant about it. Fancy resorting to those hoary old myths about chardonnay and promoting the idea that only people born in big houses can live in them, or people born into the upper class can have a glass of wine. The people of Wills want far dinkum policies, not a parliamentary charade. When I come into the House I know what the legislation is. I remember bumping into the member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), the president of the Labor Party, en route to a division, and he said, 'Comrade, what are we voting on?' The whippet from Werriwa should not get haughty. Chances are if he opened his mouth this way in Coburg he would be spitting teeth. (Time expired) Award System",95
192,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"This government stands for fairness and security for those who work and for those without work. It stands for the creation of more jobs, jobs with careers, jobs with decent pay and fair working conditions. As a community, we have to be vigilant to defend these goals and the values underlying them-the values of a cohesive, safe and caring community. That is why a little over a year ago the federal government strengthened the award system and, through it, the national minimum entitlements available to workers. These reforms were opposed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), who was incapable of dropping his hard line on industrial relations. While generally the opposition is a policy free zone, it has not dumped the thrust of Jobsback, its 1993 wage and indus. trial relations policy. In 14 years the opposition leader has supported only two wage increases-two $8 safety net increases in 14 years; only $1.10 per week for every year of 14 years. That is the record of the opposition on wages and working conditions for average Australian families. Despite the general arrogance of the opposition in refusing to stand for anything, it has not changed its industrial policy. This, too, in spite of the lessons in Victoria, where Mr Kennett has been giving Jobsback a dry run for three years now. And if Australian workers need reminding of what that means, they should just look at the Victorian government's recent actions. It is advocating a minimum wage of $8.60, which represents a cut of $60 per week or, roughly, $3,000 per year for minimum wage recipients. The effect of the industrial relations strategies of the opposition could not be clearer to Australian workers: because it has only committed itself to minimum protection for workers, entitlements such as penalty rates, leave loading, shift allowance and family leave would be abolished under the coalition. Its spokesman, the member for Flinders, Mr Reith, is committed to abolishing the no disadvantage test. Workers receiving those entitlements would receive a real wage deduction under the coalition's industrial relations policy. Let us consider what that would mean. For a typical unskilled labourer who currently works an average amount of overtime-which is 10 hours-without penalties, the reduction in overtime pay would be $199 per week or $4,888 per year. For a part-time worker on low pay-say, a nurse who works 16 hours each weekend-under the current arrangements his or her pay would be $299 a week but without penalties it is reduced to $184 a week. This amounts to a loss of $5,970 a year or, put another way, a 38 per cent wage reduction. There can be only one conclusion: the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip money and conditions away from people earning average wages. The Leader of the Opposition would like nothing better than to take away from these people their annual leave loadings and their overtime. The opposition will say that under its system you can opt to stay under the award but there will be no updating of the award over time and all new entrants to the work force will be assured of only four basic minimum conditions. The objective is to reduce real wages for ordinary workers. The net result of the policy of the Leader of the Opposition is an erosion of the working conditions and the safety net for all Australian workers. This has been demonstrated by the Kennett and other conservative state governments. Since 1993 the size of the federal industrial relations system has increased by 400,000 workers. This has been due entirely to the neanderthal industrial policies of the conservative state governments, such as the one in Victoria. Since 1993, federally, we have seen the introduction, through the Industrial Relations Reform Act, of national minimum entitlements based on ILO conventions. These have all been opposed by the opposition. These entitlements guarantee all workers the right to a fair minimum wage, 12 months unpaid parental leave, equal pay for work of equal value and protection against unfair dismissal. All of these ILO mandated standards are in the firing line under Jobsback. At the next federal election the danger of these attacks is greater. This time the stakes are higher. For all workers in Queensland who have escaped hardline conservative state government industrial relations policies, the Leader of the Opposition, federally, presents a new and greater threat, a threat from which there will be no escape. To all Australian workers who rely on the national minimum standards, . including protection from unfair dismissal, the Leader of the Opposition will be the enemy. What is astonishing is his belief that he can marry this kind of industrial relations policy with his pro-family rhetoric. He professes to be concerned about the battlers and yet he wants to carve away from a nurse $6,000 a year and from an unskilled person just on $5,000 a year. That is what the Leader of the Opposition is on about. How can he be pro-family when he wants to rip away the safety net of family income earners? How can he be pro-family when he will guarantee new workers the protection of only one or two minimum entitlements? How can it be pro-family to put at risk penalty rates, shift allowances, public holidays, loadings and restrictions on working hours? How can it be pro-family to have a Victorianstyle $8.60 minimum wage or to oppose the non-disadvantage test national parental leave and equal pay for work of equal value? (Time expired) Roads",95
193,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"In this debate on the adjournment I want to point out to the House the extraordinary performance we saw from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe) in the Main Committee. In one of the most irresponsible and misleading contributions I have ever heard, in just five minutes he made at least four grossly misleading statements. The first was in relation to road funding, when he said: . . . the federal government hands to states and to local government an amount in excess of $2 billion of untied funds which is spent on roads. Those are the words he used. But, if you look at page 3-202 of Budget Paper No. 1 at the identified road grants to the states, you will find that they were $369.2 million and that identified local road grants on page 3-205 were $358.1 million. That is a total of $727 million, not the $2 billion that the parliamentary secretary bandied around. As someone who supposedly knows what goes on in the portfolio, I would have thought he would have a few ideas. Seven hundred million dollars is very different from $2 billion. He then talked about the amount of money that states spend on the roads as if it all came from the Commonwealth. What about all the money the motorists pay to the states in taxes? There are fuel franchise fees, registration charges, licensing fees, tolls in some cases, fines and stamp duty. All of this money is raised by the state government; it does not come from the Commonwealth. It seems he could not understand the difference and got quite confused as he continued his speech. It is a great worry to think that the parliamentary secretary for transport really does not understand this. Let us get to the second misleading statement in his speech. He said that the Bureau of Transport Economics says that at least $6 billion a year is associated with the cost of road safety. He stated: What pays for that? Who pays for the ambulances, the hospitals and all of that? It comes out of untied funds that the federal government hands over. What a load of nonsense. He obviously has not heard about compulsory third party, comprehensive insurance, private health insurance, the Medicare levy and all these things that are paid for by the motorists and none of which have got anything to do with the Commonwealth government. To find a bit of authority he did not have to go any further than the BCA report Refocusing road reform. Page 310 of that report states: The Interstate Commission (ISC 1990) estimated that the 'uncompensated' cost derived from subtracting ... insurance premiums ... from an estimated total road accident cost ... was $1.6 billion ... That was just one report. Next, Dr Quiggin, someone the Labor Party likes to quote, in 1993 estimated that a 'lower bound' solution of accident costs imposed by motorists on non-motorists was $1.2 billion per year-even less. Meyrick Associates in a 1994 report said: The total external cost of accidents to be taken into account in charging policies is therefore $1350 million ... That is a very big difference from the $6 billion that the parliamentary secretary seemed to quote. I wonder whether he was getting himself confused. If he looked in the budget papers, he would have found that the total Commonwealth contribution to road safety was $6.4 million, not billion. Obviously this poor man is rather confused. Then he said about petrol pricing: The petrol tax argument is a dud ... Even the Road Transport Forum has given it away. Even the automobile associations have given it away. I do not know where this guy is, because he went on to say: Show me when they last ran the petrol tax argument. He ojlght to have a clear look. In the latest annual report of the Australian Automobile Association, the third paragraph of the president's report said: Increasing the level of taxes on road users and reducing the level of expenditure on roads inevitably leads to higher transport costs, higher prices, higher inflation and less competitive exports. Below it there is a chart showing fuel excise versus expenditure on roads. If he looked at the RTF contribution to the budget papers, he would find· that in 1995 it brought the same argument up. Clearly, this man is rather confused. In the five minutes he made at least four major misleading statements-I cannot get to the fourth one in the time available to me. Clearly, he ought to hang his head in shame. If he pretends to be a minister, then he has obviously got to do a lot better. It was a foolish contribution and I think the smirk on his face showed that even he did not take his contribution seriously. (Time expired) Member for Deakin",96
194,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise with the House matters raised in this parliament yesterday by the member for Deakin (Mr Aldred). The member made a number of allegations concerning Mr Mark Leibler, a prominent Melbourne lawyer, a prominent member of the Melbourne Jewish community and a prominent member of the Australian Jewish community. The member for Deakin made allegations which link Mr Leibler with currency transacassociated tions involving organised crime and drug trafficking. He made allegations that Mr· Leibler is an agent in a 'major financial transaction involving the Israeli intelligence service, the Mossad, and the Secretary to Department of Foreign Affairs produced a piece of paper, allegedly signed by Mr Costello, and used that as the evidence to base these scurrilous and outrageous allegations against a prominent member of the Jewish community in Australia. This is not the first occasion that the ber for Deakin has attacked the Victorian Jewish community. His record is that of person who despises the Australian Jewish community. That is revealed in previous attacks that he has made in this House against Mr Leibler. Yesterday was the fifth occasion that the member for Deakin has used the forms of this House to attack Mr Leibler-the fifth occasion! On the previous four occafor sionsMr Aldred-I have expressed some concerns about Mr Leibler on a number of occasions, but Mr Leibler and his activities not constitute the Jewish community.",98
195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Deakin will not do that again.,98
196,Mr CLEELAND,ADJOURNMENT,"The last time that Mr Leibler was attacked, a report in the Australian Financial Review of Friday, 10 July 1992 stated: . .. Mr Aldred had cqnducted against him a campaign of personal defamation and libel no fewer than four times in the House of Representatives. That was a campaign that was designed to suggest impropriety on the part of the Australian Jewish community. The member for Deakin is not just content to attack Mr Leibler. He has also attacked the Smorgon family, another prominent and well known Australian Jewish family, particularly prominent in the Victorian Jewish community, The member for Deakin, in the attack on the Smorgons-again, a typical unsubstantiated, unproven and now forgotten chargealleged that Smorgon family, who are the owners of Smorgon Consolidated Industries, with criminals. The honourable gentleman may say in this House that he is not anti-Jewish, but his history, his behaviour and his attacks on prominent Melbourne Jewish people are recorded, they are in the Hansard, they are unsubstantiated and he and Trade.' He stands condemned. The honourable gentleman has a history of this kind of behaviour. I serve on the Standing Committee on Privileges, and I vividly recall the time when he alleged that a member of this House was· in the pay of a foreign government. He was referring to Mr Lewis memKent. That matter was investigated by the privileges committee. I sat on the privileges a committee where the gentleman had a chance to put the evidence. He failed to conform with the forms of this House. We often hear about the concern of the conservatives about conventions, the standards of the parliament and the behaviour of members of parliament. On this occasion, they tried to defend the member Deakin, as is their want on all occasions when he behaves in this way. When the privileges committee, in a report to this House, asked the honourable member do to apologise to the House for this behaviour, he refused. I know that the member has no evidence, because he has never had any evidence. He continually fails to produce evidence, but he continually attacks prominent Jewish members of the Australian community. He brings into disrepute Mr Leibler and the Smorgon family. He condemns them in this House continually. I say to him that he is anti-Jewish. I say to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), 'Do not forgive him or try to condone him; get rid of him. Bring the member to heel.' (Time expired) Budget 1995-96: Queensland",98
197,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to make some remarks concerning the budget and its implications for North Queensland. North Queensland is the great juggernaut of the Australian economy, producing some $12,000 million a year in export earnings. Whilst 1I have not had time to pin all the figures down exactly, Mount Isa Mines produces some $1,200 million to $1,300 million a year in export earnings; the coal industry, about $4,000 million; the tourism industry, about $2,000 million; the aluminium industry, about $1,000 million; the sugar industry, about $2,000 million; and the cattle and sheep industries, about $2,000 million. These add up to some $12,000 million per year in export earnings. When the Australian dollar was allowed to float in 1986, the dollar floated down to 59c. At that time Australia owed only some $70,000-odd million. Today Australia owesas we know from the figures that were released recently-$170,000 million. Since the dollar floated down to 59c in 1986, presumably today it would float down to less than 59c if it were allowed to free float, if there were not intervention buying by the Reserve Bank and if there were not artificial interest rates; The proposition of Mr Hitler and Mr Goebbels, in Mein Kampf, was that if you say something even though it is not true and say it long enough and often enough people will believe it. People on the other side have obviously very satisfactorily read and digested that. They have actually got people believing that interest rates of 10 per cent for business are really excellent. Those interest rates of per cent for business exist at a time when our trading partners in the United States have interest rates of 6Yz per cent and our trading partners in Japan have interest rates of 3Yz per cent. If the dollar floated down to where it should be-if it went to 59c then I think we could assume it would go to 50c now-that would mean an extra 50 per cent, nearly $6,000 million, coming into the economy of North Queensland, defined as Bundaberg north .. Mr Dodd interjecting",99
198,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I take the interjection from the honourable member for Leichhardt. He is denigrating and laughing at me for advocating the dollar being pushed down. That would bring into Cairns, his electorate, about $300 million a year extra in export earnings; and he is sitting there laughing. But then people in Cairns say that he laughs at most things. Let me move on. The way to accomplish that is to bring interest rates down to the same levels as our trading partners in the United States and Japan. The rate in Japan the last time. I looked was 3.5 per cent, and six per cent in the United States. This would mean interest rates in this country of about four or five per cent. That would bring the dollar down to where it should be. The theft literally of thousands of millions of dollars which the people of North Queensland are entitled to would then be returned to those people, who at the present moment are reeling on the ropes. Not only have they got the theft of the Australian dollar being placed up where it is but also they have the thieving out of their pockets through interest rates-and I am not even including the tax of the federal government. Couple that with the aggressive marketing policies in the areas of petrol and wool. The minimum price scheme which enabled us to get a decent price for our product was abolished by the socialists who are in government in Australia at the present moment. As a result, instead of this country receiving $6,000 million a year in export earnings from wool, we receive only a little over $2,500 million a 10 year. That is an average loss to this country of $3,500 million per year. In the period of oil deregulation, and I am talking here about Hilmer-the only other area of the economy that was deregulated was banking, which was an absolute disaster-the price of oil worldwide dropped clean in half. The Brent price was around $34 a barrel; it is now down to $17 a barrel-in fact, one quote was $14 a barrel. At the same time the price of petrol in Australia doubled. (Time expired) Member for Deakin",99
199,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"I also wish to refer to the outrageous misuse of the forms of this parliament by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) yesterday. In particular, I wish to refer to the speech that he made to the Main Committee on the appropriation bill in which he outrageously attacked in an unsubstantiated fashion a number of people, including Mr Michael Costello and Mr Mark Leibler. The honourable member for Deakin has a long history of making paranoid conspiracy theories and accusations in this place and elsewhere without any substantiation. I will just give some examples. In 1983 he suggested that the then Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, was connected with the mafia.. Subsequently he said that Kokums, the Swedish shipping firm, was run by Soviet spies. Then he said that the former judge of the High Court, Lionel Murphy, had been engaged in meetings with Abe Saffron. In the late 1980s the honourable member said that the former member for Hotham, Mr Lewis Kent, was a spy for a foreign government. More recently he has made other attacks on Mr Mark Leibler which were described by members of his own party, such as the former member for MACKellar, as 'disgraceful' and even by the current honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as 'a matter of regret'. Most recently he has attacked the Smorgon family as being linked with organised crime. There is one common thread in all of these accusations-that is, that there has been no substantiation and no follow-up. To the best of my knowledge, nobody has been convicted of any crimes or even charged with respect to any of the allegations made. It is no wonder that the honourable member for Deakin has in his career been rejected by the voters in Henty, rejected by his own preselectors in Bruce, rejected again by his own pres electors in Deakin and then most recently rejected by preselectors in Queensland. Mr Swan-He should run for Kennedy.",100
200,Mr TANNER,ADJOURNMENT,"He might have better success up there. I would like to refer to the specifics in his speech because they make rather interesting reading. We are not told where he got this letter purporting to relate to a transfer of $640,000 of drug money to Mr Michael Costello. There is no evidence of authenticity of the letter. In effect, there is just a complete outrageous unsubstantiated smear of a senior public servant who obviously cannot reply in this forum. By implication, he accuses Mr Costello of rendering services to a foreign government or intelligence service for drug money. Some of his evidence to indicate the authenticity of this accusation includes the following: that Mr Costello was the architect of the Cambodian peace plan and he actually did not have much of a background in Asia. What that has to do with the accusation is beyond me. The honourable member for Deakin also refers to allegations of 'many long lunches, dinners and animated conversations' with a Soviet employee, Valery Zemskov, who is alleged to be a KGB agent. What the fact that Mr Costello has alleged to have had animated conversations or dinners with anybody has to do--even if those accusations are true, and I would be interested to know what the source of those is-with an allegation that he ,has received substantial amounts of drug money from a foreign government is also absolutely beyond me. The honourable member has also stated that Mr Costello 'has been suspected and interviewed on previous occasions by the AFP in relation to the disclosure of official information'. How do we know that he is suspected? What is the basis of this accusation? Surely it is logical that if a leak was being investigated the Federal Police would actually talk to the head of the department about it. If you actually look at some of the specifics, he describes Mr Costello as a monument to mafia mateship. Again, a smear has been thrown around with gay abandon and with no supporting evidence. He indicates that at the time this alleged letter was written, Mr Costello was overseas. So what? He also points out that Mr Costello has been to Brazil and Chile, which happened to be in the same continent as the country that this letter is alleged to have come from. What an incredible, ridiculous load of nonsense! Why are we receiving these allegations? I think we need to look at the staffing arrangements of the honourable member for Deakin and the fact that in September last year he employed a former ASIO agent and former employee of the Office of National Assessments, Mr Andrew Campbell, who has a history of engaging in things of this nature, particularly with respect to Mr Costello. Why are these things occurring? Perhaps, most importantly, we should ask: where is honest John, the man of proprietary-the man who has condoned the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and others, smearing Senator Richardson, who was cleared by the Federal Police investigation only very recently-who wants to present himself as the great defender of parliamentary propriety? Where is he in all of this? (Time expired) Kopassus Members: Training",100

(2) How long did each State take to respond in each case. (3) Was agreement eventually reached in each case; if not, why not. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The effort required to research the files and papers of the various steering committees, in order to obtain an answer for the honourable member's question, would require a number of staff going off-line for a considerable period. I am not prepared to authorise either the time or the resources needed to provide the comprehensive answer required of this question. Nursing Services: Processing Payments (Question No. 2112) Mr Hicks asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: (1) What is the average time taken by his Department to process an account for nursing services between receipt and payment. (2) Does his Department issue individual cheques to service providers for each patient receiving care. (3) Is his Department able to issue a single cheque on a regular basis to a service provider for a number of patients; if not, why not. (4) Will his Department implement the procedure referred to in part (3) to assist service providers to reduce the costs of bank fees and paperwork. Councils Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department undertakes to pay all claims within 28 days of receipt. The current average across Australia for the processing of nursing service claims is 14.2 days. (2) My Department issues cheques to providers three times a week (for example, Monday, Wednesday, Friday). All cheques processed for a provider are included in the next cheque run, for example, claims processed for a provider on Tuesday would be included in the Wednesday run. If only one claim for one patient is processed for that provider in this time, a cheque for only one patient will be sent. If more claims are processed for that provider in this time, the cheque will cover all the claims processed and will normally be for multiple patients. Up to 50 service vouchers may be attached to each claim form. If a provider is a member of a pay group, the cheque issued will be made out to the one person/company and it will be that person/company's responsibility to issue cheques to each of the pay group members. It may be that the company issues individual cheques to each of the group members. A service provider (such as a community nurse) may also nominate a payee provider (for example, a nursing agency) to receive payment for the services provided. In tins case the cheque is sent to the payee provider, who would then pay the service provider. (3) My Department is already able to issue single cheques to a provider covering a number of patients. (4) The procedure suggested is already in place. Poultry: Export to People's Republic of (Question No. 2130)",121
230,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 6 March 1995: (1) Is there a ban on the export of all Australian poultry and poultry products to the People's Republic of China; if so, (a) how long is the ban expected to apply, (b) is the ban attributable to an outbreak of avian influenza in Queensland (c) is the influenza outbreak confined to Queensland; if so, why does the ban apply to all Australian poultry and poultry products and (d) what action will the Government take to (i) control and confine the outbreak of avian influenza in Queensland and (ii) protect Australian poultry exporters, including two in the electoral division of Stirling, and their employees, who depend on the Chinese market. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The People's Republic of China issued a notice effective 19 January 1995 banning the imports of all poultry meat/products from Australia in accordance with the China quarantine law. After representations by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) the Chinese authorities advised on 1 March 1995 that cooked poultry meat products from the States and Territories other than Queensland will be permitted into the People's Republic of China. The import permit will be issued by the Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine upon receiving permit application from the importer. Each consignment of permitted above-mentioned products must be accompanied by a Veterinary Health Certificate issued by AQIS attesting that the products have been subjected to a specified heat treatment. (a) the Chinese authorities have advised, if there is no further case of fowl plague on 23 June 1995 according to the International Animal Health Code then the Chinese Authority may lift the ban. (b) the ban is attributable to the avian influenza outbreak in Queensland. (c) the avian influenza outbreak in December 1994 was confined to Queensland. The ban is applied in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Entry and Exit Animal and Plant Quarantine and the Office Internationale Des Epizooties (OlE) International Animal Health Code. China (d) (i) the Commonwealth and other State and Territory Governments have provided financial assistance to the Queensland Government, which has constitutional responsibilities for animal disease control, under the Commonwealth/States cost sharing agreement for certain exotic animal diseases, which includes Avian influenza in it virulent form. Assistance has also been provided with diagnosis and advice by the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The Queensland Department of Primary Industries declared a restricted area around the affected property, destroyed all poultry on the farm and undertook extensive disease surveillance of other properties in the vicinity of the affected property. It is now believed that the outbreak of avian influenza in Queensland has been eradicated. (ii) the Government has made representations, both by AQIS directly and by the Australian Embassy in Beijing, to firstly limit the ban to the infected area immediately surrounding the infected property, or alternatively, to limit the ban to the poultry products from Queensland only. These representations have been particularly useful in that cooked product from all of Australia, except Queensland is now permitted. Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Netball Telecasts (Question No. 2280) Mr Mack asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 30 March 1995: (1) Has the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) broadcast netball matches played between Australia and South Africa during 1995; if so, (a) how many matches, on what dates and at what times, (b) did the ABC receive payments or other consideration for broadcasting the matches; if so, (i) who made them, (ii) in what form were they made, (iii) when were they made, (iv) what agreement, arrangement or understanding was entered into and (v) did the ABC assess the agreement against its guidelines,before (A) entering into the agreement or (B) broadcasting the events, (c) if the ABC received no payments or other considerations, what are the details of each agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into relating to the broadcasting of the matches, and (d) did the ABC seek the right to (i) regulate display of commercial advertising material placed around the match venues or (ii) modify its placement to alter the amount visible during broadcast. (2) When it agrees to broadcast sporting events, does the ABC retain the right to refuse to broadcast an event or part of an event or modify the broadcast if commercial advertising material is displayed at the venue; if so, what are the details of the sports, events, organising bodies, advertisers and amounts of advertising material concerned. (3) Will the Government impose restrictions on the ABC or its agents and contracting parties concerning the receipt of payment or other consideration for broadcasting events containing commercial advertising material; if so, what restrictions. (4) Will the Government ensure that the ABC remains free of commercial or other pressure related to advertising material displayed at sporting events broadcast by the ABC; if so, by what means. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (a) Three. On 18 February 1995 at 7.30pm, on 22 February 1995 at 8.30pm and on 25 February 1995 at 7.30pm. (b) No. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 at s.25(3) provides that the Corporation does not have power to accept any payment .or other consideration for the broadcasting of any announcement, program or other matter. However, the ABC did enter into a co-production agreement (see (c) below), as allowed under s.25(5) of the Act. (c) The only agreement entered into by the ABC in connection with these Netball Tests was with the All Australian Netball Association (AANA). Under that agreement the ABC acquired the right to make a recording of each of the Tests and the right to exercise the following broadcasting rights in respect of those recordings: Australian free-to-air television rights South African free-to-air and pay television rights Non-exclusive Australia Television rights Co-production funds with AANA partly offset the costs of making the recordings and in return they received the following rights: All other free-to-air and pay television rights worldwide Worldwide video and non-theatric rights. (d) The agreement requires AANA at the ABC's request to remove or reposition promotional signage or other matter present at the venue in order that the the ABC may ensure that its telecast of the events does not result in any contravention of its obligations under the Act and complies with its Editorial Policies. The Policies state in relation to signage ""Organisers of events which the ABC wishes to broadcast should be informed by the prohibition of advertising on the domestic radio and television services and Radio Australia, and ABC cameras must not dwell upon on-site advertising. Incidental coverage of signage which mentions commercial products would not, in law, constitute advertising. If an Executive Producer considers that coverage of an event cannot avoid dwelling on particular commercial names and the organiser refuses to relocate signs, the matter should be referred immediately to the relevant Department Head for appropriate action."" (2) The agreement provision referred to in (d) above is a standard inclusion in sporting event agreements of this nature, as is a further provision that the ABC shall not be liable in damages or otherwise should the ABC decide not to telecast an event for any reason whatsoever ie, there is no obligation to broadcast. (3) As noted in l(b), the ABC Act includes restrictions on the ABC accepting payment or other consideration for broadcasting events. Section 31 (1) of the Act provides that the Corporation shall not broadcast advertisements. It is a duty of the ABC Board (s.8(1)(b) of the Act) to maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation. (4) See (3) above.",122
