1,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Ronald Edwards) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA RESERVE BANK: MONETARY",9
2,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer and I refer him to his statement at a press conference on 5 April 1990 when he said: At no stage in my seven years have I been at difference with the central bank about monetary policy, at no stage. I therefore ask the Treasurer whether he can assure the House that he is still in complete agreement with the views of the bank on monetary policy as expressed by its Governor in his speech last night.",9
3,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I am in agreement about monetary policy. But I am obviously not in agreement with him about the imminent need for another wage-tax trade-off. That is not around the corner. It may be that in the future conditions may be propitious to effect a cut, a downward step, in inflation through such a wage-tax arrangement. After all, the Government has done four of these already-and the current one is yet to be paid from 1 January.",9
4,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is just a timing difference.,9
5,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it is not just a timing difference; it is a point of making a judgment about the pipeline effect on wages, the trajectory on wages; about whether such a decision, such a policy, can be as effective as it needs to be for the diminution in the surplus that comes. They are matters for judgment. At the moment, before the next tax cut is paid, which will be in January, the conditions are simply not there to be seeking or indeed eking such a deal from the trade unions-a step down in nominal wages and inflation. This is the first government that has ever produced a surplus in the nation's history; and it is not there because we are accountancy freaks. It is there because we need that ballast against the savings we are borrowing abroad. We need to change the balance of Australian savings. The retention of those public sector savings through the surplus is entirely important. The surplus has not been immutable. We have run it down on occasions. We ran it down by $51f2 billion in 1988-89 for acPOLICY cord mark 5 which saved our inflation rate rising to double digits as has happened in Britain. In the same episode of high demand, Britain has had its inflation rate go from 4 to 11 per cent. In exactly the same conditions, our inflation rate has declined-and declined because of accord mark 5 and because of monetary policy. It declined because we paid a tax cut with a wage equivalence of 6 per cent. Instead of wages being adjusted, as the market would have adjusted them, by 14 or 15 per cent, we adjusted wages by 61f2 per cent. That is why the accord has been successful. But I must say this: as far as the Governor and I are concerned we are totally at one about the central message of his speech-the Opposition should take some notice of this because, were it to win the next election, Mr Fraser would be the Governor of the central bank that the Opposition would inherit-when he said: Itthat is, 'monetary policy'cannot deliver lower inflation-at acceptable costs-on its own. He does not agree with the shadow Treasurer's central view that you can reduce inflation by squeezing the guts out of the economy. Now, with the business community, with the Business Council-",9
6,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is what you people have done.,9
7,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How does the Leader of the Opposition say that? We have accord mark 6 in place this minute. How does he say that when accord mark 6 is in place this minute? Listen to this. The Governor of the Reserve Bank goes on to say: Wage increases, of course, contribute to price increases, although during most of the 1980s average earnings have actually increased more slowly than the CPI. Listen to this: Many people, perhaps blinkered by their ences of a very different relationship in earlier periods, have great difficulty acknowledging this change. What does the shadow Treasurer have say today? I mean, the accord has been statistically basically a disaster for this country. It has meant lower standards of living for the average lian family. What does the Governor say? He says: During most of the 1980s average earnings actually increased more slowly than the CPI. He is saying, 'One cannot do it without an accord'. But the shadow Treasurer has no mechanism for an accord; he does not believe in one. In fact, the shadow TreasMinister urer said today: I don't think a wage tax trade-off is a good idea. So here is the Gove-nor arguing for wage-tax trade-off and a weakening of cal policy while the shadow Treasurer arguing for no wage-tax trade-off and tightening of fiscal policy.",9
8,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is your view. That not is what you argued.,10
9,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I did not. Memthis bers opposite do not know which way is up. Mr Reith-I know which way is down.",10
10,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here you are. Here is the Governor telling us that many people are, perhaps, blinkered by their experience and have great difficulty acknowledgabout ing this change-that is, the change that in the 1980s average earnings have acabout tually increased more slowly than the But what does the shadow Treasurer say? He says that the accord has been a disastive ter. In Britain, where the policies he lieves in were pursued, they are looking at an 11 per cent inflation rate-from per cent to 11 per cent in a craft structure in a period of acceleratingpemand. exactly the same phase, we have decelerthe ating inflation which is between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. Yet the members opposite are such dummies that they are still saying that they do not believe in accord. Frankly, what would it matter what they believed in? What would it matter? .In the great scheme of national events, what would it matter what the experishadow Treasurer believed in? We then have the Leader of the Opposition who for years has been talking about, as he calls it, a steadier 'monitory' to policy-I do not know how he gets the word 'monitory' from 'monetary', but and somehow he does-a steadier 'monitory' Austrapolicy. M-o-n-e-y spells and is pronounced money as far as I am concerned, and m-o-n-e-t-a-r-y is monetary policy. Anyway, I know that he is a professor have and he could not be wrong about this. The fact of the matter is, in pursuing a steadier 'monitory' policy, as he puts it, he would like to squeeze inflation out of the system although, in Britain, Prime Thatcher has proven conclu.,. sively that it fails.Â· Now, when the Governor of the Reserve Bank gets up to talk a about another wage trade-off which has fisbeen successful in the past, members of is the Opposition then disparage the Gova ernment for the suggestion. I am simply saying that the Governor is not, in fact, suggesting it, even though the text does quite explain this well. He is not suggesting it now, because I spoke to him morning-he is not suggesting it now. Mr Reith-What did you say to him?",10
11,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say that he has more worth in his finger than a paddock full pf members opposite, I can tell them that. At least he is one fellow who is keen seeing inflation and the current account repaired and is doing something it. He is not pursuing .stupid poliCPI. cies which do not work and have been seen not to work. This is quite an illustratext for the Opposition in terms of beits own policies from the person who. would run the central bank, were it to be 4 the elected government. The fact is that what is being proposed In here is as the Government has done in past, but these views that are expressed in this speech are the Governor's own views. He did not check this speech with me. I did not see it before its release. an They are his own views and they are views which, at the moment, I do not accept, nor does the Treasury and nor do some people in the Reserve Bank. However, I do not disparage him for putting them in a sensible debate, particularly as he is pointing out to the Opposition of this country that its policies do not work-the policy construction that they have fails. NA",10
12,Mr LAVARCH,INTEREST RATES,My question is also directed to the Treasurer. I refer him to the Government's action yesterday in reducing interest rates. Can the Treasurer inform the House whether he has any information on when customers can expect to receive the benefits of this action in lower commercial and housing interest rates?,11
13,Mr KEATING,INTEREST RATES,"We have already seen falls overnight .in response to the fall in the cash rate to 13 per cent. The State Bank of South Australia has already announced that it will reduce its home lending rate from 16 to 15 per cent, effective from 1 November. For new owner-occupied home loan customers this 15 per cent rate will take effect as from today. With regard to loans to business, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and the ANZ Banking Group Ltd yesterday announced reductions in their prime lending rates, both passing on the full one percentage point reduction to customers, effective on 22 October. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia's overdraft reference rate and loan reference rate will fall to 16 and 15.5 per cen t respectively, while the ANZ Bank's prime lending rate will also be 16 per cent. The Government has been able to see interest rates decline, and relief is now coming to home owners. I believe that the other banks will pass through fully the decrease in costs which is part and parcel of yesterday's change in official rates. That should see housing rates decline and we should see a further decline in commercial rates across the country. Again, I make the point that the Opposition says that these rates can only be accommodated with a further tightening of fiscal policy-that is, a further cutback in transfer payments to the aged, the unemployed, the sick and everybody else. Only then would it accommodate a reduction in interest rates. We reject that view. Interest rate relief is coming through. Not only is that coming through but there will be an adjustment to the consumer price index to the September quarter of $12, and a tax cut of about $7.50 a week paid from January. The fortunes of many people will actually be improving over the next six months as these wage increases and tax cuts come through, along with lower mortgage interest costs. That will be important to many home owners who have borne the cost of housing interest rates over the last two years or so. Not only have they had the one per cent reduction since early in the year from 17 to 16 per cent but they should have more than that as these rates flow through. RESERVE BANK: MONETARY NA",11
14,Mr HOWARD,POLICY,"My question is also directed to the Treasurer. Is it not a fact that the assertion of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia last night that monetary policy was an ineffective weapon in reducing the current account deficit was identical to the terms of an assertion of his deputy, Mr John Phillips, on 20 June last which drew a severe and inaccurately based public rebuke from the Treasurer? Now that the Treasurer has confirmed that his views and those of Mr Fraser on monetary policy are identical, does he acknowledge that monetary policy is an ineffective weapon in reducing the current account deficit and will he at this stage ",11
15,Mr KEATING,POLICY,He never said that.,11
16,Mr HOWARD,POLICY,Neither did John Phillips.,11
17,Mr KEATING,POLICY,"Let me read it to the honourable member. If he wants to base a question on a falsity then he must wear it. He said: . . . while monetary policy must continue to bear down on inflation and inflationary expectations, it cannot deliver lower inflation-at acceptable costs-on its own. He was not talking about the current account deficit. The demonstration is there for all to see. In the year to late 1989 gross national expenditure (GNE)-Mr Jull-'Gross'.",11
18,Mr KEATING,POLICY,"The honourable member is gross. We ought to have him on Slim tabs, or something. GNE, or all national spending, was outstripping product growth by two to one. Now it is less than product growth. Monetary policy plays an effective role in reducing a cyclical current account deficit.",12
19,Mr HOWARD,POLICY,Do you want the quote?,12
20,Mr KEATING,POLICY,The honourable member for Bennelong asked the question; he should listen to the answer.,12
21,Mr HOWARD,POLICY,Read it all.,12
22,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,POLICY,The honourable member for Bennelong has asked the question.,12
23,Mr KEATING,POLICY,He can get up in a minute.,12
24,Mr HOWARD,POLICY,Turn to page 4.,12
25,Mr KEATING,POLICY,"I will turn to page 4. Conceptually, we have all the bases covered, son, so do not worry. Turn to pages 4 or 5; do not worry. He asked the question, so he should listen to the answer: monetary policy is effective in reducing a cyclical current account deficit, not in ducing a structural current account deficit. That can only be done with fiscal policy, industry policy, et cetera. Mr Phillips made an error in his remarks in that he never used the word 'cyclical'. He referred to a current account deficit. He has since admitted to me that that is true and he has since admitted to me that that was a ""mistake he made in his text. What Mr Fraser is saying is a total rebuke to the Opposition's policy on inflation. What he says is that the notion, the simplistic view, that one can employ a savage monetary policy to squeeze inflation to that of our trading partners cannot happen because the nation will not bear the pain. Mr Tim Fischer-It is your policyyour pain!",12
26,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,POLICY,Order! The Leader of the National Party!,12
27,Mr KEATING,POLICY,"We are not keeping the steadier monetary policy that those opposite wanted; we have relaxed it. Even the Business Council of Australia, as I pointed out in this House a couple of weeks ago, has been asking for interest rate relief. So an organisation which prides itself on being at the heart of the antiinflation constituency said, 'We're not in this any more. Once the pain starts to hit profitability and turnover, we're out'. That simply means that if one tries to employ a policy which relies on monetary policy alone, even though monetary policy has an important role to play in squeezing down price taking and the other inflationary influences, it will not work. The simple fact is that what the Governor is saying to those opposite, as a party, is that a sole reliance upon monetary policy as an anti-inflationary policy will not work. I would have thought that they would at least take some of that to heart. But the notion that monetary policy does not deal with the cyclical current account is a nonsense because the evidence is there for all to see. A year ago GNE was running at twice gross domestic product. Now it is running at less GDP with net exports. If the honourable member- cannot comprehend that simple fact, rewhy does he construct a question like this one?",12
28,Mr HOWARD,POLICY,Why don't you look at what is happening-,12
29,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,POLICY,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong has asked his question;,12
30,Mr HOWARD,POLICY,He has not answered my question.,12
31,Mr KEATING,POLICY,Ask another one. NA,12
32,Mr LES SCOTI,URUGUAY ROUND,My question is directed to the Minister for Trade Negotiations. Have Australia and the Cairns Group met the 15 October deadline for tabling proposals for agricultural reform to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Geneva? What are the major components of the cuts in agricultural support and protection proposed by the Group?,12
33,Dr BLEWETT,URUGUAY ROUND,"I am pleased to inform honourable members that last night, at the GATT talks in Geneva, Australia tabled the Cairns Group proposals for an agreement on agricultural reform in the Uruguay Round. The proposals set out an ambitious and far reaching agreement for reform to be implemented over 10 years from 1991-92 and include the following cuts in agricultural support and protection: trade distorting internal support measures to be reduced by no less than 75 per cent over that lO-year period; all non-tariff restrictions on imports to be converted to tariffs and to be cut by no less than 75 per cent over the same 10year period; and, because export subsidies are seen as the most trade .distorting of the measures, export subsidies to be. cut by no less than 90 per cent over that reform pteriod. The Cairns Group proposals, we believe, provide flexibility for the developing countries in introducing their reform commitments over a longer time period and at lower levels of support reductions. Canada was not a party to the tabling because it is submitting its own proposals on agriculture which, while pressing significant cuts in agricultural protection, be less trade liberalising in relation to internal support and border protection. As honourable members who have followed the GATT issues are aware, Canada has always retained an interest in maintaining. certain domestic support programs. Notwithstanding the fl'lct that Canada is putting in a separate proposal on agriculture, Canada will continue to be an acth:,e member of the Cairns Group and will continue to support the thrust for international trade liberalisation in agriculture",12
34,Mr LLOYD,URUGUAY ROUND,What about the position the United States of America?,13
35,Dr BLEWEIT,URUGUAY ROUND,"I will deal with that problem now. While there are some sigJapan nificant differences between the American and Cairns offers, the reductions being sought by the Cairns Group are in line with the cuts proposed by the United States, which also tabled its formal offer last night. On just four issues there is significant difference. Australia is asking for larger cuts across all of the internal supports-Mr Downer-Australia, or the Cairns Group?",13
36,Dr BLEWEIT,URUGUAY ROUND,"The Cairns Group is asking for larger cuts across all aspects of internal support. The Americans have made some distinction between different types of internal support. The Cairns Group has also asked for greater initial market access in relation to commodities which are at present completely excluded from markets. We begin with a larger initial access requirement. We also provide special provisions for developing countries, very much because of the nature of the Cairns Group itself. We also regard our safeguard proposals as tougher and contributing more to liberalisation and agricultural reform. But the reductions sought by the United States and by the Cairns Group establish the basis for a substantial outcome on agriculture in the Uruguay Round. We believe that the proposals are realistic and achievable and present a major challenge to the European Community, to Japan and to the Republic of Korea, whose proposals on agriculture will have to date fallen far short of what is necessary for effective agricultural reform. The Cairns Group proposals provide clear indication to some of the wealthiest countries in the world of the contribution that the lesser developed countries are prepared to make to the progress of agricultural reform. Having demonstrated their willingness to shoulder the burden of liberalising their own agricultural policies, developing countries in. the Cairns Group now look to the wealthy countries to undertake genuine reforms in their do mestic policies, reforms that they are far better placed to afford than many memof bers of the Cairns Group. It is essential that the pressure be maintained on the European Community, and the Republic of Korea if agreement on agriculture is to be reached by the December deadline for the Round. We recognise that the demands we are making on the European Community will require the European Community to make a significant structural reforms in its agricultural industries. Yet if the Uruguay Round is to succeed, all economies will have to make some structural reforms in some parts of their economies. As the wealthiest collectivity of nations in the world, we are simply asking the European Community to show a lead in the one area where it can make substantial reforms in international trade. The Cairns Group has already agreed that the Round-and I quote the Santiago communique-'cannot and will not conclude in whole, or in part, without a substantial outcome on agriculture'. I have now proposed to the other Cairns Group Ministers that we convene for a special meeting in Geneva on 5 and 6 November to determine how best to ensure a satisfactory result is achieved in the Round. RESERVE BANK: MONETARY",13
37,Mr HOWARD,URUGUAY ROUND,"I address another question to the Treasurer and I refer again to the speech made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia last night. Is it not a fact that on page 4 of that speech Mr Fraser points out that one of the consequences of high interest rates is to hold up the exchange rate? He then went on: In the shorter term, however, a higher exchange rate, by encouraging imports and discouraging exports, works against improvement in the current account deficit. Is that not a claim on his part that a higher exchange rate has a cyclical impact on the current account deficit, is ineffective in curbing it and, in having a cyclical impact, is the direct opposite of what the Treasurer said in his answer to the last question?",14
38,Mr KEATING,URUGUAY ROUND,"You do not understand the texture of any paragraph. What Mr Fraser is saying is that one of the consequences of a tight monetary policy could be, in part, to hold up the exchange rate. But then he goes on to say: . . . clearly . . . factors other than in.terest can sometimes be more potent. Notwlthstandmg the 4 percentage points reduction in cash rates between January and August, the $A actually rose . . . So he is saying yes, it is an influence, it may have that effect, but it does not invalidate the general effect of using monetary policy to reduce demand. He says in the first sentence-",14
39,Mr HOWARD,URUGUAY ROUND,He is referring to the current account deficit.,14
40,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,URUGUAY ROUND,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong has asked his question.,14
41,Mr KEATING,URUGUAY ROUND,"He asks: What effect does monetary policy have on the current account deficit? In his answer he says: It is clear that the earlier tightening of monetary policy, by slowing down domestic demand, has led to a sharp decline in imports. The volume of imports, in fact, is now about 10 per cent below its peak level. This largely reflects the cyclical slowdown in POLICY the economy. In other words, it does a number of things. It needed to be employed to reduce the cyclical current account deficit. Part of employing it means we lose some of our competitiveness because of its effect upon the exchange rate. Every economic change has various effects-lagged effects, other effects-but the balance of policy meant the gross national expenditure had to be' slowed. Mr Tim Fischer-Those behind you are looking very puzzled.",14
42,Mr KEATING,URUGUAY ROUND,"The honourable member for Farrer would be looking puzzled. That does not surprise me at all. How does the Opposition believe that Australia could have kept on growing at a pace where spending was outstripping product growth by two to one, and we were taking 4 to 5 percentage points of net imports? If it does not believe that monetary policy was the correct instrument to employ, what instrument does it believe in? That we ought to be simply lifting tax? Does it believe that? Producing an even' bigger surplus? Does it believe that? No-one said so. Those opposite have always talked ra.tes about tax cuts, not tax increases. Here we have this puerile discussion, trying to use a subordinate sentence to the principal one, where it says-",14
43,Dr HEWSON,URUGUAY ROUND,"Oh, come on!",14
44,Mr KEATING,URUGUAY ROUND,"What do you mean? The principal one is the first one: It is clear that the earlier tightening of monetary policy, by slowing down domestic demand, has led to a sharp decline in imports. Would the honourable member deny that?",14
45,Mr HOWARD,URUGUAY ROUND,But you are on the wrong paragraph.,15
46,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,URUGUAY ROUND,Order! The honourable member for. Bennelongl,15
47,Mr KEATING,URUGUAY ROUND,"Then he goes on to say that 'while monetary policy impinges on the exchange rate', it can have other effects. These are the words of someone who understands the subtleties of the total play of forces. The Opposition picks up one comment on one of those forces and then uses it as some sort of reason why it believes monetary policy is an ineffective instrument to use with fiscal policy and wages policy. A page earlier he says that if we do not use it with these other policies we cannot be effective. I mean, that leaves the Opposition with not a feather to fly with. Leaving what Bernie Fraser said to one side, have any members of the Opposition actually thought about the outcome in Britain? Margaret Thatcher, who has had three mandates to attack British trade unionism, is now sitting with a 11h per cent increase in productivity, a 10.9 per cent inflation rate, and competitiveness flyingout the back door. I suppose not one of those opposite has actually said to himself, 'Well, maybe we have got it wrong. Maybe the Thatcher mix of policiesis not working. Maybe the prescriptions we have to use monetary policy to rip the guts out of the economy and to break inflation will not work. Maybe with the Government's accords it actually has something. It has got inflation. decelerating while Thatcher has it accelerating'. I should have thought that even the slowest Opposition members might have started to think about that. NA",15
48,Mr BEVIS,NOBEL PEACE PRIZE,Can the Prime Minister inform the House whether the Government has yet responded to the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Soviet Union President Gorbachev?,15
49,Mr HAWKE,NOBEL PEACE PRIZE,"The Government was certainly very pleased to learn that President Gorbachev had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. I am sure that all honourable members would agree that it is an award which is very richly deserved. There is no doubt that Mr Gorbachev has been instrumental in bringing about the transformation of Soviet domestic and foreign policy since he took office in March of 1985. These historic changes, matched, let us note, by sensible and cohesive responses from the Western allies, have brought about the ending of the Cold War and have made possible the emergence of a new international order from which we will all benefit. The unification of Germany just two weeks ago and the spread of democracy through much of eastern Europe are reminders, and potent reminders, to us of just how momentous these changes have been. I have today sent President Gorbachev a message of congratulations on behalf of the Australian Government and the Australian people, and I am sure that all honourable members will support me in that. It is interesting to note that this Government took the view early in Mr Gorbachev's leadership that he was a leader with the potential to transform the relationship between the Soviet Union and the rest of the world, and that was certainly confirmed for me by the very lengthy talks I had with him at the end of 1987. It is a matter of interest, I would think, ,to note .that that cautious optimism which we expressed at that time was not shared by the Opposition. Indeed, I was accused by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, of 'starry-eyed idealism' in referring with cautious optimism to developments around Mr Gorbachev. Of course, as in just about every area of international affairs, we have been proven right in the assessment that we made. How much more realistic was our optimism than was the Opposition's reluctance to understand the direction and magnitude of the changes that were then under way in the world, very much as a result of Mr Gorbachev's initiatives. The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Mikhail Gorbachev marks not just the well deserved honour of a great prize to a great man but, very importantly, also the emergence of a new more optimistic world order which that man has done so very much to foster. He deserves our praise and our congratulations. It is an honour very richly deserved. NA",15
50,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the Gallery this afternoon a parliamentary delegation from the United Kingdom led by the Right Honourable Alfred Morris, M.P. I might mention to members that Alf Morris and the ANZAC group played a key part in getting back Australia's birth certificatethe Constitution Act-that Sir Geoffrey Howe recently presented to us. I am sure that honourable members will join with me in extending a very warm welcome to Alf Morris and the delegation from the United Kingdom. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA RESERVE BANK: MONETARY NA",16
51,Mr REITH,POLICY,"I refer the Treasurer to his speech to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia on 4 October referring to a report by the Reserve Bank of Australia and Treasury that: Their main conclusions were that bank interest margins have widened since the end of 1989 and that since the reductions in official began in Jan 1990, the banks have been tardy in reducing their administered rates. I also refer the Treasurer to the speech of the Governor of the Reserve Bank in Hobart last night where he said: Banks' margins now are not out of line with historical levels. I ask the Treasurer whether he agrees with the Governor of the Reserve Bank about margins and that, therefore, there is no need for a parliamentary committee of inquiry into this subject.",16
52,Mr KEATING,POLICY,"Mr Acting Speaker, you will not mind me observing that the first economic question to me comes as the third question from the Opposition, after the first and second ones were asked by the Leader of the Opposition and honourable member for Bennelong, who are shielding the shadow Treasurer during the parliamentary proceedings. Opposition members-Ha, hal",16
53,Mr KEATING,POLICY,"I am here to make these observations and to point out these facts. At least over here we can always smell a bit of political weakness when it is around, and we know that it is always around with the Opposition. There is nothing that the Governor said in his text about the banks which is at odds with the report that the Treasury put together with the Reserve Bank on margins. The fact was that margins were over. The Governor was saying that, in similar episodes when monetary policy has been weakened, margins have widened somewhat as banks have, in part, tried to recover some of the costs on the way up during the tightening of fiscal policy. My point was that, while there was some tardiness in bringing down the prime rates, people locked into the administrative. rate structure who do not have effective freedom to switch banks were not necessarily being fairly treated. The results of that study conclusively showed that those margins, if left where they were, would have covered all the losses that were basically posted by the four major banks in the rates, which current financial year. Those margins are coming down. We saw again yesterday a speedy transition to a lower level of rates in relation to the change in official rates. So there is nothing at odds with this. The Governor is again only trying to put some of these changes into perspective in a speech which is meant for people to read seriously with all the balances that are in it, and not to try to pick up and exaggerate a particular point or so. We live in hope. NA",16
54,Mr LINDSAY,MYANMAR,"My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Is Australia, in cooperation with other countries, endeavouring to persuade the Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration Council to transfer power to a democratic government in Myanmar? Is the Minister aware that staff members at some embassies, including the Australian Embassy; have been harassed by the military authorities in Myanmar? Dr BLEWETf-1 thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and for his continuing interest in the tragic situation in Myanmar. Given that we have had some pronunciation problems today, I should say we are referring to the country that was previously known as Burma. The Australian Government has consistently called for a transition to a democratic government in Myanmar, but the military authorities have made no move to transport power to representatives elected in the national elections on 27 May. Most recently, Senator Evans, when he was overseas, met the leader of the Myanmar delegation to the United Nations General Assembly and the Deputy Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw. Senator Evans took the opportunity to reaffirm the Government's strong support for democratic change and to express the hope that the military authorities would soon accede to the wishes of the people of Myanmar for representative government. In order to exert the maximum pressure possible on the regime in Myanmar, last month Australia joined a number of other countries, including the United States and Japan, in a demarche organised by the European Community. The demarche, involving 18 countries, took place on 21 September and expressed the hope that democracy would soon be restored in accordance with the wishes of the people as expressed in the May elections; expressed concern of the countries involved over the recent arrests of prominent members of the National League for Democracy, the party which won over 80 per cent of the seats in the recent elections; and raised recent detention and questioning of local employees in some embassies in Yangon as a very serious issue. On the other point raised by the honourable member for Herbert, a staff member from the Australian Embassy was detained for questioning on 8 September. He was a locally employed information officer and translator. Mr Tim Fischer-And a very good one, too. Dr BLEWETf-I am very glad to hear the accord for the translator concerned from the Leader of the National Party. It is clear that such harassment represents a serious violation of the accepted standards of international behaviour. The Australian Government has protested to the Myanmar Ministry for Foreign Affairs, noting that any interrogation concerning activity in which an employee was engaged relating to his employment within an embassy would represent a violation of article 38 of the Vienna Convention. The Government will continue to actively explore all possible means of putting pressure on the Myanmar regime for it to transfer power to a democratically elected government. MICRO-ECONOMIC REFORM",17
55,Mr SHARP,MYANMAR,"I refer the Treasurer to the speech given in Hobart last night by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia in which he said: In the absence of other policy measures, the likelihood is that when domestic spending settles at a more sustainable pace we will still be confronted with a substantial current account deficit. That is why further improvements in work and management practices in transport and other 'structural' areas are so urgent. In view of this advice from the Reserve Bank, does the Treasurer stand by his statement that reform of the waterfront and other micro-economic reforms are, and I quote him, 'small beer'?",17
56,Mr KEATING,MYANMAR,"What I have often said is they are slow burners. They are slow burners. That is, the major macro-economic influence in the economy must come with fiscal, monetary and wages policy. But to the extent to which we wish to improve the supply responsiveness of the economy, the micro-economy is obviously the important area we need to look at. But those reforms will not produce overnight results. They will cumulatively over time produce a better performance. That is self-evident because it is for that reason that the Government is now embarking on this ambitious program of change in telecommunications, transport, sea transport, the waterfront and other areas of the economy. However, that is not to say that we will quickly overcome the structural current account imbalance to which the Governor referred-that is, the structural nature of it. That will be overcome only when the economy can produce more goods and services. That will happen, in the main, when we have a growth in the capital stock back to its critical mass. That is the whole problem that Australia faces. For 20 years up to 1983 we had a diminishing capital stock because, as a government, honourable members opposite believed in commodities but not in adding value, and they stopped investment in this country in secondary industry and in tertiary industry to the point where we could not cover our imports with goods. Instead of buying imports with our own production, we bought them with someone else's savings. We are now trying to build that capital stock back through investment and through changes in the micro-economy as well as in the macro-economy.",17
57,Mr HOWARD,MYANMAR,That has nothing to do with it.,18
58,Mr KEATING,MYANMAR,"I do not know why honourable members opposite think they can find something in the Governor's speech for them, because even the most obvious quote in the third paragraph on the front page-and I overlooked it in relation to the question of the honourable member for Bennelong-states: It is obvious that monetary policy must play important counter-cyclical role. Well, there it is. So if the Opposition wants to quote the Governor to me, there is his quote back at it. The Opposition does not believe that monetary policy should have been employed to cut the cyclical demand out of the economy, but because we are about dealing with both the cyclical and structural current account deficits, we have employed the countercyclical instrument of monetary policy and fiscal policy along with the general policy to lift investment and to lift production. That is the only way that the current account deficit will be defeated. It is not going to be defeated by simple policies. The Governor of the Reserve Bank also makes a point which is worth reading to the House: Not so many months ago, there was considerable public advocacy of a monetary policy that was dedicated to eradicating inflation, notwithstanding the consequences of high interest rates for the economy. This emphasis on inflation has tended to evaporate as the economy has slowed, to be replaced by heightened advocacy of easier monetary conditions-providing another illustration, incidentally, of the difficulty of sustaining antiinflation sentiment in this country. Yet the Opposition perpetually tells the nation that it could deliver a zero inflation rate or something at the OECD by a steadier monetary policy. This was the message of the honourable member for Kooyong all the way through the last election campaign. Here is the Governor say-' ing that all this anti-inflationary sentiment has evaporated now to be replaced by heightened advocacy of easier monetary conditions. Well, of course, that is what happens. That is why a serious mind is addressing itself to more complex and serioussolutions and not slogans. ThatÂ· is why I have made the point to the Opposit ion about the unresponsiveness of the economy to a brutal assault by a savage monetary policy. NA",18
59,Mr HULLS,PEANUTS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Resources. Is the Minister aware of concerns of Australian peanut growers, particularly those on the Atherton Tablelands, that claims have rean cently been made about peanuts imported from China? I refer particularly to claims that organochlorin residues have been detected in samples. What is the Government's response to these claims?",18
60,Mr GRIFFITHS,PEANUTS,"The honourable member for Kennedy has, if I can put it this way, pursued me vigorously in relation to this issue, and obviously it is an important one in terms of his electorate. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has been sampling imported peanuts from all sources at the rate of about one in four conllignments since July 1990 to ensure that the residues to which the honourable member for Kennedy referred do not present a danger to Australian consumers. Since testing commenced, approximately 80 samples from all sources have been tested, including 14 samples from peanuts imported from China. Organochlorin residues were detected in nine of the 14 samples taken from the Chinese product. I wish to stress that the advice given by the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service is that the levels detected did not pose a risk to human health. I can assure the honourable member for Kennedy and the House that the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service will take appropriate action, including the rejection of shipments where residues of organochlorins or any other contaminants, such as heavy metals, are detected which would adversely affect consumer health. NA",18
61,Mr WEBSTER,WAGE INCREASES,"I refer the Treasurer to his statement on 11 March 1990, during the election campaign, that: . .. a returned Hawke Government will deliver real wage increases in each of the next three years. Does the Treasurer still stand by this promise?",19
62,Mr BEAZLEY,WAGE INCREASES,Where is he coming from?,19
63,Mr KEATING,WAGE INCREASES,My colleague asks which way you are coming from. You are arguing for wage-Mr Nehl-Where are we going?,19
64,Mr KEATING,WAGE INCREASES,"No, this is a better question. The Opposition is actually arguing for wage cuts, but the honourable member for Macquarie is telling us that we ought to have real wage increases. I will give the answer. We have had sHong increases in real disposable income in the last three years-including this year. But, of course, the Opposition has opposed every national wage increase in 71h years. As I made the point during the run-up to the last election, here are Opposition members crying crocodile tears about interest rate costs diminishing disposable income for home owners. yet they were going to the national wage case opposing every wage increase. I will tell honourable members what is going to happen in the next six months. We are going to see the September quarter wage adjustment; we are going to see $12 following that, plus a $7.50 tax cut which has a wage equivalent of about another $12; and we will see an increase in disposable income coming from declines in housing interest rates. That will mean that household disposable income will grow fairly strongly in the course of the next six to 12 months. We on this side of the House think that that is basically a good thing for the economy and for the public. But the Opposition does not think so, because it is always opposing such outcomes. Now I am asked a question about real wages and disposable income while the Opposition has always, as coalition parties, opposed such outcomes. Opposition members are like the gang that cannot shoot straight: they do not know which message they wish to put over. For the benefit of our colleagues from Britain who are in the gallery: I have said some things about the Thatcher Government, but at least it has a policy prescription. At least it has some structure. Opposition members inteljecting",19
65,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,WAGE INCREASES,Order! The House will come to order.,19
66,Mr KEATING,WAGE INCREASES,"At least the Tories in Britain have some intellectual rigour. But what passes for our bunyip aristocracy, this motley collection of second graders opposite, has no policy prescriptions with any rigour whatsoever. That is why the Government has won four elections and, on the Opposition's performance in this session-if that is any guide to the position of the Opposition-we are well on the way to a fifth. NA",19
67,Mrs JAKOBSEN,RADIOLOGY SERVICES,"I direct my question to the Minister for Community Services and Health. Because general practitioners (GPs) give a service to patients at the first point of contact, or mary care level, they provide a pivotal role in the Australian health care system. The service that they provide may involve X-ray procedures. In view of this, could the Minister please explain why proposed legislative changes seek to limit radiology services provided by GPs by imposing controls which will introduce an arm's length referral system for such services?",19
68,Mr HOWE,RADIOLOGY SERVICES,"I thank the honourable member for Cowan for her question. There has been some concern around the country and recently in the press in Western Australia. The Government does believe it is necessary to introduce this legislation which is aimed at curbing unethical behaviour which canÂ· result in patients receiving unnecessary radiology services, which can be both unsafe and costly. However, this legislation will not prevent, and is not intended to prevent, general practitioners from giving the X-ray services traditionally expected of them. These include chest and extremities, shoulder and abdominal X-rays. Of course, if GPs want to continue to give X-ray services other than traditional ones, they can do so-but those services will not attract medical benefits. Such services will attract benefits only when they are provided at the request of a practitioner who has no financial interest in their requesting or rendering. However, doctors working in rural and remote areas, and specialists whq provide necessary services in the course of practising their speciality, are to be exempted from the arm's length referral requirements. This legislation is designed specifically to curb unethical activity such as buying of radiologist provider nUJl1bers by certain medical entrepreneurs; this so-called buying of radiologist provider numbers is done through kickback arrangements. These arrangements, which enable GP entrepreneurs to claim specialist radiologist fees, may be initiated by the entrepreneur approaching a radiologist or vice versa. The Government proposes to introduce legislation in the next few weeks to restrict the payment of Medicare benefits for diagnostic imaging services, including priradiology services, to those which have been requested by a medical practitioner who has-I emphasise this-no financial link with the provider of those services. This decision was made following consultation with relevantÂ· professional groups, including the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists and the Australian Medical Association. I emphasise that the proposals are not aimed at denying access to the needed services but at discouraging the provision of imaging services by doctors with a direct financial interest in the ordering or performance of those services. They are based on the arrangements which currently apply to pathology services and, as I have suggested, are fully supported by the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists. In conclusion, it is regrettable that Government moves to curb unscrupulous members of the medical profession will also have some impact on responsible GPs. But, as in the pathology area, the Government believes it has an obligation to take all reasonable steps to prevent the manipulation of medical benefit arrangements. NA",20
69,Mr CHANEY,RA VENSHOE TIMBER COMPANY,"My question is to the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and I ask: Does the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, which negotiated the agreement, the Attorney-General's Department, which provided legal advice, the watchdog Department of Finance or any or all of the three relevant Ministers accept responsibility for the fact that the Government still cannot say what happened to more than $7m that it provided to the company owning the Ravenshoe timber mill in north Queensland as part of its compensation package to the timber industry? I ask: Exactly how much has been written off? Does the Government accept any responsibility for the $600,000 owed by the company to trade creditors, many of whom apparently supplied goods and services believing that it had Commonwealth backing?",20
70,Mrs KELLY,RA VENSHOE TIMBER COMPANY,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I will take him through the whole process because it has been a long process to get to this stage. The sawmill at Ravenshoe received financial assistance under the structural adjust. ment program ,implemented by the Government after the World Heritage listing of the wet tropics. As part of that, a 10-year $13m assistance package was negotiated between the Commonwealth and Plywood and Plastic Pty Ltd, which was the holding company that owned the sawmill. The agreement was negotiated by the Commonwealth after two independent studies of the financial viability of the retooled sawmilL As a result of financial difficulties in the holding company, a receiver-manager was appointed for the company on 20 April 1990.' The financial difficulties, I have been told, were caused by cash flow problems elsewhere in the holding company and were not due to the World Heritage listing. That view has been put to me by the receiver. The Government had placed - pproximately $7.5m in loans and subsidies into the mill at the time of the holding company going into receivership. This was in the form of $3m in subsidies and $4.5m in loans; of that, $300,000 has been repaid. The receiver, in his meeting with me on 19 June 1990-which was a meeting that I requested-advised that the Associated Plywoods Sales sawmill was continuing operations for the foreseeable future and that the business had been advertised for sale as a going concern. However, in late June 1990 I decided to terminate the existing agreement because the company had failed to meet its obligation and had passed into receivership. On 4 july 1990, my colleague the Acting Minister wrote toÂ· the receiver terminating the agreement and exercising the Commonwealth's option to have the sawmill immediately repay the outstanding moneys-that is, $4.2m. Also, because of the early termination, the Commonwealth did not make a $1.06m subsidy payment in July. I had also decided that the best way to help the Ravenshoe community was in fact to assist the mill to stay open, subject to certain conditions being met. Obviously there are difficulties in the Commonwealth's stepping into pay the debts that had been caused by the company that had gone into receivership. So the decision that I took in close communication with the local member was to do whatever we could to keep that mill open . On 8 October 1990 I made a formal offer to the receiver-manager offering temporary assistance, aimed solely at keeping the mill operational for up to six months to enable a .final attempt to be made to sell the sawmill as a going concern. I am nQw awaiting advice from the receivermanager, on whether this advice will be accepted. I have also asked the Attorney General to investigate whether the Commonwealth can take legal action with respect to the moneys not account-d for in the original agreement. NA MrOKEEFE-Concerning the process of consultation with local government, I refer the Minister for Local Government to the successful round of senior level consultations that the Commonwealth held with local government representatives last year. In the light of this, I ask the Minister: Is it planned to continue this process, and what is the purpose and significance of such consultations?",21
71,Ms FATIN,LOCAL GOVERNMENT,"Mr Acting Speaker, the Government is intending to hold high level consultations again this year with local government representatives. This is the second annual high level consultation and it will take place in Canberra this week-tomorrow and the next day. The Prime Minister will open the consultations here at Parliament House, and then there wjll be consultations with eight other senior Ministers. Local government will be represented by the Australian Local Government Association, by key unions and professional bodies. As I said, eight other Ministers will be consulting with them and Ministers such as. the Minister for Community Services and Health will be discussing a range of social justice matters, including urban development and housing costs.Â· It is estimated that,' for instance, in the housing construction sector-which has an. annual turnover of $45 billion-there are potential savings of well over $1 billion a year through changes to the local building approval process. Equally, local government is also an essential element in effectively providing community services, and coordination between local, State and Commonwealth service delivery is a very important part of the Government's social justice agenda. Similarly, my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories will be talking with local government about environment protection. I was reading only yesterday that Australia produced 12 million tonnes of waste last year, and of course local government plays a key role in the collection and disposal of waste. It is very important indeed that it involve itself in waste minimisation and recycling strategies. Of course, that is of great interest to us. cal government representatives will be meeting also with the Minister for Industrial Relations. I remind honourable members that local government employs 150,000 people, or 2.2 per cent of the Australian work force. It is a very large industry indeed. I mention these facts because many people overlook the importance of local government, both in our federal system and as a contributor to the national economy. May I also mention that by establishing these high level consultations on an annual basis we are demonstrating our very real commitment to raising and strengthening the status of local government as a part of the Australian federal system. This commitment is further demonstrated by the Prime Minister's initiative to involve local govern.ment in the special Premiers Conference which will be held in Brisbane later this month. This is the first timeÂ· that local government will have participated fully in such a conference. It is particularly appropriate that it does so this year when the achievement of better inter-governmental relations is on the agenda. The role of local government has sometimes in the past been overlooked and downgraded. This Government, however, has not been guilty of that, nor does it intend to be in the future. NA",21
72,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,BOGONG MOTHS,"For the information of honourable members, I have recei ved questions from members concerning bogong moths. I advise that the Joint House Department has undertaken the following action in an effort to control the presence of bogong moths in the building and to reduce the attraction of the building itself to moths: Firstly, pelmet lighting in offices in both the Senate and the House of Representatives will be turned off as from this evening. Secondly, two of the four flagpole lights have been turned off. Thirdly, attendants have been asked to turn off all unnecessary office and suite lighting. Fourthly, a great number of external lights have been turned off, including ramp lights, lighting around Lo- the tennis courts, and in the formal gardens. Courtyard lighting will also be reduced. The engineering services section has discussed with the Australian Capital Territory authorities, road safety authorities and the Parliament House security controller the feasibility of turning off all or some of the street lights located on Parliament Drive. A fine mesh has been installed over external air intake and exhaust vents, and windows have been sealed to deny moths entry. Finally, an information circular is being issued today requesting occupants of the building to turn off lights in their offices and suites as they leave and not to leave doors to courtyard areas open during the day and evening as this has been a major avenue for entry for the bogong moths. Housekeeping and cleaning staff maintain a continual program of cleaning out rooms, suites, corridors, et cetera, which have been infested with the moths. I assure the House that every action is being taken to contain bogong moth infestations. .",22
73,Mr SCHOLES,BOGONG MOTHS,"Will you, Mr Acting Speaker, ask the Australian Capital Territory authorities to investigate a suggestion made by the former Minister for Science that a searchlight be placed on a hill at the back of Canberra to attract the moths away from the lit up areas?

83,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,The honourable member may proceed.,24
84,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATION,"The misrepresentation appeared in today's issue of the Australian Financial Review in an article written on the basis of a speech I made yesterday during consideration of the Estimates. The heading of the article reads, 'Opposition backs ACTU pay campaign'. That is wrong. It is self-evident that we do not back the collective bargaining strategy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The first paragraph of the article reads: The Federal Opposition has backed the collective bargaining strategy of the ACTU wage campaign and urged employers to negotiate with the unions. That, in substance, is wrong. What I have argued persistently is that we are against the collective bargaining industry wide approach of the ACTU. I did say in my speech yesterday that individual employers should seek to negotiate on an enterprise by enterprise basis with individual groups of employees. That is a world away from collective bargaining. There is an enormous difference between enterprise bargaining and collective bargaining. To that extent the article is wrong and misrepresents what I said. The rest of the article accurately reflects, with perhaps one or two exaggerations which I will not dwell on, what I said. I want to make it abundantly clear that we remain opposed to collective bargaining, which was the 1981 experience, but very strongly in favour of enterprise bargaining, which is the wave of the future.

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places-- '",24
86,Dr HEWSON,ECONOMIC POLICY,"I am pleased to see that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has decided this time to stay in the House for this debate. It is a pity that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is not here to take part in the debate. Over the last two or three years there have been dozens and dozens of comments, assessments and analyses of the deterioration in the Australian economic performance-by people in Australia, by people and institutions offshore, by people inside and outside government, inside and outside the Public Service and, of course, inside and outside the Australian Labor Party and, indeed, the Cabinet. On everyone of those occasions the Treasurer has come into this place, gone to some press conference or made some statement designed to divert attention from the substance of those remarks. He will do anyone of a number of things in order to distract attention from the real substance of the criticism that has been levelled at him. Generally, of course, he simply denies that those statements are correct. Everything is all right, of course. It is always in the groove; it is always working according to plan and it is always on track. On other occasions, though, he has done deals to hide the situation. When housing interest rates got too tough he did a deal with the four big banks to hold down housing interest rates artificially in order to paint a better picture than was in prospect in the market at that time. On other occasions he has changed definitions to suit his particular case when he has been cornered-for example, the definition of a recession. He fails even on that definition these days; the economy has moved significantly into recession as asset prices and employment have colpaint lapsed. On other occasions he has fudged. He fudged the consumer price index, for exan ample, when he deliberately cut excise beer simply to artificially lower the inflameasures, tion rate; or when he changed the method for measuring mortgage interest rates the treatment of housing costs in the CPI. that role. Mysteriously, the method chosen by the Australian Statistician was the one that gave the lowest overall outcome. On other occasions he has attacked individuals dared to disagree with him. Nobby Clark would stand at the top of the heap of those he has attacked on that basis. other .occasions he has simply bashed groups. Just in the last few weeks he has bashed the banks, the Business Council Australia and the oil companies. The last refuge of the scoundrel is that he makes lies before it. outlandish and indefensible statementsone of which he backed off today, in lation to the commitment he made in the election campaign about maintaining real wages. All of these are designed to divert attencannot tion from the true situation. Rather than face reality, he ducks and weaves and twists and turns, as we saw him do in this House at Question Time today. The probpressure lem is that our economic circumstances have continued to deteriorate. If the Treasurer was as successful as he claims he has been, if his macro policy was so sl,lccessful in a counter-cyclical sense, he claimed today, or if his micro reform agenda had really worked, why do we still have 8 per cent inflation and near record levels of balance of payments deficits debt? Last night perhaps the most substantive of all these criticisms was levelled at Government by the Treasurer's own apTreasurer pointee, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, in a speech in Hobart. It very important that we focus on that speech because it is very much a wawill tershed speech as far as the role of Reserve Bank - s concerned. Back a couple of days before the 2 October Reserve Bank Board meeting, I called on the Governor and the Board of the Reserve Bank to exercise their statutory independence and a picture for this Treasurer as to what needed to be done in order to sustain falls in interest rates. I felt there was urgent need to get interest rates down on but only on the basis of a package of including the renegotiation of accord mark 6 and accelerated micro reor form. I called on the Governor to play In large measure last night's speech pretty well does what we asked the Bank to do. The Governor fell short of activatwho ing the procedures under section II of the Reserve Bank Act but he went a long way towards putting down in very clearOn cut clinical terms precisely what this . Treasurer has done wrong in economic management in recent years and trying to of instil a sense of urgency in this Government about the magnitude of the task that I want to put formally on the record a refew of the comments made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank last night as demonstrating that fact. The first overriding point the Governor makes is that you simply rely on high interest rate policy and monetary policy to control the balance of payments and inflation in Australia. If you want to sustain downward on inflation and genuinely deal with our balance of payments and debt problems, you have to shift away from reliance on high interest rates. Most importantly, he identifies the role of wages as policy; he also mentions fiscal policy and draws a lot of attention to the need for an effective program of micro reform. The Governor of the Reserve Bank foand cused his approach on the two objectives of inflation and the balance of payments. On each of these he takes apart the sole the reliance on high interest rates that this has embraced as a deliberate policy to drive this economy into recesis sion in the desperate hope that maybe things will turn around, maybe something pop up overseas to save uS,or what the ever. We have seen today the nature of his response: another facile ducking and weaving, an att-mpt to say that the speech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank was directed to us and our policies as if it were not directed to the Treasurer and his policies. Does the Treasurer really believe that the Governor of the Reserve Bank would devote a major speech to a group of people that the Treasurer reckons are dunderheads and dummies? The Governor of the Reserve Bank directed his criticism at the Treasurer. It stung, and he came in here today trying to divert attention from that fact. On the issue of inflation, the Governor of the Reserve Bank emphasises that lowering inflation is a medium term task and that monetary policy has to be pursued with the long haul in mind. In practical terms, he says that this means interest rates will have to remain higher than they would if the only concern was to avoid too severe a contraction in spending. The words 'too severe a contraction in spending' are very important because the emphasis of that paragraph, as he goes on to demonstrate, isÂ· that perhaps there has been too severe a contraction in spending for the sake of the gain that has been achieved in relation to inflation. The Governor admits, of course, that there has been some marginal improvement in our inflation rate in recent months as a result of the fact that the Government has deliberately pushed the economy into recession, but at a phenomenal price in terms of the collapse of economic activity. He goes on to express an even greater concern: that now when the politieal tolerance levels of those high interest rates have been reached, evidence is mounting that inflation is about to increase. It is about to increase because of the oil price rise as a result of the Middle East crisis, and he puts that in effect at about 1112 percentage points compared to the Government's forecast if the oil priee settles at around $US40 per barrel. Of course, there is the flow-through effect of the devaluation of our exchange rate by about 6 112 per cent since last August. He emphasises the essential role in relation to that inflation outcome that wages policy will now have to play. Given that he has been easing monetary policy, in his terms, in the course of the last several months, the urgency with respect to wages policy is greater than it has been. As he says, very importantly in relation to the oil price, for example, we cannot do much about the direct effects but we have to work to quarantine the secondary effects of that oil price rise, and the containment of those secondary effects will depend very importantly, as he says, on wages and fiscal policies as much as it is a continuing task for monetary policy. So he draws particular attention to the need, as a matter of urgency, to change the nature of the Government's wages policy in current circumstances. He draws a very clear point about how much inflation has been locked in in our system. The pipeline effect, he says, puts a substantial floor under the inflation rate for the next 12 or 18 months, on top of which we will have the effect of those oil priee increases and we will have the effect of those devaluation-induced price changes. In those circumstances, given that the economy is already in a fairly deep recession, there is an even greater urgency to move in relation to wages policy. In terms of the objective of the balance of payments, similarly the Governor makes very telling points about the dangers of relying on high interest rates as a way of trying to deal with the balance of payments problem. Earlier today the Treasurer got up in the House and tried to obfuscate this issue by drawing distinctions between cyclieal and structural changes in the balance of payments, trying to deny that there is' any impact on the exchange rate of high interest rates. The relevant paragraph, as read out by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), clearly shot the Treasurer straight between the eyes in 'terms of the magnitude of the adverse short term effect of high interest rates on the exchange rate. The exchange rate has been significantly appreciated as a response to high interest rates. That appreciation has discouraged exports and encouraged imports at a time when the Treasurer was arguing that the thrust of his policies was to bring the balance of payments under control. One does not have to be a university student or a university professor or anyone else to know that if the Government pursues a high interest rate policy for two to three years in the name of bringing the balance of payments under control and the balance of payments keeps getting worse, it ought at least to dawn on the Government that perhaps it has got something wrong. That was very clearly stated in somewhat different terms by the Governor in the course of his remarks last night. So he emphasises a particular urgency to shift policy at the present time. We have identified, as I said in a press release a couple of weeks ago, the key areas of change that are required in current circumstances in order to turn our situation around: redoing the Budget; using the Premiers Conference in a way to agree on a realistic agenda for micro-reform over the next two to three years; addressing some of the basic problems in relation to waterfront reform-coastal shipping reform at that conference and more generally; and, importantly, looking at the nature of the wage determination process in Australia, on which I should like to make a couple of rem""arks. The key point I would put to the Treasurer, in sympathy with the argument that was put by the Governor last night, is that the accord process has failed. It has failed in three respects. Firstly, it has failed in terms of its inability to give competitive wage outcomes. Secondly, it has failed from the point of view of the workers in whose interests that accord is supposedly being pursued. Thirdly, it has failed as a policy implementation process by having elevated Bill Kelty to de facto Cabinet status, thereby blocking just about every significant reform that has been debated in this country in recent years. On the first one, uncompetitive wage outcomes, we can take the point the Governor made that wage increases in recent years in nominal terms have been lower than some people have expected. I have always conceded that. But the Treasurer forgot to mention productivity and the fact that the accord has destroyed productivity in this country so that unit labour costs have gone ahead roughly twice as fast as those of our trading partners over the last seven years. Because those unit labour costs have gone ahead roughly twice as fast as those of our trading partners over the last seven years, so our inflation rate has been roughly double that of our trading partners over the last seven years, and our interest rates have been somewhat more than double those of our trading partners over the last seven years. Those facts are there for all to see. The accord has failed to produce competitive wage outcomes. Secondly, from the point of view of the workers in whose interests the Government claims to operate, there is a growing chasm between their belief in the system and the outcomes that the Government is producing. For five consecutive years now, the Government has reduced real wages to the average worker in Australia. Sure, the Treasurer will stand up and talk about real disposable household income, or whatever else which is dominated by capital gains, or some other increase in social security and welfare payments that distort that measure, but he should look at it from the point of view of the people who are the subject of concern. The real wages of the workers of Australia have been cut, and cut consistently for five years. The Treasurer would not recommit himself to that glamorous election time promise today that the Government would increase real wages in each of the next three years for the average workers in Australia. That is the second reason why the accord has failed. The third reason is that, as I said, Bill Kelty has been elevated to de facto Cabinet status. So every time that we look at an issue such as telecommunications reform, coastal shipping reform, waterfront reform or privatisation Bill Kelty says, 'No, no, no, no'. Nothing gets done and, in those circumstances, our problems grow. So last night's speech by the Governor was out of a sense of genuine and deep seated concern. As the Treasurer said, he did not talk to him about it. I remember the Treasurer boasting that the Governor never did anything that the Treasurer did not authorise and approve, but on this occasion he did not talk to the Treasurer. He gave him a huge serve in terms of the extent to which the Treasurer has missed the mark in his economic management. So I ask the Treasurer to use the 15 minutes that he has in the matter of public importance debate today to make a major economic statement; to put down in very accurate terms where this economy is and where it is going in the course of the next few years; and to undertaketo publicly commit-to shIft policy in the direction that the Governor called for last night: a significant shift in wages policy, a renegotiation of accord mark 6 and, of course, an accelerated program of microreform. The Australian people are screaming out under the pain of the Treasurer's misguided and ill conceived total devotion to high interest rate policy.",24
87,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICY,"After that withering attack, I shall do my best to reply. The first point is that all this feigned indignation and huffing and puffing by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is-",28
88,Mr TUCKEY,ECONOMIC POLICY,Just give us the facts.,28
89,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICY,"The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence, so Opposition members should just do me the same courtesy. The Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia is the same person who the Leader of the Opposition referred to in his press statement of 30 March 1989, in which he mentioned: . . . the Treasurer's reported inclination point one of his political mates as BOb Johnston's replacement . . .. He also said, 'He 'remains a captive of his politicised Department when Mr Fraser was the Secretary'. The same person whom he disparaged as being a political toady of mine he is now lauding today. So much for the Leader of the Opposition's genuineness on that basic point. The Leader of the Opposition tries to suggest that Mr Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, says that we cannot just rely on monetary pol'icy when Mr Fraser argues that there should' also be support from an accord process fora further downward reduction in nominal wages in lieu of tax. In other words, he is arguing to loosen fiscal policy to have the effect of reducing inflation. The Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'Tighten fiscal policy. You cannot just rely on monetary policy'. He is saying, as he always says to me, 'you should tighten fiscal policy further'; whereas the Governor is saying that we should loosen fiscal policy. What else can a large tax cut mean other than to diminish the surplus and loosen fiscal policy? The Leader of the Opposition tries to turn the words around and suggest that when the Governor says, 'Y ou cannot rely on monetary policy', he means what the Leader of the Opposition means. He does not; he means the opposite to what the Leader of the Opposition means. The Governor does not mean tighter fiscal policy; he means looser fiscal policy. That is the first point. In Question Time today the Opposition got up to use this speech"" to abuse it, and to misquote it. The shadow Trea'surer even went so far as to, quote after a comma in relation to bank profitability. 'Yhen in the text Mr Fraser talks about bank spreads and margins. The 'shadow Treasurer actually quoted after the comma, when Mr Fraser says : earlier that the banks have reduced interest rates and now, therefore, he did not think margins were out Of line. The shadow Treasurer quotes about bank margins being not out of line but does not quote the first part of the sentence-about to ap- why Mr Fraser now believes they are not out of line. That is how shabbily the Opposition performed during Question Time today. The shadow Treasurer abused Mr Fraser's sentence by quoting half of it. Mr Reith-But the question concerned there being no basis to set up a parliamentary iriqu,iry. .",28
90,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICY,Let me find the quote and make dead plain what the shadow Treasurer has done. Â· Mr Reith-Good! You can look forward to my response.,28
91,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICY,I will find the quote; it is here somewhere. Just bear with me a moment. Mr MCGauran-You are pretty disorganised.,28
92,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICY,"No; this is important. This is the sentence: With the further reductions in lending rates in recent weeks, banks' margins now are not out of line with historical levels. The shadow Treasurer quoted me as saying, 'Bank margins now are not out of line with historical levels.' He used that quote to say that there was no basis for me saying what I said about banks and setting up a parliamentary committee, where Mr Fraser uses that quote after he says: With the further reductions in lending rates in recent weeks, banks' margins now are not out of line . . . That is how utterly dishonest the Opposition is. The former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), is now orchestrating events on the other side of the House. He is now asking questions in place of the shadow Treasurer. He is now directing questions to the Leader of the Opposition-writing them and directing them. This is a role reversal. The honourable member for Bennelorig is now in this awful position of having superior political skills and being up here with somebodyhis former staffer-who does not like the game, is clumsy with it, is difficult in the House and has to be programmed by the former Leader of the Opposition. What is the honourable member for Bennelong trying to suggest to me? He says that Mr Fraser is saying that monetary policy should not be used to deal with a cyclical current account deficit.",28
93,Mr HOWARD,ECONOMIC POLICY,"No, I didn't say that.",29
94,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICY,"That was the burden of your question. Do not be so damned dishonest! This is the first quote, the second sentence of Mr Fraser's speech: For their part, however, the monetary authorities have stuck consistently to a strategy of seeking both to counter excessive swings in domestic activity and to wind back inflationary pressures. The second quote states: It is obvious that monetary policy must play an important counter-cyclical role. The third quote: It is clear that the earlier tightening of monetary policy, by slowing down domestic demand, has led to a sharp decline in imports. The volume of imports, in fact, is now about 10 per cent below its peak level. The fourth quote: This largely reflects the cyclical slowdown in the economy. In the absence of other policy measures, the likelihood is that when domestic spending settles at a more sustainable pace we will still be confronted with a substantial current account deficit. In other words, Mr Fraser is saying that monetary policy is being used entirely sensibly to reduce the cyclical features of the economy to wind back, as he puts it in the second sentence, excessive swings in activity in the economy. He says in the second sentence: . .. to counter excessive swings in domestic activity . . . In other words, this speech is entirely in line with Government policy in that respect. In respect of using the accord, Mr Fraser suggests that one cannot simply reduce inflation without reducing nominal wages in the foreseeable trajectory of wages. That is what he is arguing. The Opposition totally eschews an accord solution. It has no mechanism for doing a wage-tax trade-off. It had one offered to it in 1982 and it laughed the Australian Council of Trade Unions out of the room as wages zoomed to 15 per cent and inflation to 11 per cent. The honourable member for Bennelong and the Secretary to the Treasury laughed the ACTU out of the place when it offered them the trade-off, and they watched the place burn up under double digit inflation. The apposition has no such mechanism now. It thinks it is going to put out some press statement or go to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, whi<;h it does not believe in, to deal with wages. When Mr Fraser says this, he says it to the Opposition: Wage increases, of course, contribute to pricc increases, although during most of the 1980s average earnings have actually increased more slowly than the CPI. Many people, perhaps blinkered by their experiences of a very different relationship . in earlier periods, have great difficulty acknowledging this change. The shadow Treasurer showed this 'great difficulty' today when he said that the accord had been basically a disaster. That is, we avoid a 15 per cent nominal wage outcome in 1989,90 and end up with 6.5 per cent instead-which gives us a decelerating inflation against, in the same circumstances, accelerating inflation in Britain, where it is back to double digits because it has no such accord-and the Opposition is still in there suggesting that the remarks are not meant for it. Of course, they are meant for the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition continues to traffic in this stupid claim that the Government has a one-dimensional policy relying on high interest rates. It has the only surplus in the nation's history, equivalent to nearly 2 per cent of gross domestic product-a surplus of $8 billion after a $6 billion tax cut-and a wage policy which has seen a 10.5 per cent reduction in unit labour costs. But the Leader of the Opposition still persists in saying that it is a one dimensional policy when outlays are back at 1973 levels, heading for 1950 levels. The ultimate piece of stupidity in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was when he said that when referring to the balance of payments, I obfuscated by talking about the cyclical and structural current account. This is supposedly a professor of economics suggesting that when the Treasurer of this country refers to the cyclical and structural components of the current account, he is obfuscating. What a joke!",29
95,Dr HEWSON,ECONOMIC POLICY,It would be all right if you understood it.,30
96,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICY,"Oh, all right if you understood it! As if anyone would not; a child would almost understand what a cyclical and structural current account was. 'Cyclical' and 'structural'-what does the Leader of the Opposition think those words mean? But no, to use them is obfuscation, according to the Leader of the Opposition. The university professor of a couple of years ago is now the political simpleton who does not understand the difference between cyclical and structural, and how dare the Government dare mention the fact that there are components within the current account! That is obfuscation. This is where the Leader of the Opposition is. If he does not know the difference between a cyclical and a structural current account, where did he get that chair-from a lucky dip? Then the Leader of the Opposition said that the accord process had failed. I can only refer him to Mr Fraser's speech. He then said that the accord had destroyed productivity. He does not seem to understand the simple point that this economy has had 21h times the employment growth of every other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economy. If one measures labour productivity, one will find modest levels of such productivity because of the huge growth in employment because some sections of the economy are very labour intensivefor example, travel and tourism-and we have been replacing machines with labour as the relative cost of labour has declined. We have used the capital stock more effectively-we must have because we have had 4 per cent economic growth each ,year for seven years on average against the Opposition's 2 per cent from the same capital stock when it was in government. If we were not using the capital stock more intensively with labour, what were we doing? If we are using it with labour, the measures of labour productivity decline. But what point does that makethat we should not have the employment? But if we look at factor productivity, we see that we are up there with the OECD. That is another hollow, empty claim made by the Leader of the Opposition. He then said that we had cut real wages over five years, yet in the same sentence-in the same breath-he said that the accord did not work. He then went on to say that we failed to control inflation. If inflation were determined by the wage outcomes delivered by this Government, it would be 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent. If wages were the sole determinant of inflation, it would be 4.5 per C-:i![Mr Reith-Someone else.",30
97,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICY,"Someone else, yes. The people who took profits in the boom, the price takers, added that extra 2 percentage points to inflation. The Opposition does not seem to understand that. The Leader of the Opposition then said that Bill Kelty stands in the way of everything. But he has led his trade union movement to the most responsible wages policy in the nation's history. He is probably the most powerful trade union leader because he is the most responsible. I would not deny for a moment that he has been the most powerful trade union leader that we have seen in a very long time. He has been powerful because, basically, he has moved the trade union movement to this policy. But he has stood in support of the sale of Australian Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd. The Opposition could never do these things. How come the great lions of the free market opposite have had Australian Airlines and Qantas all these years? They left Telecom Australia without a competitor, they did nothing on the waterfront and then they trot these things up to us as though they matter. We saw from the Leader of the Opposition today another performance from a shallow, brittle member of parliament, who has to be directed by his former employer, the former Leader of the Opposition, about some political skilling in the House; both of them overshadowing the shadow Treasurer. He has had a dream run from the media. But they must start to notice. Mr Reith-You are sensitive.",30
98,Mr KEATING,ECONOMIC POLICY,"I am a long-hauler. I bring them onto the stage and then push them off. That is my game. That is the game I am in. We will be in it with the Leader of the Opposition. Here is a speech which he thinks is critical of the Government. What is in this speech is Mr Fraser's view that there should be an immediate wage-tax trade-off. That is the speech as written. That is not my view; it is not the Treasury's view. I do not think it is a majority view within the Reserve Bank of Australia. But he is entitled to put it. But the Leader of the Opposition then got up in here as though the speech endorses the Opposition's hopeless structure when, in fact, it rejects implicitly everything that stands for. That seems to have escaped him. If I were him I would have read this speech last night and said, 'I think this one can go to the keeper because there is more criticism of us in here than there is of them'. But no, being basically political dunces, up they are, with all the questions today to try to score a hit on us. In the end, the only one who could construct a sentence was the honourable member for Bennelong and he asked the wrong question by trying to suggest that monetary policy cannot deal with demand. He said that the speech meant that it should not have been used to deal with demand and the current account deficit. His question related to that. Whereas, in fact, from the second sentence of his speech onwards, Mr Fraser has made it quite clear that this is the proper use of monetary policy, in balance with a tight fiscal policy. In other words, as usual, the Opposition is left without a feather to fly with. Let me pose a question to honourable members opposite. They believe that they can squeeze inflation out of the economy by keeping a steadier monetary policy. Do they now think that with inflation at around 7 per cent they can get it to 4 per cent? What level of activity do they think the economy should have? Perhaps the shadow Treasurer will tell us when he stands up.",31
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ECONOMIC POLICY,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,31
100,Mr REITH,ECONOMIC POLICY,"1 will answer that question at the start of my remarks because it just shows the inadequacy of the understanding of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) of these fundamental issues. He says that it is Opposition policy to rely solely on monetary policy to deal with the problem of inflation. That exposes his failure to grasp the basic issues. The fact is that if the Treas or so ago and if he read Mr Fraser's speech of last night more carefully, he would see a simple message for him: that he can no longer rely solely upon moneit tary policy to deal with inflation and that, as an anti-inflation strategy, it fails to acquire community support to bring about the result that he would desire. I think we have had further evidence today, both at Question Time and in the Treasurer's response to this matter of public importance, of what a thunderbolt it was that struck the practising Prime Minister, the heir apparent, Mr Keating, when Mr Fraser delivered his remarks last night. He is still stunned by those remarks. What nonsense it is for him to say, 'Between Mr Fraser and I there is a unanimity of view'. In fact, there is not. The evidence of that comes from the Treasurer's own words this morning to Alan Jones on radio 2UE. When he was asked the simple question as to whether he supports the line taken by Mr Fraser. last night, the Treasurer said: No. Well, it is not my line, it is actually own line. Mr Jones said, 'Do you support it?' and the Treasurer replied: No, I do not support it. No, I do not support it. He emphasised it again. So, far from this closeness of view as to the manner in which economic policy should be conducted, there is a growing divide-and that is one of the critical aspects of the speech by Mr Fraser last night. For sure, they have been very close for a long time; but there is a growing divide between Mr Fraser and the Treasurer. I suppose that was rammed home to me as I flicked through the speech of Mr Fraser last night when I came to his concluding remarks about the banks. The evidence of the sensitivity of the Treasurer about the banks and Mr Fraser's comments came again in the matter of public importance when he attacked me over the quote that I used in a question to him about bank margins. The fact is that, in this whole issue about the Government's attitudes to the banks, we have seen a typical bank bashing exercise. Whenever the Treasurer is in trouble, he wants to blame somebody else. The other day he blamed the Melbourne Age, would you believe, for the economic problems in Victoria. A couple of months ago he blamed the No. 3 senior economic Minister in the Government, Senator Button. The Treasurer went out to a doorstop and had the audacity to say that he was some sort of martyr because every month he had to defend bad current account figures which were the result of the failures of Senator Button in industry policy. Of course, what is the exercise of bank bashing? It is nothing but a distraction from the Government's own considerable failures in economic policy. The person responsible for high interest rates in this country is none other than the Treasurer. Of course, Jack Lang, his mentor, was fond of bashing banks, as have been so many Labor administrations over the years. I must say, as an aside, what a veryÂ· Bernie's unsuccessful political exercise this has been for the Treasurer. There he was, practising Prime Minister, and he went over the top with Nobby Clark. Then he got clean-bowled on a question about the role of the Commonwealth Bank in interest rates. And now we find Fraser's revenge delivered last night in Hobart. Of course, Mr Fraser was very unhappy about the way in which the Treasurer conducted his initial remarks in respect of the banks. A report was called for from the Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Treasurer then failed to table that report, quoted from it selectively and has now moved on to a parliamentary inquiry. The truth is very simple: if Mr Keating really wanted a proper evaluation of the role of banks in the Australian economy in the last few years, he would have gone not for the mickey mouse parliamentary inquiry but fora full blown Campbelltype inquiry which really would have examined the issue in some proper depth. If he is open to further criticism, in his speech announcing the parliamentary inquiry he made contradictory statements. He said that he was concerned about margins and then went on to say that in his view competition was intense in the banking industry. Of course, that gives the lie to the simple fact that the person responsible for the structure of the banking industry is none other than the Treasurer. What did Mr Fraser say? He really blew the Treasurer away. He referred to community expectations when he said: What, then, does the community expect of the banks? I invite honourable members to interpose the name of the Treasurer in that sentence because then it reads, 'What, then, does the Treasurer expect of the banks?'. Mr Fraser went on to say that the banks would be expected to: - reflect reductions in cash rates promptly in their lending rates, and not take the opportunity to improve their interest margins (while not necessarily being so punctilious in the reverse direction);That is a kick for the Treasurer. On the subject of what else the community or Mr Keating expected of the banks, he said: - ensure that credit is available to customers which, in the aggregate, is neither excessive niggardly (particularly with hindsight);That is another kick for the"" Treasurer, and a nice reflection on the Treasurer. He then went on to say, regarding community expectations, and again this is, in my view, a reflection on the Treasurer: If these expectations appear somewhat schizoid, That is a fair comment again on the Treasurer's bank bashing exercise. He said, again in respect of bad loans and the Treasurer's claim that the banks have been charging more than they should, simply to cover their troublesome loans: At the same time, I have seen enough of the volume and spread of troublesome loans to appreciate that the problem is deeper than jllst bad lending; other factors are also making a contribution, including the economic downturn. What does he mean by that? The contribution, of course, is the high interest rate policy and the economic failures of the Treasurer. On this whole question of the banks charging too much, Mr Fraser went on to say: With the further reductions in lending rates in recent weeks,I will give the Treasurer the full quote; this is the important partbanks' margins now are not out of line with historical levels. That is in complete contradiction of the whole basis, the whole premise, of the Treasurer's recent bank bashing exercise. I say to the Treasurer that, if he wants people to treat him as fair dinkum on this issue, he ought to come into the Parliament and table that report from the Treasury and from the Reserve Bank, the report which I allege has been the basis of Mr Fraser's remark;s. It just shows what a phoney political exercise that whole bank bashing exercise has been. The truth is that, wherever one looks in Mr Fraser's speech last night, one finds serious attacks on the Government's economic position. In particular, he said that monetary policy, whilst it must continue to bear down on inflation and inflationary expectations, cannot deliver lower inflation at acceptable costs on its own. This task has to be shared with other policies, especially wages policy. That is what the Opposition has been saying for literally nor years. One cannot just jack up interest rates and expect that to cure all of the economic problems that we have. That  couple of months ago which brought the Treasurer out of his bunker to deliver a   go to the fundamentals in this economy and look at the incentives that people have to work, to save, to invest and to export. That is really the crux of this speech of Mr Fraser last night. It delivers to the Government a simple message that its policy is not working and that it does not have a policy response which really would lead this country out of its economic problems. This is no theoretical debate. This is about the living standards and the future of small businesses and families all around this country. We say to the Treasurer that he ought to take heed of what was said last night and he ought to take our constructive advice, which is to come back to this Parliament with a full statement before we rise at Christmas, with a complete change of economic policy that really would deliver some hope to Australian families suffering from Labor's policy of high interest rates.",31
101,Mr GIBSON,ECONOMIC POLICY,"When I came into this House as a new member I had the belief that a matter of public importance-that important segment on each day's program-was just that: a matter of great public importance; an opportunity for the Opposition members to raise a very serious issue and to present detailed facts and figures to back up their case. In the six months that I have been a member of this Parliament, I have been greatly disappointed. The performance of the Opposition in matters of public importance has been woeful in the extreme. Every day in this chamber we have been subjected to the same tired, old rhetoric from honourable members opposite. Every day we have some new set of words espousing the same thing. The speeches from those opposite are absent of facts, absent of alternative policy and absent of any substantiation from rational economic theory; but that does not stop them. We hear lots of quotes from other people but never any quotes from their own policies; that is because they have none. Today, those opposite have found a new, very shaky nail upon which to try to hang their coats-some comments by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. This time they would try to have us believe that Government economic policy is somehow in disarray because the Governor of the Reserve Bank has expressed an opinion about possible future directions. If it were not wasting the valuable time of this House, this matter would be laughable.But this is a shameful and pathetic waste of time, and members of the Opposition should hang their heads in shame. Once more, we are faced with members opposite bleating about economic policy when they do not have any alternative to offer and they have no inkling of the reality of Australia's economic position. They have .the .hide to come in here and tell that economic policy is in ciisarray because one adviser of the Government puts his views forward. The point that they have failed to realise is that there is no fundamental difference of opinion between the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Government on economic policy. I am not quite sure how members of the Opposition intend to run this country-and heaven help us if they should ever get the chance-but I can say this: this Government makes the decisions which determine the economic situatipn in this country. We seek advice and information from a broad range of people within the Australian economy, but we set the economic direction. Bernie Fraser is a'trusted and very capable adviser to the Government in his position as Governor of the Reserve Bank, and his views are always considered. But on this issue, the Government is firm that its current strategy is on target and there will be no new negotiations considered. Last week in this House we debated another matter of public importance with a rehash of the same cliches and rhetoric from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). It was a matter of public importance calling for a sustained reduction in interest rates. In case members opposite had not noticed, this week we did have a further reduction in interest rates. Might I say that the decision was made well before the matter of public importance was raised in this House. The decision was made the week before last by the Reserve Bank, to cut a further one percentage point from official interest rates. This was part of an ongoing and sustained program of reduction in interest rates which has seen 5 percentage points off official rates since January. Did we see the honourable member for Flinders come in and congratulate the Government on maintaining its resolve and urging it to continue the program? No . .He seems to have ignored the fact that interest rates are coming down and have continued to come down all year. The commitment that the Labor Party made to the people of Australia in March us of this year was that there would be no precipitous reduction in interest rates without the necessary slowdown in the economy. Unlike members of the Opposition, who promised the electorate anything it wanted to hear in a desperate bid to buy votes at any cost to the economy or to people within the economy, the Hawke Government understood that without the necessary slowdown in demand for overseas products and without an improvement in our export performance, we could not afford the renewed surge in expenditure that falls in interest rates would have caused at that time. It was because the people of Australia kn,ew that the promises of the Opposition were ju-t hollow rhetoric which could not delivered without wholesale devastation to the economy, they rejected that cheap bag of tricks and stuck with the proven economic performers. The Opposition had no credibility and no understanding the competing forces at work within economy. Unfortunately, for the people of tralia, nothing seems to have changed the Opposition's performance. It still no policies and no comprehension of what it takes to manage a mixed economy like ours in today's international market cplace. That is why it was rejected in March, that is why it will continue to be rejected. The Government's economic policy is concept firmly on track. The people of Australia ing with people. know it; the world mdnetary markets know it; and the Opposition knows it. That is why it hasÂ· failed once more provide anyÂ· shred of evidence or any glimmer of light of an alternative strategy to manage the economy to back up its claims in this motion. Let us just have a look at some of realities of the economy at the moment and the points made by Mr Fraser. Mr Fraser has suggested that a new accord should be negotiated with the trade union movement to provide a new wage-tax accords trade-off. The Government is committed to fulfilling the terms of the current cord-accord mark 6. This accord prounit vides for an aggregate wage target of per cent in 1990-91 and a range of tax cuts which come into force from 1 Janudisputation ary next year. This represents a continuation of the process of restraint by the trade union movement and Australian workers which has been a crucial compotheir nent of the Government's economic form program. Because of the restraint which has been shown by workers in this country, the Government believes that to expect them to shoulder further responsiintention bility would be Â·both unreasonable and unacceptable. The essential point which appears to have escaped the Opposition's notice in its preparation of this matter Governor of the Reserve Bank was proposing further discussions on an accord, the concept of which the Opposition finds be so abhorrent. Honourable members opposite rejected the accord in the last election and continue to oppose the operation of the accord, despite all the success that it has provided for the Australian econof omy. The accord, more than any other the element of the Government's economic strategy, highlights the massive contrast Ausbetween the Government and the Oppoin sition. Whereas the Government believes has that all the main players in the economy have a role and a responsibility in assisting the implementation of economic policy-whether they be unions, big business, and small business, State and local governments-the Opposition rejects the very of actually sitting down and talkIt was this Government that established the Economic Planning Advisory Council to (EPAC)-that high powered, representative and responsible body that provides advice to the Government on an ongoing basis regarding the economy. EPAC enables the broad cross-section of groups the within the economy to influence the direction of government economic policy. In the seven and a half years of the Hawke Government, we have had six accords with the workers of Australia. These have delivered seven years of unprecedented wage restraint and employacment growth. Since 1983, non-farm real labour costs have declined by 10.1 7 per cent; over 1.6 million new jobs have been created; and the level of industrial has fallen by more than half. The alternative is an Opposition committed to confrontation and conflict. In last term of office, the conservatives represided over a wages explosion that brought double-digit inflation and unemployment. The Government is on target in its economic strategy, and there is no by the Government to change its policy framework. The evidence is there that it is working-imports down, exports up, inflation falling, interest rates coming down. There is no need and no intention is that the to change direction now.",33

So it joins the long list of economic management failures of the Government: the vast current account deficit and burgeoning overseas debt; the persistent high inflation, which is the No. 1 disease of this economy; and continuing high interest rates, particularly the destructive high rates of recent years, which are just starting to come down; abysmal productivity growth; reduced living standards in most years of this Government; the rapidly rising number of bankruptcies and business liquidations; and, as evidenced in last week's figures, a high and rising unemployment rate, which is up by 142,000 since October last registering at 7.4 per cent and still rising-and yet the Budget forecast was for 7.5 per cent next June. I mention that the young jobless rat- was at 21 per centa daunting and damaging prospect for the youth of this nation. The onset of this largely home grown recession, the Keating recession, is undoubtedly for real. The area to which I am drawing attention is public capital ex.,. penditllre-both infrastructure, as provided for in this Bill, and public trading enterprises. Public capital spepding has been on a declining trend from the mid1960s but most 110tably over this period from 1982-83 when .it amounted to 7.4 per cent of gross domestic' product (GDP), falling to 5.5 per cent in the most recent years of 1988-89 and 1989-90. It will not improve, on the basis of the figures in this Bill, in 1990-91. In an excellent recent study published by the Australian National University Centre for Economic Policy Research Messrs Alesina, Gruen and Jones referred 1990-91 to this trend as 'cause for concern'. They referred to international and Australian empirical research demonstrating that a fall in government contributions to capital accumulation has serious negative consequences for labour productivity and long run economic growth. There was more in that vein. Particularly in the area of public trading enterprises, as the authors recognise, an important part of the problem has been this Gov,ernment's anti-privatisation stance-until very recently when its national conference gave it the go ahead for limited action in ihis. area. The point is that cutting or limiting public investment by public trading enterprises and excluding the private sector is not an acceptable option. Adequate public capital investment, along with injecting competition, privatisation and other aspects of so-called micro-economic reform, is critical to lifting Australian productivity and competitiveness and hence critical to addressing the current account deficit and vast overseas debt problems. But the political reality is that it has been easier for the Government to cut public capital expenditure, along with payments to the States, than it has been to offend the welfare and other big spending lobbies and the unions, Bill Kelty and company, who insist on their 'social wage' pound of flesh, whatever the cost. Hence the decrease of public capital expenditure as a major component of the achievement of the Government's surplus. I think it is worth noting in this context of referring to those statistics for public investment as a percentage of GDP that if we take the sum of private and public investment as a percentage of GDP then notwithstanding the much vaunted expansion of private investment in recent years, now collapsed, that increase in private investment has only served to offset the decline in public investment to which I have referred. The sum of public and private investment in 1989-90 was 24.16 per cent and in 1982-83 almost the same. I might add in response to some of the things that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) was saying in Question Time today that in the early 1980s, preceding the .advent of this Government,' there were a good deal of important additions to the capital stock in a variety of areas which have subsequently proved themselves essential and profitable for this country-and not merely in the resources area. I could instance the very large investment of General-Motors Holden's Ltd in the Fishermen's Bend engine plant, which still ranks as our second largest manufacturing exporter to this day. What really needs to be said in this whole area of the economic program of the Government is that the Government affects to act, at least to yesterday, as if there is no slide into recession and further, and in a sense more importantly, as if this country's persistent current account deficit and massive debt overhang were not a problem, or not too bad at any rate. The other day in this House I was upbraiding the Treasurer for not showing leadership in this whole matter, for not telling the Australian public just how it is, not telling them the magnitude of our economic problem, particularly the awful arithmetic of the public debt as it has been put and the changes that need to be effected if the country is to avoid the downward slide to banana republic status that the Treasurer has talked about. Perhaps I should have been targeting the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). His weekend statement seeking to maximise the political gain from the one point drop in official cash rates was in all the circumstances of this country unwarranted, if not downright irresponsible-a disgraceful betrayal of the leadership of this country from the high office of Prime Minister. What he did, as Paul Kelly correctly pointed out in the Australian yesterday, was to oversell this instalment of interest rate relief with his .not too subliminal message of happier days being just around the corner and to undersell, as Mr Kelly put it, the 'ongoing hardship which Australians will face' associated, as I have said, with the containing of the external deficit and the overseas debt-and in which the investment in public infrastructure and other developments in that area, more competition and privatisation, as raised by this Bill are so important. While the interest rate reduction was welcome-indeed, I was strongly plumping for it in the remarks of last week that I referred to a moment ago-the fact is that the Government's package is flawed. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made clear, and as is evident in the thrust of the speech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, for a sustainable cut in interest rates there should, firstly, be a really taut fiscal policy. There is virtually unanimous opinion among informed observers 'that there has been a loosening, not a tightening, of policy with this Budget. Secondly, there needs to be a real start to some really effective action, undertaken with a sense of urgency, in the micro-economic reform area. Thirdly, as has been said, we need a renegotiation, to put it in the Government's own corporatist terms, of the accord mark 6, the election driven arrangement with the unions, the deal with Bill Kelty and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU)-endorsed without question in this current Budget. That was the point made by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. In referring to monetary policy in particular he said that it cannot deliver lower inflation at acceptable costs, and bear on the overall economic problems of this country, on its own; that task 'has to be shared with other policies and especially wages policy'. I stress that the Government should be scrapping the move to the 20 mega-unions it has foreshadowed and under whatever name-award restructuring, Of even the supposedly industrywide bargaining of the ACTU-should be encouraging genuine enterprise bargaining and enterprise agreements, so that wage increases are linked to improved productivity and performance. The recession to which I have referred is inexorably upon us. But let us benefit from it at least by getting some genuine change in terms of the abandonment of absurd work practices on the waterfront and in workplaces all over the country, and by making the best use of what genuine, new, productive investment there has been-although there has been not nearly as much as the bald figures which the Treasurer often cites would indicateand thereby achieve the sorely needed lift in productivity which the country needs. That is the essence of the nation's difficulty-and the factor which has been adversely affected by this declining trend in public capital expenditure which will continue into 1990-91, as evidenced by the legislation which is before the House. The essence of the matter is to increase national productivity on a continuing. basis. It is the wage-cost outcome which is important, and that is a matter not only of the money wage outcome, but also of the increase in productivity. One may have a money wage outcome that is somewhat comparable-it has been higher than outcomes in many countries-but the productivity performance of this country, including the impact through public investment that I.have referred to, has been abysmal. I referred in that respect to the importance of a fundamental change in the wages system, moving towards enterprise agreements, linking wage increases to improved productivity and performance, and also changes in the micro area, and so on. I emphasise those points. The Reserve Bank Governor has suggested yet again in that context a further wage-tax trade-off. The fundamental requirement, as I have said, over the long haul is to increase productivity. Let us keep the money supply taut and steady, which is compatible at this time with lowering interest rates, but let us do this in the context of a really taut fiscal policy, a changed accord mark 6, and a start on some real action in the micro reform area. What that package also does is to set the scene for a more competitive exchange rate, the lowering of the value of the Australian dollar when the current petro and energy related pressures subside. With yesterday's interest rate reduction, the rate has already collie down some 3c or 4c in terms of the exchange rate with the United States dollar. There is. widespread support for the view that a sustained, significant, real depreciation of the Australian dollar is essential to overcoming the current account deficit and debt problem and, of course, underlines the need for a continuing taut monetary and fiscal policy to bear down on inflation. The program that I .have just outlined addresses not only th- Keating recession but also the longer term overriding economic challenge for this. country: the ongoing hardship associated with overcoming the current account deficit and the burgeoning foreign debt, about which, irresponsibly, nothing was said by the PrIme Minister in his weekend statement. As the recession takes hold, people undoubtedly want a basis of hope for the future. As I said the other day, and I say again to the Government, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that they ought to tell it as it is. I think they would find the Australian people much more responsive than they believe. It will require a four, five or six-year disciplined stint for this country to work its way out of the present deficit and debt situation, and that is just to the point of stabilising the debt. The country must effect a transfer of 3 to 4 percentage points of, hopefully, a growing-not stagnant-national production into net exports. That is the only way in which we can pay the interest on the debt without borrowing to pay it, which is what we are doing now. The total figure for dividend and interest income payable overseas in 1989-90 was $15.8 billion, which was matched by an increase in the net overseas debt of the same order.Â· In the most recent June quarter, that net income payable overseas represented a ratio of 25.5 per cent of our exports, which is the danger level at whi<;h the red light starts flashing to overseas investors. The ratio of net income payable overseas in 1982-83 was only 10 per cent of exportsÂ· and has incre.ased as a ratio - y about 2 percentage pomts a year ever smce. That is the magnitude of the task in front of us. To effect that transfer to the net export sector is the only way to pick up the tab for the profligate borrowing and living beyond our means of the past few years. There is no overnight solution, no quick fix in this area. What should be made clear, and what the Prime Minister might have said more about in his weekend statement, is this: If everyone pulls their weight, if management lifts its game and employees give up stupid and archaic work practices, black bans, go slows and stop works, everybody in the nation will be better off. But it will indeed be a long haul. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.

NA (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL 1990-91 Second Reading D-bate resumed from 21 August, on motIOn by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",36
105,Mr ROCHER,APPROPRIATION,"The vote for the parliamentary departments this year approximates $116.241 m. In itself, it represents a modest enough increase over the figure. for the previous year and, of course, as IS the case with all Budget Bills the coalition does not oppose the Appro: priation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill. Whilst I do n-t intend to take up anywhere near the tIme which might be available to me on this issue, I would like to touch on a couple of matters. One is that the sitting hours of the Parliament seem to bear no relation to the costs of running it. I say that, Mr Deputy Speaker, because, as you know only too well-and probably, like myself, have occasion to lament-this Parliament will sit for only 30-odd days this year. I forget what the total vote was last year, but over a full 12 month- - 116m, or something less, for 30 or so slttmg days does not seem to me to be very good value for the Australian public, particularly when we compare the sitting program and its length this year to what has transpired in the past. We are scheduled to sit on far fewer days this year than ever before, with one exception-some time in the 1930s. At the same time, the amount of legislation before the Parliament has not been reduced. We are still going to deal with about the same volume of legislation. Heaven knows, there are matters of an economic nature depressing this country and its citizens which also deserve adequate consideration by members on both sides in this Parliament. An opportunity will be lost simply because the Government does not want to front up to the people of Australia, given the problems that beset both the Government and our economy. This is the one place where an opposition has a chance to expose the shortcomings of a government-and goodness knows this Government has plenty of shortcomings. The number of Bills will be approximately the same, the sitting times will be savagely reduced, and we will, no doubt, see the guillotine-that very crude, blunt parliamentary weapon-used by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in a couple of - eeks time to &et a whole raft of legislatIon through thIS House to be dealt with in the Senate. I have had occasion to criticise that before, as has the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) and many others on this side. It makes no difference to this ernment because its arrogance knows bounds. But you would think that if we are sitting less, at least the cost of running the place might be less. That does seem to be the case. It might even be that it would cost more if we sat for a reasonan able part of the year; but that is not parent from the papers made available the Government. I want to touch on another subject which I think great credit is to be given to those involved. That is Hansard. When we moved here in 1988 there were great problems associated with the move, setcorrect tling in, with the new surroundings, the distances involved and a whole host problems. But Hansard always coped. I noticed-and I am sure others in this affects chamber did also-that the Hansard staff had their problems from time to time, and they managed to overcome them mirably. In recent times we have seen the signs of their very fine work, and we getting pretty good service once again. could not imagine that it could be much better. The 'greens', as we see them come into this place, are far superior to those which we have ever experienced before. Recent industrial action aside, we have managed to get onto a much more effisay cient basis the process which exists beissue tween Hansard doing its work and the Government Printer. That seems to me to be so, anyway, from examining the end product. All in all, we have achieved a great result and those concerned in Hansard to be congratulated. This has been achieved at a time when-in recent times anyway-Hansard has had to engage a lot of new staff, and they seem to have very well indeed. We particularly welcome the money that is being made availbroadcast able in this area. There was some suggestion that Hanchannels sard was brought into some disrepute cause of events associated with words uttered by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which attracted a lot of media attention. That was compounded by the fact that what Hansard recorded the Prime Minister repeated in a television program at 7.30 on the same night. We and the world Govat large could be forgiven for thinking no that what appeared in Hansard, having been confirmed in that way, was in fact what was said by the Prime Minister. The not end result was that we saw the Prime Minister come into this place cackling like old crow and telling the Leader of the apOpposition (Dr Hewson) that he had fallen by flat on his face because he accepted the printed word, confirmed by the Prime on Minister in the television program of which I spoke. That is typical of the Prime Minister. Whilst there must be some doubt as to whether the Hansard record was or otherwise, the only person who came out of that deserving of criticism, of in my opinion, is the Prime Minister. I want to touch on another matter which the parliamentary vote, and that is the proposed televising of proceedings in this chamber along lines which already adoccur in the Senate. The Opposition, through the Leader of the Opposition, has are made the offer to cooperate with the I adoption of such a program and, in return, has been offered the Government's support for such a measure, conditioned by the attachment of three quite unrelated so-called reforms which the Government would like to introduce. I simply want to on behalf of the coalition that the of televising the proceedings in this Parliament is a separate issue and, as far as we are concerned, will be kept separate from those other changes which the Prime Minister and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) seek to have us agree to, all of are which offer advantage to the Government and not to the Opposition parties. The only reservation I have about televising proceedings in this chamber is that the done Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which has the legislated duty to proceedings in this House, has in recent times relegated the broadcast to which it seems to me no-one can bereceive. I know that in my home city of Perth I cannot get the channel on which the proceedings of Parliament are broadcast. That is true not only for Perth, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I am sure you know, coming from Sydney; it also applies to other capital cities, as far as I can ascertain from my colleagues. If the ABC is going to play games along that line, I wonder whether it should be given the responsibility. There might be some justification for thinking, as some do, that the ABC is just looking for a reason, a vehicle, to get a second broadcast channel, for reasons which are not immediately clear but which would certainly suit the psyches of some at the top in the ABC who seek personal aggrandisement rather than providing, as their first priority, service to the people of Australia. With those few remarks, I simply reiterate that the Opposition supports the Bill, and I will leave it at that.",39
106,Mr SNOWDON,APPROPRIATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (4:30)-I shall make a couple of comments in relation to the contribution from my colleague opposite, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I agree with him in relation to the suggestion that the service we are getting from Hansard is now far improved on what we had previously. I will not comment on his slight in relation to an issue which he addressed in the context of his contribution. I will say to Hansard that it is not only the Opposition but also Government members who value the service it provides. Whilst there are occasions when it is possible-for the benefit of the honourable member-for other people to make small errors, by and large, and indeed from my own experience, the contribution of Hansard to the running of this place has been one which has been fundamental to the successful performance of Parliament. It seems to me that it is appropriate, as the honourable member said, to praise the good work of Hansard. There is absolutely no doubt that under the new arrangements the service which is being provided is extremely good and of a very high order. As honourable members opposite know, when they get back to their offices very shortly the 'greens' will arrive forthwith. In the old Parliament House I would go trotting around looking for the 'greens', often not available until some considerable time after speeches were made. In terms of the use of parliamentarians' time, it is in my view of great benefit to all of us that we now have this very efficient service being provided by Hansard. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon) read a third time. PATENTS BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 October, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.  Patents Bill. 1990 has a very long history. Industrial property rights and ownership have been recognised for many years. Indeed, this Bill replaces the 1952 Patents Act. In 1979 the then Minister for Productivity, the Hon. Ian Macphee, initiated an inquiry into the Australian patents system by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee (IPAC). The Committee, representing the Australian Law Society, the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia and the Patents Office, reported to the Government in 1984. On 28 November 1986 the Government made its response. In 1989 the then Minister for Science and Technology, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), introduced the Patents Bill 1989 into the House. However, as we know, Parliament broke up for the March election. Following the election the Minister changed, and on 29 May the Patents Bill 1990 was introduced into the Senate. Following debate, reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and some rather absurd amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats, the Bill is at last in front of us today. Indeed, it could be said that the progress of reformÂ· in this area has been far too slow, especially given the pace of technological advance and the dire need to improve our balance of trade. I should like to place on record my thanks t- Senator Archer, who so ably saw the BIll through the Senate and the committee procedure. By any standard, Australians have a very proud record on inventiveness nove-ty and innovation. On a per capita baSIS, we are amongst the world leaders. I do not mean just the Victa lawn-mower the .Hills hoist and the photocopier. Austrahans have also been responsible for the invention of the solar telephone the wine cask, plastic banknotes, perma-ent press pleats for men's pants, the automatic fruit picker- and commercial refrigeration, to name Just a few. . It is the patents system which gives the mventor exclusive rights to the ownership and marketing of these inventions. A patent gives the inventor the right to exclude other people, for a limited period from making, using or selling the patented invention. This is a property right in the s-nse t-at the inventor can sell, assign or lIcense It to others. An inventor must apply to have his invention patented. The process of getting a patent inspected currently takes about 20 months but with increasing efficiency, the Patents 'Office hopes to have this reduced to its .goalof 18 months. This is in spite of a 6 1/2 per cent increase in the number of patent applications lodged in the 1988-89 financial year. In that financial year some 23,049 standard patent applications were lodged, up from 21,641 in the previous financial year. . Australia operates according to a twottered system of patents, granting both stal!da-d an- petty patents. It is a system WhICh IS umque to Australia. Under the existing legislation, the only difference tween the standard and petty patent is the period for which the patent is granted. A stal!dard patent is granted for 16 years, whIle a petty patent is granted for an initial period of 12 months, with an option of extension forÂ· five years. The underlying concept of the patents system is that it should be granted only to an invention which adds to what is known or practised in the area of technology concerned. To determine this an invention is tested for novelty and in-enÂ­ t-ve s.tep. In assessing novelty, an inven!lOn IS t.ested against publicly available mformatlOn from a prior document or use to ensure that it is in fact new or novel. An invention is taken to involve an inventive step unless the invention would have ot.herwise been obvious to a person s-llled m t-e relevant art and unless prior dIsclosure m document form exists. The current Act, which is to be amended by this - ill, p-ovides for the test of novelty and mventtveness to apply against any document in Australia. !he Industrial Property Advisory CommIttee report quite succinctly sums up what the patents system is all about: to - ain. in-reased b-nefits for Australians by fos-eflng l-dlgenous mnovation, and utilising the mternatlOnal patent system in developing export markets; . to i.ll!-prove Australia's international competitive posItion; to red.uce unnecessary social costs including those result.mg ff(?m undesirable anti-competitive conduct mvolvIng patents; and to improve the efficiency of the administration of the patent system with consequent reduction of costs. The report also went on to make a number of recommendations on improvements which could be made to the patents system. Four of these recommendations were adopted by the Government and have been incorporated in this Bill. The first change made has been to redraft the Bill in plain English. This is very welcome from the Opposition's point of view . The 1952 Act is very lengthy-some ?16,Pages-and is quite complex. Indeed, It nvals the .tax Ac! in terms of length beand cOJ?1plexity. It IS almost impossible for any mventor and for some administrators to wade their way through it. The change to the plain English style is something of an innovation for the Government. I understand that this Bill is one of only a few which have been redrafted in this manner. I hope that the Government will continue along this path as it opens up to ordinary Australians some of the Government's legal requirements and conditions. The second amendment made by this Bill is to simplify the administration of the patents system. As far as possible, the Bill now only deals with matters of principle, leaving procedural matters to be dealt with entirely by regulations. As I said, the Government's rationale for this is to streamline and improve the administration of the patents system and to simplify future changes to administration. The Opposition is particularly concerned about this change. As regulations are not subject to the same degree of parliamentary scrutiny, this amendment will make analysis and investigation of changes much more difficult. The Opposition will have to be vigilant in scrutinising the regulations to ensure that the Government does not interfere with the property rights of patent holders without the matter being referred to the Parliament. As a matter of principle, the legitimately acquired rights of property ownership should not be altered by the Government without consultation with the parties involved or a full debate by the Parliament. I remind the House of the words of the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) on this matter when it was raised in the other place. He said: I believe that hethat is,. Senator Archer on behalf of the Oppositionhas asked to be kept fully informed on the opment of regulations under the legislation and I certainly give him the undertaking that not only the Opposition but all honourable senators with an interest in the matter will be kept fully informed as the regulations are d,eveloped and not merely when they are . . . promulgated. I seek a similar assurance from the Minister for all members of this House as well. The IPAC report also recommended that the 16-year patent term remain in place. This Bill makes no change to the existing patent term. The fourthÂ· amendment relates to the granting of a patent and strengthens the test against which an application will be assessed. As I mentioned earlier, a patent is tested for novelty and inventive step against all other disclosures in Australia. This test will now be strengthened to include all other disclosures anywhere in the world. This raises the level of testing to an international level and will make a standard patent harder to obtain. The international standard of testing will have a second effect. It will also encourage patentees to seek and exploit export markets, because by being awarded a patent their invention is unique to the world and patentable anywhere in the world. However, 'once the Australian inventor obtains a standard patent, it is then up to him or her to seek the patent in the countries to which he or she wishes to export, and also to develop those export markets. I point out that the test applying to petty patents will not be changed. They will continue to be assessed against disclosures in Australia. The availability of patents in other countries to Austr-lian companies is matched by the availability of Australian patents to the nationals of other countries. This, and the stronger international test, will go some way towards opening up the lines of free trade and reducing protection, although in a very subtle manner. In addition, it will be helpful in multilateral trade negotiations, including the current Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiadeveltions. Most importantly, this development ensures that domestic innovations are not inefficiently protected from competition. All these factors are consistent with the coalition's approach to protection and our aim to substantially reduce all protection by the year 2000. Indeed, because a patent confers a limited monopoly power over the use of patented technology, it can be viewed as a very blunt form of industry assistance. However, the granting of a patent right could also be seen as the enforcement of a private property right rather than the protection of domestic innovation in the form of industry protection. Adding weight to this is the view of some that a patent is seen as encouragement to an inventor to disclose his invention rather than keep it a secret. Further, while the patent gives the patentee the opportunity to profit from his or her invention, it does not always guarantee that this will be the case. While this legislation does not make the distinction clear, if research, innovation and ideas are to be stimulated by the method of conferring private property rights, then that is appropriate. However, if by conferring private property rights the Government is bringing forward some additional form of industry protection, then this is not appropriate. By strength- end. ening the test to be applied to patent applications through this Bill, the Government is perhaps showing that its principal aim is actually to stimulate innovation and inventiveness. The Opposition supports this move. I touch briefly upon an amendment which the Australian Democrats raised when this Bill was being considered in the Senate; The Democrats sought through their amendment to preclude all human life from being patentable. In doing this, they were precluding from the scope of patents all innovations based on genes, genetic material, animals and plants. The Democrats' amendment was rejected by both the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the Opposition. From our point of view, the amendment precluded the patenting of animal and plant life. Both of these play a fundamental role in the development of crucial vaccines and medicines. The amendment was also restrictive. As it stood, it would have prevented the patenting of sufficient numbers of vaccines and antibiotics which are based on live genetic material-for example, viral vaccines, live polio vaccines and one particular tuberculosis vaccine. The amendment would also have precluded the patenting of new medical techniques-for example, skin growth techniques, which are becoming increasingly widely used in burns cases. A flow-on effect from the Democrats' amendment would have been to substantially hinder research into and development of new technology. This would particularly apply to the medical and pharmaceutical fields. Effectively, the amendment would have stopped most research into life, genes and living organisms. If there is no incentive or award for an inventor, currently provided through the patent system, he or she will simply not undertake the research. To illustrate that, pharmaceutical industry research can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and is primarily motivated by the reward at the However, the Senate did agree to one amendment moved by Senator Harradine. His amendments modified those moved by the Democrats and precluded the patenting of human beings and their biological processes. This essentially precludes in-vitro fertilisation and cloning for reproduction purposes from being patentable. The IPAC report concluded that, overall, the cost of the patent system probably exceeded the benefits. However, it did not recommend abolishing the system. In reaching this conclusion, the Committee gave due consideration to. Australia's international relations. Patent schemes operate in all industrial nations and are becoming increasingly widespread in developing nations. Under these circumstances, it would be difficult for Australia not to have a system of patents, as overseas firms might try to keep their products out of an unprotected market. With this in mind, the Opposition will be supporting this Bill.",41
107,Mr COURTICE,APPROPRIATION,"The Patents Bill is intended to increase the opportunities for manufacturers,. inventors and entrepreneurs to develop new technologies for Australia. The Bill takes into account many submissions from various peak groups within the industry, including the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia, the Australian Manufacturers Patents, Industrial Designs, Copyright and Trade Mark Association and the Intellectual Property Committee of the Law Council of Australia. One of the main focuses of the Bill is to foster indigenous innovation and the use of the international patent system to develop export markets for' Australia and improve our international position. The standard of patentability for standard patents is strengthened by testing inventions for novelty and inventive step against disclosures in recorded form anywhere in the world rather than, as at present, just in Australia. Other changes are aimed at improving the efficiency of the administration of the patent system, ranging from examination procedures to enforcement of patents in the courts. As the previous speaker, the  ser) said, we cannot live in international isolation and the patent system is as relevant here as anywhere else in the world. The Bill, like the present Patents Act, contains provisions expressly designed to prevent abuse also of patent monopolies. I suppose one of the major features of the Bill is to move towards greater interna-, tional compatibility of the standards of novelty and inventiveness which are applied in deciding whether a patent should be granted for an invention in Australia. Of course the idea of a patent is to give an opportunity for profit, but it certainly does not guarantee that.' It comes back to marketing skills, quality and competing in the '. marketplace. One problem we have. faced, and still face, in this nation is in the past we have basically committed ourselves simply to knocking down mountains and shipping them overseas or reaping another wheat crop and' sending it to anyone who will buy it. Selling our primary products in the international trade world will get harder, as everyone well knows. Donald Horne put it very well in the early 1960s in his book The Lucky Country, which attempted to grapple with the problem. The title has been often misunderstood and its irony lost. When Australia faced invasion in 1942, the United States came to our rescue. In the 1950s we found oil. Each time our luck changed. But because we have never been traumatised, Australia has not had to face up to rigorous planning or look ahead to future stages in developing human capital. Donald Horne warned that reliance on luck and last minute adjustment would not work in reality when faced with the demands of new technology and the change in the world today. Australia will not be able to maintain its prosperity in the new technological age without profoundly changing its life patterns and, in particular, coping with demands for a rising level of skill and promoting new technologies. There are some depressing stories of excellent ideas for products which have failed to gain development because no managers were prepared to take them up and no financiers were willing to invest. Honourable members may well recall the Australian Broadcasting Commission show Inventors of the Year, which ran from 1970 to 1981. Mr Downer-It was a good program.",44
108,Mr COURTICE,APPROPRIATION,"As the honourable member for Mayo said, it was a good program. Each winner had to pass through an exhaustive elimination process. He or she had to beat hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of competitors. Of the 12 winners, two won international gold medals at the Geneva Inventors Exhibition and another two won silver medals. Yet, of those 12, six inventions have not been manufactured at all. A couple of inventions have been outstanding, such as Mike Debenham's Presto Can and Bob Hanthat sen's Gold Swing Trainer. The remaining four have been modest successes, occasionally manufactured, but they have not been scaled up to take on world markets, largely because of the difficulty of gaining access to capital on favourable terms. There is still a strongly anti-intellectual feeling in this country which suggests that we do not need to rely on using our brains if we have the minerals. The reality is that a nation can be richer through intellectual effort and using a few grey cells rather than just digging things up. To point that out, in 1984 Australia ranked No.8 in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and No. 10 in the world as the producer of scientific research papers. We have produced the same number of Nobel Prize winners in the sciences as Japan, with an eighth of the population. As an exporter of high technology products, of the 24 OECD countries we ranked 18th in 1978, 20th in 1980 and 21st in 1982. The leaders were nations with much smaller populations than ours. Switzerland-whose figure was 32 times higher than ours-the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden, all of whom we beat as research producers, have made the linkage between research, wherever produced, and its industrial application. We have still to learn that lesson. Australia has a population of some 17 million people, one of the richest natural resource bases of any nation, abundant, cheap energy and a strong agricultural base. However Sweden, a country of only 8 million people-55 per cent of Australia's population-rather limited raw materials and a very short industrial working week of some 30.2 hours, has a gross domestic product proportionately much better than ours. What I am trying to say is that by using technologies and not living on raw materials alone, a small nation with an inhospitable climate such as Sweden has been able to do so well that it has produced brand names such as Volvo, Electrolux, ASEA, L.M. Ericsson, SaabScania and SKF. It sells us $ 5 worth of finished goods for every dollar in raw materials we sell to it. Indeed, the resource rich nations such as the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom have fallen in ranking while resource poor nations such as Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Japan and Singapore have risen rapidly. Again, it is by applying these technologies. More than 60 per cent of the annual export earnings of Japan, France, Sweden, theÂ· Netherlands and Italy depend on brain based industries, while Australia's figure is something like 5 per cent. Technologies currently being developed and applied in both the manufacturing and service sectors use little in raw materials and energy. These include biotechnology and micro-electronics. At the moment we need to look at online services and whether they should be based on coaxial copper cable or on optical fibres, where the signals are pushed along by laser. We have the copper and silver used in coaxial cables in abundance, but so far we lack the skills in fibre optics. The comparative cost of the raw materials is 300 per cent in favour of optical fibres. What large scale provider in his right mind would take the copper cable option? Quality control and expertise are what we need to direct towards new technology. That is why it is very important that through this Bill we protect those people who are getting out there and being innovative and are putting in place the technologies that will be necessary if we are to take our rightful place in the ever changing and tough wo.rld environment. The other problem we have is that as I have mentioned, since 69 per cent of -)Ur gross domestic product is export earnmgs based on raw materials or primary products, we have a vulnerable economy because we are subject to the vagaries of world trade. Consequently, I believe that we need to continue to push for and support technological advancement and. innovation. As a consequence of that, I am very pleased to support this Bill because it puts. in place protection for people, encouragmg them to have a go. . We also need to encourage people to get back to these sorts of innovations. Some of the corporate collapses may well demonstrate to people that it is important not to shuffle paper in the stock market so much as to get out there and compete the way countries such as Sweden have. As I have said, we have produced more Nobel Prize winners in the sciences. I am sure that we can do it. We can invent anything if we put our mind to it as a nation. We led the world in cinematography at the turn of the century, and there are many other opportunities for us. It needs a changed mindset. Consequently, I support this Bill. . Mr DOWNER (Mayo) (4.58)-1 would lIke, in the spirit of bipartisanship, to support many of the remarks made by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr form Courtice), who picked up some interesting and important aspects of the Patents Bill 1990. As the honourable member for proper Hinkler indicates, this Bill is really broadly related to the capacity of Australians Australian firms to compete in high nology industries, be they related to our intrinsic comparative advantages as an economy or high technology industries which almost spontaneously develop in areas unrelated to our natural comparathe tive advantages. To be specific about the Bill, I will mention to the House that it is a redraft of the 1952 Patents Act. One of the conSome structive aspects of this redraft is that puts patents legislation into what is deright scribed, sometimes euphemistically, as plain English. At least it gives the prospect of people being able to understand what the legislation is actually about if they peruse what will become the Act. This legislation also internationalises whole concept of patents. As a result of this legislation, the inventions tested against disclosures around the world, whereas under the previous legispoint lation they were tested only against closures domestically in Australia. The point is that patents is becoming more an area of intellectual property. I anotherlegislation suppose in a broader sense it is very much an international issue and an issue that in range that context falls very much within my own trade portfolio. I know that there is some debate in the community which has not really emerged in the House today about the efficacy the system of patents and other aspects the protection of intellectual property. I refer the House to an article which recopyright cently appeared in the British Economist magazine which argued, rather surprisures ingly I thought, against the system of ents and the protection of intellectual property. Suffice it to say that is not a view that I find particularly appealing, but there an emerging debate about the issue of patents and the question of whether they really act as an inhibition to free trade and very little else, and are an artificial of non-tariff protection. I think that the view expressed in the House so farthat without patents there would not be a dissemination of ideas and the incentive of inventors to invent and innoand vators to implement those inventions techwould be taken away-is probably still the correct argument. Certainly there is insufficient evidence to support the argument that the Economist put forward. As I said earlier, we need to think of issue of patents not just in a domestic context, but also very much in a global just context. From Australia's point of view, this is actually a very important issue. people say it is not because we are it a net importer of technology and copymaterials, but in fact, as I will try to argue, there is enormous potential growth for Australians in export markets in those areas of technology and copyright materials. Without proper protection for those people involved in those service and manthe ufacturing industries, Australia has very limited prospects of getting into the interwill be national marketplace. Intellectual property rights, from the of view of Australia ""as a net imdisporter of technology, mean that we gain access to technology to which we might not otherwise gain access. To put that way, if we did not have patents in Australia, there would be a of companies and countries around the world which would simply refuse to allow the transfer of technology to Australia on the grounds that the technology on its arrival in Australia would be pirated. Of course, that is a problem which of exists in some other parts of the world of and to which I will come in a moment. As I said, our exports of technology and materials have very Â·great potential. It is very hard to get up-to-date figon the trade in technology and patcopyright materials, but in 1987 the Australian Copyright Council produced a study which showed that Australia's imports of copyright-based items in 1985-86 is amounted to nearly $1.3 billion, whereas Australia's exports were only $220m, a very small proportion compared to imports. But it is important to note that the Australian Copyright Council study said that there had been a 17 per cent per annum growth in exports of copyrightbased items between 1980-81 and 198586. If we look at more recent figures on royalties from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), we see that they give a similar indication of the deficit that we have in this type of trade. They should also encourage us to believe that there is scope for improving our exports and ultimately reducing that deficit. The ABS international trade and services figures for 1987-88 show that royalties on, for. example, technical know-how that Australia received as a credit were worth about $42m, although the debit was some $367m. In the computer software area the credits were $94m while the debits were, once again, a very substantial $288m. I will not read out all the figures, but the conclusion reached by the ABS study was that in total there was a very substantial debit but with a potential again for growth in those exports. If we are to be 'serious about improving those exports, there has to be protection of Australian intellectual property rights, otherwise that export market is simply going to be lost to us and, as the honourable member for Hinkler said, any potential we have in Australia of developing appropriate and relevant high technology industry simply will not occur. Australia is not the only country with problems such as this legislation certainly addresses; there are also substantial lems in overseas markets. It is interesting to look at the 1988 survey of Australian companies and organisations involved in international trade in technology and copyright materials conducted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade because that survey revealed very substantially that, according to those companies and organisations, a substantial degree of piracy-if one could call it that-exists in foreign markets. That survey was quite specific in identifying countries such as the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, China, India, Korea and some of the South American countries as countries which did not have effective copyright and intellectual property rights regimes and consequently were, if you like, conspiring in this piracy. When we looks at the list of industries affected, according to the Department's 1988 survey, we see that b90k publishing, music, film and video production, computer software and the like are all at risk. Let me remind the House that these are areas where Australia has considerable export potential. There are basically four reasons for the lack of proper protection in the international marketplace. First, there is an absence of international agreements. There are some international agreements and there is, of course, an international arrangement under the auspices of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), but there is no substantial international regime-which I suppose is the best way of putting it-which is effectively comprehensive. Secondly, in a number of markets there is also an absence of domestic legislation of the kind we are debating today in this House. Thirdly, in some countries there is an inability properly to enforce intellectual property rights. Fourthly, the protection of property rights in some markets is discriminatory; for example, the United States of America and the United Kingdom have been very successful in negotiating bilateral agreements in the Asia Pacific region on intellectual property rights, but those agreements are effectively discriminatory because they apply only to products that come from the prob- United States and the United Kingdom and do not apply to intellectual property from a country like Australia. That puts us at a significant disadvantage in that particular market. I am glad to see that these issues have become significant issues in what is known as the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) international trade negotiations. In those negotiations they fall under the rather curious 'acronym' of TRIPS-trade related aspects of intellectual property rights. To some extent GATT does cover the issue of intellectual property rights in articles 9, 12, 18 and 20; but the coverage in the GA TT articles is fairly ineffectual. TRIPS has been given-not surprisingly, I suppose-major priority in the Uruguay Round by the United States, the European Community, Japan and Switzerland. It is understandable that they should give it a major priority. The Australian Government has given it a much lower priority and that is understandable because Australia's major priority in the Uruguay Round must inevitably be agricultural trade, but that is not to say that the Australian Government has ignored the issue of TRIPS. It has certainly participated actively in that agenda item of the Uruguay Round, and I offer no criticism of the Government for taking a relatively low profile on this issue in that context. Certainly the Opposition strongly supports a multilateral discipline for intellectual property rights in the context of the Uruguay Round and international trade in general. That multilateral discipline must be based on three fundamental principles, principles of not just sensible, fair and free international trade, but also GATT. The first of those principles is that of national treatment, which means that the same treatment for imports should be given as is given to local products. If we do not do that in the area of intellectual property, as is supposed to be done in the area of trade in goods and services, intellectual property rights within a country will simply become a form of non-tariff barrier. That means that exporters of intellectual property rights just will not have proper access to the marketplace because those intellectual property rights will not be protected in that market. If there is a multilateral regime, it must be based first and foremost on that principle of national treatment-in other words, exporters of intellectual property should get the same treatment as domestic producers of intellectual property. Secondly, the principle of non-discrimination is absolutely fundamental to that sort of international regime. There should be no special deals with certain countries which exclude other parts of the world. In 1986 the United States and South Korea reached an agreement on intellectual property which applied only to the access of intellectual property from the United States into Korea and excluded other countries. The trouble with that agreement was that while it suited the United States, it obviously excluded a country such as Australia and had the effect of giving the United States preferential access to the Korean market which was obviously, by definition, denied to a country such as Australia. If we are to have a proper international regime concerning international property, it must be nondiscriminatory. There must be no place for special deals of the kind that the United States and Korea negotiated in 1986. But what is more, the GATT principle of most favoured nation status should also apply. By that I mean that a deal with one country, particularly a GATT contracting country, should apply to all other GATT contracting countries and should not be a discriminatory and special deal. It is important that we reinforce that principle of non-discrimination in the Uruguay Round and in other negotiations on intellectual property issues. The third principle that has to be a fundamental part of this kind of regime is the principle of transparency. All relevant laws and regulations-this Bill provides not only a law but also a great deal of scope for the introduction of regulations-should be publicly available. They should be transparent, in other words; they should be visible. There is some debate in the context of trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights in the Uruguay Round about whether court rulings, particularly those of lower courts in developing countries, could be made publicly available on issues such as intellectual property. We have to do our best to ensure that even if in every instance it is not very practical to achieve the principle of transparency, in general that principle of transparency is incorporated properly into an international regime on intellectual property. Finally, developing countries in the context of the Uruguay Round have, as usual, argued for what is known as Sand o treatment-special and differential treatment. In relation to intellectual property, they argue that an intellectual property regime would work against them because it would create import monopolies for developed countries which are exporters of intellectual property within that particular market in a developing country. I think that this principle of special and differential treatment proposed by developing countries is a regressive principle and it should not be endorsed in Australia by the Australian Government. If we were to concede this point partially for political reasons, it should be only a partial concession and it should be done only on a temporal basis-that is, we should only agree to such Sand D treatment for intellectual property for a small number of years. But, in principle, I do not think we should accept that sort of special and differential treatment. In conclusion, I have addressed, in particular, the TRIPS negotiations in the context of the Uruguay Round. I do not want those negotiations to be seen as being totally separate and unrelated to the excellent work which has been done over many years by other bodies in the area of intellectual property. I refer to the Universal Copyright Convention which operates under the auspices of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and the World Intellectual Property Organisation-WIPO-which has been in place, I think, for over a century but which has had effective conventions really only since around 1970. It is important that whatever is achieved in the Uruguay Round is properly integrated with the work of those bodies and that competing bodies are not established. Although this legislation may not be of great interest to all members of the Australian Parliament, it is important legislationin terms of giving us, as a country, an opportunity to develop international markets for our high technology inventions and other copyright materials. Some of these areas are areas of very substantial export potential for Australia, and if we support a sensible international regime for intellectual property rights. that will only make it easier for us to build up our place in the international marketplace. This legislation, therefore, will play an important part in ensuring that that proper international regime can come into place. If we were not to have effective legislation in our own country, we could hardly go to the international community and argue that other countries should provide adequate protection for intellectual property.",45
109,Mr CREAN,APPROPRIATION,"in reply-There are a number of points that were raised in the debate to which I want to refer and about which I want to inform the House. The first point is that the Patents Bill is representative of an exhaustive period of consultation concerning the form in which the Bill should come before the House, and I think it is for that reason that there is little objection to what the Bill proposes to do. However, a number of points have been raised in the contributions from honourable members from the other side which I want to deal with. The first concerns the patent term which the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) alluded to; the second addresses the issue of the patenting of life forms; the third concerns the request from the honourable member for Forrest for me to reaffirm that those with an interest will be kept fully informed as the regulations are developed; and, finally, the point made by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in his lengthy, informative and basically supportive role concerning the issue being dealt with in the international forums and, particularly, in the context of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round. . The Bill includes provisions for patent terms which were included in the Patents Act 1952 and which were introduced by amendments late last year. The new provisions leave the basic term for standard patents at .16 years but enable four-year extensions in the case of pharmaceutical products for human use. Interest groups, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, are still pressing for a basic 20-year term .. The Government's decision on the patent term was made after an extensive process of consultation in this area, in particular. In terms of the current negotiations in the GATT round concerning trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, Australia advocates a minimum term of 15 years from the date of filing the patent application. There is no current worldwide opinion on patent term, particularly for pharmalife ceuticals. From our point of view, 20 years seems to be emerging as the preferred term in developed countries, often with extensions being available for pharmafirst ceuticals or other products or processes. Some developing countries have no patas ent laws. Some countries which have such laws exclude pharmaceuticals from patbacterium. entability. Existing government policy could be reviewed when agreement has in 1976. been reached in the GATT and in other international forums, such as the World Intellectual Property - Organisation (WIPO), which the honourable member ment for Mayo mentioned, because, amongst other things, they are considering the term of the"" patent at the moment. I simply make the point that our decision in reiafully tion to the term was taken in full knowlveloped. edge of what is happening internationally and after exhaustive consultation. The second point is the question of the patenting of life forms. Whilst this aspect is not opposed by the Opposition, it is important to remind the House that the Act has, for many years, allowed the enting of life forms. Whilst we have cepted the amendment by Senator Harradine, in the other place, apart from Senator Harradine's amendment the Bill represents no change in policy in relation to the patentability of life forms. Effecmembers tively, Senator Harradine's amendment means that human beings and the biologstitute ical processes for their generation not be patentable inventions. As I say, we have taken the view that it is important to continue the practice that has existed for a very long time of allowing the enting of life forms, subject to that qualiCollins fication and amendment to which I have just alluded. The reason for our doing that is that is impossible to foresee what inventions there will be in the future. Flexibility required. Patent laws need to have that inherent flexibility to cope with the changing technology. In our view, a patfor ents Act which is not flexible enough to deal with the unforeseen would not serve the inventors, the public or the GovernLtd. ment. The Patents Act which was passed in 1952 did not prohibit the patenting of forms; nor did it discriminate between biological and other technologies. The Patents Act 1903, the first Commonwealth Act in this area, was similar. The Australian patent for an invention involving a living organism was granted far back as 1921; this was for a tuberculosis vaccine containing a tuberculosis The first Australian claims for micro-organisms themselves were allowed The third point is that the honourable member for Forrest asked the Governto assure the House, in similar terms to an assurance given by Senator Tate in the other place, that those in this House who have an interest in this will be kept informed as the regulations are deI am happy to reaffirm Senator Tate's undertaking and to extend it to this House. We are looking at how best this can be done. It may be of interest to the House that first drafts of the regulations are"" now becoming available from the drafters. These will be considered in the first instance by the working group on the patstreamlining of patent laws which the acGovernment agreed that the Commissioner of Patents should convene to assist in the preparation of the Patents Bill. That working group comprises, apart from of the Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Offices, representatives of the Inof Patent Attorneys of Australia would and the Law Council of Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the very significant contributions made by the representatives of pateach of those organisations, Mr Terry and Mr Keith Leslie of the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia and  it of the Law Council. We are grateful for their contributions to date and thank them is for their continuing interest and assistance. It is also appropriate to thank the Industrial Property Advisory Committee its work reflected in this Bill, and particularly its former Chairman, Mr John Stonier, of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. In fact, Mr Stonier has been Chairman of this body for some 10 years. The final point I want to make reference to is in response to comments made by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) in relation to the international coverage. The Australian Government, through the patents office, is very active in the international negotiations, both in the World Intellectual Property Organisation and in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in particular in the Uruguay Round. As the honourable member for Mayo pointed out in relation to this curiously named TRIPS, the trade related aspects of intellectual property, from the Government's point of view this has been and is a significant commitment. , In fact, the Commissioner of Patents is in Geneva at this very moment, along with officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department, undertaking the TRIPS negotiations on behalf of Australia. I should add that this involvement is somewhat higher key than may have been inferred from the honourable member for Mayo's remarks, and I can assure the House that we have been and 'will continue to take a very active interest in area. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Crean) read a third time. NA (FOREIGN,INCOME) BILL 1990 [COGNATE BILL: TAXATION (INTEREST ON NONRESIDENT TRUST DISTRIBUTIONS) its BILL 1990] Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 September, on motion by Mr Crean: That the Bill be now read a second time.",50
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Order! I understand that it is wish of the House to debate this order the day concurrently with order of the No.5. There being no objection, that course will be followed.",52
111,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The first point to make about the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill and the Taxation (Interest on Non-Resident Trust Distributions) Bill being debated cognately is that a further new concept is to be introduced into our taxation system. This legislation will share that distinction with the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax in the Australian context. However, accrual systems, although new in Australia, do exist in other countries. A justification for these Bills seems to be a need to counter the perceived practice of Australians deriving income through non-resident companies based in low tax jurisdictions. Historically, Australian tax has not been payable until after profits of the type to become affected were paid by way of dividends or other income to Australian shareholders. Unlike domestically generated taxable income, the types of in,come now to be targeted will be taxed regardless of whether the income this has actually been received. The perception is that, because such dividends were infrequently or rarely paid, the revenue has been unfairly deprived. The objective of the new accruals system seems to ensure that foreign income be and capital gains received, or deemed earned, by Australians through foreign companies are taxed at the rate of at least 25 per cent. The exception'will be income derived by foreign companies satisfying the active income exemption provisions. So it will transpire that generally, if this income is not taxed at the rate of 25 per cent in an overseas jurisdiction, the accruals system will be activated to tax profat Australian rates, with credits being allowed if certain taxes are paid overseas. A matter of great concern, for reasons that I will discuss later, is the effective starting date of 1 July this year. The accruals or attribution concept, being new, is far from straightforward. Attempting to it is fraught with problems; the but it should be attempted as both the of second reading speech by the Minister for day Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) and the weighty documentation accompanying the measure leave something to be desired. It seems to boil down to something like this: whenever an Australian resident has a share in a foreign company, the accruals concept has the potential to have applior cation to that person. It will not. apply where the Australian shareholder and associates own less than 10 per cent of a foreign company; this is known as a portlian able investment; nor will it apply where the foreign company is not a controlled foreign corporation. Basically, a CFC is foreign company controlled by Australian residents. It will not apply in most inof stances where the active income exempbeing very broad. tion has application; nor will it apply where the active income exemption has been failed but there is active income nevertheless. Gerierally, active income a CFC will not be attributable income. Finally, application of the accruals sysing tem will not apply in most instances where the foreign company is resident in a listed comparable tax country such as the United States of America or the United Kingtems dom. The most common exception to this exclusion is income. derived in the comcountries parable tax country from a designated concession. Only one of the exclusions just mentioned need have application to ensure that there is not an accruals assess-. ment or attribution of income. to an tralian resident shareholder. The system is designed to take into account income which flows from one foreign company to another. Examples are CFCs deriving income from non-CFCs and vice versa CFCs based in comparabie tax countries deriving income from foreign companies and branches based in non-listed jurisdictween tions and vice versa. Basically, a foreign company will be CFC if it is controlled by Australian dents. Control is defined for the purposes of the accruals system. A foreign company will be deemed a controlled foreign corunless poration if it is controlled by five or fewer Australian residents either alone or gether with associates. This is said to a matter of fact to be determined accordis ing to the circumstances of each case. The second control test is based on the assumption that a single Australian resident whose interest in the foreign company is 40 per cent or more will control the company. This assumption is rebuttable if it can be shown that the foreign company is controlled by another entity group of entities, whether Australian or otherwise, not associated with the 40 his per cent or more shareholder. Both the direct and indirect interests of the Austraresident are, I understand, taken into account. The direct and indirect interests of associates of Australian residents are a also taken into account. It should be noted that associates are not limited to residents Australia, the definition of 'associate' The measurement of control occurs at the end of the non-resident company's of accounting year. This measurement requires a complicated-to the point of being unfathomable for most-aggregatof the direct and indirect interests of both the Australian resident and the associates. Listed countries are those which the Government considers have tax sysand rates generally comparable with our own. Not surprisingly, non-listed' are not listed. Although there is tax a presumption that the accruals system will apply to companies resident in nonlisted countries, there are exceptions to this rule, the most important being the Ausactive income exemption. Other exceptions are income derived in a branch in a listed country and taxed at comparable rates in that country; income already taxed in Australia, including franked dividends; and and certain dividend receipts. The relevance of the distinction belisted countries and non-listed c-untries includes prima facie income deri ved by CF<=:s resident in listed countries a which will not be subject to the accrual resisystem. Conversely, income derived by CFCs resident in a non-listed country is prima facie subject to the accrual system, the active income exempti.on applies; and a dividend derived by an Austotralian company from a company, whether be or not a CFC resident in a listed country, exempt income.. This exemption will apply only where. the dividend is from a non-portfolio investment-that is, the Australian company has a voting interest of at least 10 per cent. 'Designated tax concessions' is a colloquial term given to certain concessions granted by listed countries within their own taxation system, which the Australian Government will not allow to escape the net of the Australian revenue. The correct term as per the draft regulations is 'designated concession income' being profits from certain tax concessions. The tax concessions in listed countries' jurisdictions which are unacceptable to the Australian Government have been dealt with in two ways involving a general description of the types of income and capital gains, which are either not taxed or are taxed at a reduced rate, and a specific reference to a certain country and a precise description of the offending concession. Briefly, if a listed company does not tax income or a capital gain at a rate of at least 25 per cent, there is an extremely high probability that it will be designated concession income. Whether it is then subject to attribution will be determined by the nature of the income or capital gain. If active, it will not be subject to attribution. Inclusion of the active income exemption provisions was a significant concession won by business after the proposed introduction of an accrual system was first announced way back in 1988. Initially, the exemption was only to apply on an entity basis. However, after further submissions from the business community the concept has been expanded to exempt all active income. 'Active income' is effectively defined, but by default. Basically, active income is any income which is not tainted income. As might be expected, 'tainted income' is extensively defined. I quote from page 7 of the introductionÂ· to the explanatory memorandum of the draft Bill: Tainted income includes the types of income that are readily susceptible to being shifted to foreign tax jurisdictions. In very broad terms, tainted income will consist of passive income (e.g. dividends, interest, royalties and most kinds of gains on the disposal of assets) and business income from transactions with related parties and Australian residents. Of most concern is the inclusion of business income from transactions with related parties and Australian residents. For instance, there is tainted sales income which refers to the goods which are purchased from or sold to an associate in turn having a relevant connection with Australia. Profits made from sales will be excluded from tainted sales income in two situations, the first where the goods are created or produced by the company and the second where the character of the goods is substantially changed by the company. Packaging is not considered to change substantially the character of goods. Tainted services income includes income derived from the provision of services to an associate of the company, to a resident of Australia or in connection with a branch in Australia. Th- performance of technical, managerial, engineering, ar-. chitectural, scientific, industrial, transport, commercial agency or other professional or similar work would generally qualify as services. There are three main requirements for the passing of the active income test. The first stipulates that a CFC must have a permanent establishment in its country of residence; then the CFC must have kept accounts and complied with substantiation requirements in respect of those accounts prepared in accordance with commercially accepted accounting principles; and finally, the CFC's tainted income must be less than 5 per cent of its total income. If a CFC passes the stated tests with the exception of certain trust income, none of its income will be subject to attribution. An area of much concern again, given the wide definition of 'tainted income' is that many commercially active operations will not satisfy the active income exemption test. This will be despite legitimate attempts to establish overseas operations. For example, many countries offer the facility of a free trade zone. Such zones are ideally suited for packaging and distribution activities because of the availability of labour at a cheaper rate than in Australia. The nature of a packaged product may not allow for any further activity to be carried out in Australia. So, by definition, the profits generated from such activity will not be active income. Such a tight definition of tainted income effectively defeats the so-called political reason for the inclusion of the active income exemption-and that is to enable Australians to compete effectively in low tax jurisdictions. Given that a CFC fails the active income exemption, it is not necessarily the case that all of its income will be subject to attribution. Basically, however, its active income will be excluded from attribution. With two major exceptions, the existing system will continue to apply to dividends received by Australian residents from foreign companies. One exception arises where a dividend received by an Australian resident company from a foreign company-whether or not a CFC-resident in a listed country is exempt income where the investment in the foreign company is a non-portfolio investment. A non-portfolio investment, as I think I might have indicated earlier, is where the Australian company has a voting interest of at least 10 per cent. A second exemption occurs when a dividend is received by an Australian resident from the income of a CFC that has been attributed to the taxpayer under the accrual system. There is a complex system of recording the information to enable this exemption to be calculated. The treatment of foreign branches of Australian companies has been modified to bring them into line with the treatment of foreign companies. Basically, the profits of a resident company derived in carrying on a business at or through a permanent establishment located in a listed company will be exempt income with effect from 1 July 1990. As might be expected, any such profits which have not been taxed by a listed company will not be exempt income. This might occur where the income or profits have benefited from a designated tax concession. Having said all that, it is at best only a brief summary of the proposed amendments which intend to tax foreign source income. The legislation is voluminous, complex and detailed. Given the introduction of self-assessment for companies and other taxpayers, the ability to recognise a situation where there is attributable income becomes essential. In reality the administration required to comply with the provisions is prohibitive. Compliance and administration requirements will act as a major disincentive for Australians to become involved in a CFC. This comes at a time when many Australian businesses are seeking to expand their operations into overseas markets. Inevitably. they will become involved with the accrual system, even if it is only to determine whether the active income exemption has some application. This in itself is no easy task. It should also be noted that not included in this outline of the Bills are the intricate rules relating to overseas trusts or to the practical problems of complying with the legislation and the associated calculations required. Furthermore, the associated issues of tax sparing, the operation of the foreign tax credit system, and international tax treaties are beyond the scope of this discussion. Whatever the merits of what is intended, this legislation has had an agonising ""gestation period. It was first foreshadowed way back in 1988 and was revived in April 1989. A draft Bill became available last December. Consultations ensued, with many suggestions to either simplify the measures proposed or remove the disincentives which militate against Australians doing business overseas. Another draft Bill followed, available in late. June, and the amended version is now before the House. Involving as it does a further 236 pages of amendments to the principal Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. 416 pages of explanatory memorandum, press statements announcing new and conflicting details and the Minister's second reading speech. it is hardly surprising that the main Bill is neither brief nor in an understandable form. Much of the hyperbole and propaganda reported in the financial press from April 1989 until now also left a great deal to be desired. The terms of the Bill itself and press briefings of one kind or another are and were intended to mislead and paint a rosy picture of what will be achieved. There is more than a suggestion that considerable thought and effort has gone into manipulating public perceptions. Take as an example the references to tax havens in virtually every newspaper article prior to and since that initial announcement. Those references blatantly insinuated to all but the very well informed that the measures proposed are mainly aimed at income derived by Australians from business channelled through notorious tax havens. But it will not just be income through tax havens which will be caught in this net; it will go far, far wider. In many cases it will not even be income in any accepted sense of the word 'income' which will be taxed. In many cases we will assess and collect taxes from entities and individuals which and who have not received the income taxed and might not receive it for months or even years, if ever. Then there is the description in the Bill of certain income as tainted. The use of the term 'tainted income' ranks alongside 'tax haven' as terminology intended to appeal to the emotions rather than to logic or reason. The simple truth is that a new category of taxable income is to be created, and that in normal parlance is hardly tainted income. That adjective is most inappropriate and connotes illegality and even criminality when used as it is to describe income. A major sticking point is that the legislation is to have effect from 1 July, while it is still here before the Parliament. Our concern is compounded by the certain knowledge that compliance costs will be considerable, as well as the fact that a reasonable degree of knowledge about the Bill's provisions was not possible before introduction only a month ago. The Minister's claim in his second reading speech when he said that the Bill is essentially the same as the June draft Bill is also misleading. There are at least 18 changes and possibly more. That number of changes might be insignificant to the Minister but in a Bill of great complexity, comprising 60 or 70 clauses, those 18 changes have to be absorbed, understood and ultimately complied with. The second draft Bill was issued on only 28 June or thereabouts, as were draft regulations. Not without good reason, there is some nervousness about the proposed regulations and the near certainty that they will be varied also. With the June draft available only a few days before the proposed legislation is to have effect and with subsequent changes, both confirmed and likely, the Government will force exporters, bankers and accountants to comply with a parcel of laws which many had not even seen on 1 July. The complications and uncertainty it has created by its own legislative incompetence must be obvious, even to this Government. The Bill, having grown like topsy since the December 1989 version was issuedfrom 118 pages to 230-odd today-still fails to attract support. Admittedly, outright opposition is equally difficult to identify, but that is more the product of a sense of general futility as well as ignorance about the full implications of the measures than any implied support for the Bill. One particularly offensive aspect of the proposed legislation surrounds the intention to insert a new section 264 in the principal Act. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is to be given access to documentation held overseas that might be considered relevant for the purpose of establishing a liability or otherwise under these provisions. So far, so good. But it transpires that if the information demanded .is not made available, whether due to a failure of the potential taxpayer or because of legal restraints imposed by the country where an investment resides, the taxpayer is to be prevented from using in evidence documents not provided on demand by the ATO but which may subsequently become available in any u1timate court action. That is very heavyhanded stuff. Apart from the potential to deny natural justice to taxpayers it goes to the very heart of the separation of government, in this case represented by its agency, the ATO, from the institution that is our system of law courts. There remain other matters of concern which a lack of time will prevent my canvassing today. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following matters. There is to be common treatment of banks with other enterprises. This is to come about despite separate domestic laws for banks and a whole host of case law. There is a decided lack of commercial reality in the requirements as they will affect the banking industry. Also, there is no assurance that double taxation generally will not or cannot occur. Then there are the control and attribution tests for those Australian shareholders and trust beneficiaries who may be unaware of control by other Australian residents. There is also the prospect of this legislation inhibiting genuine enterprise. Such an outcome, at a time when the Government's economic mismanagement has caused immense national indebtedness and massive balance of payments deficits, would again demonstrate this regime's foolhardiness. The irony is that while the measures are aimed at reducing tax avoidance, a consequential effect will be to discourage export earning enterprise. There is much about the legislation which gives cause for serious disquiet, but because the concept has been around for some years, consultations with business have taken place and there has been an absence of outright opposition to the provisions, the coalition will not oppose the legislation. While the Government deserves to be hoist on its own petard, un-' fortunately it is likely that the revenue and all Australians will be the ultimate losers once again.",52
112,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"At the outset I congratulate the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) on his clear and detailed elaboration of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill and the Taxation (Interest on l'-onÂ­ Resident Trust Distributions) Bill during the first two-thirds of his contribution. I have to say, however, that the views he expressed during the latter third of his contribution, in which he drew attention to some problems with the legislation for those on his side of the House, are not necessarily shared by those on this side of the House. I guess we can cut through a lot of the discussion by simply saying that one of the principal aims of this legislation is to deal with the problem of tax havens. The honourable member for Curtin believes that that is an emotive term that does not necessarily describe what the basic aims of the Bill are. I dispute that statement. I suggest to him that the closing off of a tax loopholeand very many parts of corporate Australia have in the past used tax havens for their own advantage, thus denying a fair share of revenue to the people of Australia-is one reason why this legislation must be supported. I will go to some of those matters in a short time. The history of this legislation has been rather lengthy, but it has been so by necessity. The draft Bill was put forward in April 1989-coincidentally, at the same time as the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration was carrying out its investigation into the subject of international profit shifting and was concentrating a great deal of its efforts on looking at the use of tax havens by corporate Australia. In fact, our Committee report was tabled in May 1989. Of course, I will be drawing substantially on some of the information contained in that report in my contribution tonight. The initial draft of the Bill came forward in December 1989 and an exposure draft in June 1989. This says something about the Government's preparedness to go to the business community and to tax practitioners and seek their input into what the legislation was seeking to do. Unfortunately, a consequence of this was that the size of the legislation has grown, but I think that is part and parcel of the Government's endeavours to tighten up the loopholes which became evident as one got into this very intricate and detailed part of the tax Act. It is the next step in cracking down on tax evasion and avoidance on behalf of this Government. In fact, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and New Zealand have similar regimes to this taxing of foreign source income on an accruals basis which is, after all, at the centrepiece of this islation. The legislation, as was explained in the second reading speech of the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean), will introduce an accruals system of taxing foreign source income that has been deri ved in low-tax countries by Australian controlled entities and has been accumulated offshore, avoiding Australian tax. Exemption proposals in the Bill will also simplify the existing foreign tax credit system and the Bill will generally have effect from the 1990-91 income year. That is what the Bill seeks to do. What have people said over a period about the problem of tax havens? It is quite interesting to note some comments with regard to tax havens and tax planning-which is a very nice euphemism used by those in the business, the lawyers, accountants and so on, for tax haven usage, minimising tax or avoiding tax. It is very interesting to look at what some of these people have said. In a very authoritative examination of the use of tax havens in the Business Review Weekly of 9 June 1989, under the heading 'Treasure hunt-Tax-haven companies duck for cover', it is interesting to look at some of the comments made by people in an article by Ali Cromie. This comment illustrates the matter quite nicely: Tax lawyer Lawrence Magid. from Allen Allen & Hemsley. says: ""I think it would be a little surprising to find any major multinational company that has never had an occasion to use a company not incorporated in low tax jurisdictions. I think that essentially shows the major problem for Australia. The difficulty was that this was a - ay that l11ultinationals and Australian companies could manipulate their tax affairs by going offshore into tax havens, minimising, therefore, the tax they paid in Australia, and the burden was then flowing, as usual, to the pay as you earn taxpayers in this country. Other noted commentators in the area of taxation have made similar sorts of comments. One which interested me greatly was a comment attributed to a noted Melbourne tax adviser and lawyer, leg- Mr Mark Leibler. Mr Leibler, of course, is one not unknown to our Committee. During the course of our investigation he saw fit to make some rather disparaging remarks about what we had undertaken to do and what we were finding out. It is quite interesting that back in the late 1970s and early 1980s Mr Leibler was propounding the use of tax havens and giving suggestions on how to set up the sorts of schemes which have been the subject of investigation. He has obviously had a change of heart. While he was setting them up for some of his clients back in the 1970s and 1980s, he now says, as reported in an article in the Age quite recently: I wouldn't write that sort of article today . . . which he was doing at the time, in setting up these sorts of schemesI freely admit that my attitude to the whole issue of tax minimisation has changed. I guess, if you go back several years, I would have had no qualms on advising on artificial means of tax avoidance, even though it was completely legal and above board. How tax avoidance can be legal is beyond me. He continued: Today I don't believe I would. That is a very interesting comment from a noted tax adviser in Melbourne. During the course of the Committee's inquiry that I referred to earlier, he had quite a bit to say about what we were seeking to find out. For example, I quote from a press release that he put out: The Parliamentary Inquiry into international profit shifting is a 'blatantly vindictive smear campaign' targeted at some of Australia's largest and most reputable business organisations. He also went on to describe the work we were doing as a witch-hunt of massive proportions. Obviously, that wasÂ· a view shared by some in the media, certainly in the Australian, because. an editorial on Wednesday, 12 April 1989 stated: The Parliamentary I-quiry into the Bond Corporation's tax affairs is developing an unattractive MCCarthyist tone. The witch-hunt against Bond is another tation of the arrogant tendency of the Government to issue vague generalities about how it might change the law if taxpayers do not watch out. What absolute nonsense; and it has been proven that that is the case. I have referred to the fact that the House of Representatives Standing Comporations mittee on Finance and Public Administrasity tion went to this. very issue. In May 1989 it tabled in this Parliament a unanof imously supported report called Tax Payers or Tax Players?-a report and added efficiency audit of the Australian Taxation Office on the subject of international profit shifting. The report went very clearly number of issues. It talked about, for ample, the types of tax havens and their main characteristics. It will not hurt to run through some those for honourable members in this place. I refer honourable members to 46 and 47 of that document and following pages. It identified the existence of four major sorts of tax havens which will be canvassed in this legislation: first, counof tries which impose virtually no taxes, as the Bahamas, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Nauru and Vanuatu-tax paramade dises; secondly, countries which impose taxes but at a relatively low rate, such the British Virgin Islands and the Neththrough erlands Antilles; thirdly, countries which tax income from domestic sources but empt all income from foreign sources, such held there. as Hong Kong, Liechtenstein and Panama, which are called tax shelters; and, finally, countries which allow special tax privileges, such as Luxembourg and the Netherlands, known as tax resorts-a very nice term. These tax havens have a number of characteristics. Generally no taxes or low taxes are imposed on certain types of come and capital receipts and there is banking and commercial secrecy, . lack exchange controls, lack of double tax treanual ties and agreements and so on. In other words, often two or three sets of books are held in Australia and the foreign countries which are tax havens, and people cannot get at them. During the course of our investig-tion manifesour Committee looked at this issue by taking up a suggestion by Mr John Elliott of Elders IXL at the time and examining the public documents of a number of major corporations in Australia. We followed an analysis which was done for the Committee as a submission during the course of our inquiry by the Transnational CorResearch Project of the Univerof Sydney. It was done by Mr Greg of Crough, who analysed the annual reports over 100 of Australia's top companies. Our Committee did the same thing. We up the contribution to group profits by a number of Australia's major corporations to see how effective that was. I to a refer honourable members to page 63 of exthe report Tax Payers or Tax Players, which sets out for 1988 the top 15 companies in Australia that made good use of of tax havens. They include News Corporation, $387.9m; Bond Corporation Ltd, pages $285.3m; Pioneer $187.1m; and Elders IXL $1 00.2m. On and on it goes. It was a simple process. We went to the annual reports, to the section at the back the financial statements which list all such the subsidiary companies. We added up those that made a profit and those that a loss, and saw what came out at the end of the day. As I said, there was as the information. When we traced it to some of the companies that were involved, there were exchanges and exlOsses and money was moved offshore and As we know, the Four Corners program in early 1989 exposed just how the use of tax havens was bleeding the tax revenue of this country of dollars which more properly resided here. The Cook Islands and many others were exposed in that. Given the importance of this legislaintion, I thought perhaps we should take that analysis a step further. It was easy of enough in 1988 to take some of the anreports of some of Australia's major companies and trace through the use of tax havens. I wondered what had happened since that date, since the report was published and since we analysed the information. Is it possible that these good corporate citizens which in the past have said that they were only doing legitimate business in many of these overseas tax havens have changed their minds? Are they still operating there in the full knowledge that legislation being put into this Parliament would stop that use? Company name News Corporation . . . . . . TNT Limited. . . . . . . .

113,Mr MARTIN,TNT LIMITED,"Other people will have the opportunity to look at these when Hansard is I?rinte-. I will just menti-n f-ur compames wh.lCh were - n th- major hst that our CommIttee exammed m 1989 when we tabled our report. News Corporation's contribution to group profit in 1990 was $334.1m from use of companies and subsidiaries in tax havens. In 1989 it was $369.6. The comparable figures for TNT Ltd were $89.8m in 1990 and $81.7m in 1989. Unfortunately, the Bond Contribution to Group Profits Place of Incorporation 1990 1989 Hong Kong (I) Hong Kong (I) Hong Kong (35) Cook Islands 6459 Jersey (2) Jersey 6234 Hong Kong 990 Hong Kong 13 Cook Islands 9,363 Cook Islands (5) Cook Islands 13,790 Jersey 3 Cayman Island (2643) Cook Islands (10,641) 196,467 Table 5 NA Contribution to Group Profits Place of Incorporation 1990 1989 ('000) ('000) Cayman Islands (10) Bermuda (33) Hong Kong 61 Hong Kong 505 Hong Kong (1379) Hong Kong (2) Hong Kong (48) Hong Kong 1191 Hong Kong (237) Hong Kong 22,748 Hong Kong (55) Hong Kong (47) Hong Kong 709 Hong Kong 847 Netherlands Antilles (2680) Singapore (62) 21,508 Limited Annual Report 1989 Corporation Holdings Ltd 1990 annual report is not out-for understandable reasons, one suspects. In 1989 $196.5m was contributed to Bond Corporation's group profits from tax haven subsidiaries. The figure for Pioneer International Ltd was $21 5m .. As I said, these tables go right to the heart of the question. They identify places of incorporation of many of these companies and subsidiaries in tax havens. We see the same old names-Hong Kong, Netherlands Antilles, Bermuda, Cayman Islands. On and on it goes. Guernsey gets a guernsey in there as well. For example, News Publishers Ltd made $267.5m in Bermuda. That is a lot of newspapers being printed in Bermuda. In the case of the TNT group $64m was made in Hong Kong through one of its subsidiaries. There are two pages for the sorts of tax havens the Bond Corporation used. PerUnfortunately, haps what has happened to Bond might look give an illustration as to why he should have been more interested in Australia than the Cook Islands and some other have liked. places. Notwithstanding that, the majority of his major tax haven profits retained overseas were in the Cook Islands. In refuture. lation to the sorts of places Pioneer Intercle national used, again the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Hong Kong, Netherlands is interesting Antilles and Singapore loom very large. As we have seen, the legislation before this Parliament chooses to incorporate schedule a list of countries for the poses of the Bill-that is, countries which have tax regimes similar to Australia's. In corporate countries on the list one is assumed to be paying fair and reasonable tax. But none Tax of the tax haven countries are on the ques, schedule that came out with the draft legopportunities islation. That itself raises a bit of a probnies lem for us; it simply means we will tax the people back here. That goes to a couple of points made danger in the contribution by the honourable advantage member for Curtin. He was concerned, for example, about the question of access to overseas documents from the Tax Oflooking fice. One of the main reasons the Tax Office has not been able to get on to fair and reasonable share from Australian corporations using tax haven's is that those countries have secrecy. In 1988 in Brisbane at Expo, Vanuatu states: was advertising itself as the premier tax haven of the South Pacific. It was out brochures telling people to go to Vanuatu and set up tax havens while all the other countries at Expo were trying to encourage tourism. People are entitled their own view as to what would been benefit their country. The honourable member for Curtin could not understand why banks should be treated the same. Again I simply refer him to the analysis done in 1989 by our Committee, and by Mr Greg Crough, of Australia's top 100 companies. He will see that the banks loom very large in tax havens. The Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd loomed as one of the top 15 in the analysis that we did in 1988. time did not allow me to at the contribution to group profit of all the other companies located in tax havens in the amount of detail I should But what about problems for the future? There are some problems for the Again I go to the Ali Cromie artiin the Business Review Weekly, 'Treasure Hunt', that I quoted a little earlier. It to see the attitude that some people display to successive governments' attempts to crack down on the use of by illegal or tax avoidance or evasion measpurures. On page 70, this article said: Already the new accruals tax proposal, like all tax laws in Australia; is being scrutinised by some of the best brains in the country. lawyer John King, a partner in one of Australia's biggest legal firms, Mallesons Stephen Jasays:""We have seen some possible planning and steps that Australian compashould take ahead of its introduction to minimise any adverse consequences."" King will not elaborate. ""I know this sounds very cute, but if we go public on all these things, there is a we get seen as encouraging people to take of technical provisions, which is not how we see our role,"" he says. In other words, some people are out there at legislation, even before it is in this House and passed, and suggesting its ways that people can walk around it. Again, I go to the very last paragraph of this article on page 72 of the Business Review Weekly of 9 June 1989, which And a Melbourne QC is convinced that tax putting planning cannot be stopped. Tax planning: the old euphemism is back again. It does not attribute the quote; it to is just 'a Melbourne QC'. It continues: There is no more chance of closing that down than closing brothels', he says. Is that not an indictment of the attitude that some people out there might haveresponsibilities. tax lawyers, tax accountants-as to what the Government legitimately is attemptwhat ing to do with legislation to deal issues associated with tax evasion, tax avoidance, tax minimisation? The legislation before the Parliament has been needed for some time. I pay tribute to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) introducing the legislation for public ment when he did, for putting it out the marketplace to get people to put their imprimatur on it and to give their comments to the Government about what urer needed to be changed. But what I abhor is people out there in the marketplacespeech: tax lawyers, tax accountants and so onwho are supposedly giving advice to their For constituents on ways in which legislation controlled can be walked around. Is it any wonder that the Australian Taxation Office runs into problems with its resources if, as soon as it devotes sources to fixing up one part of the legisnance lation, smarties out there try to work ways to walk around it? This legislation, its technical completeness and so on, will There go all the way to ensuring that Australian companies that used tax havens in the and past will meet their obligations in the fuare ture and we will see some teal benefits to and the tax system in this country.",63
114,Mr WILSON,PIONEER INTERNATIONAL LIMITED,"1 was interested to hear what the honourable The member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) had adopted to say. This is an important piece of legis islation. In his remarks he identified much of the problem but he did not really assess the adequacy of the solution put forward by the Government. Yet I know that he taxation burden. has a very real concern to ensure that right solutions are found. Any government that has a tax system that imposes different levels of tax different activities, on different types income, on different classes of individuwas as, is setting up a situation where people will adjust their personal and business tivities to ensure that those activities are tax effective. I do not believe it is right and proper to sweep into the one basket those who minimise their tax and those who at the other extreme evade their legal The difficult area is when we come to is euphemistically described as tax with avoidance-something worse than minimisation but not so bad as evasion. This legislation was designed to overcome what was thought to be a legal tax minimisation-tax avoidance arrangement. The Taxfor ation Office acknowledged that the law comwas insufficient and, therefore, has now in brought to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) a proposal that it be changed in this way. When the Minister Assisting the Treas(Mr Crean) was introducing this legislation, he said in his second reading the great majority of Australians, those who do not have investments in offshore trusts and foreign companies, this legislation will have no direct impact. In this statement the Minister missed the point of the report of the House of Repreresentatives Standing Committee on Fiand Public Administration, which out said in its report in May 1989 entitled Tax Players or Tax Payers: is a need to restore balance with regard to taxation. It is not between the corporate sector the individual but rather between those who able to organise their affairs to be tax effective those who cannot or choose not to so organise their affairs. The Committee went on to say: methods (of international profit shifting) have in general been legal. The Committee is not in a position to say otherwise, but what called into question is the impact that such methods have on the share of taxation burden. The Committee concludes that tax havens have provided the opportunity for a shifting of the the They have shifted that burden between various groups of individuals within the Australian community in a way which, on under the law that this Government has of continued to support now for seven years, quite legal. The purpose of the tax reforms contained in this legislation acshould not be seen merely as a mechanism for collecting more revenue; it should be seen as a means of ensuring that the burden of taxation is more equitably distributed amongst Australian taxpayers. As the. Committee said in its report, 'companies and, indeed, partnerships and individuals who because of the availability of or accessibility to tax havens are able to minimise their tax, place a greater burden on others'. In seeking to solve the problem of a fair tax on income earned in foreign countries, this new law temporarily exempts from Australian tax income earned in a listed country until that money is repatriated to Australia. A country will be listed if it is considered to have a taxation system similar to our own, even though the taxation rates may be different. If the income is earned in a country that is not listed but rather is a country considered by 9ur Tax Office to be a tax haven, then the income will be taxed under an accrual system. This means that tax will be payable on foreign sourced passive income earned by residents of Australia as it is earned, regardless of whether it is repatriated to Australia. I do not believe that the accruals tax system will achieve the taxation equity sought by this Bill-at least to the extent desired. My preference, and the recommendation of the Committee on Finance and Public Administration, was for the introduction of a system of functional analysis involving an examination of the extent to which Australia is the source of income. I will come back to that in a few moments. It used to be the case that Australian residents were exempt from tax in Australia on their foreign sourced income provided that that income was taxed overseas, even if the income was subject to only a nominal rate of tax. Since 198687 this bias, which encouraged Australians to invest in tax havens, has been partially removed. From that year investors have been subjected to Australian tax when foreign sourced income, subjected to tax in its source country, is remitted to Australia. A credit for any foreign tax paid is offset against the Australian tax liability. In spite of these changes in the law, the tax system remains biased in favour of those who delay or avoid remitting foreign sourced income to Australia. The legislation now before the House will reduce this remaining bias but it will not remove it altogether. It will make Australian controlled entities liable to tax on foreign sourced income as it accrues in low tax countries. These entities will no longer be able to defer liability for Australian tax until, if ever, it is repatriated to Australia. The income of a company not resident in Australia but controlled by Australian residents will be attributed to Australian residents unless either the company is subject to a tax system comparable to the Australian tax system or the company is predominantly engaged in active business in a country which does not have a comparable tax system. I personally question that exemption, and I will deal with it a little later on in my address. This Bill attributes income of non-resident trusts in low tax countries to Australian residents-to those who have directly or indirectly transferred property or income to the trust. It is interesting to note that a deemed rate of return based on the value of the property and income transferred to offshore trusts is included in the assessable income of the transferor if the trust's income cannot be established according to Australian tax law. Furthermore, attributable income of a trust included in the assessable income of the transferor will be exempt from tax in the hands of the beneficiary. In this regard, one wonders why the franked-unfranked income approach is not used to ensure that the tax paid is at a rate not less than the corporate rate or at the highest marginal rate, if appropriate. This is what happens to the distributed income of Australian businesses operated through companies. We should assess this legislation against the background of the concepts and principles on which the Australian tax system should be based. My view is that that is the weakness of this legislation. It seeks to patch up a hole in the tax system. It does not do so by looking at the fundamentals upon which that tax system should be based. My view is that our approach should be, firstly, that there should be a uniform systym of taxing companies, trusts and partnerships; secondly, that Australian residents should be taxed on income from all sources, both within Australia and around the world; thirdly, that non-residents should be taxed on income which is sourced in Australia; fourthly, that all income from whatever activity it is derived should be subject to the same rate or rates of tax, whether it is the income of residents or foreigners; fifthly, that the ultimate aim should be for a flat rate of tax which is payable by all natural persons, whether resident in Australia or not; and, sixthly, that any variations, whether in accordance with activity or the resident status of the taxpayer, from a stepped or flat rate structure, should be provided for by explicit purpose-based tax rebates. Such an approach would reduce tax minimisation and avoidance now engaged in by those who, according to their interests, interpose companies, trusts and partnerships, whetherÂ· onshore or offshore, between themselves and their income generating activity. This approach would also lead to a reduction in complex and convoluted drafting measures, such as this one, used to distinguish the different tax regimes now applicable to the different vehicles used for carrying on income earning and profit generating activities. A radical change to the law such as I propose would involve all trusts along with companies and partnerships being placed under an obligation to furnish annual tax returns. The traditional view was that a company-like an individual-being a separate legal entity, should be subject to tax on its profits or dividend income. This approach resulted in the double taxation of company profits declared as dividends. But since the introduction in 1987 of the tax imputation system, this double taxation has been removed to a significant extent, and the dual taxation of company profits declared as franked dividends, to which imputation credits are attached, is now abolished. The traditional view and tax treatment of trusts and partnerships has been ditferent from that of companies because trusts and partnerships have no separate legal entity distinct from their beneficiaries or partners. Tax has been levied on the beneficiaries or partners rather than the business from which the income has been derived. But in recent years there has been a change. For some time, of course, the income from certain types of trusts has been taxed to the trustee. The newer changes came about first in 1981 when corporate income and property unit trusts were made subject to the corporate tax regime. Then in 1985 the Treasurer's draft White Paper on taxation recognised that tax avoidance and minimisation could be countered by taxing trusts and partnerships on the same basis as companies. Why has the Government been so tardy in taking that simple approach of having a uniform tax regime governing the whole range of business activities in which Australians and foreigners investing in Australia engage? If there were that uniform taxation approach, we would not have these pages and pages, volumes and volumes, of complex legislation through which people comb in order to find yet another loophole. One day, the Australian Taxation Office and the Government will stop this bandaid treatment of tax avoidance and the minimisation loss of revenue by standing back and saying, 'Why should there be a different tax regime for a business conducted through a corporate entity from that imposed when the business is conducted by a business trust or a partnership?'. The 1985 company tax arrangements were applied to certain trading and business unit trusts, but not to those investing in property equities or securities. There remains a large number of business acti vities which should be, but which are not, taxed as companies. They include partnerships, non-trading trusts, superannuation f]lnds, family trusts and estates of deceased persons. The system of dividend imputation goes a long way towards avoiding the double taxation of corporate income. This system could similarly be used to avoid the double taxation of the income of trusts and partnerships if they were brought in under the one taxation net. The tax avoidance measures which have been introduced into the tax Act have more impact upon corporations than they do upon trusts. Because of that, there is yet another loophole if one's business is conducted through a trust. The measures to stop tax avoidance by companies that do not apply to trusts are debt creation involving non-residents; the legislation relating to the denial of deductability to share-based financing arrangements; and the provisions that require, in the case of companies, interest on non-arm's length overseas borrowings such as are dealt with in legislation dealing with thin capitalisation. There are no thin capitalisation requirements in relation to partnerships or trusts. In addition, companies are prevented from dividend streaming, but trusts and partnerships are not so prevented. So there is room for tax avoidance in that way at the expense of the general body of Australian taxpayers. As long as trusts and partnerships do not come within the corporate tax regime, they can be used to circumvent these antiavoidance measures, calling into doubt the value of these measures as effective and efficient anti-avoidance devices. It is little wonder that one of the preferred vehicles of tax minimisation, tax avoidance an.d tax deferral is the trust. Selective legislation of the type contained in the Bill before the House is far less effective and more complicated than the urgently needed, more fundamental reform of the tax system. The Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration recognised this when it said in its report: Tax haven income tax schemes tend to be based on two concepts upon which Australian income tax law is structured, namely residence of the taxpayer and source of the income. A resident taxed on income regardless of source, but resident is not taxed on income unless it Australian source. Most tax haven arrangements, therefore, attempt to give a technical legal source outside of Australia and try to have that income derived by a non-resident, commonly a company or a trust. To legislate more stringently against companies is to invite tax planners to concentrate their avoidance efforts on trusts. Significant reduction of tax minimisation will best be achieved through a uniform system of taxing companies, trusts and partnerships. The key to any proposal for establishing a uniform tax treatment of companies, trusts and partnerships is to ensure that the chosen vehicle for carrying on taxable activity is tax neutral to the natural persons who ultimately benefit from its activity. This can only be achieved if the primary rate of tax payable by the entity chosen as the vehicle for the taxable activity is the same as and coincides with the highest marginal rate of tax payable by natural persons. In the case of Australian residents receiving taxable income sourced overseas, double taxation should be avoided by allowing tax credit for tax paid in the country in which the income is sourced, subject to the condition that reciprocal tax credit provisions have been entered into between Australia and the country from which the income is sourced. To the extent that we wish to lessen the tax burden on Australian residents in respect of income derived in foreign countries, we should do so by explicit tax rebates, so that it is clear to all Australian taxpayers that that group that happens to be in a position to invest in Hong Kong or some developing country with a low tax regime is getting the benefit of a tax rate lower than that it would have had if it had invested that same money in Australia. The current tax regime on income earned by Australians investing in tax havens is a form of hidden subsidisation. Why should we exempt from Australian taxes an Australian who wants to invest in a country with low income tax as long as that person remains an Australian resis ident? If as a nation we want to encourage a noninvestment in a foreign country, people has an should be encouraged by identifiable, measurable and quantifiable grants and subsidies. Just as the conceptual basis of the Australian tax system imposes tax on the income of Australian residents from whatever source they derive that income, so too should it impose tax on the income foreign investors derive from Australian sources. In the case of tax payable by foreigners on income sourced in Australia, firstly the tax should be at a uniform rate, whether the income is in the form of interest, dividend or any other form; and, secondly, any reduction in that rate, whether it benefits the investor or, as is oftentimes the case, the Treasury of the country of residence of the investor, should be provided by explicit rebate, subject to appropriate reciprocal arrangements which benefit rather than disadvantage Australia and which benefit Australian taxpayers rather than the taxpayers of the foreign country benefiting from our low taxation on income earned by foreigners investing in Australia. I would have liked the opportunity to have discussed for a moment the basis upon which our tax treaties are entered into, but I will take another opportunity to do so.",65
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PIONEER INTERNATIONAL LIMITED,Mr Nehl)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,69
116,Unknown,PIONEER INTERNATIONAL LIMITED,Sitting suspended from 6.32 to 8 p.m.,69
117,Mr ELLIOTT,PIONEER INTERNATIONAL LIMITED,"It gives me pleasure to be able to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill and the Taxation (Interest on Non-Resident Trust Distributions) Bill. Prior to the dinner suspension the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) referred to what they saw as limitations of this legislation-items such as the date of effect, the complexity of the law, the need to establish the spirit and the letter of taxation law and to separate, the distinction between avoidance and evasion. They indicated that this legislation, in their view, falls short of meeting those objectives. In my view, complexity of the law would be no justification for allowing people not to meet their effective tax liability, irrepractice. spective of its form. Clearly it is important, particularly when dealing with issues such as overcoming the proliferation of tax havens which are used to minimise and avoid tax, for the Government to act, irrespective of the complexity that may be involved, to make people pay their proper tax instalments. The point made about the need for the spirit and the letter of the law to be established is simple and if that were done it would mean that lawyers and accountants who specialist< in these fields would no longer see the need to try to devise schemes to minimise tax-Mr Braithwaite-Professional accountants.",69
118,Mr ELLIOTT,PIONEER INTERNATIONAL LIMITED,".1 suggest it is very hard to envisage a situation where we will effectively stop lawyers and accountants from overcoming the laws we establish; overturning the legislative process has become an art form for some of them. This legislation is important because for far too long some people have taken the opportunity to invest overseas and have been able to take advantage of loopholes in our taxation system either to minimise or to avoid meeting their fair share of taxation commitments. This has meant that the burden of taxation revenue in this country has been left with ordinary Australians, wage and salary earners who are taxed on the basis of pay as you earn. They are the honest taxpayers. The average wage and salary earners who actually constitute the majority of Australians have been forced to pick up the tab for those ingenious enough-particularly, as the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) mentioned, some of the multinational corporations-to have employed clever but, I would suggest, unprincipled lawyers, accountants and tax agents who have been able to help them filter their income to overseas tax havens. This legislation will go a long way towards ending the free ride which has been had by Australian residents who could afford to invest overseas and who took the opportunity to do so. I believe it is right that we should seek to eliminate that Every Australian, no matter how rich or poor, should contribute, according to his ability to pay, to the running costs of the Government for the services which he, and all of us, utilise. The consequences to the Australian economy of untaxed foreign source income cannot be underestimated. The equity of the tax system was previously distorted because the same amount of income was taxed at different levels, depending on the ability of taxpayers to source their income in low tax - r tax haven countries which charged nomlllal taxes. Therefore a resident taxpayer with an Australian source income such as .wages, would, on the same quantum of lllcome, pay more tax than a resident receiving trust income from a nonresident trust. Furthermore, the exemption resulted in a loss of revenue to the Australian Treasury, directly as well as indirectly. The indirect loss of revenue was attributable to the tax avoidance and minimisation which the exemptions promoted by actually encouraging people to invest overseas instead of in Australia. The Government has introduced this legislation in an attempt to make the system more f-ir for. all. By introducing measures WhICh will successfully eliminate the tax evasion and avoidance scams which have existed for so long, the Government is effectively broadening the tax base. This process, which has led to the debate in th- chamber tonight, has followed extensIve consultation with the industry as well. I suggest that this action stands in contrast to our opponents' plans for a consumption tax and their plan to scrap the capital - ains tax retrospectively, as has been mentIOned. The Government believes that the broadening of the tax base is the essential ingredient in the reform of the taxation system which the Hawke Government is undertaking. The Bills before the House are another positive step in that direction. The taxation system needed a coordinated approach in all areas of tax policy and the Government's record in these areas shows it has met that challenge. One has o-ly to look at the initiatives shown by thIS Government in certain areas-the capital gains tax; the reduction of the top company tax rate from 49c to 39cÂ· dividend imputation, which was talked' about earlier tonight and which was an initiative from this side of the House; reductions in the margins of the personal income tax rate; the extension of the provisional income tax sy-tem; and the fringe benefits tax-to realIse that the Government is committed to restructuring the Australian economy through the integration of its social justice strategy and the tax system. I think it should also be highlighted that at the forefront of the Government's agenda in tax policy is the commitment t- n;take a more equitable society by allevlatlllg the burden of the average Australian. . A down payment on that commItment was delivered in this year's Budget, which provided tax cuts of $1.25 billion, effectively a tax cut of $7.75 a week for the average worker. In speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill I now turn to the foreign tax credit 'system (FTCS). Under the law as it existed before the Hawke Government introduced the foreign tax credit system, Australian residents were exempt from tax in Australia on f?reign source income provided that the lllcome was taxed overseas even if that .rate of income was subject to only a nomlllal rate of tax. The FTCS was introdyced in 1986-87 pending the introductIOn of the accrual system in an attempt to remove the bias which inadvertently encouraged Australians to invest overseas. T-e system. provides that foreign income will be subject to Australian tax when it i- remitted to Australia, with credit being gIven for any foreign tax that was paid. . The Taxation Laws Amendment (ForeIgn Income) Bill provides for the introduction of an accrual system. A series of amendments to the FTCS have been introduced. wit.h the intention of simplifying !he applIcatIon and therefore increasing ItS overall effectiveness. The effectiveness of t.he foreign tax credit system, in eliminatlllg the propensity for tax minimisation in foreign tax havens, will also be enhanced by the introduction of the contr-l of.foreign companies provision which thIS BIll seeks to implement but I will deal with that issue later in - y remarks. The direct changes to the FTCS take the form of e?,emptions and I would like to highlight some of the major initiatives in this area. Firstly, dividends received by resident companies from companies resident in listed countdes will be exempt from Australian income tax where the Australian company has a voting interest of at least 10 per cent in the fQreign company. Secondly, a non-portfolio dividend received by a resident company from a company resident in an unlisted country will be exempt where the dividend is paid out of profits arising out of the exempted receipts. A non-portfolio dividend is a dividend received from an investment involving evading interest of 10 per cent or more. Thirdly, the foreign tax credit system will be modified to exempt from income tax the income or profits of a resident company derived in carrying on business at or through a permanent establishment located in a listed country under certain conditions. Fourthly, the basis of granting credit foreign tax paid in respect of each class of income will be modified. The classes of income are interest income, income from offshore banking, and other income. The interest class of income will be replaced by what is referred to as passive income. Fifthly, provision will be made for foreign tax credits which cannot be utilised in any income year to be carried forward and applied against tax payable on any foreign income of the same class that is derived in the subsequent five years of income. Sixthly, under the existing foreign tax credit system, a foreign loss incurred by a taxpayer can be offset only against foreign income of the same class and the same source. Amendments proposed in this Bill remove this restriction. The introduction of the foreign tax credit system in 1986-87 was only the first step in remedying the deficiencies that existed in the Australian tax system arising out of the treatment of foreign source income prior to its introduction. The draft White Paper in 1985 on taxation reform recognised that an FTCS alone would not solve the problem of the incentives in the tax system to accumulate profits in companies and trusts in tax havens. In order to illustrate this point it should be noted that the foreign tax credit system could not expose profits retained in companies and trusts established in tax havens to the Australian tax system. Such companies and trusts, although controlled by Australian residents, are separate, non-resident entities for income tax purposes. The income of these entities is exposed to Australian tax only when it is derived by Australian residents. Such derivation of income takes place when a non-resident trust makes a distribution of income to a beneficiary resident in Australia. Thus the income of such controlled companies and trusts would remain outside the reach of the Australian tax system until repatriation to Australia. This could be deferred indefinitely as generally they are controlled' companies or discretionary trusts. This legislation before the House seeks to eliminate those holes in the system net through the introduction of the accruals system of taxing Australian controlled infor vestments in offshore trusts and controlled foreign companies. The honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) spoke on that matter at length this afternoon. The fundamental thrust of these measures revolves around the principles of fairness and equity. The success of a nation's tax system depends on its fair and equitable treatment of all people. This legislation is an important down payment by a government in ensuring a credible and just tax regime. Last year's parliamentary reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration entitled Shifting the Tax Burden and Tax Payers or .Tax Players adequately demonstrated the need for the Government to act on this important area of public policy. The Committee made recommendations dealing with issues such as preventing taxpayers from double-dipping in the area of the expenses incurred before .the introduction of the foreign tax credit scheme. The Committee was also concerned about the role of the banking industry in relation to tax havens and it sought international cooperation to effectively eliminate tax havens. . The Committee's recommendations, as the recent Four Corners program highlighted, addressed the urgent need for our Government to act decisively to overcome the financial loss to the nation. It is worth noting that tPe House of Representatives Committee reached the following conclusions: first, that Australian revenue had been reduced by the operation of the tax havens; secondly, it was not possible to provide an estimate of the loss; and, thirdly, the quantification exercise being undertaken at that time by the Australian Taxation Office was proving to be of significant value. It is clear to me that the Committee was right. It is also cle-r that the Government needed to introduce this legislation to ensure that the grossly unprincipled corporate behaviour behind the proliferation of tax havens was prevented. The average taxpayer in my electorate will not willingly stand by while corporate high flyers devise artificial international corporate arrangements to avoid meeting their proper tax liabilities. This legislation is very significant in ensuring that we establish and stabilise an effective legal framework for the public of Australia to again have confidence in the morality of corporate Australia. The Government's decisions to add to the professional resources of the Australian Taxation Office and, more recently, the emphasis on the effective development of the Australian Securities Commission are key initiatives in sUPl:iort of our objectives, in that they ensure that corporate Australia conducts itself with standards that accord with the principles of a fair go and equity for all, which has always been the hallmark of the Australian culture. I am pleased that this legislation accords with these social justice objectives and I am very pleased to support these measures which will mean that the highly questionable techniques used by the corporate opportunists are closed off for good. Average honest taxpayers have no sympathy for these corporate activities as they know, as everyone does, that the collective tax burden is reduced if everybody meets their valid, legal and correct taxation liabilities. I turn now to the introduction of the controlled foreign companies provision. The active business income of controlled foreign companies will not be attributed to Australian residents. The measures in this Bill provide for the attribution of income, other than active business income which is not subject to tax in a system comparable to Australia's. For this purpose, the Bill introduces a Part X to the assessment Act. The main elements of that Part X are as follows. First, a foreign company will be a controlled foreign company if, at a particular time, five or fewer Australian residents own or are entitled to acquire 50 per cent or more of the interests of the company. Secondly, the accruals measures are to apply in relation to controlled foreign companies resident in a non-listed country. They will also apply in relation to a company resident in a listed country where the company derives benefits from a designated tax concession or from an income source outside the country of residence that is not taxed in a listed country, or other certain categories of trust income. Thirdly, if a controlled foreign company passes an active income test, some or all of its income or gains will not be attributed to Australian resident shareholders. One of these requirements is that the CFC's tainted income must be less than 5 per cent of its total income. Fourthly, detailed rules are set out in the Bill for calculating the attributable income of the controlled foreign company separately. for each attributable taxpayer. The income to be taken into account in the calculation of attributable income will be different for a controlled foreign company resident in a listed country from that of a CFC in an unlisted country. It will also be dependent on whether the CFC passes the active income test. A de minimis exemption applies where the attributable income of a CFC in a listed country comprises income that is subject to a designated concession in that country. Where the exemption applies, the designated concession income will be excluded from the attributable income of the CFC. The exemption will apply if the gross turnover of the CFC is less than $1 m and the sum of the designated concession income and other attributable income does not exceed 5 per cent of the gross turnover, or if the gross turnover of the CFC is more than $1 m and the sum of the designated concession income and other attributable income is $50,000 or less. The purpose of the Bill is also to introduce the accruals system of taxing Australian controlled investments in offshore trusts. The thrust of the non-resident trusts provision is to include in the assessable income of a resident transferor of property and services to a non-resident trust the attributable income of the non-resident trust with effect from, and including, the transferor's 1990-91 income year. These measures will apply to both direct and indirect transfers to non-resident trusts. The attributable income of a nonresident trust is subject to certain reductions: firstly, in the case of a trust that is not a resident of a listed country, the whole of the net income of the trust; and secondly, in the case of a trust that is a resident of a listed country, so much of the net income of a trust that benefits from a designated tax concession in that country. The transferor tax measures will not apply to certain family arrangements that are subject to certain other conditions. These include a non-resident family trust where the trust is a post-marital trust or a family relief trust. Perhaps most importantly, an incentive has been provided to wind up non-resident discretionary trusts that were in existence on 12 April 1989 and before 30 June 1991. It takes the form of a rebate on tax so that the rate of Australian tax on trust distributions made after 12 April 1989 and before 30 June 1991 does not exceed 10 per cent. The Taxation (Interest on Non-Resident Trust Distributions) Bill 1990 will formally impose the above mentioned interest charge. Another important provision in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990 relates to offshore information notices. A new section will be inserted into the assessment Act under which information or documents may be requested by the Commissioner of Taxation where the Commissioner has reason to believe that they are held outside Australia and are relevant to the assessment of a taxpayer. Where that notice is not complied with, the information or documents may not be used by the taxpayer in evidence to dispute the assessment. The likely direct revenue gain resulting from the introduction of the accruals system of taxing foreign source income is difficult to predict. This is particularly so in the initial years because of the variation in controlled foreign companies' accounting periods and the taxpayer's years of income. It is not known to what extent non-resident discretionary trusts will take advantage of the 10 per cent final tax liability by winding up before 30 June 1991. It is not known to what extent the domestic tax base will increase as a result of these measures. While the revenue gains in 1990-91 are not expected to be significant, it is anticipated that the revenue will increase to within the range of $60m to$70m in 1993-94 after the full impact of these measures takes effect. In concluding my remarks, I would like to say that this Bill contains further evidence of our Government's commitment to making the tax system fair and just for all by closing off the loopholes which have been available to only a limited number of people. The Government is showing its commitment to a broadening of the tax base, with the end result being a lessening of the taxation burden for average Australians.",69
119,Mr GRACE,PIONEER INTERNATIONAL LIMITED,"Since the election policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in 1984, this Government has set in place the most dynamic overhaul of Commonwealth taxation policy since Federation. Despite the noisy protestations from the privileged majority and their champions amongst the ranks of the conservatives, the Labor Government has succeeded in its efforts to fundamentally reshape and reinvigorate Australia's taxation system; that is, to undo the taxation damage of 23 years of Liberal stewardship which led to this country entering the 1980s with a tax system which was antiquated, economically counterproductive and totally out of step with the needs and aspirations of the vast majority of Australian people. Worse, we had a taxation system which was heavily biased in favour of the wealthy and those who could afford to join in the many tax avoidance schemes that flourished. Who does not remember the early 1980s as the shameful period when taxation avoidance was the fastest growing industry in this country, a time when asset stripping became an art form and the small business people and the pay as you earnÂ· workers picked up the tab for the smarties who did not have to work because they had a tax system working for. them? As I said in a speech in the House last week, Labor has understood, where the Liberals have not, that the tax system needed to be looked at far more comprehensively than as just the means to raise finance. The Government has recognised that the tax system can work to support economic growth and stability provided it encourages investment and initiatives and possesses an appropriate neutrality in scope. Just as the Liberal taxation policy stymied growth and investment in the dark days of the early 1980s, the Hawke Government's policies have worked in the opposite fashion in the second half of decade and into the 1990s. This Government has been successful because it has been persistent in its move to swing the existing tax bias away from the wealthy and to bring real neutrality and incentive back into the system. Mr Braithwaite-You made them all poor-that is the way you did it.",73
120,Mr GRACE,PIONEER INTERNATIONAL LIMITED,"The shadow Minister might learn something if he listens and keeps quiet. This levelling of the playing field, which those opposite would not .know much about, has been accomplished through a sizeable number of distinct and in many respects courageous policy decisions that have been coordinated and complementary, moving through the full range of tax related areas from business taxation to the banking sector cash transactions. In other words, the Government has closed off the loopholes which allowed the wealthy to minimise or avoid tax while the great majority of taxpayers picked up the tab. In the wider sense, the Government has been responsible for six major taxation reforms which have spearheaded the antitax avoidance drive and provided the foundations for a new system based on equity and the encouragement of economic growth. They have been the abolition of entertainment expenses as a business deduction, the introduction of the capital gains tax, the introduction of a tax on non-fringe benefits, the ending of the double tax on company dividends through a full imputation system, the delivery of substantial reductions in marginal tax rates, the most significant income tax cuts in the post-war period, and a foreign tax credit scheme. As honourable members will be aware, the taxation treatment of foreign sourced income has been something of a vexed question. We have all known that a great deal of tax avoidance has taken placeÂ· as a result of the channelling of business its profits through tax havens and other low tax countries by Australian controlled entities. We have also known that a comprehensive legislative remedy needed to be put in place. However, the problem has the been the sheer complexity of the matter and the necessity to balance. the closing off of this tax avoidance loophole against the genuine interests of Australian companies operating internationally. I believe that in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990 the Government has put together a workable piece of legislation which is comparable with those two requirements. Broadly speaking, the Bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so as to introduce an accruals system of taxing foreign sourced income. that has been derived in low tax countries by Australian controlled entities and has been accumulated offshore, thereby avoiding Australian tax. The .Bill also amends the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953 as a consequence of specific provisions dealing with classes of income and prosecution matters respectively. In dealing with the substance of the Bill in this regard it is perhaps appropriate for us to spend a moment or two examining the historical processes that have led to this event. Unfortunately, such an exercise may once again lead us back to the conservatives and their atrocious record in government. The regrettable fact, consistent with their policy endeavours in so many social justice areas, is that the Liberals did not even contemplate the reasonable taxation of foreign sourced income during their 23 years of continuous government. Their legacy to Australia was a foreign tax regimen under which Australian residents were exempt from tax in Australia on their foreign sourced income provided that income was taxed overseas. Of course, it did not matter that this overseas tax was often in the form of a nominal or peppercorn rate. It is little wonder, therefore, that in the dying years of the Fraser Government, with the world marketplace becoming a reality, many Australians chose to invest in overseas tax havens rather than in their own country. One will recall that even the most reputable of Australian business institutions had multimillion dollar business dealings in the most obscure places. Some of our largest banks and investment houses had branches in very exotic and perhaps questionable locations. But, then again, banks set up branches only where there is a business need. In the 1986-87 income year the Hawke Government introduced the foreign tax credit system which began the process of building a framework for the equitable treatment of foreign sourced income. Under the FTCS Australia finally had a legislative tool which would enable foreign income to be subject to Australian tax at the time of its remittance home, with a credit being allowed for tax being paid in the host country. However, the FTCS dealt with only half of the problem; it did not go to the heart of the tax avoidance possibilities which primarily exist through the diversion of foreign sourced income derived in low taxing countries into foreign companies and trusts. In other words, the income is not repatriated to Australia and therefore avoids taxation even through the scope of the FTCS. This tendency for an accumulation of foreign sourced income in overseas companies and trusts by Australian interests, and the resultant complicated round-robin transactions that seem to follow such an accumulation, have underscored the complex nature of the foreign sourced income issue. As the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister assisting the Treasurer (Mr Crean) said in his second reading speech: The tax l-akage through the use of tax havens could only be closed if a regime existed for taxing income diverted into foreign trusts and companies. In considering its options, the Government decided that the fairest and most efficient way to tax foreign sourced income would be on an accrual basis-that is, by taxing the income on an annual or 'as it accrues' basis, as opposed to waiting for the income to be realised andlor repatriated to Australia. That has been the approach of other Western governments, such as the United States, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Canada, which have put in place measures similar to those contained in the Bill under discussion. As I have said before, by necessity the Bill is somewhat complex in its scope. That has been a consequence of both the large range of avoidance methods which exist within the foreign sourced income arena, and the long consultative process which the Government has undertaken to bring the Bill to fruition. The current Bill varies in a number of respects from the consultative document which was originally released in May 1988 and, indeed, also contains some changes to the draft document which was released in December 1989. These changes have come about because of a willingness on the part of the Government to listen to genuine comment from those Australians whose operations will come within the gambit of the Bill when it comes into effect in the 1990-91 income year. At this time, I do not intend to go through the many components of the Bill which deal with such diverse matters as controlled foreign companies (CFCs), nonresident trusts, additional tax on certain trust distributions and the simplification of the FTCs; suffice to say that the main feature of the Bill is the CFC measures which aim to attribute to Australian residents, with some exceptions, certain income derived by a non-resident company that is controlled by Australian residents. The exception, of course, is where the company is subject to a tax system comparable to Australia's or is predominantly engaged in active business. The term 'active business' in the Bill refers to a mal trading business, not 'passive' style business such as dividends, interest, royalties and most kinds of gains on the disposal of assets. Passive income is the easiest to shift to a foreign tax jurisdicStates tion. A non-resident company will be a CFC where five or fewer Australian residents own, or are entitled to acquire, 50 per cent or more of the interests of the company. Alternatively, a company will be classified as a CFC if five or fewer residents have actual control of the company, regardless of their shareholdings. Under the Bill, theÂ· important test of the tax status of a company in a low-tax country will be the level of 'taintedness' of its income or gains. In other. words, even if a company is classified as a CFC, its income or gains will not be attributed if its level of 'tainted' income is below per cent-tainted income being defined as passive income and business income from Australian residents and related parties. Under such circumstances, the tax would only be attributable under the FTCs on its remittance home. If, however, the level of tainted income is above 5 per cent, then that tainted income will be attributed to the relevant Australian residents. The non-tainted income will remain nonattributable and will be taxed on its remittance to Australia. In the case of CFCs in comparable tax countries, there are still circumstances prescribed in the Bill where low-taxed come may be attributed to certain of the CFC's Australian shareholders. Generally they relate to categories of trust income and tainted income that benefits from a tax concession not consistent with Australian income tax regulations. In discussions on the scope of the I have been asked on a number of occasions how the Australian Taxation Office will be able to verify or check information supplied by the recipients or beneficiaries of overseas sourced income. I believe that this is a reasonable question which goes to the effectiveness of the legislation. The fact is that the Bill will authorise the Commissioner of Taxation to demand documentation held overseas. Should that norinformation not be forthcoming, the taxpayer in question may not then use the documents at a later time to dispute an assessment. It has been the experience in overseas countries such as the United and Canada that such an arrangement is far more effective than having legal sanctions and penalties. The end result is that a taxpayer runs the risk of receiving an assessment which is incorrect should he or she not comply with the Commissioner's directive. As the Minister for Science and Technology correctly said in his speech, the operation of this provision, 264A, will be kept under review to make sureÂ· that its objectives are met and that the interests of taxpayers are protected. After two years of consultation and research, the Government has put together 5 a Bill which will serve the interests of the vast majority of Australian taxpayers. It is a Bill which simplifies the operation of the FTCs and gives Australians with foreign assets a clear picture of their rights and obligations. Above all, it is an important Bill which reinforces the message that the Hawke Government has put out loud and clear-tax avoidance is a thing of the past. I commend the Bill to the House.",74
121,Mr SNOWDON,PIONEER INTERNATIONAL LIMITED,"Northern Territory-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (8.37)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am in the fortunate position of summing up in- this debate and I would just like to address a number of the issues which have been raised during its course. I will not take up too much of the House's time. Firstly, I acknowledge the contributions of all honourable members who have participated in the debate, including those Bill, from the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Wilson) from the Opposition but, most particularly, those from the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott)"" the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) and the honouranyone able member for Fowler (Mr Grace) from this side of the House. Indeed, many the points which have been raised by the honourable member for Fowler points that I had intended covering in some more detail in this summing up. First, I would like to comment on issue of the starting date and the question of whether this legislation has been rushed. As the honourable member for Fowler quite rightly pointed out, this legislation has been some time in coming to fruition and, indeed, a policy statement regarding the issues was made in April 1989. Extenattribution sive consultations were then held and a active business. draft Bill was issued in December of last year. Most of the detailed design features of the legislation were contained in that draft Bill. At the time, of course, the ernment announced that further work would continue on the draft, and that to the June draft and, finally, the Bill currently before the House. By the time the Bill had been introthat duced, affected taxpayers had had ample opportunity to familiarise themselves with the measures laid out in the legislation. was pointed out that there were 18 differoverseas ences between this Bill and the draft released in June 1990. A number of these changes were of an anti-avoidance nature and did not have any major impact on the substantive procountries visions of the Bill. In fact, of the changes merely corrected minor technical deficiencies and provided furtakings ther relief to taxpayers. The measures generally take effect from the 1990-91 come year. The income of a controlled foreign company will be attributed to Australian taxpayers where the company's accounting period commenced on or after 1 July 1990. It is therefore incorrect say that the Government has rushed this Bill through without providing adequate apply opportunity for a detailed analysis of legislation. Another subject which was addressed the course of the debate was the comfor plexity of the measures. I am rather dumbfounded by that criticism because would have thought it patently obvious to that the measures are necessarily complex, given the nature of the subject of with which they are dealing. They deal with a wide variety of complex business were structures and income flows. Australian taxpayers do not have to resort to these structures. For example, the where a resident company operates in a listed country and derives comparably based income the measures proposed in the Bill reduce the compliance burden. Again, an Australian company with a directly owned subsidiary in a low tax country will not generally be subject to if the subsidiary becomes an Moreover, the complexity of these measures is the result of an attempt to cover all the possible cases, something Govwhich I would have thought the Government should be applauded for. However, led it is most unlikely-as I am sure the House is aware-that any single taxpayer would have in place all of the structures are contemplated in the legislation. Another issue which has been canvassed during the course of this debate is It the effect of these changes on genuine business investments. The Bill Bill contains provisions to exempt from the attribution measures active overseas business enterprises carried on by Australian entities. Most business activities in listed will be exempted from the promore than half posed measures. The active income test is based on gross and enables a company to derive some tainted income without failing the intest. Even where the foreign company fails this test only its tainted income will be attributed to resident shareholders. A foreign subsidiary that carries on a manufacturing business will, in all likelihood, not to be subject to the attribution measures. However, the provisions will correctly where such companies indulge in the transfer pricing-which I am sure the shadow Minister for community services in and aged care, the honourable member Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), would support-or attempt to shelter large amounts I of passive income, another measure which ,. I am sure he would support. It is therefore incorrect to state that genuine business activity will be discouraged. Finally, I want to mention again the issue of the section 264A information notice, which was canvassed during the contribution of the honourable member for Fowler. Under section 264A the Commissioner of Taxation will have the power to require a taxpayer to produce relevant documents held offshore. There will be no monetary penalty for failure to produce the document but the taxpayer will instead be prevented in subsequent legal proceedings from introducing documents that paint an incomplete or inaccurate picture of the facts. The Commissioner's consent under section 264A to the admission of documents may be withheld only where introduction of these documents would be misleading. An avenue of judicial review for the Commissioner's decision has been provided. It is in the interests of equity that all relevant facts be put before a court. The only taxpayers who will be adversely affected are those who withhold relevant information and then try to have introduced into legal proceedings selected documents that present a distorted picture of the facts. Section 264A will prevent these taxpayers from playing games with the evidence produced by the courts. On the question of the effect of the legislation on tax equity, it is true that the bulk of the population would not be adversely affected by these measures. They would not face any additional tax burden. These measures are really designed to ensure that those taxpayers who could reduce their tax burden by having to resort to tax avoidance through the use of tax havens pay their fair share of tax, something which again I would have thought would have been applauded by the Opposition. J am sure the shadow Minister opposite sees the necessity for the Government to undertake this action. The Bill will produce greater equity in the tax tem than was the case when a select class of taxpayers could take unfair advantage of the system by accumulating income in tax haven entities free of Australian tax. In conclusion, this Bill puts into force very important tax equity measures. It is something which will have the broad support of the Australian community and I am sure it will be supported by the Opposition. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

122,Mr MCLACHLAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"The main purpose of the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is to extend the computer bounty until 1995 with gradually reducing rates of assistance. The Bill also proposes some minor technical amendments to the Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 sys- and the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Amendment Act 1990. The coalition does not oppose the Bill. The proposed five-year extension of the computer bounty is designed to ensure that the industry receives assistance at around the same level as the rest of manufacturing industry over this period. By 1995 the nominal bounty rate will be a quite modest 9 per cent and the cost of the scheme reduced in real terms. The Bill also removes the so-called orderly development provisions in the computer bounty scheme. We on this side of the House for many years have consistently opposed these and similar provisions in other bounty schemes, but until recently the Government has insisted that they continue-the reason for which we are not sure. These changes are therefore welcomed by the Opposition. It could be argued that computers should no longer receive any bounty assistance; after all, the scheme has been in place, like most assistance schemes, for a long time-since 1977-and costs taxpayers about $30m a year. Nevertheless, for all those disadvantages the coalition supports the extension of the scheme for three reasons. Firstly, we believe that it is essential that industry operates in an arena of certainty, a predictable environment, at least so far as this is within the Government's control. Secondly, the proposal is that the rates of assistance are to be reduced. Thirdly, despite their budgetary cost, bounties are generally a less distortionary form of assistance than either tariffs or quotas. However, while the Opposition is always ready to support the Government's efforts to reduce assistance-as has been said a number of times in this House in recent days, we have given the Government unprecedented and, up until now, largely unappreciated support iii this area; perhaps tonight we will change this precedent-there is a world of difference between the coalition's overall approach and that of the Government. I tepeat that there is not much difference, up until now at least, in our stand on protection. The Government has put in train general protection cuts for all industries, except in the passenger motor vehicles and textiles, clothing and footwear sectors which are covered by industry plans. By 1992 the average nominal rates and levels of protection will be well under 10 per cent. We agree; 'Bravo!', we say. The Government is saying that protection will continue to be reduced. Again, we agree, but we ask: By how much, to what levels, by when and with what help or assistance in the form of structural reforms? There is a lack of predictability in the Government's current stance and a great unknown, therefore, for industry. Moreover, when the current car plan expires in 1992, there is absolutely no doubt that assistance levels for that industry will be reduced. Already the Industry Commission has recommended strongly along those lines. The car industry, of course, has continually stressed the need for predictability. Yet we do not know how those falls are going to come about. The coalition, for its part, recently announced an approach to protection which is a logical extension of the Government's policies. By the year 2000 we want all industry protection to be at negligible levels. One can define that as being between o and 5 per cent. By then most of indus..: try will have had 12 years, or one-eighth of a century, to adjust to the trending down of that protection. The car industry will have had 15 years. Despite some feeble attempts by members of the Government, unfortunately including the Treasurer (Mr Keating), to make political capital out of this commitment of ours-and which I sincerely hope is not a precursor to Labor's views of how it will behave in opposition-the fact is that there is not much difference between us and the Government on the need to reduce protection as quickly as possible. On 14 May this year the Treasurer said: . . . the way to get exports up is to cut protection ... the way to make the economy more supple and responsive is to cut these large constraints which have been laying around. Notwithstanding his inability to differentiate between the words 'laying' and 'lying', the fact is that his thrust was understood. Even from him we are getting some confusing signals with his recent attacks on the coalition policy. One might ask: What level of protection does he think there should be? Where we do differ, and differ absolutely, is on the extent and pace of structural reform required. Both sides of the House agree to use the words, but in fact what we see from the Government is what we have had over the last few years: what you get is what you see, and what you see is what you get. It would be unreasonable to assume that in the area of structural reform the Government can increase the pace of that reform. Because of the Treasurer's definition of constraints laying around-or even lying around-it appears that his definitions are a lot narrower than ours. The coalition is not saying to the computer industry, the car industry, the textile industry or any other industry, 'We are going to remove your protection and then you're on your own', as the Government has been doing. We are guaranteeing a complementary, predictable and synchronised package of structural reform measures which include the following: industrial relations reform to open up a new stream of voluntary enterprise-based agreements so that employers and employees can negotiate directly on working conditions and their own future. We will introduce, in the process of that, voluntary unionism-compulsory voluntary unionism. We will have genuine competition on the waterfront and the removal of cabotage in Australian coastal waters. We will open up the telecommunications sector to full competition in conjunction with extensive privatisation. We will open up the skies of Australia to competition. We will reform the existing wholesale sales tax mess by moving to a broad based goods and services tax. I mentioned predictability. These things are going to be done-let nobody mistake it-when the coalition is in government. Together, the removal of the impediments and other things commensurate with that, including the industrial relations area I have just talked about, will reduce inflationary pressures by increasing productivity and ensuring that wages are more closely aligned to productivity, thus reducing pressure on interest rates and the currency. These measures are not peripheral to the current economic debate. They are absolutely central to it. They are absolutely crucial if we are to get away from an over-reliance on interest rates to manage the economy. That strategy, until now the Government's strategy, is at a dead end. It is at a dead end as we heard today in this House. It is about time because that single course strategy has deadened many a business and many a family. The Government has demonstrated by its own actions an incapacity to deliver genuine structural reforms. Industrial relations is off the agenda altogether for obvious reasons, and so-called reform in other key areas, such as telecommunications, is at best half-baked and based on internal political realities and not on what is right for Australia. Waterfront reform moves at a snail's pace, if it moves at all. Even the Government's own program-its admitted program-of a modest target of 30 per cent is simply not good enough by any international comparison by which we want to measure it. The New Zealanders and the United Kingdom in the last couple of years have achieved much larger productivity increases than that. Why should we aim so low? The critical message to the computer industry and all other industries is that, in supporting this legislation, the coalition is reaffirming its understanding of the need for predictable changes in assistance as well as putting the industry on notice that reductions will continue beyond 1995. If one does the mathematics one will arri ve very quickly to the point that by the year 2000 this progress gets us to a negligible rate and fits exa,ctly into the coalition's policies of a negligible rate of assistance by that year and a predictable process by which we get there. We are guaranteeing, therefore, to fix uP those man-made, home-grown, institutional impediments that which are outside industry's control. As Sir Mark Oliphant said after Chernobyl, anything made by man will eventually break down. The pressures of circumstance will make these impediments break down, but it is not happening now. We have strikes, we have wage claims, we have claims that go beyond the levels and the measures of productivity. It is not surprising that in the current economic climate, however, pressures are increasing for new forms of government intervention, with the Government unable to deliver these much needed structural reforms; thus it is vulnerable to quick fix solutions. I think it is worth going back and remembering that tariffs were quick fix solutions. They were all quick fix, short term remedies, some of which have been around for decade after decade. In those days they were solutions to high labour costs, to some fear about lack of defence capabilities, or to whatever was the current problem of the time, and they were robustly supported by many employers, by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) or its predecessors and, in many cases, by primary industry until the mid1970s and the early 1980s, when we grew up. Thus the line being pushed by the Australian Manufacturing Council, the ACTU and some other industry bodies for positive assistance must be rejected for all the reasons that protection has been universally rejected-universally rejected at least as a concept, if not in practice. I fear, however, that an increasingly desperate Government, left with nowhere to go because of its special relationship with the ACTU, will turn to further snake oil remedies. Already the Government has demonstrated one of those with its decision to give a $36m hand-out to Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd. If it does turn to those remedies, it will not get any support from the Opposition, and the industry should bear this in mind. It will, however, get support from this side of the House with regard to, for example, capitalisation grants, some of which have been used in recent times, where they are used to wean people from the government bottle. That is a well-used carrot and a good principle. But industry itself knows that it has far more to gain from our approach than it has at present from the Government, and it is starting to say so. Mr Ivan Deveson, the Managing Director of Nissan Australia, said yesterday that the local car industry would grind to a halt if present industry troubles continue. He said that crippling industrial disputes, government taxes, tariff and other cost pressures had created an industry that was uncompetitive internationally. He said: The armchair economists and bureaucrats wonder why we cannot be as sprightly as our competitors . . . but all the disruptions, the taxes, interest rates and duties accumulate like lead poisoning. The Industry Commission, for example, estimates that transport and communications reform plus efficiency in savings in power generation and distribution would add $16 billion to the gross domestic product, create a minimum of 35,000 jobs, increase real wages by 8 per cent, and reduce the cost of living by more than six points. The manufacturing sector would then actually expand. It would not contract; it would expand. Moreover, these estimates exclude the benefits of broad based industrial relations reform, which could only add tens upon tens of billions of dollars to national income by improving productivity in every workplace in this country. As has been quoted in this place many times in the past week or two, we have examples in this country of enormous productivity increases; we do not have to go overseas to find them. The reality is that, if we continue down our current road, industry will be devastated, if it has not been already. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button), in one of his increasing moments of candour, said earlier in the week that high interest rates will without doubt reduce manufacturing capacity and hurt some of the 'good ones'. Remember that this is happening right now. His words were echoed again yesterday by Mr John Prescott of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, who said: . . . in constraining growth we have sent a great many of our better businesses to the wall and we've done very little to encourage others. The computer industry, as well as any other, knows that all the interventionist assistance programs in the world count for nought when interest rates are at over 20 per cent, inflation is double that of our trading partners and numerous key infrastructure services are inefficient and costly. The Government may be right to call for us to become the clever country, but it seems to me pretty unclever and cynical to then pursue economic policies that tear the heart out of our productive capacity and force investment and brain power offshore. And that is what is happening all over this country today. People are picking up their businesses and moving them offshore. The computer industry, a new age industry, is very mobile. If we want it to stay and flourish, we have to provide a genuinely competitive environment, and that is not happening now. The coalition does not oppose this Bill but we do urge the Government to implement the rest of the agenda needed to ensure a viable and competitive economy in the computer industry and to make it understood to the industry many years in advance-in other words, for all of industry to see, for all of industry to know, for all of industry to understand that the predictability is there and there will be no change from that position. In not opposing this Bill, we again make the plea that has been made many times in the past few weeks for the Government to address these vital areas of structural reform and put some predictability into the reduction of protection and the increase in the rate of these structural reforms.  pleased to speak in support of the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) as I am generally pleased to speak in this House about areas where governments should be encouraging Australian industry. I want to reject some of the propositions put forward by the shadow spokesman on industry matters, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), particularly in relation to the information industry. It is a tragedy when we look back and see that Australia was very much at the forefront of the computer industry due to the efforts of organisations such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, but that we were manifestly unable to take advantage of that and translate it into a viable industry. Indeed, if we have a major problem in Australia, I think it is that we have been able to come up with great research and great innovation but all too often some other country has taken advantage of it. There is a very proper role for government in industry policy. I notice that the shadow spokesman talked about the communications industry, for example. The new industry arrangements developed in late 1988, requiring participants to conform via an escalating points system to local production, research and development and exports, are working very well. The changes the Government will be making in this field, which I understand the Opposition is opposing, provide a further opportunity for that industry to get an even broader base, to earn more export dollars and to be involved in more research and development, and the consequent jobs that go with it. When we talk about industry policy we tend to get into an ideological debate. What is being done in relation to the macro-economy? Over seven years we have already cut $30 billion out of government expenditures. It is not as though we have been lax or have not done the job. Indeed, the job has been done so effectively that there is real concern now that any further cuts will start to tear at the heart of social policy, will rip the social fabric. I for one would agree with that. Let us look at the financial sector. I have always supported financial deregulation and I think it has considerable benefits. But obviously-and this is one of the reasons why we would want to have a banking inquirythe banks, by and large, whilst they are able to defend themselves against foreign licences, and very effectively, were not very well placed in terms of making the transition from rationers of money, as they were under the old system. Of course, they went to the extent that they were actually shovelling money. We have seen some corporate collapses, we have seen some of the banks hurt, and we have seen the banks declining to take their fair share of pain and wanting to pass it on to depositors. By and large, I would say that some of the expected benefits-that is, pumping money into manufacturing industry and into the services industries-have been largely unrealised. As we look into the 1990s and at industry policy, we are going to have to harness better the financial strength that the banks have in terms of their small depositors. I for one, incidentally, should like to see the banks more involved not just in putting depositors' money ou.t to loans to different companies but in being able to aggregate small investors' capital and getting a spread of investments so that some of the money goes into deposits put other money goes into equities. The banks are well placed to do that but they have largely failed to take the initiative. In terms of taking equity in companies, which has not been an Australian tradition but a tradition internationally, they are currently doing it but they are being forced to do it because of their lending policies, rather as a matter of building up and strengthening relationships with customers and being better able to assist them to grow. I believe that the Australian. banking system has a much more positive and vigorous role to play the{e. It is a question of who should lead. Should we leave it up to the banks? I believe that in opposing a banking inquiry the Opposition is basically saying, 'Well, yes, what the banks have done is within their prerogative. We will leave it at that. We should not have an inquiry'. Mr Rocher-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I fail to see what the banks have to do with this legislation, certainly in the context that the honourable member is expressing his views. They have nothing to do with this Bill.  should point out that the contribution by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), included a comment about high interest rates. He talked about assistance and the role of the Government, and it was those areas that I was addressing.",78
123,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"1 understand the honourable gentleman's statements. The debate has been wide ranging, but I would suggest to the honourable member for Chifley that he bring back his remarks to the context of the Bill.  Speaker. I am only too happy to take the benefit of your very sound and learned advice. I will wrap up by saying that obviously I support the banking inquiry. Indeed, I had quite a bit to do with it in the early days. I am happy to concede that there are areas of industry policy that I find less than successful. I should like to place before the House my deep reservations about the partnership agreements that have been negotiated. My reservation about them is that there is not an open process of monitoring. If I can be forgiven for again providing an example in communications, with a new industry arrangement Austel is required to monitor it. It hires a very reputable firm to do the aUditing, but then that auditing is made public. So we can detect who is conforming and who is not conforming. Partnerships do not have that open scrutiny, that public access, and the opportunity to close down a participating firm. It is interesting that in the information industry, in two partnerships where there was a research and development element in software, companies have now unilaterally closed down those centres. Regrettably, they are seeking to find employment for those who were hired to work in the centres, but the multinational companies have hired the best and sent them overseas. So I do have some reservations about partnerships but, by and large, I want to make the point that I very much believe that there is a role for intervention in industry policy. We have a lot of theory about industry policy. One of the things I just do not quite get a handle on is this: we hire specialist bodies to report on different sectors in the economy but they never really take a holistic approach. As the shadow Minister happily reports to the House, apparently the Opposition is quite comfortable with closing down, say, the car industry. It is true that the industry has been going since 1949. My namesake had a little to do with the development of the car industry since 1949. There have been a number of car plans, but it is said that the Button plan, which was started in 1985, has not been successful. I should have thought that if we had had an industry going for 50 years and in the past five years wanted to make a major change in direction, we would not chahge that industry around overnight. The important point is whether we are heading in the right direction. I believe we are. This is where we should contrast the contribution of the shadow Minister with my contribution. I would. come out very much in favour of the car plan and the other industry plans we have put in place. Indeed, if we do not have intervention encouraging certain industries, we will not get them. One of the points the Opposition does not understand in the broader debate about industry policy is that often domestically we need a scale of manufacture, a size of manufacture, that then allows us to go and penetrate overseas markets. Let me give two examples of that. One is a fairly current one, and that is the collaborative arrangements with the National Acoustics Laboratory. Much of the debate about that decision-yet to be announced by Cabinet-will be whether we can gather enough size in Australia through a collaborative arrangement that will allow for a growth in employment and exports. The first phone monopoly is another example, and indeed we are exporting. So there are a number of forms of assistance to industry-including bounties, offsets and partnerships. I suggest the new industry arrangements provide an even better model. But I say that there is a legitimate role for industry; that if we to be a viable and dynamic country in the 1990s and particularly into the next century, we need a manufacturing base. We just cannot be an island of primary production, minimal value added, and a little bit of service industry to boot. We do need a viable manufacturing sector. Whilst I share all the reluctance about governments picking winners, it does not detract from the point that there is a legitimate role. If we look at countries such as Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Singapore, what happens? Do they have this sort of macroeconomic serendipity theory operating where they get the macros right and businessmen run around yelling 'Serendipity' and setting up different industries? Of course not. They have quite a battery of assistance that they provide to industriesÂ· and a clear view of where they want their countries to be five, 10, 20 years from now. In Australia we want to be like these newly emerging economies-'Aren't they fantastic? Look how quickly they have turned around'-but we do not want to bite the bullet by saying that there is an appropriate role for government working in cooperation with business and the trade unIons.",83
124,Mr ROCHER,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1990 is the third bounty Bill to come before this House this year and the second to reduce the rate at which bounty payments are made to a particular industry-in this case, the computer industry. The provisions of this Bill should see bounty payments to the computer industry fall from a high of $45m last year to around $25m in 1995-96. It is fortuitous that these reductions in assistance are consistent with a move towards the abolition of these payments and other direct forms of protection by the year 2000, which is one of the coalition's stated aims for industry. Bounties are a superior form of protection to tariffs in that they at least allow Australian consumers and industry greater are access to world prices .than would be the case under a tariff regime. It is also desirable that the effective rate of assistance made available to this industry should be in line with that found in other industries in the manufacturing sector. Significant variations in assistance between industries, as we know, cause resources to be misallocated. However, I think it is important to stress the many problems with the use of bounties-problems that are implied by the proposed reduction in bounty payments contained in this legislation but which have been ignored by the Government in addressing this Bill. These problems need to be highlighted, because it is this type of targeted assistance which is the new vogue on the part of the protectionist forces in Australian manufacturing. It was targeted assistance measures which were lauded in the Australian Manufacturing Council's report, inappropriately entitled The Global Challenge, which was released earlier this year. These reductions in bounty assistance are welcome, but they nonetheless point to the prevalence of the philosophy of picking winners in this Government's industry policies, a philosophy which Australian manufacturers are only too keen to exploit. The rationale for this scheme is not just to give the computer industry a level of assistance commensurate with trends in assistance accorded other industries. According to the Government, this bounty scheme supposedly has the goal Of fostering the development of an internationally competitive computer industry while improving productivity in other industries by making high technology products more available to them. The computer bounty scheme reflects the Government's approach to industry policy, which is based on targeted assistance schemes that reflect its assessment of those industries most likely to benefit from such assistance. Targeted assistance to industry is based on at least three very tenuous presumptions. The first presumption is that the assisted industries will use these payments as opportunities for growth and innovation, and not as protective walls behind which they will seek to take shelter from competitors. The second presumption is that the industries so assisted will in turn benefit the Australian economy. Such calculations have to be carefully made. The opportunity costs of alternative uses of these bounty payments also need to be taken into account, and they so often are not. So care must be taken with the distorting effects of the taxes used to raise the funds for these bounty payments. These costs can really only be estimated, but are known to be considerable. We can only guess at the extent to which targeted industries are using assistance to take up opportunities that would otherwise be beyond their entrepreneurial, technical or financial reach. We have to be wary of the fact that these industries can equally use these payments to a greater or lesser degree as a gift, a payment, for doing what the industry was going to do anyway, though not at the expense of and risk to taxpayers. Finally, there is of course the presumption-perhaps the greatest of all-that the Government's assessment is correct and that it has indeed picked a winner and not sunk money into what might turn out to be an industry or firm with somewhat dubious prospects. We know from the Industry Commission that there are significant opportunity costs associated with assistance measures of all types and that such assistance is responsible for an overall loss of national income. At the same time, we really only have the word of the computer industry, and other recipients of bounty payments, as to the contribution bounty payments make to their own 'success above and beyond what may have occurred anyway were the industry left to its own devices. It could be that the only difference is that the industry concerned simply works less hard to achieve the same result, although clearly other outcomes are possible. In the end, we just do not know, at least not without an expensive investigation by a public authority. The Industry Commission and other bodies can help, but even they are making a lot of educated guesses. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) we heard a lot about how successful the computer industry has been in this country. I have no reason to doubt his assessment. What I do question is the extent to which bounties are responsible for this success. These bounties are said to be part of the Government's 'information industry strategy'. I pose the rhetorical question: Is there any area of policy where this Government does not claim to have a strategy, however bereft of content? We heard some impressive figures about the growth in the information technology industry, both here and overseas. Natu': rally enough, the Minister claims that bounty payments have been instrumental in the development of the computer industry and other industries in this country. His claim is supported by the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) and its program evaluation report earlier this year into the operation of this bounty scheme. In particular, it is claimed that the high level of research and development in the industry, with all its associated benefits, reflects the Government's assistance measures, although we must remember that these expenditures may also be eligible for 150 per cent tax concessions. But the BIE was unable to quantify the contribution that the bounty scheme has made to the industry and to the country. We need to be very suspicious of a report, the. methodology of which based largely on a survey of the firms the industry which are beneficiaries of these bounty payments and which obners. viously have a vested interest in their continuance. The remaining evidence propotential duced in this report on the role of bouneconomic ties in the success of the computer industry would, in a court of law, be deemed to be of the circumstantial type. As the Minister readily concedes in his speech, assessments of the contribution of bounty payments to the success of the industry call for necessarily subjective judgments. In his second reading speech the Minister stated quite clearly: It would be impossible to attribute increased usageof computer based technologiestotally to the bounty scheme . . . This is very true and raises the question as to how we can reliably attribute successful commercial enterprise of any sort to a given assistance scheme. The Minister claims that, without the bounty, the computer industry 'would be much smaller and less vibrant than it is today'. But the only evidence the Minister can put forward for this claim is the BIE's finding that growth in sales for the computer industry has been above that for the rest of the manufacturing sector. All that the BIE can add to this claim is that 'Australian industry does not appear disadvantaged in its use of equipment covered by the computer bounty'. I am sure that honourable members would agree that that is a fairly lame claim to make. The fact is that it is impossible to disaggregate the numerous factors that contribute to the relative success or failure of an industry or firm. The BIE itself noted that growing demand, rapid technological change and a weak Australian dollar, as we had not so long ago, have all been potential contributors to the observed growth in computer sales. Even if the computer industry did turn out to be much smaller, it could have been much more efficient. These considerations point to a fundawas mental flaw in the Government's apin proach to industry policy and the protectionist philosophy of picking winThe idea behind picking winners is to select an industry thought to have the for growth and for delivering the benefits associated with that growth. That industry is then bestowed with the dubious honour of being eligible for assistance. We then find the Government claiming credit for any or all of the industry's subsequent successes, however they might be measured. But we already knew, or at least hoped, that the industry was going to be more or less successful because that was the rationale for targeting it in the first place. Of course we would not want the Government to back losers-that is, hopelessly backward industries and firms which have no chance of success and for which assistance would present nothing more than a stay of execution. Why do we want to go back to so-called winners either? If they are indeed winIslatlOn ners, why on earth do they need assistareas ance? It is almost a reversal of the old protectionist philosophy that governed this country for decades, except that now we bestow government favours on those inand dustries that are already looking good the strange hope that assistance will them look better. We all know that assisttive ance is not the way to underpin success. All the theory and practice suggests that assistance corrupts successful firms. Stranger still are the bounties that have been made payable under this scheme to large successful multinational computer firms based in Australia, such as IBM. These payments are highly questionable in terms of any infant industry-type guments t-at are often used to justify this sort of assIstance. Much of this assistance is provided in the mime of increasing the level of value added production in Ausbusiness tralia. There is also a view that we should target industries with export potential. As I said before, it is by no means obvious that we are better off as a result of such assistance, whatever specific efits we might be able to identify in terms of the current account or in increased value added production. Indeed, we know that overall we are worse off as a result of protection and industry assistance measures, in terms of both lost national income and the entrepreneurial lethargy that is fostered at the level of the firm. In the end we have no way of knowing to what extent successful industries owe their success to government assistance or longer term. whether they have simply exploited market opp?rt--ities that were available way. I- IS ndl-ulous that we are supporting these mdustnes when the very criterion ror tha- assistance is the ability of those mdustnes to deliver a satisfactory perby formance. Winners simply do not need assistance if they are winners. The rationale for targeted assistance a contradictory one. The funds used in current assistance programs should be leased to the private sector so that alter1993. native resource uses can be allowed to succeed as well. The very fact that we are - edu.cing bounty payments with this legand reducing protection in other constitutes an admission that assistance i- not a source of economic benefit. So it is indeed strange for the Minister to sing. the praises of this bounty program ItS alleged benefits and yet couple this in with the admission that these payments make need to be reduced to secure a competiindustry over the longer term. Surely a frank admission of the very real problems with bounty and other forms o- assistance would be more in keeping wIth the deregulatory thrust of the times. Of course it is the coalition leading the way in this and other areas under the able leadership of the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). It is the coalition arwhich has an unambiguous commitment to the elimination of industry assistance by the year 2000. There seems to be a belief on the part of both government and that, with the right amount Of assistance, government can foster high technology industry in this country.

125,Mr NUGENT,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"-I wish anyto - omI?ent on that part of the Bounty LegIslatIOn Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990 dealing with the extension of the computer bounty. It has already been stated the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLa-hlan) that this side will not oppose the BIll. We accept the extension of the is c?mputer b?unty to 1994-95, but give nohce to the mdustry of reduced protectipn reas part of our structural reforms after I strongly support this position. I have spent the last dozen years or so very heavily involved in the computer industry in Australia as a customer, working for a multinational vendor and with an Australian systems and services house. I nave to say that the Australian computer market is amongst the most competitive in the world because everybody comes here and dumps their products in an almost literal sense, be it the Americans, the Japanese or the Europeans. The Australian market is going through a very major downturn at present. I far from convinced that the computer bounty scheme really achi-ves benefits substance for Australian industry and Australian business. I stress that word 'Australian' quite deliberately. The fact life in respect of high-tech development in Australia today is, in spite of all the rhetoric, that the share capital required finance mass market products is just within most Australian companies' capathose bilities. I well remember in the early 1980s that the well known company Texas Instruclaims ments decided to go into the personal strengthen computer (PC) market. It spent billions of dollars developing its product, building a factory and trying to market its Pc. When the company lost $180m in one quarter, it called it quits. I suggest very few companies in Australia have the wherewithal for that sort of competition. Therefore, we need to be in niche markets or in special products, not in the mass market. So I ask: why make the bounty availpolicies able on such a wide range of products? Why subsidise the multinationals? Why allow screwdriver operations to be eligisaid ble? I could go on. The Minister for Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), of needed. course, dismissed these concerns on the grounds that: There is no economic justification for such restrictions. I suggest to the House that the undeservSo-called ing will always find ways to benefit from a hand-out system, while genuine cases can be better helped by other means. me amplify. A company that I interviewed recently in Victoria is amongst those that are listed in the computer bounty scheme program evaluation report No.8 issued by the .Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) as being a consistent recipient of the bounty over the last five or six years. Frankly, I will not name the company here for fear of doing it even more damage than it has already done to itself. What is quite clear is that the computer bounty propped up this company which is now in receivership. The bounty helped encourage the am company to produce a mainly standard product range, which it did not have the of financial or other resources to compete with either in this country or overseas. The company now complains that it canof not get business (rom government or anywhere else because it is in receivership, it does not have a nationwide, let alone into ternational, support capability, its prices not are generally 5 per cent or more above of its competitors, and it has no unique product features. The computer bounty scheme report that the bounty scheme has helped the local market. In fact, all it has done in many cases-in this instance and in many others that I have come across in the last 10 or 12 years-is prop up those who should not be in the marthat ketplace at all. Worthwhile Australian high-tech companies would benefit, I suggest, far more from the availability of risk capital or lower interest rates, lower general tax rates, perhaps depreciation concessions, more consistent government and an ability to pay people their worth and not be subject to artificial accord pay deals. Above all, as has been before, transport, waterfront and Small Customs efficiency and reforms are Multinationals, of course, will always milk the system. I remind honourable members that we are not playing a game with gentlemen. Imported parts for value adding can have artificial price levels set. trans nationals-of course, they do not like to be called multinationals these days-can and do rig transfer pricLet ing mechanisms in order to qualify for bounty assistance. The bounty is simply an added incentive to play paper games in addition to avoiding taxation by shipping profits offshore. Shipping goods into this country, across the Tasman and back again-and variations on that sort of theme-can make a mockery of paperwork control. By these and other means transnationals can concoct books that qualify for bounty, even if not on the terms originally intended by government-and who is to know? No wonder there was a cheer from the industry when the extension mea-ures were announced earlier this year. The Minister makes play of the fact that the bounty is an important part of the Government's information industries strategy. The partnerships for development scheme is also an important part of that strategy. Just recently the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology had a briefing from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DIT AC) on the partnerships for development scheme, and after two years or so we are still evaluating it. There are no substantial ures at all. I was gratified to hear the  earlier express his reservations about the scheme as well. I suggest we are subordinating the interests of the local industry to those of the transnationals. Let us see some real evidence of benefits for Australia. The growth in the information industry worldwide is huge. In Australia the industry will double in the 1990s, but will this be genuine Australian growth or growth for the benefit of the multinationals-oops, I am sorry, the transnationals? What is the true cost to this country of the bounty? Surely the wider introduction of technology into Australian industry is not going to stand or fall on this bounty, which will cost a mere $37m? My goodness, Kodak cost almost as moch by itself. The bounty is often taken up by underfinanced, get in and get out quick cowboys, and I think we all want to get away from that sort of scenario. I suggest that the way to establish and maintain a worthwhile Australian information industry is by production of quality products; education and training-let us develop the skills; a support and service ethic; productivity agreements in wages and structural reformÂ· to give meaningful help to vendors; and finally-and I think very critically-there must be a willingness to look more than just a few months ahead in our planning, our thinking and our profit taking. The Minister says that the bountiable goods sector is a much better research and development performer than the manufacturing sector as a whole. Ye gods! I would hope and expect so. High tech products are often obsolete in six to 12 months. Surely the measure should be a comparison with the rest of the world's high tech companies, not Australia's beaten manufacturing sector. Our take-up of computer based technologies, such as it is, is very unlikely to be as a result of bountiable technologies. I put it to the House that a strong research and development performance is something inherent in the industry and has little to do with the bounty. Innovation and skill and the initiative of the individfigual-and not a contrived scheme-will be the bedrock of information technology in the future. I will develop this theme in the coming months in the House, but for the moment I ask: What about the administration of the bounty scheme as such? What about the companies that get the computer bounty but also receive other support under schemes such as the export market development grants scheme, the 150 per cent tax concession for the research and development scheme, and the partnerships for development scheme? We have a proliferation of schemes and of bureaucracy which does not even ensure that the benefits are getting to those to whom they were originally targeted. In accounting for the bounty, why can the Government not address the issues of differentiation of assistance and the problems of classification based on usage? The difficulties and complexities of administering bounties per se impose substantial costs on industry and the community. Of course, the argument has been put forward that bountiable technology schemes encourage more diffusion of skills and knowledge into user industry. It is quite clear from reading the BIE report that no evidence exists to substantiate this outrageous claim. From my knowledge of the industry, I can tell the House that the transfer of such personnel has nothing to do with bountiable technology as such; it is much more likely to involve career progression, better job satisfaction, or the of filthy money. The report itself admits that it would be difficult to attribute significance to any influence of the bounty in the growth being achieved by the industry, either locally or overseas. Of course, the sudden removal or significant reduction of the bounty would reduce the ability of some firms to produce and to compete. I acknowledge that, but I would suggest that those firms are merely being propped up by the bounty with little or no long term value to the Australian economy or to the industry. The computer industry, like our other industries, is suffering from our strong currency, bloated infrastructure costs, outmoded work practicesalthough they are not as bad in this industry as in some-and, believe it or not, increasing environmental constraints. In conclusion, of course computer equipment vendors. will claim that the bounty is a good thing. Of course its research and development looks like a good performer compared to the general manufacturing sector. Of course it boosts the industry a little bit. Of course we need more research and development, more high tech, more world competitiveness and more skills. But for the long term, bounties are not the way. For the future, the Australian information industry must compete on the basis of ideas, efficiency and quality. Companies must support our excellent Australian research brains and invest in the products of their ideas. The world competitive environment requires structural reforms, not bounties or protection, and we need to distinguish between the benefits to Australian companies and the benefits being handed over, for scant return, to multinational or transnational companies. The coalition will not oppose this Bill, but the information industry in this country is on notice that post 1993 there will be a different way of doing business under a coalition government.",87
126,Mr FORD,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"lf we are to subsidise an industry or an enterprise, it certainly should be in the form of a bounty. I therefore support the Bounty lure Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) to the extent of extension of the bounties to the computer industry, but with some reservations. The alternative is a tariff which, as pointed out by the honourable  been proved ineffective. From my knowledge and experience I believe that a bounty is preferable because the cost is known and can be monitored; it can be debated at Budget time as an item of budgetary expenditure. Having reluctantly accepted the concept of assistanceand bounties are the preferable form of assistance-we must be aware of the problems that could arise by providing such assistance. For example, an enterprise could arrange its affairs around the guidelines; long-term contracts could be negotiated on the benefits; even small businesses could plan several years ahead on the basis of the guidelines. This means that the bounties must be consistent, that the guidelines must be predictable and must not be changed without reference to the individual enterprises. I trust that the changes will not occur to the computer scheme without reference to the industry. Apart from the aspect of predicability, there are two features which I believe must be considered. The first is .the application of the bounty and the second is why bounties or tariffs are necessary at all. The bounties we are considering are based on value added. That is to say, we pay 25 per cent-I give this as an instance-on the value added to a product in an enterprise. This means that the less efficient enterprises will receive the greatest assistance. This can best be explained with an example. We will assume, for instance, that my colleague the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and I both have factories. We make, say, Speaker's chairs and, for the sake of the explanation, we each receive a 25 per cent bounty. Both chairs sell for $10,000 each. The honourable member for Barker makes business quality units, spending, say, $3,000 material. He is efficient and he spends $6,000 on labour. He makes a nice profit of $1,000. For his $6,000 added value would receive a $1,500 bounty. My prise is less professional, spending $1,500 on material, and it is inefficient construction by spending $10,000 on 'laclose to that. bour. My factory makes a nominal loss before a bounty. My enterprise would ceive $2,500 bounty, thus eliminating loss. On these types of figures the more efficient Barker enterprise receives $1,000 less in bounty. An alternative method calculating assistance is needed. It could be based on the article itself and on its selling price, or a similar method whereby the efficient industries receive the most favourable treatment. Have the industries receiving bounties prospered in the past? Have the individual enterprises receiving bounties prospered? My instinct tells that they have not-not when the least efficient obtain the most benefit. The second aspect concerns why a bounty is necessary. As I mentioned lier, obviously the enterprises need the support or they would disappear, being unable to compete with imports. The port is for a set period and will decrease over a set period. The whole assumption, therefore, is based on each enterprise becoming more efficient-that is, removing the initial inefficiencies. The most imporachieved. tant factors which cause inefficiency in businesses in Australia today are: taxaproposing. tion, its level and absurd complexity; flation, which is also high compared with other countries; interest rates, which also high by any standards; and industrial relations. They are the four key factors. The individual proprietor has no control over any of these factors. Therefore, bounty would be accepted on the Micawothers-from ber principle-hoping that something ter will turn up, which will change any one or all of these factors. Unless the business proprietor can tain some control over the future, the business will eventually be doomed to failure on the basis of the four factors. Only one of these factors offers immediate hope-industrial relations. It offers the proprietor some control over his on or her future. That is why micro-economic reform is so necessary. Enterprise level negotiations are necessary. We allow he our business proprietors to pick up apenterproximately a 24 per cent handionly cap-which is why I selected a bounty in example of 25 per cent earlier, which is This 24 per cent handicap which we reexpect our businesses to carry, compared my with overseas competitors, is quite easy to calculate. It consists of: superannuation at 6 per cent; payroll tax, 6 per cent-that of is 12 per cent so far-workers insurance, 5 per cent, and that totals 17 per cent; training levy, one per cent, totalling 18 per cent; loading on annual leave one per cent, making 19 per cent; long service leave, another one per cent, making 20 per cent; termination and redundancy payments, 2 per cent, bringing it to 22 me per cent; and public holidays, another 2 per cent. That is a total of 24 per cent. I am not suggesting that these be abandoned. But I am indicating that most of earour overseas competitors have a 24 per cent start on labour costs. Most do not have these add-on costs. These costs which suphave been added on by this and other governments are not related to productivity and they are a severe handicap. What has to happen over the period of the bounty is that efficiencies must be This can and must be done by enterprise bargaining, as the coalition is Bounties reflect the fact that inour industries are not competitive. They reflect the degree to which our industries are are regulated. The eight items which I mentioned amount to a 24 per cent imposition, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. They are the few that can be a measured easily. What about all of the fringe benefits tax to envibetronmental protection requirements, to penalty rates and waterfront inefficiency? The list is not endless but it runs to over at100 factors-certainly to.o many to read out and enough to dishearten the most enthusiastic business person. As I said in my opening remarks, bounties are necessary, but without genuine economic reform they will not work. I support the comments of the honourable member for Barker-reform is necessary.",90
127,Mr BEDDALL,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"in reply-I want to sum up this matter and address some of the issues, raised by honourable members today. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) has a fixation with multinational and transnational corporations- In fact, whilst it is true that some multinational and transnational corporations receive bounties, they receive bounties only on products made in Australia. Eleven of the top 20 bounty recipients are Australian indigenous companies; three of the top five bounty recipients are Australian indigenous companies. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) also made many comments that had much more to do with his philosophy of life rather than the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). I think his philosophy of life is that in a free market world everything will be all right and Australia will prosper. He does not look at the real world, and I think that those people who read his comments will see that his industrial policy really a return to the nineteenth century. The honourable member for Aston and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised issues in relation to the Bureau of Industry Economics-(BIE) study and I would like to address some of my comments to that study. The BIE concluded that the bounty has been a substantial factor in facilitating the taking of computer-based technologies and has made a positive contribution to the long term viability and international competitiveness of the Australian industry. The bountiable sector has, on average, experienced a 25 per cent growth rate per annum in value added since the bounty's inception. This compares with growth in value added for manufacturing as a whole of around 10 per ceht over the same period. This suggests that the bounty has been influential in encouraging the sector's growth. Although the sector is characteristic of a strong research and development performer, with an average research and development intensity ratio of Rand D expenditure to turnover of 9 per cent-far in excess of the manufacturing average of one per cent-the bounty has contributed to the level of Rand D expenditure within the sector, which has increased from $30m in 1985-86 to $33m in 1988-89, which is, in fact, very close to the sum paid out in bounty. The bountiable sector has proved to be an outstanding export performer. Its export propensity has averaged between 39 per cent and 51 per cent over the past four years. This is more than double the export propensity of manufacturing as a whole, which is about 21 per cent. The sector's exports increased from $66m in 1985-86 to $141m in 1988-89. The average growth in value added for the sector has been about 25 per cent per annum since the bounty's inception. The BIE has further estimated that with no bounty or other compensating assistance, bountiable products would have an effective rate of minus 10 per cent compared with 12 per cent for manufacturers generally, excluding the passenger motor vehicle and textiles, clothing and footwear industries. Such action would result in is relocating the resources away from this sector. One .of the main aims of the computer bounty is to improve the productivity and c?mpetitiveness of all industry by encouragmg the wider application of information technologies. These technologies are an increasingly important factor in the service industries in particular-that is, banking and tourism-as well up as in the manufacturing sector, computeraided design manufacture, micro-processors and control, et cetera. The Government considers, therefore, that the important industry sector should continue to receive assistance for a period of five years. The honourable member for Curtin suggested that the Government was acknowledging the failure of the bounty scheme because it was winding it down. Of course, if we continue the bounty scheme forever we are actually putting in a tariff in a different way. In this proposal we are saying that, obviously, if we give assistance to a particular industry by way of bounty, we cannot guarantee that industry that it will get that assistance forever. The bounty comes in, gives effect to the policy of assistance, when, in fact, the industry knows that in a very short space of time it will go out. What we should really be talking about is the fact that it is a very positive method of encouraging an industry to operate in a competitive arena so that it knows that in a short space of time that bounty will disappear and if it is not competitive it will fold. The Government welcomes the Opposition's support of this Bill and commends the Bill for speedy passage through this chamber. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Beddall) read a third time. NA BILL 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 September, on motion by Mr Beddall: , That the Bill be 'now read a second time.  Customs Ta'riff Amendment Bill 1990 makes quite a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act, most of which are of a housekeeping nature. It puts into effect four amendments which are the result of quite major policy decisions. I would like to run through and comment on each of these key amendments on an individual basis. The first major change which the Bill makes is to the duty for textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) articles. The new rates reflect the tender quota; rates paid for the current financial year. Duty rates vary each year according to premillms paid for quota allocation. In this, financial year, some of the rates have increased while others have fallen; but overall, the total import duty to be paid is expected to rise substantially because of an increase in the quota allocation. The expansion of the quota is part of the current textiles, clothing and footwear plan to expose the industry to competition ever so gradually. The textiles, clothing and footwear plan was introduced on 1 March 1989. It formed the central plank of the Government's strategy to encourage the textiles, clothing and footwear sector to become more competitive. The textiles, clothing and footwear sector accounts for a significant part of the Australian manufacturing sector. In 1987-88 TCF industries contributed some $3.9 billion to value added. This represented 7 per cent of total manufacturing value added. Turnover in the sector in 1987-88 was some $8.5 billion. However, levels of assistance given to TCF industries are also among the highest for all manufacturing industries. The Industry Commission estjmated that in 1987 effective assistance provided to the textiles industry was approximately three and a half times the average for all Australian manufacturing. Effective assistance for clothing and footwear is as high as nine times the average. It has further been estimated that assistance given to the TCF industries is around 168 per cent, but can go as high as 200 per cent. Because of these high levels of assistance, Australians are paying 67 per cent more for clothes, 63 per cent more for shoes, and 25 per cent more for textiles than if there were no barriers to trade. In 1989 the cost of all this to consumers was estimated to be $1. 7 billion. This equates to $300 per family per year. According to the Industry Commission, the value of assistance given directly to TCF industries is approximately $1 billion per annum. As I mentioned earlier, the current TCF plan came into effect on 1 March 1989. It is scheduled to run until June 1995. The objectives of the plan are to encourage industries to become more efficient and internationally competitive, to inspire greater innovation and export orientation, and to reduce industry dependency on community support. In doing this, the plan contains various measures to help the industry restructure. It very gradually removes quotas with the aim of having a tariff only system and it progressively reduces bounty rates. But what has been the success of the plan? The state of industry report released by the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority-tabled in Parliament today-indicated that the last 12 months have been hard for the industry. In spite of all of the assistance given by the Government in 1988-89 record numbers of plant closures, liquidations, receiverships and retrenchments still occurred. This may be indicative of the large number of inefficient TCF industries which were in operation and the impact which even the slight reduction has had. The report says that some industry restructuring has been undertaken. But it also points out that the pace of restructuring has been far too slow. If the TCF industries are to become more competitive and more responsive to changing markets then this program must be accelerated. It is interesting to note that the Authority, through this report, directed some heavy criticism toward the Government. In particular, it criticised the Government's high interest rate policy and the effect that this has had in holding the Australian dollar artificially high. It went on to criticise the Government's lack of commitment to micro-economic reform. It said: Governments can and must contribute to industry restructuring and revitalisation through tinued emphasis on the provision of infrastructure support in such areas as research and development. training and education and the more responsive regulatory environment. Tariff quotas currently apply to the majority of clothing and footwear products and to some textiles imported into Australia. The quotas are expressed in volume terms and limit the number of items which may be imported at base rates of duty in anyone year. Currently, two types of quota operate. They are allocated base quota and tender quota. Originally, all import entitlements were offered as base quota which were allocated free of charge to importers on the basis of the previous volumes imported. In recent years an increasing share of quota entitlement has been allocated for sale by tender. The tender quota is sold on an ad hoc basis and to the highest bidder. It is interesting to note that recent tender auctions for the 1991-92 financial year attracted very low prices, reflecting a poorer market outlook. Consequently, duty rates for next year could be considerably lower than this year's level. The increase in tender quota allocations proposed in this Bill is consistent with the TCF plan to remove tariff quotas and to lower assistance to TCF industries. In increasing the tender quota allocation, more competition is being introduced to Australian industries, encouraging them to be more efficient and productive. The volume of quota offered by tender will increase annually as the amount of free base quota is phased out. By 1992 all quota will be allocated by tender. The amount of quota to be allocated will also be increased annually, as part of the TCF plan, to remove all quantitative barriers by that time. The coalition has no great problem with the TCF plan. Indeed, we believe that protection is a massive burden on both the community and the industry. This burden is particularly imposing at the moment, given our current economic situation. Protection encourages resource misallocation, the development of inward looking industries and aÂ· lack of dynamism and innovation. Consequently, the con- coalition is supportive of any initiative which reduces this burden and which encourages competitiveness. However, it is also our view that the plan is too slow in implementing the changes. We believe that the plan should be accelerated so that all quotas are abolished by 1993. We also consider that tariffs could start to be phased down in 1993-well ahead of the TCF plan schedule. Our aim would be to reduce the tariffs applying t6 the textile, clothing and footwear sectors down to the manufacturing sector norm by the year 2000. But let me say that we would undertake these reductions in tariffs in conjunction with major mjcro-economic reform. This would include reforming the industrial relations system, eliminating inefficiencies in transport, cleaning up the waterfront and opening up the telecommunications sector. In doing this we will be tackling the major problems faced by business of low productivity, high inflation, high interest rates and an artificially high currency. As a result, business will have a natural competitive advantage and the need for protection will be almost negligible. The second change made by the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is to revoke the exemption which all government departments have in regard to customs duty. As a result, departments will now be liable for the full cost of duty on all goods imported. However, it should be noted that because of constitutional limitations, departments will actually pay an administrative fee equal to the amount of customs duty. The Government's decision to revoke the exemption was announced in the August Budget and is effective from 1 August this year. I do not have any problems with this amendment as it has been coalition policy for quite some time. Currently, government business enterprises and the private sector must pay duty on all goods imported while government departments are exempt. However, government departments are supposed to apply a notional duty when evaluating tenders from overseas companies and comparing them with those of domestic firms tendering. In practice, this does not always happen. Consequently, domestic firms suffer a disadvantage as the imported goods are considerably cheaper. It is generally the overseas firm which wins a contract as a result of this discrepancy. It may be said that in doing this, the government departments themselves are adding to our balance of payments problems. This amendment will ensure that Australian and international companies are treated equally. With government departments liable for a fee equivalent to the appropriate customs duty, Australian firms will be able to compete on a more equal footing. Indeed, this amendment could be even seen as. a subtle 'Buy Australian' campaign. This amendment also ensures that government departments, government business enterprises and the private sector firms operate in the same way, in the same market place and according to the same conditions. There is no reason why government departments should operate according to different rules from the private sector, nor should they receive special benefits. It is important to note that the imposition on the government departments of a fee equal to the amount of customs duty will not be an additional expense for them and, therefore, impact on their budgetary outcome. It will in fact be budget neutral, as the Department of Finance will be reimbursing all the departments for the administrative fee out laid. This arrangement will remain in place for three years, after which departments will be allocated additional funding based on average duty paid per year over the previous three years. When the Government's proposal was first floated, it intended imposing the equivalent customs duty on everything imported after 1 October 1990. However, this had some significant implications for the Department of Defence and, inparticular, its high cost submarine and frigate projects. Under existing rules, any raw material or components imported by contractors that are to be used as inputs in the production or manufacture of further goods that will ultimately become the property of the Commonwealth of Australia are exempt from duty. In a welcome move, the Government altered this proposal so that the duty will only apply to new contracts made after 1 October. Consequently, projects like the Collins submarine and the ANZAC frigate contracts will still be delivered on budget. The Department of Defence is concerned about the additional administrative costs involved in classifying imported goods into customs tariff categories. Given that over 100,000 defence-related items are imported, this administrative cost is expected to be of the order of $3m. Defence is also concerned about the impact of the amendment on our trade negotiations with other countries and the development of defence equipment export markets. None of the countries from which we buy defence equipment, such as the United Kingdom, the United States or North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries, imposes duties on defence-related items. There is some concern that they may brand this as protectionist. This could lead to reprisals, possibly affecting export opportunities for Australian defence items at a time when the defence equipment market has become difficult to penetrate. But, in spite of these very legitimate concerns, the underlying principle of this amendment is correct. There is no reason why government departments should be treated any differently from the private sector firms. The next change made by this Bill is the treatment of ride-on lawn-mowers. The Bill changes the duty for diesel powered ride-on lawn-mowers which fall within the tariff sub-category heading of 8701.90.1. It addresses anomalies between the treatment of agricultural tractors-cum-mowers and lawn-mowers which fall into different tariff categories. The amendment is the result of a recommendation made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on the mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries. The new tariff will be zero and is effective seven days after the Bill receives royal assent. The final amendment proposed by this Bill is the tariff treatment of lightweight wool fabrics. On 1 March 1989, lightweight wool fabrics will be allowed to be imported duty free. This is also a welcome move from the Opposition's point of view. The treatment of lightweight wool fabrics, including the highly successful 'cool wool', represents a very serious anomaly in the Customs Tariff Act. Indeed, the Opposition brought this anomaly to the attention of the Minister some 12 months before the Government actually made its decision to correct February 1988, imported lightweight wool fabrics have been the subject of a tariff of 35 per cent. This was quite appalling, given that other imported wool fabrics were not the subject of any tariffs at all. Where used, it severely hampered the competitiveness of Australian designer garments in overseas markets. Because of its exorbitant price, it discouraged many Australian designers from actually using the fabric. The decision, when announced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) on 1 March 1989, was welcomed by the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian fashion industry. Hugh Begges, Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, at the time of the decision said: Great stuff. Hopefully, Australian designers will now pick up the very best lightweight fabrics from wherever they're made and make clothes out of them so we in Australia can wear the best of our own product. As I said at the outset, this was a very welcome decision. The remainder of the Bill deals with minor housekeeping matters, none of which the Opposition has any great difficulty with. Consequently, we will be supporting this legislation.",92
128,Mr MARTIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The principal amendments in this Bill-the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1990-as indicated by the honourable member for  ished speaking, relate to the removal of duty on certain articles of rubber apparel, certain protein concentrates, certain coal tar and pitch, and certain tractors. The Bill also increases the tender quota allocations for certain textiles, clothing and footwear goods. It is in respect of the question of textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF) that I would like to make some comments tonight and, hopefully, those comments will be taken on board by the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is seated at the table. At the outset, I would pay tribute to the Minister. His diligence in his portfolio responsibilities is fast becoming legendary out there in the community, and I would certainly indicate to him that he has my it. Since total support in that regard. The current textiles, clothing and footwear plan commenced operations on 1 March 1989, and it is scheduled to run until June 1995. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is designed to assist the Government's ongoing economic strategy to restructure and revitalise the Australian economy. With this in mind, the main objective of the plan is to encourage those industries which are internationally competitive to foster greater innovation and reduce dependency upon <::ommonwealth assistance. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill provides yet another example of the ways in which this Government has refashioned the Australian economy to make it more competitive and outward looking. There are many aspects to the adjustment task. One of the important ones has been the need to rebalance the Australian economy away from our traditional dependence on commodities. We have turned back the high levels of tariff protection which earlier governments had used in a vain attempt to create a broad based manufacturing sector in this country. The only result of that was the mushrooming of a range of inward looking industries poorly suited to our country which were a burden on our export industries. The tariff approach also developed a mind which saw the Government as the main solution to industry problems. There was little belief on the part of the manufacturing sector that progress could be made through innovation or through meeting competition head on. I think that is a point that was amply demonstrated in an article by Julie Power in the Australian Finctncial Review today, Tuesday, 16 October 1990, headlined 'Tariff cuts fail to spur TCF restructuring'. In that article, she makes the valid point that unfortunately, few companies have taken the benefits that have been available to the TCF industries in the restructuring process. She makes very strongly the point about the offers of overseas trips for study purposes subsidised by the Government not being taken up by the executives of those major textile, clothing and footwear companies. It is quite surprising that, given that there has been substantial investment and new capital, people have not taken up that opportunity to help diversify their own industrial base even more and to look at ways in which the present situation might be enhanced. As I have indicated, we have gone a long way towards improving the textiles, clothing and footwear sector. As I have also said, there is still a long way to go. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill is part of that ongoing process. The challenge of restructuring faced by the TCF industries throughout the 1990s will continue to present opportunities. The principal amendment in the Bill will increase the tender quota allocations for certain textiles, clothing and footwear goods. TCF industries account for a very significant part of the Australian manufacturing sector. In 1986-87, for example, TCF industries contributed $3,509m to value added manufacturing, which represents 7 percent of the total value added in manufacturing in this country. Since 1986 the TCF industries have invested $700m in fixed capital expenditure. In 1987-88 employment in the TCF industries totalled 115,500. On and on go the statistics which clearly indicate the significance of this industry to Australia. In 1987, before the commencement of the TCF plan-again an industry plan developed by the Government; a caring government and one that is keen to promote industrial development in this country-the Industry Commission estimated that the effective assistance for clothing and footwear products was as high as nine times the manufacturing average. The Industry Commission has estimated that the cost to consumers of protection to TCF industries is approximately $1 billion per annum, obviously a figure in this day and age which is not sustainable. The aim of the current TCF plan is to encourage industries which are efficient and internationally competitive to inspire greater innovation and reduce dependency and community support. The increase in tender quota that the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill introduces is consistent with the objective of the current TCF plan to remove tariffs and reduce assistance to TCF industries. The quota tender results for 1990-91 reflected a significant reduction on the rates for the 1990 period, with falls in 24 of the 35 quota categories. In 1991 there will be an average decline in premiums of over 50 per cent. It is encouraging to note that the overall protection for the clothing and textile sectors will decline as a result of changes along the lines of the legislation which has already been introduced. Imported clothing will now attract a general duty of 55 per cent plus an average tender premium of 40 per cent, giving an average duty of 69 per cent compared to nearly 90 per cent in 1990. Total duties on footwear will decline from an average of around 90 per cent in 1990 to less than 75 per cent in 1991. This will obviou,sly benefit consumers by lowering prices and will strengthen local industries that meet the challenges which increased competition provides. These results are' good news for Australian consumers, who will pay about 10 per cent less for all imported clothing and 7 per cent less for footwear over the course of the next 12 months. It is important to bear in mind the global nature of the TCF industries. It is also important to bear in mind the extent to which productive capacity is mobile and will continue to shift from high to lower cost countries. The forces which saw Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan emerge as significant players will now see capacity shift towards China, South East Asia and the Pacific. This trend will be especially marked in the clothing and footwear industries which, despite technological advances, are likely to remain relatively labour intensive throughout the 1990s. Australia's abundant supply of raw materials provides significant growth opportunities for the textile industry. Raw materials processing can, if investment continues, provide a solid core of export industries by the late 1990s. Australian firms also need to develop linkages with both growers and international producers to lock into scale economies associated with worldwide, materials processing. Increasingly, as a result, in the ground swell industry. of change introduced by this Government after years of stagnation, Australian manufacturers are beginning to accept that the protection afforded by governments cannot be relied upon to sustain competition and that strategies must be adopted to exploit - a-kets and to take advantage of opportumtIes presented by changes occurring in the global stage. The Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority has noted: Retailers are likely to become less concerned with gross margins and will focus instead on the potential contribution that quick response, rapid s-ockturI! can make to total earnings. The Austrahan r,etall market will increasingly be looking for t-e n&ht products with the right quality at the nght time and at the right price. As a result of the wide-ranging reforms introduced into the economy under the present L,abor Government, including the deregulatIOn of the Australian financial system and programmed protection reduction of tariff barriers, TCF industries will progressively become more integrated into the international market. The overall pace of change, however, will need to be increased to ensure the ongoing viability of the TCF industry to ensure that the significant number of Australians currently employed in the sector can be ensured of long term secure and productive employment. The Bill itself goes a long way towards meeting the objectives of the Government in this regard and I commend it to the H?us-. I would now like to end my contnbutIOn so that the Minister might have some time to reply prior to the adjournment.",96

If the departments had been applying notional duty, as was their wont, obviously this cost factor would have already been picked up because all they have to do now is apply the duty. I do not think that is valid point and I wish to refute the fact that it would be an additional cost. Howof ever, my Customs 'officers have said they will monitor this with the Departlights. ment of Defence to ensure that there is a smooth transition to applying duty rather than just the notional duty that was previously intended. I thank honourable members for their contributions on this Bill. In order to assist the House I will not take much more time. I want to address some of the issues relating to the TCF industry that were raised by the honourable member for Macarthur. It is important that the Austhe tralian textiles, clothing and footwear dustry seize the opportunity to go forward with the TCF plan. If we are going to have an industry that can survive in this country, the TCF plan is important. It is also important that those industries now recognise that that TCF indusjs now try plan was put in place so that we could prostheses have a competitive industry, one come together and find new avenues and new export drives, one that can see the opportunities that competition will prois vide to them without sheltering behind the tariff barriers of the past. Those tariff barriers have not given us an efficient textiles, clothing and footwear industry. They have not given us an industry that can compete on world markets. The TCF plan is designed to give them a competiconcerned ti ve edge. As the honourable member Macarthur has said, it is disappointing that many of the companies involved have not taken that challenge up. I do not wish to delay the House any longer. I comin mend the Bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to moved forthwith.

132,Mrs GALLUS,ADJOURNMENT,"1 would like to alert honourable members to the problems' that have been caused by changes brought about in the Budget into the free limb scheme. The scheme was introduced in the 1970s and it provided free artificial limbs-prostheses-for amputees. In the Budget the free limb scheme was changed to the artificial limb scheme. Free limbs are no longer available as they were to everyone in the population. There a charge of 15 per cent of the that can is, however,forupthose to a requiring them. This limit of $200. As the average cost of an artificial limb about $1,400, it means that those receiving them will pay $200 in the year. Those with pensioner benefit cards, health care cards and health benefit cards will receive the limbs, as always, for free. So those who are actually hit by this are those who are on incomes, and I am most about those who are on low for incomes. It seems that this Government keeps hitting those who are trying to make a go of it for themselves, those who are earning a small income and who just come above the health benefit card limit and who find that they have this other impost of $200. Also, under the new scheme limbs are no longer available in the same way as they used to be. Under the free limb scheme people could have limbs any time be they needed them. Under the new scheme they must wait 36 months. For amputees, a this is not always possible. Some amputees can use the, one artificial limb for as long as seven years, while others need replacements every 18 months. To be asked to wait for three years will impose quite a difficulty. I have contacted the Department of Veterans' Affairs and it has assured me that there is a process whereby those requiring the limbs can ask to have a new one within the three-year limit, but they have to send in a detailed report to be approved by the unit in Victoria. At present people are not aware of this. The amputee in my electorate who contacted me had contacted his doctor, who knew absolutely nothing about the ability to get new limbs without waiting 36 months. As usual, confusion has been created because something has been introduced without being discussed with those involved and without clarification being given to those involved in the scheme. As honourable members can imagine, this is causing considerable concern to those who need these sorts of things. Another concern about this scheme which was announced in the Budget is that it entirely ignores the Industry Commission report on aids and appliances for people with disabilities. This report was brought out several months ago and contained quite a few recommendations, including the privatisation of some elements of the industry. Not one of these recommendations has been taken up in the new scheme. Why do we go to the trouble of having these reviews if all the recommendations are ignored? Further, there is under way at present a free limb scheme review. In this review, which is about to be published, there are 93 recommendations about what should happen to the free limb scheme. Yet this review was totally and utterly pre-empted in the Budget. Again, I ask: What is the point of having reviews of these sorts of schemes and then totally and utterly ignoring them? This is not the first time that I have mentioned this matter. On the last occasion that I spoke in an adjournment debate I referred to the care aggregated module review which was similarly ignored. Changes were made without reference to a review which was under way. I point out that this scheme has been brought in without consultation and without informing the recipients of the scheme of what is about to happen, which has caused enormous concern and fear to those who need artificial limbs and for the people who are trying to' help them. People are confused as to what,is happening in the industry. As I said, the Government has totally and utterly ignored one review and pre-empted another. Warragamba Dam",99
133,Mr MARTIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Political self-interest and the failure of urban planning have long conspired to create flooding in Sydney's outer fringes. The Greiner Government, unfortunately, has raised this to an art form. I am referring, of course, to the problems associated with Warragamba Dam, which is located within my electorate, but potential problems could occur in those areas downstream from Warragamba. The dam is Australia's largest concrete dam. It is 142 metres high and is built upstream from a major population centre, and holds back water that would fill Sydney Harbour four times over. At the time of its construction the dam was regarded as a major feat of Australian engineering. However, in 1985 precipitation probability figures were revised upwards. The following year the Australian National Committee of Larger Dams recommended that Australian dams meet the probable maximum flood (PMF) requirements in line with international standards. The crux of the present problem is that the goal posts have been shifted. Because of the inadequacies of the Warragamba Dam and the rapid and ongoing development of the wide plains west and north-west of Sydney, which fan out and stretch through Penrith, Minchinbury, St Marys, Emu Plains, Windsor and Richmond, if the probable maximum flood ever occurred the results would be catastrophic. If the PMF ever happened a gigantic flood wave would be sent through the outer suburban regions of Sydney. The Australian National University (ANU) Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies, which has gathered information on every building likely to be affected, has calculated that 40,000 people's lives and 14,000 homes are being put at risk. The cost of such a tragedy is estimated at $4 billion. It is impossible to put a cost on the hundreds of lives that would be lost. D. I. Smith and M. A. Greenway, in their paper Potential Dam Failure in New South Wales-Damages and Dam Safety Management, estimate the direct damage bill as a result of a near PMF inundation would be in the order of $1 billion. The indirect damage caused through loss or disruptions to the transport network, the loss of trade and production and the cost of alternative housing would more than double the total. Smith and Greenway do not attempt, of course, to put a monetary figure on the human costs involved. Mr Dingle Smith of the ANU's Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies and a specialist in flood management has stated: There is no question that if the dam failed eral thousand . . . houses and factories would be totally demolished. They are just inundated. The velocity and depth combinations means they are just swept away. There is no question. Such an event would result in the loss of 70 per cent of Sydney's reliable source of water. This eventuality would result in Sydney's water supply system being severely disrupted and would bring rationing to homes and industry to a standstill. In response to the sorts of claims that have been made, the New South Wales Government has taken very decisive action. The Deputy Chairman of a committee which was established to look at dam safety, the New South Wales Dams Safety Committee, dared to question the Government's wisdom in not doing anything about it. The Board has recommended that a gigantic safety valve be cut into the side of the dam to prevent a catastrophe in the event of the flooding and collapse of the dam. The cost would be of the order of $80m. The Deputy Chairman of the committee regarded this as a vital piece of engineering. Currently, unfortunately, there is very strong resistance on the part of the Greiner Government to doing anything. The whole saga is rather unfortunate because the New South Wales Minister for the Environment, Mr Tim Moore, acting against the advice of his own Department, responded to the potential catastrophe by questioning the expert engineers' reports rather than taking action. In the meantime Mr Adrian Williams, a senior Water Board engineer and Chairman of the Dams Safety Committee, has spoken against Mr Moore and, for his trouble, he has been sacked. Another Cabinet Minister, the Hon. Ted Pickering, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, was asked for his opinion. He said that in his opinion the State Emergency Services would be more than capable of conducting a major evacuation of 40,000 flood affected people, if that were to happen. It is an absolute nonsense, and I am therefore calling on the Greiner Government not only to give serious consideration to the funding of the emergency sev- spillway creation at the site but to look at the reconstruction of the dam itself before it is too late; before a major flood occurs. Recently we have seen flooding in the western parts of Sydney. It is a scandal of monumental proportions. It has been pointed out by some of the media, but even media pressure in Sydney does not seem to be able to move the Greiner Government to any action. It is a nonsense and something should be done immediately. Broken Hill Area: Reticulated Electricity",100
134,Mr HICKS,ADJOURNMENT," Many people in the House, particularly those from rural areas, would know that there are still parts of Australia that do not have reticulated power. One such area is north of the city of Broken Hill. Recently the State Minister for Minerals and Energy, the hon. Neil Pickard, had a survey carried out in that area and found that residents in about 200 properties would like to have the power connected. The only problem was that each property would have to be charged $53,000 per connection. The Darling Electricity Construction Agency, which was formed to look into this problem, took the matter to the Minister, said that these 200 properties required connection, and then set about being the authority that would decide just how this job would be done. Previous New South Wales State governments, under Mr Wran and a later Premier, allowed a $10,000 contribution towards the connection of power in outback areas, which was means-tested and phased out at $52,000 based on the income of the property over the previous three years. The present State Government has made a non-means-tested contribution of $20,000, plus another $17,000, because the actual connection cost to each property is a massive $90,000. Recently some of these property holders have signed contracts for the amount of $53,000, based on what their earnings were in previous years. We all know that the victims of the rural recession and the wool problems that we are facing include people in those areas. Now they find it will be very difficult to get the $53,000 for the connection of this power. I am putting to the Federal Government that one way that it could assist these people is to provide a subsidy to people to have the power connected. The State Government has already done its part in contributing almostÂ· $37,000 towards the cost of putting power onto these outback properties. In the past these properties have contributed greatly to the national product. Now they are in times of great difficulty. Another thing the Federal Government could do would be to give a 100 per cent tax deduction on expenditure in the year of putting this power onto the properties. I do not think that is a great deal to ask from the Federal Government. Perhaps this may be the way to go. People who live in outback Australia, particularly in this isolated region, have a right to the connection of this reticulated power, as most Australians do. They are showing their good faith by contributing the $53,000 per property for the connection of power. Not too many people in capital city areas or regional areas would be paying that much to have the power connected. If the Government does not feel able to provide the subsidy, surely it could provide a 100 per cent tax reduction in the year of expenditure. Brisbane City Council",101
135,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"On 23 March 1991 the people of Queensland will face another round of elections, this time for local government authorities. I wish to speak tonight about the Brisbane City Council, because it is within the Brisbane City Council boundaries that my electorate falls. After suffering six years of Liberal administration in the Brisbane City Council, the people of my electorate are crying out for the opportunity to throw it out and return a Labor administration to the City of Brisbane. I look forward to that opportunity because I have in my electorate seven wards for the Brisbane City Council. Unfortunately at the moment only one of those is represented by a Labor alderman, Alderman Tim Quinn in the seat of Woolloongabba. But I can assure all honourable - members that after 23 March next year seven Labor wards will represent the electorate of Moreton in the Brisbane City Council. I look forward to the opportunity of having seven Labor aldermen in my electorate because I know they will care f()r the people of Brisbane, unlike the current administration, and that their basic priority will be to provide good services for ordinary people-something that the current Bri-bane City Council has totally failed to do. Within the electorate of Moreton I am looking forward to having people of such high quality as Kerry Rea, the Australian Labor Party (ALP) candidate for the electorate of Ekibin; Linda Holliday, the ALP aldermanic candidate for the ward of Camp Hill; Robyn Twell, who will be the new alderman for the seat of Fairfield; Owen Pearson, who will make an outstanding alderman for the seat of Holland Park; Philip Reeves, who will do an outstanding job in Rochedale, unlike the current holder of that seat; and Scott Patterson, who will take back for the the seat of Carina, which was only narpoor services. rowly taken away from us in the last election. Mr Sciacca-It sounds like an excellent bunch.",102
136,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I agree; they are an exto cellent bunch. The honourable member for Bowman knows some of those people and knows that they are an outstanding team of candidates. They are led by an outstanding mayoral candidate by the name of Jim Soorley. All of these candithe dates will make outstanding aldermen in the Brisbane City Council because they care about ordinary people in our munity. That is what has been so sadly lacking with the current administration. While our current Lord Mayor trips around the world displaying her outfits and ignoring the basic needs of the City of Brisbane, we have suffered sively. Mr Sciacca-How many trips has she had?",103
137,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to know. do not know. I do not think one could fit them on two pages of foolscap; I am sure they would go even longer. The cU,rrent Council has ignored the basic reasons city councils and local government exist, and that is to look after ordinary services such as decent roads, sewerage, garbage collection and other services such as those. That draws me to the main campaign theme for the Labor team in the Brisbane City Council elections, and that pronged approach: fair rates, efficient management and a clean' environment. They are three basic principles that have been missing from the last six years poor Liberal administration in the City Brisbane. Let me come first to the question fair rates. This year in its budgetthe eral administration introduced a new system called the differential rates system, which meant that it cut the rates from wealthiest areas of the city and increased the rates for the poorest areas. Some idents in my electorate have faced 40 cent increases in rates this year. That is shameful exercise, particularly when they enterprises. ALP live in very low income areas with very Another issue is a clean environment. The Council had the gall this year to introduce an environment levy. It charged an extra $20 to City of Brisbane residents protect the environment, something the Council had failedÂ· to do for the last six years. What is the money being spent on? It would not be a bad idea if those in the administration were going to protect the environment. But what will they spend money on? They will spend it on protecting a few trees in the western suburbs; meanwhile in my electorate in the last 12 commonths they have destroyed about 50 acres of trees. They have not provided the clean environment that residents in my electorate of Moreton require. I cannot latest wait for the new elections.",103
138,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The mashonourable member's time has expired. Job Vacancies: Manly-Warringah Area,103
139,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah) (10.48) I - While the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) have continued to insist that Australia is not in recession, . they might be interested to why know that job shortages in the ManlyWarringah area have reached a critical point. Local job vacancies slumped by 45 per cent in September and figures released by the Manly and Brookvale branches of the Commonwealth Employment Service show that this follows eight months of is a threepersistent deterioration. This trend is confirmed by the local newspaper, the best in Australia, the Manly Daily, which recently reported that of vacancies advertised in that paper were of 62 per cent lower than 12 months ago. Yet the Treasurer insists there is no recesof sion. The Commonwealth Employment LibService reports that company closures and staff cutbacks have stripped 385 local people of their jobs in just the past four the months and cites the Sky Channel sacking of 45 employees, the closure of the Worresmald International (Australia) Pty Ltd per factory at Dee Why, with a loss of 260 a jobs, and 80 other job losses from smaller The closure of Wormald International at Dee Why is of particular concern me because that single action will bring uncertainty and hardship to as many as 1,000 local men, women and children. How could a company with over 100 years of history in Australia and a respected job, name in the fire protection and security industry find itself in circumstances where it has to close such a major undertaking? It did not take too much probing to find out the answer. The immediate reason is that Wormald has been taken over by an American commanagement pany, Tyco Laboratories Inc., and company has decided to close down all of Wormald's manufacturing operations in Australia because, it is claimed, it is cheaper to import those same products from overseas sources. This is a very sad finish for such an important and rerole spected Australian company, and if Labor Government had any real concern about where its policies are taking this country it would be asking itself what went wrong. The real answer is not that Wormald's products were not price petitive with those in other countries or that Tyco wanted to rationalise its new producing corporate structure in order to maximise growth stock. its return on investments. No, the reason must be sheeted home ultimately to seven years of economic management by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the failure Labor's policies to create a sound and viable manufacturing industry. Deregulation of Australian financial markets, the entry of foreign banks the debt creating policies of the first years of the Hawke Government resulted in this country being awash with easy money through the mid-1980s. We saw frenzy of financial lending and the ensis couragement of many projects and entreof preneurs, which in hindsight was wasteful and downright unwise. As we know, bilthose lions of dollars of foreign debt was crestantial ated in just a few years, but instead of being turned into productive enterprises such as factories, export products and ployment opportunities, it was largely wasted on unproductive corporate redemise structuring and the associated stock ket and property booms. As part of that frenzy of takeover activto ity which marked the 1980s, Wormald was targeted twice in 1985 and again in 1988. It resisted all those attempts and set about putting its own financial house in order. Perhaps it did too thorough a particularly in its successful entry into the European market, for in May 1990 it fell to an attractive takeover offer from Tyco Laboratories Inc. of the United States. One of the tragedies of this takeover is that five years ago Wormald was not only bigger than Tyco but Wormald's had been eyeing it as a posthat sible takeover target of its own. Instead, Australia loses another piece of its corporate heritage. Wormald's manufacturing operations will be closed down; its research and development closed or transferred to an overseas country; and its in Australia will be reduced to noththe ing more than a warehouse at Hoxton Park distributing overseas-made products. In essence, Wormald will be reduced to a shell, with little more than an investment interest in Tyco. As the Australian Financomcial Review described it: Wormald will be transformed from an income investment into a non-yielding capital The final blow was Wormald's announcement on 12 September this year that it would change its name to Tyco Industries of (Australia) to reflect its transformation from an operating company to an investment holding company. There is much that will never be reand vealed about the motives and manoeuvthree ring of those who made the decision to sell Wormald, but it is said that the suggestion for the Tyco takeover came from a Wormald's management. A careful analyof Wormald's share holding, the terms the takeover, and subsequent management changes gives some indication of who have made or will make subfinancial gain from the Tyco connection. What is certain, though, is that hundreds of Wormald employees and their emfamilies are not the beneficiaries. I feel a very real sense of sadness at the of Wormald. From a company five maryears ago which could have taken over Tyco, it is now but a mere shell operating as Tyco's Australian distributor. Wormald is just another Australian company to have become a victim of a Labor government that encouraged the frenzied excesses of the 1980s in the mistaken belief that financial activity was real activity. Opposition Policies",103
140,Dr CATLEY,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Acting Speaker, as you well know, there was a palace coup in the Opposition ranks only six months ago. The old leadership of the Liberal Party and the National Party were pushed aside-some into the wilderness after losing seats, some to the back bench, and others to become bit players in the new regime. At the time the new leaders were seen as younger and cleaner after seven years of post-Fraser instability. What was not known was the effect they would have on policy. On 12 September in this House I suggested that it represented a swing to the right. It is now very clear that they represent a massive lurch to the radical right. By 12 September they were already pledged to abolish all protection for secondary industry, restructure the tax system to take the burden from the asset rich to lower income groups' consumption, and to have a fire sale of public assets, starting with Telecom. This lurch has not yet been picked up by the gallery-with the very honourable exceptions of Niki Savva in the HeraldSun and David O'Reilly in last week's Bulletin. They both depict a very radical right leadership. O'Reilly described the internal brawl that produced the consumption tax and how the MCEwenist nature of the National Party has been beaten back by the present Leader's acceptance of dry economics. Mr Downer-You prefer the old style, do you?",105
141,Dr CATLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"Leading the brat pack of the new right wing radicals-the honourable member for Mayo is one-is the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who is so desperate to distinguish himself from the Government that he has not only proposed to continue to try to cut expenditure by a further $3 billion, which the Opposition was pledged to at the last election, but also to abolish the Department of Social Security. Its role would be handed over to community groups, nineteenth century style. No wonder those opposite attacked Senator Richardson's defence of the social security budget. Let me quote some of the more honest policy proposals of the Leader of the Opposition as revealed in these articles: We have painted ourselves as a harder-line alternative to the Government. If that involves pain to the Australian people they will wear it. Australians will have to endure falling living standards and accept being worse off in the short term. He adds: We have a clear and hard line, easily understood alternative position because we are fundamentally different. These stories mark the unveiling of the radical right policies against which we will fight the next election. Yet to come, Mr Acting Speaker. I see that you have recovered from your triumph on the football ground at lunchtime; I tooare their new policies on health, where they do not have a policy; wages, where they have something called enterprise bargaining and high unemployment; welfare, where their policies are still unknown; and immigration, where some want more, some want less and some want something else. I should also note an important point that even those astute observers in the gallery have not yet noticed, and that concerns the four-rank structure of the Opposition's order of battle. First, we have the 10 or so new young hard men on the front bench who push the macro-economic strategy: axe welfare, sell off assets, shift the tax burden and dump down on the unions. Second, we have the 10 or so old guard who have a great deal more political experience than these new guys and they run the strategy. They run parliamentary business, and we watched the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) run Question Time today because neither the Leader nor the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) were capable of doing it. They maintain the links with the Party machines and the corporate backers. Third, the wet portfolio spokesmen try to reassure the targeted groups that their interests will not be damaged, whether they concern welfare or the environment, and this of course is a major con. Finally, the back bench push whatever policy promises seem appealing in the local circumstances even if, and particularly when, they conflict withÂ· the leadership's general direction. In the Appropriation debates we have been repeatedly bagged for cutting spending by an Opposition back bench that is committed to supporting a leadership that will add $3 billion worth of cuts to whatever cuts we introduce. We have found this on every Appropriation Bill, including notably the First Home Owners Amendment Bill which IÂ· spoke on the other day. In short, the Opposition's egy is full of holes and it will not to plug them while espousing policies that must have Sir Robert Menzies turning in his grave. The hard line of the radical right leadership will not mesh with the soft sell of the backbench wets, and people are going to notice. Maritime Safety Communications",105
142,Mr CHARLES,ADJOURNMENT,"1 should like to talk very briefly about a publication issued by the Department of Transport and Communications entitled Maritime Safety CommunicationsCHANGES AHEAD. The Department intends to introduce a new global maritime distress and sea safety system. This system is designed for the world's commercial fleets. Unfortunately, we are going to bring the system into Australia and close down our radio telecommunications system for small craft at sea in a number of centres, including particularly, I note, Melbourne radio and Hobart radio. There is a great deal of concern out there in the pleasure craft industry among yachtsmen and among fishermen with small boats. The communications system which will come into place starting next July will leave us only foUl: centres, four communications towers, and almost no weather and safety information for many small ships, unless they want to spend II over $5,000 per vessel in new electronic equipment. I suspect that the Department could communicate with us in a better way than putting out a standard pamphlet. I should like to hear from the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) because these are real concerns about the safety of real people at sea. In addition to a lack of weather forecast by closing down local centres such as Melbourne radio and Hobart radio, we also have the prospect of small vessels winding up at sea in terrible weather conditions without highpowered transmitting equipment in order to get to the major centres in Sydney, Townsville, Darwin and Perth. Lives will be put at risk.",106
