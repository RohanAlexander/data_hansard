As you know, Madam Deputy Speaker, supplementation in East Timor-as there should be; there is Secretary to the Department of Defence, on a supplementation has gone to force generation more precisely, probably about $470-odd Why is this a black hole? What is unclear, battalions are a matter of policy, is when the by Army. Will the current situation continue?

In other words, what below the increase in average personnel costs government that is outlining a number of initiatives the parliament as a whole, but in the white money than the historical 10-year average.

Or is it already the it is government policy, they are meeting that in the white paper that there are quite a number of on the personnel front. Again, I do not think But what is disturbing is that there is a is proposed in the white paper is two per cent over the last 10 years. So here we have a that it wishes to take, with the support of paper it proposes to provide two per cent less wish it were otherwise, but I cannot see how the ambitious target in the white paper.
