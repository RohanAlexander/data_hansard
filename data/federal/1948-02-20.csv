1,Mr CBIFLEY,Unknown,"The work mentioned has not come before the oommittee of the Commonwealth Literary Eund, and the only information I have concerning it is that which appeared in a paragraph in the press some days ago-. Of course, it is possible that it may have been considered by the Advisory Board of the Eund, but I have no knowledge of the matter having been brought before the committee. It is possible, of course, 'that the work may have been rejected by the Advisory Board as not being of a sufficiently high standard. With regard to the honourable member's question concerning the printing of the book, neither the parliamentary committee nor the Advisory Board makes any direct arrangement with printers even in cases where financial assistance has been approved. That is a matter which is usually arranged by the publishers. Of course, the secretary of the committee may give authors the benefit of his advice and assistance in placing their books with publishers. I shall inquire whether the work has been considered by the Advisory Board of the Commonwealth Literary Fund and inform the honourable member.",15
2,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"In order to avoid any confusion, might I suggest that it made clear that the Commonwealth Literary Fund has never made any rule a minor character. that a work of history is not to be regarded as a work of literature. In that respect the honourable member's question is quite misleading. LAND SALES CONTROL.",15
3,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"Mr Balmford/the principal Land Sales Control delegate, recently gazetted an order exempting entirely from land sales control all sales effected by a certain co-operative building company. When I asked why there had been this apparent discrimination in favour of one company, Mr Balmfor-d said that the exemption had been granted to avoid duplication, as the company was a non-profit concern and its affairs were under the control of the Registrar of Cooperative Building Societies in New South Wales. He said further that one or two other exemptions had been made in somewhat similar circumstances. I ask the Treasurer if Ue is aware that all co - opera.tiYebuildingsocieties in New South Wales, whether they are selling ov lending societies, ar-p non-profit organisations, under the supervision of the Registrar of Qo-operative Building Societies, and that in all cases the fair values of houses purchased by members from or with the assistance of such societies are fixed by the - societies' own valuers ? Will the right honourable gentleman now grant a similar exemption to al) sales effected by these societies,, or in which they are the financing authorities? Will lie furthersay what are the one or two other cases in which exemptions were granted ?",15
4,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I will supply the honourable membev' later with ' a full answer to all the questions he has asked. The organization t.o which he has referred and to which exemption has been granted comes particularly under the supervision of the Registrar of Co-operative Building Societies in N""w South Wales. Ah assurance has been given that proper protection will be afforded to all persons buying houses from or with the assistance of a society - It is believed that the control will be as firm as that whiph the be Government would itself be able to exercise. The other exemptions were of THE PARLIAMENT. VOTING J.^NT DIVISIONS.",15
5,Mr CONELAN,Unknown,". I ask you, Mr. Speaker, as the custodian of this House, if you have seen a report in today's issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph stating that after the Parliament is enlarged in 1949 members will cast their votes in divisions by pressing a button, and that engineers of the Postmaster General's Department are already experimenting with an electric voting system for the House of Representaives ?",15
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I have not seen the report. I can assure the honourable member, .a* the custodian of the House and as the person who would give the neoessary instructions, fhat the report of. experiments of this nature is a figment of the imagination. IMMIGRATION"".",15
7,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"I ask tke Minister for Immigration if he has seen a statement by the Commonwealth Statistician that during 1947 there was' a net increase of 226 in the number of persons in Australia of Russian nationality. ""Will the Minister state who these new migrants are, whence they came and for what purpose they have been admitted to Australia?",16
8,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I shall have inquiries made as the honourable member desires. There are a number of people in the world today who were of a certain nationality when World War II . started, but by unilateral act found themselves of another nationality when the war ended. The honourable member will remember the famous case of Yoizuki, when a number of Japanese ex-prisoners of war found themselves, when the Japanese were defeated, to be Formosan, or Chinese, subjects. Similarly, a number of Greek people who were regarded as Italian subjects because they were born in the Dodecanese Islands became Greeks when the war was over. Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians and East Prussians, who had their own nationality when the war started, now that their countries have been incorporated in other countries find themselves described as Russians, or of some other nationality. The British Government has not recognized those incorporations of the Baltic countries in the TJnion of Soviet Socialist Republics. It is quite possible that a number of people, despite that fact, have described themselves as being Russian subjects. I assure the honourable gentleman that the security record of everybody coming into this country is closely checked and screened by security omcers, and that he can sleep safely to-night. COMMUNISM. ISSUE OF PASSPORTS.",16
9,Mr LANG,Unknown,"J ask the Minister for Immigration, were passports issued to 50 members of a Communist auxiliary known as the Eureka Youth Movement to proceed to Yugoslavia? Was not the Minister aware that tliese youths proposed to enlist in a Communist international army? Is there any reason of [5] government policy that makes it possible for Australians to serve in a Communist foreign army but wrong for Australians to accept employment under the United States Government?",16
10,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman has made a statement containing a number of alleged facts. I do not believe that there is any substance in any of the statements he has made. As a matter of fact, when it comes to stating facts the honourable gentleman has a perfect record-h e is ahvays 100 per cent, wrong. DOLLAR DEFICITS.",16
11,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister received confirmation through official channels of newspaper cablegrams reporting that all Dominion High Commissioners or other representatives in London have been invited by Sir Stafford Cripps to attend an early conference at which an alarming drift in the dollar exchange position will be discussed? If such u conference is proposed, does it mean that there has been a further adverse development. If so, can the right honourable gentleman tell the House the nature of that development? Will he offer every co-operation by Australia in the matter?",16
12,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"We have had no official communication from London indicating that Sir Stafford Cripps has asked for a special conference with the High Commissioners on any particular subject. Generally speaking, it has been the practice for the British Government to consult the High Commissioners on a number of matters from time to time, and either the Minister himself or leading officers of the department keep them informed generally of the position. Also, we have in London a statistical dollar committee on which we have a representative. Mr. Nimmo has been sent specially from Australia to that job, and he is engaged constantly on that particular work. I do not think that there is anything that can be said from day to day about the so-called gold and dollar drift. I do not think that I am justified in disclosing all the figures because that is the business of the British Government. What I can say in general terms is that it is hoped from imonth to month toireducesubstanarises tially from .the British - reserve the drift of gold and 'dollars. Various reasons - exist 'for the 'drift. One 'is 'that - other countries, such - as Belgium, demand something more than sterling for their goods. The most general statement'that I can make is fhat in January the drain of gold and dollars 'from the British reserve was .much more than was antidollar cipated. In other words, the drain not been reduced by so much as was hoped 'for. Further 'than 'that, T do not think there is any statement that I could justiwith fiably make that would have the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I is true that Ithere is cause for;alarm. The Chancellor of the Exchequer may be prepared to give more detailed information as to the 'future prospects .to the .High Commissioners Ior conveyance to their the 'Indian deal. governments, but more than fhat T.cannot say at .the moment.",16
13,Mr BERNARD CORSER,Unknown,"Has - the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to a statement some weeks ago regarding a sale by Japan to India .of -£2,000,000 worth of .cotton goods, - and that India .had.agreed to pay this amount .to Japan in United States dollars? .In view of the precarious position of :the ^British .'Empire's dollar *pool and portance of dollars evidently held by India, was any effort .made by the Australian Government to secure payment in dollars 'for wheat and other products, which Australia sold to India before Japan's favourable business arrangement was made ?",17
14,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I am quite.sure that no attempt was made by the Minister Commerce and Agriculture, who is cipally responsible for the negotiations with the representatives of India regardpaper ing the sale of wheat and flour to that country, to obtain payment in dollars for them. We require from India jute, discharge linseed and linseed oil, which are essential to 'OUT'economy, and 'for which to pay in sterling. Therefore, I may disabuse the honourable member's mind, df he has any ideas, that we would have reqnired .India to - pay us in dollars - Australian foodstuffs. Tn Tegard to the brought to 'dealings with the .Supreme Commander-of the Allied tPowers for the purchase 'Japanese 'goods, ta 'complicated ^problem in relation 'to (Currency. I could endeavour .to explain the position at-some length for .the information ,of .the Jionorable member, Ibut I believe that I .should only weary the Souse by attempting to describe the difficulties which have arisen, for example, in regard to .one paymentfor wool, and the purchase of-certain other materials, including silk, probably on a basis. In conjunction with the has British Treasury, we are endeavouring to break the deadlock .which has arisen in.regard to currency problems in dealing the sale of goods to and from Japan. I am not .able to give the honourable memt ber any final information on this subject, 'but I shall .examine his question 'for the purpose of ascertaining whether I can supply any additional information about ALIENS. REGISTRATION-^TREATMEN T OF EX-SERVICEMAN. . Mrs BLACKBURN - My .question concerns the case of an ex-serviceman who served for five and a'.half years with the 2nd/16th Australian ""Infantry Battalion-82 4 days 'in Australia and 1,01ft days in the Middle East, New Guinea the im- and Borneo. He was discharged in ""November, 1945. A week after his discharge he received a letter telling him to report to the nearest policerstation as an alien. His finger-prints were taken and when, at a considerably later date, hejourneyed to another State, his fingerprints were again taken along with other precautions. Does the Minister for Immigration know of these practices? Does for such service as has been given to Ausprintralia by this man entitle him to no protection? Should not his discharge serve as a passport of a free citizen ? As he has applied for naturalization, should not his service and his honourable immediately secure his naturalization and give him full citizen-we expect ship rigbts without delay?",17
15,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"If the honourable member will give - me the name of the ""for person concerned, I shall have the file - my notice. I cannot believe that any one who applied for .naturalizaof tion as :far back as 1945 has not yet received it. .As a matter of fact, that would, be. impossible., The. average, wait for. naturalization now in my department isj only, tbree montbs. As' to what happened.in. 1945j,about two and a half!years, ago, I "" think it is a little late to go. into, the circumstances now; but a person is either a British subject or is not a British subject. If he is-nota British subject, he has. to. conform to. the laws regarding those, persons, whom, weregard, as - aliens. There was, at, that, time a requirement, which was largely a wan-time/ requirement,; that, aliens, must be registered and. finger-printed. If. some person did. not take notice of the honourable discharge from the Australian, forces.ofi that person, that. is. one of the-human errors that occur. ""We do not finger-print aliens.now. We abolished, that under, the act. that we passed, in. the last sessional period. Persons registering, as aliens no longer have to go to the police stations, but do so by reporting at the Department of Immigration, in the. capital' cities or at post offices - outside capital"" cities. There oan be no complaint today about anything thai operates in regard to registration, but if.'the. person referred to by the honourable member, has not yet' been naturalized; I assure Ker'that it will not be long before he is: SICKNESS; BENEFITS.. Mr JAME'S - I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Social Ser* vices., whether it, is, a' fact that - sickness benefits, are. cancelled when, a recipient receives, his annual, holiday pay at* the end of the year? Recognizing that such pay is spread over, the-whole, year, and would not' exceed the permissibleincome per week that; is-allowed , under the sick> ness 'Benefits provisions, does the-Minister consider - it. fair that* those who: are receiving:si'ckness benefits, say,- forDecenrbero r January; should be deprived of them b'ecause^tHey received"" holiday payin a lumpsum of £10' or £19? If the Minister* does not"" consider that' this cancellation of sickness benefit's is fair, what steps does he propose to take to rectify the position)?* Mr HOLL a WAY . ^ - I have-not. heard of the circumstances which.the honourable member has described. Such a position co.ul'9'not'have-arisen in the past,,because the; prevision granting, fourteen, days! annual, leave, has been, in operation., for less than a. year..",17
16,Mr JA,Unknown,"MES.T-In . the - mining? industry-, all' the-pr.oyision.has! operated, for. two years.",18
17,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"I did not know that the*, honourable member - referred to persons employed* in tthe-.mining industry Mr JAMES;-Thos e - are the - employees whom--1 had'in-mind! Mr HOULOWAY' - Expressin g my own opinion, I should say that if. the facts are as stated by the honourable memJ ber; the withdrawal'of the sickness benefits, is not fair - However, I shall referthe question to' the Minister fbr Social Services, and ask him exactly : what"" the law providesiir this matter; ARBITRATION. FLOUR MILL . EMPLOYEES. Mr^FRANCISi-Has the,Minister, for Labour and National Service' seen, the statement of Mr D. V.

18,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The-fact s are as follows""--The - conciliation' commissioner, Mr Morrison;, did' make some: remarks 3 similar to those menti6n6dJhy.the -.honor3 ables member wheni hey wasi considering 5 claimsby the Federated Mill. Employees % 1 Association-. Both"", parities, were present; and""somerumour:-I i do.not thihki that it 1 1 wasimara than arumour*-wasscircylate d to. the effect,that, even if-the conciliation : commissioner, made a.; new awardj the men would impose - a ban. onworking ! overtime.. As: the result, of. that rumour., Mr Morrison, informed the parties in the court that he-had reached the stage where, he could make hisor.der>, but that he would not make any order unless he obtained from the. Federated Mill Employees. Association an assurance that its members would no+ impose a ban on overtime anywhere in Australia. The officers representing the Federated M ill Employees Association, whom I know well, asked for permission to consult their council before they made a definite promise to the conciliation commissioner, because they did not want to break their word. The parties met the conciliation commissioner again on the 17th February, and the representatives of the association gave a definite assurance that no ban would be imposed on any flourmilling operations in any State. Having received that promise, the conciliation commissioner made a new order, and there is no possibility of any ban. being imposed. I am sunt of that. The honourable member may rest assured that the mills, about which he is naturally concerned, will be running at full capacity if they have the necessary labour. There will be no suggestion of the Federated M ill Employees Association imposing a ban anywhere in Australia. AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC POSITION.",18
19,Mr HAYLEN,Unknown,"Did the Prime M i nister read in yesterday's newspapers a glowing tribute paid to the Australian economy and the Australian Government by a British businessman, Mr Gilbert Harriman? Mr Harriman, who was formerly vice-chairman of the. Hong Kong Stock Exchange, has arrived in Sydney to settle permanently in Australia. He said Australia is the most secure country, and the Australian pound, taking the long view, is the soundest. People in the Far East are beginning to realise this. 1 include sterling and the gold dollar in this. I think Australia's economy is wellguarded with controls, and, whatever people have to say about its politics, the Australian Government's policy is straightforward and honest, as far as its economics are concerned. In view of the anti-Australian "" knockers "" and denouncers, does not the Prime Minister consider that this Englishman's view of Australia and the Australian Government is very fair ?",19
20,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"My attention has been drawn to the statement which the honorablo member read, and to several other statements which appeared in American newspapers indicating their view of the very sound economy that Australia enjoys. ""When invited by the press to make some comment on the matter, I suggested that the articles be sent to the Leader of the Australian Country party. WHEAT.",19
21,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I desire to address to the Prime Minister a question relating to the delay in appointing a chairman of the Australian Wheat Board. My question is founded upon the provision in the statute that, in the composition of the hoard, there shall be a chairman appointed by the Government. The Australian Wheat Board is now called upon to handle a record harvest, and the problems concerning the marketing of wheat at present are of almost unprecedented dimensions, as are also the problems associated with the sale and disposal of our exportable surplus. Will the Minister inform me why has the Government lef t the Australian Wheat Board, notwithstanding the statutory provisions, without a chairman since the 5th May last? Is it the intention of the Government to give effect to the statutory provisions and appoint the chairman of the board ?",19
22,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,The r e has always been an acting chairman of the board. Board meetings have not been held without a chairman.,19
23,Mr MOEWKN,Unknown,There has not been an acting chairman. Members of the board have occupied the chair in turn from month to month.,19
24,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I am. saying that at all times there has been some one acting as chairman of the board, and that in each case an experienced individual has performed this service. However, I shall consult with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, who has given a great deal of thought to this matter, and provide the honourable member for Indi with a reply to his question as early as possible. TARIFF PROPOSALS 1947. CUSTOMS TARIFF (NEW ZEALAND PREFERENCE) AMENDMENT (No . 1 ) . In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from the 14th November, 1947 (vide page 2,143), on  That the schedule to the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) 1933-1934 be amended . . . (vide page 2132, volume 194). Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered That Mr Dedman and Mr Johnson do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. NA (NEW ZEALAND PREFERENCE) BILL 1948. Bill presented by Mr Dedman , and read a first and second time. In committee: Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. The schedule.",19
25,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS TABI FF,Richmond) [11.191. - The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) has not given any explanation of the purport of this measure. The schedule now before us is merely a list of figures which is incomprehensible to any body who is not an expert on tariff matters. It is a farce to put this list of hieroglyphics before the committee. I invite the Minister to tell honourable members what the measure proposes to do in relation to New Zealand preference. How will these altered rates affect the existing situation?,20
26,Mr DEDMAN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"Corio-Minister foi Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction, and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [11.20] - An explanation of this measure was given yesterday by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  tariff proposals introduced on the 14th November,'1947, it was necessary to adjust ad valorem rates of duty consequent upon the amendment of the Customs Act to provide for the calculation of value for duty in Australian currency. Certain items in the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Act provide for ad valorem --ates of duty and the reduction of the rates by 12 per cent, is complementary to the similar principle of reduction which the committee has approved in dealing with Customs Tariff Proposals No. 1.",20
27,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"Barker) [11.21] - I have seen a few funny things emanate from this Government, but 1I have never yet known the Parliament to be asked to agree to a schedule consisting of one line stating "" Amendments of the schedule to the principal act"". If the Government intends that the schedule which has just been circulated to honormembers, when the bill is almost through the committee stage, should be approved, it is funnier still. Apparently the Government proposes once again to take advantage of its overwhelming majority in this chamber. What are the amendments that we are being asked to consider? Are they the ones contained in the schedule that has just been placed in our hands? If so, why are they not incorporated in the bill?",20
28,Mr DEDMAN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"The schedule was in rny possession yesterday, and I think it was on the table of the House.",20
29,Mr ABBOTT,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"New England) [11.22]. -.Surely this committee is entitled to some explanation of the extraordinary document that has just been circulated. Here we have a series of amendments entitled "" Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Proposals No. 1 "" . We know, of course, that New Zealand always gets preference. It has received an. extraordinary preference of approximately 15s. a bushel in the purchase of wheat. We ai'e entitled to know what all this means. The schedule has been kept secret. We do not know its full import. A quick glance reveals, in Item 15, a reference to ""Toheroa soup, oyster soup and other fish soup, in powder or otherwise and whether in admixture with other substances or not"". The schedule sets out a long list of commodities in respect of which customs duties are to be altered. Locomotives are mentioned, and I should like to know from the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction (Mr Dedman), who no doubt is conversant with the details of the schedule, how many locomotives have been imported from New Zealand during the past ten years. Is this importation a large trade, and is OUT own locomotive industry/being damaged by it.?. Then we. see -"" winches, cranes^ capstans,. windlasses and hoists cent, ad valorem What is the. volume: of the trade in this, machinery, between New Zealand and Australia*?

37,The CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,Mr Clark) Order! The honourable member for woods in New Guinea? Parramatta (Mr Beale) must be a little more courteous to the Chair.,23

41,The CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,Order JI f the all honourable member does not control himhave self I shall deal with him.,23
42,Mr DEDMAN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"The purpose of this proposal is similar to that of the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment No. 1, with which the committee has recently dealt. Certain items covered by the Customs Tariif (Canadian Preference) Act are subject to ad valorem duties and the rates have been reduced by 12 per cent, in view of the new basis for calculating value for duty.",23
43,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"Balaclava) [11.39] The matter under consideration may not be of outstanding importance in itself, but it does give members of the committee an opportunity to discuss all the items in the schedule. Item 291, building timber, affects the construction of houses, a matter which is of vital importance in Australia today that should not be disposed of without some discussion. We should review the rates of duty operating in regard to Oregon logs and sawn oregon. The Government should make inquiries of the timber trade to ascertain whether timber cannot be produced more cheaply than it is at present, and the Tariff Board should also be asked to furnish a 14th report on the subject. Since the present scale of duties was imposed before the war conditions have changed considerably. To-day building materials are in short supply, and the Government should investigate the possibility of building timber more cheaply from Canada. This is an aspect of the which should receive special consideration by the Minister for Works and Housing (M.r. Lemmon). Canadian timber possesses some qualities which are lacking in Australian hardwoods.",23
44,Mr HARRISON,CUSTOMS TABI FF,What about the soft,23
45,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"That subject would be regarded as sub judice today. Whilst the iniportation of Canadian oregon would involve us in the expenditure of dollars, I think that the advantages which would to the community would justify I that expenditure. Australian hardwood is already well protected by tariff, but the important thing today is that the of house construction should be reduced. The introduction of the 40-hour week, the shortage of building materials of kinds, and a number of other factors caused the price of house construction to sky-rocket, with the result that buyers of homes, and particularly those who purchase war service homes, will require a lifetime to pay for them. If a substantial reduction could be effected in the cost of some of the essential materials the lot of most of our people would be much happier. I exhort the Government to review particularly the protective tariff placed on timber, and to confer with the building trade and the Tariff Board to ascertain whether it is not practicable to permit the importation of Canadian timber in the form of sawn logs. I appeal to the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Sheehy), who has just entered the chamber, to support my proposal. Like other South Australian members he has spoken on this matter before, urging that cheaper building timber be brought into the country. This is an opportunity for him to support my appeal.",23
46,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"Wide Bay) [11.43] - Whils t I have always advocated the imposition of adequate tariffs, I consider that the present time is one when we should make temporary adjustments to our tariffs in order to meet our difficulties. Item 157 deals with barbed wire. A duty of 50s. a ton is imposed on barbed wire imported from abroad at a time when it is urgently required by primary producers. The Australian iron and steel industry is being frustrated by a concerted attempt on the part of enemy agents to prevent the manufacture of many things which are essential to primary producers. Local manufacturers have been quite frank in admitting that fencing materials, including posts, cannot be delivered to primary producers for two and a half years because of the shortage of coal, which is holding back production. The iron and steel industry is also being hampered by the adoption of "" go-slow "" tactics. Because of our present economic situation it is necessary for us to review our tariff policy in order that the proper development, particularly of primary industries, of the country may proceed. I ask the Government to hesitate before pressing for approval of this schedule. Spare parts for trucks and motor cars are almost unobtainable, but a heavy duty is imposed upon them. Instead, a' subsidy should be paid in respect of any that are imported so that the wheels of industry may continue to turn and country people may be enabled to carry out the tasks that are so essential to the prosperity of our primary producers. Owing to the dollar shortage we cannot import many new motor vehicles, and are forced to use old ones. They have continually to be repaired and will have to be laid aside if spare parts cannot be obtained. I urge the Government to ensure that when these items arrive in Australia they are delivered to the places where they are most required.",24
47,Mr MCEWEN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"Indi) [11.47] - I support all that has been said by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Bernard Corser) about certain items in this tariff schedule. The duties imposed upon barbed wire and oregon timber, for instance, are intended either to raise revenue or to protect Australian industry. At the present time the Government is bloated with revenue from income tax, sales tax, customs duties and so on. It has even reached the stage at which it does not bother to collect £60,000,000 arrears of income tax. There is no justification for imposing duties, in order to raise revenue, upon items that have an important effect upon the housing of the Australian people and the efficiency of its primary producers. If that is the motive, the duties should be abolished and the articles imported duty free. If the intention is to protect Australian industry, surely the Government knows that it is not necessary to protect industries so overwhelmed with orders placed at highly remunerative prices that they are years in arrears with deliveries. I refer to the iron and steel industry and the timber industry. Present circumstances afford no justification for the maintenance either of a protective duty or a revenue raising duty upon items seriously affecting the cost of houses and the proper conduct of our primary industries. There is an increasing demand for oregon timber for use in flooring and other housing requirements. That is due to the difficulty of importing the Baltic timber normally used for this purpose and the inability of Australian mills to supply adequate quantities of kiln-dried Australian hardwood or softwood. A person who wishes to build a house to-dayis - told, that the. only timber: available - for: floors;, skirting boards,, architraves, picture rails, and other - fittings.* formerly made ofkiln-dried .hardV wood, or Baltic softwood; .is oregomtimber., costing approximately twice as; much. The committee is asked to approve a tariff' schedule, the effect of which wilh be to increase the cost:of home building, : in: this country at a time, when that cost;, hasalready-risen to-a level hitherto.not' dreamed'of. The cost of homes is such, that even, a Labour: government, cannot' regard it with, indifference as: falling' upon capitalists, even if home-buyers are; as the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction once described them, little capitalists, who aspire, to nothing more than ownership of their own Homes. These people are entitled to protection from the extortionate prices, that are no.w being charged: I have brought architraves, paying 9di a running foot for oregon timber. 3 inches or 4 inches wide. This tariff schedule is designed to perpetuate those high costs. The complaint is made today that, even homes built by State housing, commissions are let at rents in excess of £2 a week. If homes .have to befloored,with oregon. timber,, the capital, cost will increase. In my own. district, many homes, are being built, with floors constnucted. ofs that, material. That is. a purposer to. which it was. never, intended to put that timber in this country, and thereasom forits. use. is the. inability of, home builders to obtain other, timbers. Similar arguments. apply to the duty upon barbediwire, because at-the.present time.it,is not .possible to buy barbed wire -. I . am engaged in,the.live-stock,.industry,, and. although I have had ai standing, order for barbed, wire, placed with, my pastoral, company for. seven years L have, not received,a.single coiL The small.quantity that is.available-is diverted to: exrservicemen-quite properly,, in my opinion.. It is-diverted, from, ex-service personnel only to. settlers who suffer, serious loss,through bush fires, or floods,,and.then,the.preference reverts, to ex-service: - personnel. I know all* about,that aspect of the: matter: However,, many farmers throughout, the. Commonwealth are obligedto. let, their, stock, roam. the. roads, because, they, cannotpur.cha.=ewire to. fence, their pr.oMr ifrEirrn. per.ties., But,, im this:, instance; when the Government-, is. not,short, oft revenue and. there is.no.'iieed' for a duty to protect the Australian iron. and. steel industry}., we are askeditbjratify. a.duty, which-will.have: the effect of keeping - up. thei cost of barbedwire, and; to: some: degree,, ofIkeep^ ing. itrout.of the country altogether . That 1 is"":an-iniquitous policy: Lam not askingthat'the Government revert.to'a duty-free policy in respect of these, items-. I acknowledge: the necessity; when, circuim stances warrant such a policy, for; protecting our timber and iron. and. steel industries; There.is, however,.no need at: the moment'.for a protective duty; and.no honourable memben. willsuggest, that, any necessity will - arise within the next: two or-three yearsfor protecting these industries in order to ensure disposal ofi their entire output. Therefore; I intend to move an amendment that all items indivisions VI . and. X.. be deferred until such time as the Government brings forward a proposal for the temporary dutyfree entry of these requirements for housingand primary production, in this country.",24

50,Mr ABBOTT,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"New England) [12.0]. - I .support.the amendment.moved.by the honourable member - for Tndi (Mr MCEwen). It is proposed that the duty on barbed wire be at the rate of 50s. a ton. This'is a classic example df the lack of knowledge of a socialistic government and df the damage which, in its ignorance of the requirements of primary industries, 'it can do to those .industries. Tn its ignorance, it depends upon advisers who are congregated at 'Canberra, far removed from the areas of 'primary production, and unaware of developments in industries supplying.the needs of primary industries in this and and other countries. - Presumably, the item applies solely to steel barbed wire. The Minister for Post-war Eeconstruction (Mr Dedman), in his peregrinations overseas, if he were interested at all in primary - production, must have read in American magazines, such as the American Country Gentleman, the - Farmer's Journal, the Implement Manufacturer of Chicago and the Arizona Farmer, of the enormous development which has taken - place in the TJnited States of America and Canada in the'manufacture'of barbed wire from aluminium. The Minister implied'that this and other items should be agreed 'because they were imposed by a Liberal-Country party government 'some years ago. Apparently they are'there, like the laws of ""the ""Medes'and Persians, - never to be 'changed. But the Government, depending merely on library research, and - without 'any practical experience of the needs of the man on the land, completely ignores the enormous development which 'has 'taken place in the'TJnited""States of America and Canada in the manufacture of aluminium products, including aluminium barbed wire, which are on the market today. ""Just how .ridiculous is this proposal to : i impose a duty on barbed wire at the rate of 50s. a ton will be realized when we know that the running length of a coil of aluminium barbed wire .is three times 'the: running length of a coil of steel barbed - wire :of the same weight. Whereas, a -1-cwt. icoil :of steel barbed wire has as [20 EEBRUABY, 1948.] Tariff ^Proposals '1947. '139 running length of'800 yards, a'coilof aluminium barbed'wire of the same - weight has a running'length of 2;400 yards. This proposal reveals the - slipshod manner in which this'schedule 'has .been compiled. It also reveals 'a lack of practical re-search. I - strongly oppose the item, which shoultl-not'ohly be def erred,-even if we have to wait a few days, but should also be put intcorder so'that, when we have it before us again, it shall be plain that it refers toi bar bed wire'made from'steel ana not to barbed wire made from aluminium. The item is a classic-example of the Government's gross stupidity and ignorance in dealing with the needs of primary producers. Therefore, I have - much pleasure in supporting the amendment for the postponement of the item, even though'it may mean that, for-a week or two, theliigher rate of duty shall-stand, it could then he exactly described. We may then move for 'heavy 'reductions of the tariff imposed-on such products. We have been told today and time an'd time again that the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and - Australian Iron and Steel Limited - are producing 45,000 tons a week less than their capacity because of labour and coal shortages. Are the development of primary industries and the production of food so urgently required from Australia to be held up by very heavy duties on these imports because the Government is un- willing to bring about'the state of affairs that - would produce 'the necessary iron and-steel? Are we to have production - held ""up 'and the - world starved because we ,'aro not producing the'food-that we could if we got barbed ""wire and wire netting and other-agricultural requirements'that -' we need? The Government is-so unaware of the 'conditions 'of the - world 'today that it does not know that aluminium ""barbed - wire that weighs only one-third of the weight -'of - steel - wire is procurable.",26
51,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"Richmond) [12.7] ""ft is not very often that we have the opportunity of reviewing these duties, but when it is provided the Government should take cognizance of the views of honourable members representing the food-producing industries of the country 'and the people in need of ""homes and other buildings who, I suppose, are represented by all honourable members. The standard and stock excuse of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) for the maintenance of these items is that they are related to the Ottawa Agreement and were put into operation fifteen or sixteen years ago, long before this Government took office. His defence is that these items are only a variation to bring the duties into line with a change in the standard of currency. That is no defence at all and it does not in any way satisfy the people wbo need the materials covered by the schedule. The Minister aptly bears the title of Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. That, in itself, ought to signify that there has been a change of conditions since the tariff based on the Ottawa Agreement was tabled. Circumstances today are vastly different. Tens of thousands of people are unable to build homes. Thousands more cannot produce the food required. We have committees aet up by the Government to organize driver for food for Britain and for increases of production, and we hear many exhortations from Canberra as to what the farmer is to do; but I , as a farmer, am unable to do the things that I want to do-and there are thousands like me-becaus e I eannot get materials to fence paddocks, to cultivate and to improve pastures. The materials are not available. The honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen) said that he had not been able to secure a coil of barbed wire for years. Neither have thousands of farmers throughout the country. Yet the Government exhorts the farmers to produce more. There should be some flexibility in the mind of the Government on this matter. What was done fifteen years ago should not stand for all time. This is the time and the opportunity and today presents the need for a change of the tariff policy, a temporary change if you like, as the honourable member for Indi said, but a change of sufficient duration to enable us to import supplies of materials to relieve the shortages in Australia.",26
52,Mr DEDMAN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,Where are the supplies available?,27
53,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"That will soon be ascertained if the duty is varied. The Minister is taking a different tack now. He implies that no need exists to alter the duties because we could not get supplies, in any case. Let us test that. I think it could be quickly demonstrated that we could get some additional supplies for Australian industries.",27
54,Mr DEDMAN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,The honourable member knows that that is not true. They could not he got from Canada.,27
55,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"I know that the output of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is 25 per cent, less than its capacity because it cannot get steel, coal find coke at Newcastle. I was informed of that at Newcastle last week. Consequently, home-building and productive enterprises are held up. The Government has the opportunity of making a forward move by permitting the entry of those supplies. The Minister says that we cannot get them from Canada, but has he tried? Let private enterprise have a "" s?o"", and I shall be able to give the Minister an answer within six months. Mr Archie CAMERON.'-What the Minister says does not apply to Oregon, - iiiyway.",27
56,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"It certainly does not apply to oregon. On the. one hand, the Minister for Immigration confessed yesterday to spending millions of pounds to bring migrants to Australia, and, on the other, the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Haylen"") claimed that migrants should not be brought here until homes are available. We know that the Australian sawmills cannot supply sufficient timber for the homes that should be built. Any one who has attempted to build in the last year or two knows that. The Government should show a realistic approach to post-war problems. The first man. to support that point of view should be the man who bears the title of Minister for Post-war Reconstruction.",27
57,Mr ABBOTT,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"Minister for "" Post-war Destruction "".",27
58,Mr ANTHONY,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"I should not like to say how the general public describes him, but that, at any rate is his official title. I come from a timber district, and I can say that Australia's timber resources art rapidly running out. On the north coast of New South Wales and in Queensland, for example, farmers nnd fruit-growers are almost unable to buy cases in which to send their goods to market. The price of cases has gone up since the war from 9d. to 2s. 6d. each. That is an increase of about 300 per cent., but cases are not available because the timber that is available is being diverted very largely to house building.",27

62,Mr ANTEONY,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"I support the which amendment of the honourable member for Indi. We are not prepared at this juncadmitted ture to advocate that the duty be abolished, because, manifestly, that would be improper, but a proposal should be introduced to discontinue or reduce cerunless tain duties-for a period. They could safely discontinued altogether for the next five years. An honourable memrepresentations ber, by interjection, suggests three years, hut I think we could go furthe ther than that, because there is no replies prospect of Australian manufacturers timber, barbed wire or other materials catching up with the back log of orders for years. More revenue is not required and industry does not require to be tected.

68,Mr TURNBULL,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"No honourable member interested in primary production could fail to support the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen). I believe that materials are urgently required for primary production at the present time should be to this oountry free of duty. One has only to travel throughout Australia to realise that the primary producer's equipment is deteriorating, and, his machinery can be repaired or be replaced, Australia's production will suffer. On several occasions, I have made to the Minister for Supply and Shipping (Senator Ashley) regarding lack of supplies of wire, and the which I have received show clearly that the Minister does not expect the posiof tion to be remedied for some years. The latest reply which I received, stated that, owing to the lack of man-power in the wire-pulling industry, it was doubtful prowhat would happen in future, and supplies would be short for some considerable The seriousness of the position is emphasized whenever we hear the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) speak of the general shortage of man-power The honourable member for Indi said that certain sections of the community who require supplies of wire are granted to priorities. One of these classes, and rightly so, is the ex-serviceman on the land. But what is the use of granting ex-servicemen a priority when they are not able to purchase their requirements of wire? That is what is happening in today. In Victoria, the land settlement of ex-servicemen is being held reup through this shortage. If we cannot the produce the goods which we require, we I must obtain them elsewhere. I have always held the opinion that Australia - is essentially - a - primary - producing country, - and although T strongly favour the development of ""our secondary industries in every way, ' I consider that they should 'be.an-adjunct to and should not'expand at 'the expense of the primary industries. Apparently, we must have tariff protection - to ibolster the 40-hour - week, and shield workers who are not giving maximum output. Primary producers are anxious and willing to .give maximum production, and suitable action should be taken 'to adjust this 'lack of balance - between primary and ""secondary - indus""tries. The barbed wire position in Australia is an excellent example .of the difficulties which .primary producers encounter in securing their requirements. My constituents find that their plant and equipment has deteriorated, and I emphasize that if the condition of .this machinery continues to deteriorate, production will be .reduced, and our population will face a reduction of its standard of living. .Secondary industries cannot:be built up permanently at the expense of the source. of their expansion, namely, the .primary industries. This .Government, with its socialist .outlook, appears to believe that itican develop secondary industries and attract ,pqpulation from the rural areas to the cities,, and .that Australia will tinue to prosper. History-has proved the fallacy .of that belief. The policy may succeed-for.a time Mr SDEDMAK;-This - Government ""has done .more to'decentralize industry than any 'previous .government. ' Mr TURNBULL - T f 'the Governhonorable ment persists with its present policy, Australians will 'not be able to retain --their present-standard'of living. Primary : producers .axe being 'menaced and 'harassed, and 'their production is being .affected in many ways which could - avoided. Therefore, in supporting amendment, I believe 'that 'T am acting in the best interests-of Australia, because - the :purpose is to 'increase production. 'The - Prime Minister and many other - honourable members opposite have stated - that we must increase production. Whnt --is the use of'that advocacy when nothing .practical is done'? It is as 'futile rgiving .an 'ex-serviceman a property, Tariff 'Proposals 1947. not making it possible for him to obtain - the materials - required to work it . : - Prompt action must 'be taken, 'to overcome these shortages if 'we are to make Australia a great .ndtion. Mr FAEKLNTJEB, (Eranklin) '[12.21'J. - I desire to'refer-to that part of item 291 which relates to timber,'bent-or cut into .shape, dressed or partly dressed. The'duty on .these imports from Canada has been reduced from So .per - cent, to 47^ per cent, ad valorem. I have in.mind .the importation of Canadian .case timber to - supply the Australian .fruit in dustry in .general, and the .requirements of Tasmanian fruit-growers in particular. Throughout Australia at the present time, there is a grave shortage of case timber for the fruit industry. This shortage is most serious in Tasmania where this year more than -6,000,000 cases of apples and pears ""will be available for export. 'Fruit growers are experiencing great difficulty in obtaining supplies of case 'timbeT. - Before the outbreak of World War II . , we imported a substantial quantity of Canadian wood for case timber, and some persons engaged in the fruit industry prefer it on the ground that the presentation-of their fruit, particularly on export - markets-as in-the United Kingdom, is of con- - a ""better character. At present, ;there is a shortage.of ithis Canadian timber, and a grave shortage of Australian 'timber 'for the case'industry. ' I suggest that - Canadian - timber for the case industry be imported under by-law, - nnd 'that, for the 'time being, the present duty should be waived. As the member for - Indi (Mr. MCEwen) mentioned, while there is such a shortage of Australian timber, the need to protect our own industry does not really arise. 'It will not do 'so until the local supply approximately equalizes be the demand. By removing the exist'the ing duty, we shall not imperil our own production and industry. If the Government is sincerely interested in the welfare of the fruit and timber industries, it can very well make this gestui'e, which will be of great help to fruit-growers, and permit the growth of their industry. I support rno9t as emphatically the remarks made by memand bers of the Australian 'Country party, aud I sbould like to hear the-replyof the Minister forPost-war Eeconstruction (Mr Dedman) on the subject.",28

71,Mr BIIAIN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"Northern Territory) [12.28] - I am surprised that;, ih the course of this discussion on the importation of timber, no honourable member has stressed the necessity fbr the conservation of our-- own forest resources. I am reminded of the wise words of our former Inspector-General of Forests, Mr C. E. disLane Pbole, who said, many years ago, I "" ""When weimport' tbo Tittle, we cut too the. much"".' These words are just as true today-as they were then. I remind honorthat ih relation to Queensland, the most richly endowed timber State of the Commonwealth, had therate: of cutting operating - ten years ago been allowed' to continue, the timber resources of of that State would"" have been depleted in years: To-day there is an urgent need' to import timber into this country, 1 not. only tb alleviate the present shortage,, 1 also tbprotect ourown forests. I ' I cancould'- speakalso of the effectsof the preserious' shortage of barbed/ wirein the northern portions of the Commonwealth, but-1 propose ai? this stage tb confine my cerremarks to item291 G whichdeals witn and - unsawn logs. I have conferred with-senior 1 officersof the Department of Trade and Customs and' they have informed me that now beingimported' from British. North Borneo-is subject, to a duty of only. 1%' per. cent; under the British, preferen: oft tial'tariff, plus; of course, the usual 5 per dutiescent, primage which is commonto both' Canadian and Eritish timbers. I congratulate the Government upon that concession, but why not go further and allow the free importation of timber from these areas. 1 Eor two years, I have been endeavouring to do the work of the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon) in the rebuilding of Darwin, but I have had no support at all for my efforts. Indeed, the Minister has now come under fire from the newly-elected Northern Territory Legislative Council which held its inaugural nieeting last week. Strong criticism was voiced by the member for Tennant Creek (Dr Webster), who is not a Government nominee, but a representative elected by the people. Eor two years I have been corresponding with the British North Borneo Timber Company with a view to having logs brought to Darwin. One firm in Darwin which has its own saw-milling equipment has asked me to make representations to the responsible Minister-I am not sure whebher it is the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Johnson) or the Minister for Works and Housing (Mr Lemmon), because one Minister "" passes the buck"" to the other-to have the logs shipped from Sandakan in North Borneo to Darwin in cattle ships returning to that port after carrying cattle to Manila. I have not been able to obtain a satisfactory reply from either Minister. I have received communications containing a mere mass of words, but no definite statement of poliey. When passing through Brisbane last Christmas, I noticed a report in the press that on the wharfs were large quantities of North Borneo logs consigned to Brett and Company Limited of Brisbane. Apparently this live-wire firm has been able to import the timber itself. I see no reason why Darwin should be hy-passed in favour of Brisbane. It is the duty of the Ministers who are concerned with the rebuilding of Darwin to ensure that adequate supplies of timber shall be made available for this purpose, instead of allowing the Darwin people themselves to bring timber in from the bush on their shoulders. Recently, an agent of the British North Borneo  during the war was interned by the Japanese in Borneo, visited New South Wales in an endeavour to purchase Mr Blain, machinery to rebuild the saw-mill at Sandakan. The latest information that I have from Harrisons Eamsay Proprietary Limited, one of whose senior officers, Mr Wearne, has just returned from Borneo, is that the company would bo pleased to make some arrangement to import logs. Why should I , as a private member, have to do a Minister's job? The Government confiscated land at Darwin. Why is it not attending to this matter? Two Ministers are directly in control of the territory, and the Minister for the Navy (Mr Eiordan) and the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) also have fingers in the pie. They are neglecting their duty by failing to attend to the territory, over which, jointly, they have full control. The time is overdue for a responsible Minister to visit New Guinea and the islands of the archipelago which stretches from the end of the Malay Peninsula to the Solomon Islands, with a view to making use of tlieir enormous timber resources to augment our local supplies, which are steadily being depleted. Of course, this Government is not likely to regard the potentialities of these islands seriously. It has never done so. Mr HABRISON .(Wentworth) [12.36'J. - As I understand the position, the Government is asking the committee to agree to a schedule which, it claims, will ensure the collection of approximately the same amount of duty as was formerly collected when values were calculated on a sterling basis. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction (Mr Dedman) has said that this amendment is merely a reflection of some agreement arising from the Ottawa Conference. That is true. However, as has been pointed out, circumstances have changed considerably since the Ottawa Agreement was negotiated. Circumstances within Australia are entirely different from what they were then. We all appreciate the seriousness of the bousing situation today. There is an urgent need to bring into Australia suitable softwoods to augment the limited supply of locally produced timber in order to accelerate our housing projects. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. Falkinder) has pointed out how the shortage of timber is limiting the production of cases. All of our shortages can be overcome and the wishes of honourable members on this side of the chamber can be met if the Minister will take notice of the suggestion which was made by the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), who opened this debate. The honourable member has had great experience of customs laws and procedure, and, in the light of my limited experience, I am happy to support his suggestion that timber be permitted to enter Australia under by-law, even if only for a limited period. Such an arrangement would allow the Government to continue to control the basic tariff schedules while, at the same time, permitting the free entry of timber to overtake local shortages.",30
72,Mr DEDMAN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,Actio n under by-law can still be taken even if we pass this measure.,32
73,Mr HARRISON,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"I know. That is the point. The honourable member for fndi (Mr MCEwen) has proposed an amendment about which I am. not too liappy. If the Minister would give the lionorable member an assurance that he would consider permitting the free entry of timber under by-law for a limited period, I am sure that the honourable member would withdraw the amendment and that there would be no need to divide the committee. The Minister should say, "" We recognize the great advantage that will accrue from having a surplus of softwood timbers in Australia, and therefore we consider, in the light of what has been revealed in this debate and of what has been said by timber interests generally, that consideration should be given to the importation of softwoods under by-law "". The implementation of the suggestion made by the honourable member for Balaclava would not adversely affect the millers. They are not likely to raise any objection. They are handling all the timber that they are capable of handling. We are badly in need of oregon. Honourable members have only to look at houses that are being erected in order to realise the seriousness of that shortage. Uncompleted houses are left waiting for roofing tiles for long periods, and the ber is exposed to the elements. This hardwood is usually put into the houses in a green or near-green condition and, before the tiles are finally put in place, it buckles so much that the workmen have difficulty in getting the tiles to sit flat. That is a common experience today. It would not occur if we had adequate supplies of oregon. Oregon does not suffer from exposure to the weather as does hardwood that has not been kiln-dried. It is not subject to the same stresses and strains. It is idea] for use as roofing timber and it should have a place in the development of oui housing schemes. 1 The restrictions now imposed upon the importation of timbers are so excessive that the casts of home-building are being unduly inflated. The duties specified in the schedule applied before the war, but then the demand for home-building was uot so keen as it is today. Furthermore, in addition to the duties, home-builders must pay primage and sales tax. This automatically forces up building costs. As other honourable members have pointed out, this Government is bloated with revenue There is no need whatever for it to insist upon'the collection of this revenue tariff, because our hardwood industries are not now in need of protection. It is obvious that the Government is using this tariff solely as a means of gaining revenue, a process which is causing unnecessary inflation of building costs. The difficulty can be resolved by the Minister saying to the honourable member for Indi that the Government will consider permitting the entry of timber under by-law for a limited period. I am sure that the honourable member would thereupon withdraw his amendment. Surely the Minister should be in a position to give consideration to this reasonable suggestion. I draw attention now to remarks of the honourable member for Franklin. Tasmania has produced a record crop of apples this year, but the growers have only an extremely limited quantity of cases in which to pack the crop. They have been promised that ships will call to take the apples overseas, but they are made suspicious of the Government tim- because it has now changed the method of assessing the crop and has announced that growers will be paid only for the apples actually delivered. They have not enough cases to handle their crop and it ieems that' the Government is not providing-for. the manufacture of the cases necessary for the growers toeffect deliveries ",32
74,The CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TABI FF,Order! honourable-member's^ remarksare not* reflated to the subject'before the Chair;,33
75,Mr HAEEISON,CUSTOMS TABI FF,"My remarks are intended as an illustration of the timber shortage. The point is that, the timber required to make cases for the. apple, crop in Tasmania is not procurable. If the Governmentagreed' to permit the entry of timber under by-law; it would be avail* able. T was told by a prominent man associated' with the case-making industry in Tasmania that manufacturers today are cutting up timber that normally would be used for the manufacture of furniture. That indicatesthe extreme seriousness^ of the timber shortage.",33

Timbw: ' Controller approximately five years ago discloses 'that not-nearly sufficient .timber is grown in Australia to .meet - local requirements, and that is something which - the .Government .should Ibear in mind - when considering uts - tariff ^policy. Some people contend that the absence ""of overseas timber iresults in the cutting-of-.more timber in this country than is desirable, and there is something in that contention. E was a member of the Commonwealth housing.commission which,iin conjunction wit h other'investigations regarding housing, inquired into the supply - of .building materials. HOuring our 'investigation, we were inf ormed by a government timber expert that the standing timber available in this country was insufficient to meet local requirements, and that the prospects of an adequate ^supply in years to'come were disturbing. It was impressed ""upon us that more'Queensland timber should be utilized, but, at the same time, it was apparent that if .the standing .timber in that State .continued to be cut, without adequate Te-afforestation being 'undertaken, the .supply from that State - would not .continue for very long. Furthermore, consideration of the welfare of Australia requires that regard be had to the needs,of every State. Three-ply timber is also included in'the proposals before us. Although it may be necessary to impose - a tariff duty on 3-,ply .timber coming into this eountry, some - States - should not .be. penalized in order that 3-ply timber may be made ; available by others. As an illustration of - what I mean, Queensland 3-ply w.ood cannot.be.obtained:for use.in South Australia unless we are prepared to'accept a certain quantity of ready-made doors. When .the Parliament agreed.originally to place a duty on imported'3-ply wood to encourage the .Queensland timber industry, I do not think that it intended that residents of one State should be at a disadvantage as compared with those of ^another'. Of course, Government control is not responsible for the shortage of 3-ply .wood in.:South.Australia. .1 want tounake ""tlrat quite clear, because that shortage has come about - solely by 'the action of - private interests.

Some J years ago the timber industry established logging mills to cut oregon logs in .South Australia,'but'those timber mills in that State have since ceased operation, with the result that'much cheap, o'ffcut timber is no longer available. In their interests, as well as in ""the interests of all Aus; tralians, I again ask the .Government 'to abolish entirely the duty on - imported oregon logs. Progress reported.
