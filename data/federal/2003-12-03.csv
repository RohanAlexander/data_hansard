It is clearly holding seminars on how to invest your money who another group who are doing almost exactly the same which is property, who are unregulated. So I think that. So the Governor of the Reserve Bank is clearly given extra powers to cover these people, because not property advice alone.

NA Somebody should ask the question: do they really ters go forward so we do not have a disaster, way in which the political people in Victoria, directed their authorities not to cooperate In the additional comments that I have what we have heard and, in particular, to look some of the state governments, particularly able and unfortunate. They were predictable they did not give evidence, they did not put and the member for Corangamite rightly said, but they had the personnel to come along to all they did. It was predictable that they would political colleagues in the federal parliament ommendations. So I do not think they gave it the report before they commented. In fact, in New South Wales the Minister Minister for Emergency Services and Minister Tony Kelly, along with the Minister for the put out a joint press release. It was a 2½ page committee, on me and, I guess, on their own cause they were part of the committee. But They clearly had not read the One of the most disturbing aspects was that, release from two New South Wales ministers, senior public servants in that state: the Rural the Deputy Director General of the Department Fleming. I think it is a disgrace to bring those lease that is making comment on and rubbishing think it is a demonstration of the arrogance the head-in-the-sand attitude that they have prehensive.

The reactions from New South Wales and Victoria, were both predictin that they did not cooperate with the inquiry, in submissions and, as the member for Gilmore they claimed they did not have the personnel the hearings and take copious notes, so clearly come out and knock the report, even though their supported the report and supported all 59 rectoo much thought and I do not think they read for Rural Affairs, Minister for Local Government, assisting the Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and Attorney General, Bob Debus, press release of absolute political attack on the Labor colleagues in the federal parliament, beit was absolute nonsense that they went on with. report before they put that out. in the middle of a very highly political press there is reference to and comment from two Fire Service Commissioner, Phil Koperberg; and of Environment and Conservation, Dr Tony senior public servants into a political press reour inquiry.

This is the expertise and They will use this report, and they will use might regret their actions in the longer term. Some of the other feedback and comments Victorian Farmers Federation said: At last there is a Government document that proposes safety and conditions of rural and regional communities. The contrast between this report and the The recommendations of the report, aptly titled have listened to the concerns of farmers and rural summer. In contrast to the Victorian report, the federal burning and public reporting of the achievements They also go on to say: The recommendation to abolish the fire services equitable rate on property is wholeheartedly It is interesting that the Victorian minister said that we, federal politicians, were not qualified pid comment he made then-when commenting off insurance and just apply it to rates, because is a new tax; it is a poll tax.' What a stupid New South Wales more recently has come out insurance and applied to rates. So they have any credit to the report. I also noticed the other day that Bob Carr sources for rapid responses to fires. These drop in behind the lines, and this will allow came out saying: ‘Rapid response? Do you want not read the report either. Now, a few weeks later, come out and say: ‘Yes, we are doing this. We response situation.' I do not care if they do not is that they do continue to act on it. I have a few other concerns, though.
