I hope to be able to deal with it some time today, and to inform Inter-State members before they leave for their homes what course the Government proposes to take. SINKING OF THEEMDEN . CRITICISM OF CAPTAIN GLOSSOP.  ister for the N a v y ) [11.7] -(B y leave.) - I notice that during iny recent absence in Sydney the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Mathews) made some very grave reflections on Captain Glossop, and to be charitable theo n l y conclusion I can come to is that he was speaking without full knowledge of the facts - The honourable member criticised adversely Captain Glossop's handling of H . M . A . S . Sydney in the duel with the German light cruiser Emden. In the first place, I would point out that the loss of life on the Sydney was small. Out of a complement of 400, three men were killed wounded. The best Naval opinion is that the action against the Emden was ably and skilfully fought. The officer most exposed to the enemy's fire was Captain Glossop himself, as shown by the fact that the first casualty occurred beside him on the bridge. The Admiralty's' appreciation of his work was shown by the conferring on him of the Most Honourable Order of the Companion of the Bath. I trust that no more of these unwarranted attacks will be made upon a distinguished officer, who by his prompt and efficient action made the name of Australia ring throughout the civilized world by ridding the Empire of a raider which had done millions of pounds worth of damage.",23
14,Mr MATHEWS,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"I shall enlarge upon the subject at the first opportunity. There should not have been any casualties on the Sydney.  It will while the honourable member was speaking the honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr . Atkinson), by way of interjection, said that Captain Glossop had been disrated. In this instance also I feel sure that the honourable member spoke without full knowledge of the facts; otherwise he would not have made such a statement. Captain Glossop has not been disrated on any occasion in connection with this matter.",23
15,Mr ATKINSON,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"B y way of personal explanation, I desire to say that in - using the word "" disrated,"" I was under the impression from statements that had been frequently made that Captain Glossop had been disrated, or had, at least, teen deprived of the command of the Sydney, because, in the engagement in question, he took his vessel too close ta the Emden. I was led to interject as I did, because I thought that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Mathews) in his references to Captain Glossop,was not treating the Government fairly. He appeared to me to be endeavouring to show that the Government had promoted Captain Glossop to a higher position, and that his treatment was different fro m that extended to men in the ranks. I am very glad to learn that Captain Glossop was not disrated. and fifteen . Mr MATHEWS - I also desire to make a personal explanation. The Act has not explained the actual situation. On the occasion to which he has referred, I was trying to distinguish between the punishment meted out to the lower-paid men of the Australian Navy, and the treatment of those of the highly-paid ranks. The authorities which the Minister has quoted are not the only ones that might be cited with regard to Captain Glossop's handling of the Sydney in the encounter in question. It is well known that the Sydney, with its 'guns of longer range and greater calibre than those, of the Emden, should have been able to engage her without coming within her range of fire ",23
16,Mr SAMPSON,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"On a point order,",24
17,Mr SPEAKER,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N," Order! The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, instead of making a personal explanation, is now debating the subject-matter of Captain Glossop's handling of the Sydney in the engagement with the Emden. That is outside the scope of a personal explanation.",24
18,Mr MATHEWS,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"Well, "" if I am to be blocked now, I will raise the question in another form. Mr SPEAKER . ^ I would remind honourable miambers that, under cover of making a personal explanation, it is not permissible to debate the subject-matter that has 'been raised. It is, however, permissible to correct a misstatement or misunderstanding .",24
19,Mr MATHEWS,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"Then , Mr Speaker, you ought not to have allowed the Minister to speak as he did.",24
20,Mr SPEAKER,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"Order ! The Ministei obtained leave ito make, not a personal explanation, but a statement, which is an entirely different matter. The honourable member, if he wishes to make a statement, should ask for leave of the House to do so.",24
21,Mr MAHONY,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"It was a very one-sided statement. Mr SPEAKER,-Order !",24
22,Mr MATHEWS,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N," I deister sire to state that I did not attack Captain Glossop, - although I should have done I simply drew a comparison between the treatment of officers and the treatment men in the lower najniks. I may say, ever, that at the time the columns newspapers were teeming with condemnations of Captain Glossop in connection with the Sydney-Emdcn fight; in fact, suggestion was made that he ought to be giving it attention. court martialled. If tire Minister thinks that I have done an injustice to this officer, let him be tried by some court rmartial. He will then see whether tain Glossop is not condemned for itibe gulations. m'anner in which he fought his ship.

Failing that, will he permit private enterprise to bring coal here, and to distribute it to the best advantage? ,",24
24,Mr WATT,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"I appreciate the 'anxiety of the honourable member, and many others, ito discuss at this stage the strike position in all its bearings, but since tihe struggle may be a very serious and protracted one, I should in future prefer thlat notice be given of all questions relating to it.

Some honourable members, like myself, travel each week from 1,200 to 2,000 miles in order to serve in this Parliament, and we are invariably put in the worse compartments in the. train. The carriages in which we have to travel are constantly placed in the worse position in the make-up of the train.

43,Mr WISE,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"Some delay took place owing to the illness of Captain Combes, the secretary of the Peace Celebrations Committee, but the distribution of the medals is now proceeding as rapidly as possible.",27
44,Mr ARCHIBALD,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"Will the Government consider the question of distributing these medals, not only to children attending school, but also to children who are not of school age; because, obviously, in after years, tliere will be a distinction between the children who have been able to secure the medals and those who were not old enough to attend schools 1",27
45,Mr WATT,SANITARY ARRANGEMENTS I N,"When the Celebrations Committee was appointed under the presidency of the honourable member for Nepean (Mr Orchard), and the medal question was considered, the Government expressed its desire that every child in Austraha should receive a medal on the proclamation of peace. I realise that there are many difficulties in the matter of distribution to children of tender age, but I suggested to the honourable member for Nepean, and I . think he has already dealt with the matter, that, on the application of parents, medals be provided for children in arms, so that it may be said that every child alive, within the Commonwealth, when peace was declared, received a token commemorating the event.

49,Mr WATT,NATION AL FEDERATION,"I am not in a position to do that at present, as I have not had definite details as to how the £10,000,000 worth of wheat, which the Prime M in ister (Mr Hughes) has succeeded in sell1 ing in London, is to be paid for.

51,Mr WATT,NATION AL FEDERATION,"My honourable friend is quite right when he says he is not usually so persistent, but he does convey the impression, sometimes, that he is a very pood substitute for persistency. I have communicated with the Ministers in charge of those Departments. I have received some replies, but I have not yet had time to deal with them. As soon as I have a chance to analyze them. I shall be able to see how far public policy ought to condition the making known of the information referred to, particularly that relating the Attorneyto one James Mathews.

As we have already had over half-an-hour of crossfiring on questions without notice, I suggest we might proceed with the questions on notice, and get to the business of the day. PERSONAL EXPLANATION . invitation.",28
58,Mr FINLAYSON,PUBLI C SERVICE,I desire to make a personal explanation concerning some misleading and untrue remarks made by the honourable member for' Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) yesterday. Mr SPEAI£ER (Hon. W. Elliot Johnson) - Order! The honourable member must withdraw that statement.,28
59,Mr FINLAYSON,PUBLI C SERVICE,"I will withdraw the word ""untrue,"" Mr Speaker, and substitute "" annoying "" for it. The remarks made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh induced me yesterday to use language which was quite unparliamentary, and, at your request, I withdrew it. The honourable member yesterday, referring to my political life, said that I had never voted Labour until I had voted for myself. The statement, in a somewhat similar form, was ' made previously by the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom), 10655 and by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), but I took little notice of it because it came from my political opponents, and manifestly it was made for political purposes. I do object, however, when an honourable member who deserted his own party in its time of trouble and trial accuses me of being false politically; and I think I have a right to inform the House and my constituents, who obviously were meant to be impressed by the statement, of the facts concerning my political career. I entered this House in 1910 at the very urgent request of two particularly honoured Labour representatives, Mr Hinchcliffe, M.L.C, of Queensland, and David Bowman, ex-Leader of the Labour party in that State. I have often told them since that the only grudge I have against them was that they induced me to leave a comfortable position in private life for the political arena.",28
60,Mr JOWETT,PUBLI C SERVICE,We all agree with that.,28
61,Mr FINLAYSON,PUBLI C SERVICE,"Prio r to that time, and particularly during the 1906 Federal election, I took a very active part in support of the Labour candidate, Dr Culpin, and at a'bout the same time. I was urgently requested to submit myself as a Labour candidate for Warwick in the State Parliament; but I declined the Prior to that, and during the 1904 Federal election, I actively supported the candidature of Dr Culpin against the two opposing Liberal candidates. Prior to that again, and while in Maryborough, as the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) is well aware, I identified myself with the Labour candidate, . Mr Norman, amd the Independent candidate, Mr Stafford, in opposition to the Liberal candidates, Mr Annear and Mr Bartholomew. From the time of my arrival in Australia in 1887, I have always taken an active part in temperance work, and' whilst occupying an official position in that movement, I kept myself free from membership in any political party, because I believe that the temperance question should not be the plaything of party politics. I believe that the temperance movement is in a faulty position today, because its leaders bave not followed a wise policy in this regard.",28
62,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLI C SERVICE,Order ! The honourable member cannot go into that question on a personal explanation.,29
63,Mr FINLAYSON,PUBLI C SERVICE,"I realise 'that, Mr Speaker, and will not continue. While I was in Maryborough, which is in the Wide Bay electorate, I was repeatedly approached by Labour supporters with requests to submit myself as a candidate for the State Parliament, but I persistently declined. Some time later I was approached, on behalf of Mr . Kidston, the then Premier of Queensland, with a very tempting offer of subsequent promotion if I would contest the Oxley electorate against Mr Denham, the ex-Premier.",29
64,Mr WATT,PUBLI C SERVICE,Evidentl y you have been very popular.,29
65,Mr FINLAYSON,PUBLI C SERVICE,I can say at all events that I have been more successful than most men in resisting temptations to enter politics.,29
66,Mr KELLV,PUBLI C SERVICE,O r to leave politics. We understand Mr Ryan wants to get in here.,29
67,Mr FINLAYSON,PUBLI C SERVICE,"Perhaps I cannot better explain my position than by reminding honourable members of the Shakspearian quotationWho Steals my purse steals trash: 'tis something-, nothing; J Tww mine, 'tis his, arid has been slave to thousands; But he that filches from me my good name Kobs nie of that which not enriches him,. Aiid makes me poor indeed. Those honourable members have deliberately tried to rob me of my good name, which I remind them is as dear to ine as, perhaps, theirs is 'to them. What I have said is, I think , a sufficient answer to the statements made about my political life. Those honourable gentlemenparticularly the two Queensland members referred to "" in u s t know that never at any time was I a member o r supporter x>f the Liberal party, nor have I ever been in any way identified with it . I hope, therefore, that I have heard the last of these suggestions. NA .

69,Mr SPEAKER,INFLUENZ AAT LIVERPOOL," I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Swan (Mr Corboy) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The appointment of certain persons to the Commonwealth Public Service in West Australia, and the effect of such appointme>nts on certain other persons."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",29
70,Mr CORBOY,INFLUENZ AAT LIVERPOOL,"Swan) [11.45] - I am in receipt of the following telegram from - the secretary of the Returned Soldiers Association in Perth : Federal Taxation Department eastern States_ sending over returned soldiers who have qualified in eastern States to take place of temporary clerks returned soldiers employed here. We object to introduction of men from east for these positions, contending it is a case of repatriating eastern returned soldiers at' the expense of local returned soldiers. There are only a limited number of positions to fill in Western Australia, and by introducing men from other States there will be no positions for those men who are returning and who will desire to qualify for positions in the Service. Please note that the salary paid to these men coming over is approximately l is . 3d. per day. Minimum rate in this State for temporary officers 12s. Od. During the last two years there has been a decided d r if t <of men from the eastern States to Western Australia to occupy the better-paid positions in the Service there. That has Veen especially noticeable in the Defence Department. In the present instance the complaint is agaanst the Taxation Department. We do not enjoy a reciprocal transfer of men from Western Australia to the eastern States, CAM P. and I think the position of returned soldiers in the West, who desjre to qualify for the Service, is being unjustly prejudiced by the sendingover of men from the eastern States. I ask for some definite pronouncement on this matter from the Acting Prime Minister, because, when in the past, we have protested against Defence Department appointments of this kind, we have been informed that for the purposes of the Public Service - the Government regard the Commonwealth as a whole, and take n-o notice of State boundaries. However, this operates unjustly against the returned soldiers in a State which did its part in the war extremely well. We, in this House, should now do our part in seeins; that the positions in Western Australia are kept for the men"" from that State wbo did the job' at the Front.",29
71,Mr WATT,INFLUENZ AAT LIVERPOOL,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [11.48] - The honourable member for Swan was courteous enough to show me the telegram when I entered the Chamber this morning, but I have not been able to get from the Department the papers relating to the case. I do not know whether or not the allegations made in the telegram are substantially correct, or whether, if they are, the practice referred to is followed at the instance of the Commissioner of Taxation, or is inter-departmental. All I can say at this stage is that the Government has laid down no policy of the kind indicated. The sending of officers to Western Australia appears to be an automatic, operation of the Commonwealth Public Service machine. But if I were a resident of the West, and saw a d r if t of officers from the eastern States to the disadvantage of Western men, whether returned soldiers or not, I should be inclined to voice the indignation of the Western State. Of course, the theory is generally held that the Commonwealth Servioe is one body throughout Australia, and many transfers to Defence Department positions and others have teen made that are of a thoroughly reciprocal nature. That is the only way in which promotion can be gained in certain branches of the Service. However, if the honourable member for Swan will be content with this answer for today, I shall inquire into the matter and furnishh i m , as earlv as possible next week, with a more definite reply.

Failing fulfilment of this undertaking men were charged with the value of the overcoat. The return of the greatcoat was considered necessary in order to maintain adequate supplies for A.I.F. requirements, including re-issues to troops overseas. The cessation of hostilities, and the rapidity with which our troops are returning has, however, enabled a stock to be accumulated in Australia, and it is no longer necessary to insist on the return of the articles in question; consequently, instructions have heen given that all returning members of the A.I.F. may retain, without payment, the greatcoats on issue to them.

It was approved hy the Cabinet that the pay of the Royal Australian Garrison A rtillery bfc equalized to that of mobilized Australian Garrison Artillery (M i l it i a ) rates the payment of a war Allowance for the period of the war, to date from 1st July, 1917. This concession was also extended to certain other units of the Permanent Forces. As the highest rank below "" Commissioned"" officer in the A.G.A.

Warrant Officers and Non-commissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff, who were practically employed seven days per week in Australian Imperial Force Camps and Schools of Instruction, were paid extra duty pay, at the rate of Is. 6d. per diem, whilst so employed. This payment was reviewed in 1917; and, in view of the fact that the work had somewhat eased down, the payment of extra duty pay was superseded by the granting of a Saily allowance of 9d. to all Warrant and Noncommissioned Officers of the Instructional Staff, and was likewise extended to members of the Survey Corps and Provost Staff. It was never intended that any member of the Permanent Forces should be adversely affected, but that they should be placed on at least an equal footing 'to mobilized members of the A.G.A. At the same time, it was not in tended that any member of the Permanent Forces already in receipt of pay and allowances greater in total than was payable to members of the A.G.A., of corresponding rank, should receive any additional payment.

The reasons for cancellation and payments were that the Government considered it sound policy, after the conclusion of the war, not to complete the contracts for wooden ships; and the payments made included progress payments by and covered contractors' liabilities, as well as some measure of compensation. Advice has been received from the Commissioner for Australia in the United States, indicating that contracts for building 385 wooden vessels were cancelled by the American' Government, at an average cost of £13 5s. 4d. per ton, or a total cost of £14,942,S77; and that they further cancelled the building of fifty-two ships, at a cost rather more than that involved in the cancellation of the 385 ships.

The sacks were sold under ordinary trade conditions, and as the quantity in the hands of the Government represented only a small proportion of the total required for a normal harvest any attempt to impose special conditions in the interests of the farmers would have liad the effect of preventing the trade from purchasing them.

Is it a fact that many complaints are arising from the system from soldiers claiming pensions? -3. Will he arrange for the members of the final Medical Board to, simultaneously with examination of the individual soldier, review the previous - medical history of each soldier ? M i -. WISE - The answers to the h o n orable member's questions are as f o l low :1. The present system of medically examining members of the Australian Imperial Force on disembarkation is not cursory, and is considered more satisfactory than any alternative method. Men arriving from overseas are anxious to have their cases dealt with by a Medical Board as soon as possible, and this is achieved aftor scrutiny by a Board of experienced Medical Officers. Delay is not only unpopular with the men, but allows injuries and illnesses to become aggravated in the interval, while useless expense to the Commonwealth is caused. 2. Only a very few complaints areknown to this Department, and of these several were unjustifiable. 3. The previous medical history, if available, is invariably considered at the .time of examination. The instructions issued to the Commandant, Australian Imperial Force, Headquarters, London, provide that a ll medical history papers shall be placed on the same transport as the men embark on. A full medical examination is also made of the - men while on the transports, and this is in the hands of the Examining Board.

Soldiers' on active service have always been liable! to pay tax on any income from property derived from sources within Australia provided it amounted to £100 in the case of a single person without dependants, or to more than £156 in the case of persons with dependants. Munition workers have never been exempt from taxation on any part of their Australian income, because they were not on active service outside Australia with the'Naval or Military Forces of the Commonwealth, or any part of the King's Dominions, or of an Ally of G-reat Britain, as provided by section 13 of the Act.

To facilitate business and avoid loss of time, latitude was permitted to States in making sales of inferior wheat without reference to the Australian Wheat Board, the basis f.a.q. price, however, being fixed by the Board. As States were debited by the Board with the f.a.q. rate, even though a considerably lower price might be realized, it was to the advantage of the States to obtain a* high a price as possible, and the interests of the Australian Pool were safeguarded. The practice was to report such sales immediately to the Australian Wheat Board, which thereupon issued a contract note. The New South Wales sale referred to was not so reported. ""WHEAT POOL. ' 5. Yes; the quantit}', however, was 72,000 tons. SALES TO JAPAN. C. This is not known to the Australian Wheat Board, sales to millers being made by the State offices. 7. Yes. 8. The Australian Wheat Board asked for information. The reply received was that the Minister of Agriculture-, Sydney, would make, an explanation to the Wheat meeting. 9. No. Seuator .Russell arranged matter should he dealt with at the next meeting of the Board. 10. Under the system in force at the time the sale was made, the loss, if the wheat sold below its value, would have been confined low :to the New South Wales Pool. This system, was altered at the meeting of the Wheat Board held in May, with the result that if the wheat had been sold substantially below its value,, Australian Fool , as Well as the New South Wales Pool, would have suffered loss. As no sample of the wheat sold has been to the Australian Wheat Board, it is not known by the Board whether or not there has been auy loss. 11. The New South Wales State Wheat Office is under the control of the Government New South Wales, and, therefore, any requests for the investigation of the working of that ofiice should be made to the Premier State.. The Minister of Agriculture for New South Wales explained the circumstances of the Georgeson sale to a full meeting of the Australian Wheat Board in May, at which growers' representatives from all the States were present.

If honourable members will examine the Bill they will . note that it purports to continue in foroe the regulations set out in extenso in the schedules.

The Government that if it were deemed necessary to ex tend any of the War Precautions Regulations beyond the specified period of three months after the expiration of the war, they would ask for specific authority. Two other activities, to which I have not today referred, are sugar and wheat. That part of the Bill dealing with sugar is simply a reproduction of existing regulations.

207,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That is so. In dealing with large concerns it is absolutely essential to be able, to make contracts for definite periods. That has been a great security to Australia to have these contracts made for definite periods. It has undertook led to a feeling of confidence in the comr munity. This Bill covers only the periods of those contracts, and enables these activities to be carried on in order that the contracts may be fulfilled.",47

We had the power conferred by this Bill before, or we do not possess it now. That is certain. power to deal with these matters under the Constitution, war or no war, dr we had not. The gentlemen who certify to the competence of this Parliament to pass this Bill do not refer to the war in any shape or form.

The Melbourne members of the Committee, consisting of Sir Edward Mitchell, Mr . Sir Edward Campbell, Mr Starke, and Professor Harrison Moore, state: We have carefully considered this Bill, and are of opinion that it is within the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament. T. guarantee that if any firm in Melbourne desires to fight the Commonwealth Government on this matter in the High Court any of these gentlemen will be prepared to accept' a brief to conduct their case. Every one knows quite well that the High Court would take no notice whatever of the certificate which these gentlemen have given. The Court would consider only the Bill itself, if a case were brought before it under the measure. It would not consider what might have been said in Parliament. ' The Court would consider merely whether, in its opinion, the law was valid or not. My hope is that we have this power to fix prices which these gentlemen say that we have. If we have the power to fix the price of sugar u n t i l the 30th September, .1920, we have the power to fix the price of any and every commodity which We had the any person consumes in this country.",48
220,Mr BOYD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,And up to 1990.,48
221,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"If we have the power to fix the price up to 1920, then I agree with the honourable member that we have the power to fix it up to 1990. My mind goes back to the first case taken under the price-fixing regulations, that of Burvett v. Farey. Burvett was the detective employed by the Department, and Farey was-, a baker in K.ew or Hawthorn. I was a member of the Government at the time that case came before the High Court, and wag very much interested, to know whether we had the power to deal with price-fixing. The Crown Law Department had up to that date contended that we had no such power. in June, 1916, two or three months before I left the Government, a decision on the question was given in the High Court. Chief Justice Griffith said that the case of Burvett v. Farey raised a Defence matter, and that the action of the defendant affected recruiting in the Commonwealth. The question whether the money allotted by a soldier to his dependants was sufficient to buy bread and other commodities depended on their, price, and he held that the fixing of the price of bread was within the Defence powers of the Commonwealth.",48

We Bill were kepthere until a quarter to 2 o'clock this morning, and had to come back at 11 o'clock. That is over the odds. I have not had the time to look up this question and read the judgments which have been delivered in connection .with it . I can only speak of them from memory. Mr Justice Higgins and Mr Justice Isaacs gave judgments which were in aceord with the decisions they have given Early throughout, backing up the Federal powers and giving them the widest interpretation. Speaking from, memory, in the cases to which I have referred four of the Judges of the High Court said that we have the power to deal with the fixing of prices. I think that Mr Justice Duffy and Mr Justice Rich said that we have not that power. The gentlemen who have giventheir certificate in connection with this measure say that we have the power . The New South Wales members of the Committee supplied the following certificate: We have carefully considered this Bill, and of opinion that it is within the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament, subject,, as Part IT. (Sugar)., to the proviso that the Bill becomes law before the termination I may mention that the part dealing with is the only part of the Bill in which specific reference is made to price fixing, although there is a reference to it in one of the butter regulations. The proviso bewhich the Sydney members of the Comconsider necessary means that any Bill which we desire to pass dealing, with fixing, must be passed, before the termination of the war and Mr Hemsley incorrect. telegraphed' to sayKnox and I understand ""termination' of I war"" to be ""exchange of ratifications."" next According to thesegentlemen,, who take the* most circumscribed, view ofi - the to be valid! thisB ill , or any part dealing with price fixing ajid amy provision of the kinid introduced int o it , must be passed, before the exchange of - Mr HECTOR LAMOND- - They do not say thatanythingwhich may be' put into the Bill! wilM be legal:,, brafe that th«' ccsnitinuainioe-. of existing contracts' wilL be legal. There are na new contracts, iin the 1",49
230,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"If we have the power to deal with this matter nearly two years after the signing of the armistice and about fifteen months after the signing of peace, I say that we have the power to deal withit for an indefinite period. The Acting Attorney-General (Mr . Groom), in dealing with the dairy produce regulations, said, in reference to the dairy seasonThis season will terminate on the 31st August,' 1920, and the Bill provides for the extension of the regulations up to that date. If honourable members w i ll look at the regulationsdealing with dairy produce set out in the schedule they will find that they cover six or seven pages of the measure, though there is only one line dealing with the subject in the Bill itself. There are some amendments that I desire to move in the Dairy Produce Regulations when we reach the Committee stage. In reference to the Dairy Produce Control Committee, the Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom), when introducing the Bill , said It was decided, therefore, to form a Pool to provide against this expected shortage. Committees chosen hy the dairying and commercial interests concerned were set up in the various States, with a central committee,, of which the Chief Prices Commissioner in Melbourne was the chairman. A conference was held in Melbourne, and another, later on, in Sydney, at which certain recommendations w«re made, add approved by the Government. The honourable gentleman then referred to the amount of butter dealt with, and went on to sayThe Committee consisted of the Ministerwho is chairman- a deputy chairman appointed by the Minister, three nominees of the Commonwealth Government, the Commonwealth Dairy Expert, two representatives for each] of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the butter factories in those States, one representative for each of the States of South Australia and Tasmania in respect of the butter factories in those States, and one representative for each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland in respect of the cheese factories, in those States. The representatives of the producers in the various States were elected' by ballot held on 14th October, 1918. Immediately upon the ballot being taken the Comlmittee formerly inexistence voluntarily retired! and handed over to the newly-elected body It will be observed that the CommonwealthDairy Expert is. to have no vote; that is, the only employee of the Commonwealth ' Governmentwho is on the Committee is not allowed to vote^ although the employees of the State Governments are. As I pointed out the other evening, there are fifteen persons on this Committee, and, although the producers, the manufacturers' agents, and others are represented, there is no representative of the consumers. If I , when Minister of Customs, had appointed a committee consisting of fifteen consumers only, without any representation for producers or agents, what would bave been said? 1 trust that, in Committee, honourable members will see the advisability of providing for at least some representation of the consumers, who are certainly as important and as much entitled to it as. are producers, and agents. The Acting Attorney-General will , I hope, agree that on all committees of the kind, not only employers, buyers amd sellers-the latter of whom produce nothing, being merely agents or brokers-bu t also consumers, shall be represented. Speaking of brokers, I remember ex-Senator Trenwith , at the time of the Kyabram movement, some yeara ago, saying that it was worked by "" sharebrokers, pawnbrokers, and stony-brokers ' ' ; and I certainly think the consumers will be the "" stony-brokers ' ' if they are not allowed to have some say in the fixing of prices. We require information in regard to some of the regulations, which are certainly the most important part of the Bill - indeed , one regulation is more important than the whole of the fourteen .clauses. No. 5 of the Dairy Produce Regulations is as follows: Members of the Committee;, other than the Minister, may be paid, from moneys, held by the Committee, such, sums' asremunerationor expenses as the Minister may from time to time authorize; The Government, of course, are all powerful,, and may appoint whom they like, and pay the-members of the Committee as they choose; and it is in regard to this, that information is necessary. We know the personnel of various Pools, and are told that in connection therewith, certain gentlemen give their services free.",50

232,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,They may or may not give their services.,51
233,Mr FENTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,They are entitled to payment.,51
234,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Of course; members of the Pool have been entitled to pay all along, and some have received it for out? of-pocket expenses, and, no doubt, for services Rendered. I remember that when the Labour party were in offi.ce, some of the gentlemen now on the Government benches were very persistent with questions as to what this or . that member of any committee received for his services; and it is only fair that information of that kind should be given now.",51

242,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I take it that they are paid by the Pool.,51
243,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Then the ments will not be extravagant.,51
244,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I presume the payments are made out of the moneys of the Peol, and not out of the Commonwealth revenue.",51
245,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,In all the cases of which I have any knowledge the committees are paid by the Pools.,51
246,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,So far as I know there has never yet been a complete statement of the operations of some of these Pools; and so long as only one interest is represented we are not likely to get any statement! Possibly the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) thinks that only one' section of the community is entitled to representation. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs- a position which my generous friends on the press said I occupied by pure accident- I was accused of concerning myself with one interest only.,51
247,Mr BRENNAN,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"It must have been more than an accident, and rather a coincidence, because the honourable member was Minister several times.",51
248,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"In any case, it was said that I was concerned with only one in terest, and that was the interest of the all paconsumer. My opinion, however, is that all sections have a right to be represented.",51
249,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Can - you tell me what interest of the consumer his representative could conserve in the business management of a business, apart from the price, which the Committee does not control.",51
250,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"But the Government have the control, and will take the advice of the members of the Committee. An y Minister must have expert advice, for no matter who or what he is, he cannot know everything about everything.",51
251,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,That is true.,51
252,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"T he Department of Trade and Customs has to be continually calling in experts, and probably today experts are being consulted in every State of the Commonwealth.",51
253,Mr BAMFORD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,And a very wise thing.,51
254,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Of course.,51
255,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The consumer is concerned only with price and quality. Quality is fixed by the Government pay- graders, and the Chief Prices Commissioner fixes the price on the evidence tendered.",51
256,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"But directly this Bill is passed, the Chief Prices Commissioner will find his work finished.",51
257,Mr MASSYGREENE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable member is quite in error. The powers of the Chief Prices Commissioner under the War Precautions regulations are incorporated in the Bill , and will continue.",51
258,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"An election must take place before September, 1920, and before the operations of the. Butter Pool come to an end; and it is within the bounds of possibility that the present Government may be displaced.",51

This told me that - he had had a .witness before him to .whom he put the .question, The witness immediately replied,- ""Wihen I ask the boss for a rise, and he says that will not 'give it to me, then ,you ihave had they an industrial dispute.""",53
293,Mr BOYD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I suppose ^tihiat the Oourt would aTgue in ' thei isam© way over the question of whether there is a strike in an interexistence at the present - time.,53
294,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Most people would say that there ds an industrial dispute in our fix midst. The Government propose in this Bill to dea! with only f o u r o r five commodities. They have already fixed the price of sugar. TJnder .this measure liiey desire ito fix the price of every commodity exported overseas. But, 'while we - send only aibouit onie-fifth of our butter production (overseas, it - must be remembered Prethat the whole of ithe - sugar inanuf actae d shall in Australia is consumed locally, and has that we are obliged to import more. It is. now - proposed to fix th© price of this and - ttn'ticOe, not only at the m ill , but also the price at w^hioh it shall be retailed. Consequently the Legal 'Committee, by and their opinion, affirmed that this Parlia-memt possesses the power to fix tibe wholeas sale and retail price of sagar arnitil September, 19.20. While tilie present juncthe War Precautions Act and of the regulations framed under it , it is significant that the Government are anxious to abandon their power to . control prices. They have accordingly (handed this power over to the States, saying, "" We must iio longer deal iwitlh this matter."" Yet, according to the opinion which I have quoted, they 'possess the power to deal with it . eternally, so long as we pass the Bill before the "" exchange of ratificationis."" It is interesting to look back upon the .history of this sugar business. four or five weeks of the outbreak of war, the party which I have the honour to lead was returned by the electors of this country with a majority. W it h in a period of twenty-four hours after the Labour Ministry was sworn in , it prohibited the export of sugar, which had reached a very high price overseas. We thus saved the local con«umer many thousands of pounds. If we possess the power to fix the price of sugar u n t i l the 30th 'September, 1920, I unhesitatingly say that we possess the power to fix the price of any other commodity. To-day we are not sending a pound of sugar outside of Australia. The position which it occupies is quite! different from .that of wool or butter, which we are exporting. But why does not the Bill extend to shipping? When the War Precautions Act was before this Parliament, and many of us protested against its extension, we were assured that if shipping were re0 leased the ship-owners would immediately increase freights and fares. Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) , stated that if shipping were released, and if we did not allow the ship-owners to increase freights and fares, they would withdraw their vessels from Australian waters. But I contend that if the Government can' control sugar they can also control shipping. We were' told not long ago that ship-owners would be able to sell tiheir ships for double the price at whioh they stood in their books at that time. During the first twelve months of the war \ustrailiian ship^ownjeirs were 'anxious to sell their vessels outside of the Commonwealth. The honourable' member for [398] Henty (Mr Boyd) knows that perfectly well. A number of those ships were somewhat out of date, but nobody then imagined that the war would be such a protracted one. The ship-owners at that time were under the impression that - they would be able to replace their vessels with new and up-to-date ships at a less price than (fchJey would get for their own out-of-date vessels. In all probability, had they been as wise then as they are today, they would not have been anxious to dispose of them. Within We know that shipping is essential to Australia, - since it is impossible to reach some parts of the Commonwealth except by steam. At an early hour this morning the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) called attention to the isolation of Tasmania, and I certainly think that if the Government have power to deal with sugar in this way they have power to deal with shipping. Since the Legal Committee, to whom this measure was referred, say that it is within the competence of the Parliament to pass it , it must be admitted that the Government have just as much power to deal with the shipping industry as they have to control sugar. W it h the exception of the sugar industry, none of the interests covered by this Bill will be likely to contest it , inasmuch as they will be better off under it than they would be without it .",53
295,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"T h o s e engaged in the shipping industry may contest it in the H i gh Court. The Mr TTJDOB - That is very likely. I do not know what will be the position of the meat industry under this measure. In the early days of the war the Queensland Parliament passed a Sugar Acquisition Bill , under which the State Government have since dealt with many other commodities. Indeed, it may be said that the whole of the commercial activities of the Queensland State Government have been carried out under it . Meat was acquired under it to enable the contract which the Denham Government entered into with the Imperial authorities to be carried out. Beef and mutton, under that contract, were to be supplied at fixed - prices, which have been varied from time to time, and in all probability, notwithstanding that the war is over, that contract will continue to operate. The position is, therefore, that beef and mutton will continue to be controlled under the Queensland State legislation, and wool will be controlled under this Bill, whereas hides will not be dealt with. In today's Argus there appears the following telegraphic Teport from Adelaide :Adelaide - The Prices Commission sat on Thursday, when the leather industry was under consideration. J. M. Reid,' tanner, stated that under normal conditions Australian tanners readily obtained all the hides they required, and turned out a big quantity of leather, which gave an exportable surplus of 25 per cent. On the declaration of war, the Australian hide and leather markets were greatly upset, and hides fell considerably in value, as there was no opportunity to export. Subsequently, British tanners wanted Australian hides, and opportunities were afforded for shipments to Great Britain. The prices of hides then gradually rose, until, early in February last, light hides were up 60 per cent., medium hides from 43 per cent., and heavy hides from 54 per cent. Leather values advanced in a relative ratio. As stated by ithe honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), in the course of the debate on the Ministerial statement, since February last the price of hides has increased to the extent of nearly 50 per cent., so that if there had been an increase of 54 per cent, up to February last, the increase today, as compared with the price before the embargo was imposed, is practically 100 per cent. According to some figures that I obtained from Mr Knibbs, the price of heavy hides before the imposition of the embargo was less than Is. per lb., whereas today it is over Is. Sd. per lb.",54
296,Mr CHABXTOKT,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The prices are practically double what they were before the embargo was imposed.,55
297,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"That is so. That embargo was imposed while I held office as Minister for Trade and Customs. A point that needs to be emphasized is that the advantage of this great increase in the price of hides has not been reaped by the producer. I make bold to say that hundreds of thousands of hides were held by the big mea t companies. They purchased their beef on the hoof at from 40s. to"" 60s. per cwt., and would estimate to receive about 55s. for a heavy hide, or, at 13d. per lb., about 60s. ' Since then, as I have said, the price of hides has gone up to Is. 8d. per lb., so that the meat companies are reaping the advantage of the enormous increase. Those who have leather stocks are also reaping the advantage of the increase in leather values. The .Government, however, say that they will leave the State Governments to deal with the price of meat, that they themselves will control the wool, but that the hides and pelts shall be free from governmental control. Every person in the community is being called upon to pay higher prices for his boots because of the failure of the Government to control the hides. The Acting Attorney-General (Mr Groom) should tell us at once with e r the Government have power to deal with hides and pelts. According to' a report of the Inter-State Commission, if a man goes to a timber merchant for building material he is told that he - must buy from that firm everything he wants for his building, otherwise he will not be supplied. The Government, in the same way, should say in respect of all these matters, "" All or none.""",55
298,Mr JOWETT,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The honourable member is aware that the Government has not attempted to control the price of boots.,55
299,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am aware of .that, but - although this Bill affords an opportunity .to go into thewholequestion of price fixing, I do not intend to deal with the question in detail today. I have not the slightest intention of going into the whole question of unrestricted price fixing when dealing with this Bill. Let me quote further from the evidence given before the Price Fixing CommissionThe Commonwealth Government then decided to regulate the prices of hides, leather, and boots. A conference was called, and a basis for increases on pre-war rates was determined, ranging from 33 per cent, on light hides to 38 per cent - for heavy hides. Taking a leading line of sole leather between July, 'l914, and .July, 1919, there had been an increase of 87$ per cent, in the price, but an exceedingly dangerous period had been entered, which had filled up the tanneries with hides. If the Government have power to control the price of one commodity, they ought to have power to control that of another. The Bill practically admits that they have. The legal gentlemen who have given an opinion say that the Commonwealth have the absolute power to control wool and wheat. If the Commonwealth can control two matters it ought to be able to control more than ""two. But possibly the whole thing is illegal. If the question should come before the High Oourt, no cognisance will be taken of any opinion given by legal gentlemen-or of any speech delivered in this House. The question will be decided on its merits only and in accordance with the enacted law.",55
300,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Does the honourable member object to the Minister for t if y in g himself with the opinion of the best men available ?,56
301,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Before lunch I said that it was the duty of every Minister to get the best opinion available, so that he might avoid making mistakes. On the question of the examination of the lighthouses of Australia, upon which the Commonwealth proposed to spend a considerable sum of money in order to bring them up to date, I called into consultation in my office the chairman of the Steam-ship Owners Federation and the secretary of the Merchant Service Guild, although they were having a controversy in the newspapers at the time, and, apparently, were not friendly. I asked for their assistance i h making a choice from among the persons who had tendered their services to do the work. Both gentlemen readily acceded to my request. I hold that if a Minister will not seek assistance he is not worthy of holding office. A man makes a big mistake who sets himself up to be an expert in everything. In fact, the person who knows all about everything is generally a "" mug."" ""When the . Fisher Government were in office a Bill was brought forward in which it was proposed to ask the High Court to give a decision as to the constitutionality of any measure. It was an unusual procedure, aud I do not know that the' Court was ever asked to give sueh a decision; but it is not [398]- 2 a bad idea for Parliament to ask the Court whether it has the constitutional power to legislate in any particular direction. There is one matter in which the Government will have absolute power to f i x prices. We have committed ourselves to an expenditure of £50,000,000 on homes for soldiers, and I commend to the notice of the Assistant Minister for Repatriation  State Commission on Rents and Building Combines, dealing with the increase in the cost of building. If , according to the sworn evidence given before the Commission, we do not fix prices, those gentlemen who control the supply of materials for building purposes wiU do so. On page 21 the Commissioners comment upon the action of the New South Wales Government in establishing a State brickworks, and quote the report of the State Auditor General dealing with this matter. This is what the report says The manager of the State Brickworks gave evidence, and produced the Auditor-General's reports on the workings of this enterprise. The works sell common - bricks at 38s. 6d. per 1,000, as against the Combine price of 50s. per 1,000. They have since raised the price by 2s. 6d. per thousand. Operations began in 1911, and the financial results, according to the Auditor-General's report, 1918, have been remarkable. He states (pages 1-2-)-""Accumulate d profits-at 30th June, 1918, were £23,022 Ss. 9d., or 26.94 per cent.: reserve for renewals, £27,489 15s. 6d., or 31.36 per cent.; amounting in all to £51,112 4s. 3d., or 58.30 per cent, of the capital employed. In addition to the declared profits, direct savings to the extent of £68,470 18s. 2d., on account of Government services, must be taken into consideration. These savings were effected by Government services, but also the general public participated in these reduced prices, though necessarily such estimates are not included. It will thus be seen that the profits were £23,622 8s. 9d., plus the savings of £68,470 ISs. 2d., or, in all, £92,093 6s. l i d . , a sum in excess of the capital employed, viz., £87,669, by which amount the State has benefited.""  member hear the answer I gave this morning with regard to bricks and 'timber for soldiers' houses ?",56
302,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I believe the honourable member said that the Repatriation Department intended to follow the example of New South Wales in this respect. On page 11 of the Inter-State Commission's report we find the following: The following comparison of the total cost of building in 1914 and 1918, and the bution of that cost into the principal items of material and labour, was supplied ney builder of wide experience in the class construction dealt with:-Bric k cottage with five - rooms, including kitchen and bath, and labour-1914 , £131 6s.; 1918, £146 3s.",57
303,Mr BUUCE SMITH,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The momber does not object to that?,57
304,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,ISo ; but the cost of material increased in the same period from £ 2 7 8 to £ 4 1 0 . The cost of the ' material in 1918 was more than the cost of material and labour combined in 1914.,57
305,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Does the honourable member know how much of that material was imported ?,57
306,Mr BOYD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Do not forget also, that the cost of material goes up because the cost of production increases owing to - advances in wages.",57
307,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The report states that various trade associations or combinations are dealing with building material, and exercising a rigid control in fixing prices as well as in regulating distribution. If the Government do not fix prices, outside organizations of employers will do so. It is better for the Government to take this course. The Bill , in my judgment, does not go far enough with regard to them. Instead of asking the Legal Committee whether the Government ha? power to deal with these particular items, they should have asked whether power was not vested in the Government to deal with every item in regard to price-fixing. I believe we have the power, and now that the war is over any failure on the part of the Government to control these matters cannot be excused because we are in a state of war, as was urged in the Burvett v. Farey case, which came before Chief Justice Griffith. The Acting Attorney-General has stated that we have power to deal with the matters referred to in the Bill , but I think we have a great deal more power under the Constitution than many of us have been led to believe ",57
308,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Parkes) [2.53]. - I intend to speak for only a few minutes on one or two salient features of this Bill . I should like to compliment distri- the Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Tudor) upon his marvellous industry. by a SydHe must' have spent many hours going of into all the details of this measure, but, notwithstanding his industry, his speech will land him nowhere. He reminds me very much of an occasion when he introhonorable duced a Bill on the subject of navigation in this House. He sat at the table with nobody behind him, as all the members of his party were upstairs. They had gone through the Bill and left it to the Minister. He sat at the table while I made a speech from the opposite side of the House, occupying about an hour and a half, in which I brought to bear all the knowledge I possessed, covering many years of experience of shipping and the law, and simply nodded his head at me very much like a Chinese toy. In - the end he did not make one single amendment. I am afraid he has been beating the wind this afternoon, and that the Minister will probably not make one alteration in the Bill as the result of the many suggestions he has made. I take an interest in this measure, because I think I was the leading spirit in opposing an indiscriminate extension for six months of the War Precautions Act last session. It was proposed then to extend the Act with regard to all the activities at that time controlled by the Government. I pointed out that as the war was practically over, we ought, as soon as possible, to return to government by Parliament. I consider that during the last three or four years I have been paid £600 a year for doing nothing because the whole power of Parliament has been vested in heads of Departments. We have been governed by heads of Departments. None of us have had the advantage of knowing what the Ministerial in tentions were, as they will be in future explained in Bills to be placed before us for consideration and criticisms'. When the Minister brought forward the Bill for the indiscriminate extension of the War Precautions Act for six months, I contended that it was altogether too general; that, as the Avar was over, he might pay us the compliment of allowing us to return to parliamentary practice, and have some opportunity of criticising Government activities. five or six other honourable bers I voted against the Bill , and as a consequence of a reduction in the Government majority the Ministry thought it wise to extend the powers for three months only instead of enacting an indiscriminate extension of war powers. for six months. I want to see a return to parliamentary government today. We are a democratic community, and whether we believe that the man in the street knows as much as we do about politics, we are quite satisfied to regard this House as representing the country and to criticise measures on their merits. I urged at that time that, because of the termina-. tion of the war, there was an obligation on the Government to demonstrate the necessity for an extension of any W a r Precautions Act powers, and that they ought to bring down a Bill at the end of three months indicating what activities it might be thought advisable to still f u r ther control. The Government have done that, and I am perfectly satisfied to leave the matter in their hands. In this measure the Government have enumerated dairy produce, wool, sugar, flax, and wheat, which it is desirable further to control. Shipping is not mentioned, and in connection with that matter I remind the Leader of the Opposition that when he is talking about shipping he always appears to be talking at me, and points his finger at me. One would think, from his general attitude, that I was fortunate enough to possess all the shipping of Australia. Perhaps he would be very much surprised to know that, although I had the honour to manage a very big company for three years, as a ship owner I now take no more interest in shipping except so far as it affects the dividends I receive. I know nothing of the details of purchase, freights, or arrangements, and therefore I would have the honourable member tounderstand that, he should shake his finger at some other member, remembering that I know no more about the subject than he 'does. Asa professional man, I have learned not to use my head for nothing, unless it be f o i my own edification and amusement, and ] can assure him that I am just as innocent of all these wicked practices of the snipWith ping rings as he is. I suppose I kno« mem- about as much of the shipping rings as he does of the rings in the Trades Halls of this country. The Government have done as I suggested, though I do not say it is in consequence of my observations. They have taken upon themselves the responsibility of stating in . regard to what particular subjects they desire an extension of powers, and, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, they have obtained the best legal talent to advise them as to the effect of existing law^and laws which they propose for the future. I am perfectly satisfied, as i. private member, while we are living under the War Precautions Act, to accept the suggestion of the Government as 'tc the necessity for extending the law in regard to those particular activities. 3 understood the Minister to say that if , as time goes on, ithey find it neeessary to oxtend powers affecting 'other activities., they will bring down Bills and consult. Parliament. That being the case, I thinfe the Leader of the Opposition is only beating the wind, and that when the BifP comes out of Committee he will find it ha:been but little altered in consequence ov his observations this afternoon.",57

310,Mr BRUCE SMITH,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I , too, thin k that",58
311,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I am surprised that the honourable gentleman, who possesses legal knowledge, did not attempt to offer an opinion as to the validity o; the Bill , in view of the fact that the wai 'has terminated,'and that the W a r ' P r e cautions Act was passed for the purpose of enabling the Federal authority tc operate certain powers during the currency of the war and for six month; thereafter. The honourable gentleman ii quite prepared to accept the decision of the legal authorities consulted by the Government. ' I .do not question that decision, but it appears to me, as a layman, that there is need for some further explanation of the legal decision, because, if , as the Minister (Mr Groom) stated, the Government must have power under the Constitution to extend the control of some commodities t ill 1920, and others to an earlier date, there is no reason why. the control should not be extended in regard to all commodities. If that is so, why do the Government tell us that, peace having been restored, certain commodities, the price of which was formerly controlled by the Commonwealth, must now, in accord"" ance with the powers of the Constitution' revert to the control of the States? There must be something wrong in that con tradictory statement. . If the Government can continue to regulate the prices of sugar, butter, cheese, wheat, and other commodities, surely they can do the same in regard to every commodity; no line of demarcation can be drawn between one set of articles and another. legal in respect of one commodity must be legal in respect of others. I find the Minister's statement a little perplexing. Frequentlv legislation which has passed this Parliament has been found, when tested in the Courts, to be ultra vires, ind we ought, therefore, to be very caref u l not to pass legislation that is possibly beyond the province of the Commonwealth.

The co-operative societies in the dairying industry have accumulated large sums of 7 money, and do honourable members think that they will not test this legislation? We ought to take the precaution of getting sound legal advice as to the position we occupy in regard to this measure.",59
317,Mr ATKINSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,Do not the certificates of the legal gentlemen who have been What is consulted give us the necessary security ?,59
318,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do ' not know the nature of' the case that was stated to them. If 1, as a member of a Government, asked certain legal gentlemen if , under the War Precautions Act, I could legally extend the duration of the control of certain commodities, they might reply, "" Yes, as you have full power under the War Precautions Act to do certain thingsin time of war."" But if I were to say, "" Now that Peace is restored, have we power to continue to regulate the prices of these commodities,"" .they might give quite a different answer.",59
319,Mr ATKINSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I understand that the text of this Bill was submitted to them.,59
320,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I am stating my own view. We know how lawyers differ in their opinions regarding many matters.,59
321,Mr MAXWELL,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"They differ as much, as doctors do.",59
322,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I accept the honourable member as an authority on that question. There is considerabledanger in this Bill . If the contention of the Minister is correct, what are we to say t""o. the people when it appears that we have extended the control of certain commodities under this measure, whilst we have permitted to continue unchecked the profiteering in other commodities? We must be logical. Either we can control all commodities, or we can control none. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr . Bruce Smith) said that the Minister will have power to add from time to time to the commodities 'mentioned in the Bill . If that is so, the Parliament must have power to bring within the scope of the measure all the necessaries of life', and there can be no justification for permitting profiteering to continue one minute longer. How can we shelter ourselves behind the people by saying that before we can act we must have an amendment of the Constitution? opinion upon which the Minister is acting be sound, no amendment of the Constitution is necessary, I admit that when the Fisher Government were in power we were advised that an amendment of the Constitution was necessary before the Federal - Parliament could legally dual with trade and commerce and monopolies. We appealed to the people, and they rejected our proposal. But in the light of the latest legal opinion, it appears as if there is no longer any necessity to take a referendum of the electors; we have the constitutional power to deal with trade if we only care to exercise it . If it be true that we can legally do the things which this Bill seeks to do, I shall not go before the people and shelter myself and Parliament behind the plea that we have no constitutional power. That is a position which the Government will be obliged to face. During the recent debate, whenever any one on this side mentioned the cost of living and pointed out the necessity of this Parliament doing something to regulate it , there was a chorus from the other side to this effect: "" Oh, we cannot do anything; we have not the power. The war is over; it is now a matter for the States."" Even the Minister now sitting at the table said it was. Nowwe find it is a matter not for the States, but for this Parliament. Why, then, are we shirking our responsibilities? seems to be no room for argument if that legal opinion is correct. I believe it will be found that this Parliament has not the power that it should have to deal with these matters, but I am not a legal man, and my opinion does not j u s t if y the Government, who believe they have the power, in permitting certain things to go from their control, and certain in d i v iduals to charge exorbitant prices. Rer cently the Leader of the Opposition and myself asked what justification there was for this Parliament permitting the price of boots to rise as it is doing. It can be raised now week after week if those in terested wish it . The Minister says that . the reason they allow it is that they no longer have control over them.",59
323,Mr ATKINSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,That is under the Constitution.,60
324,Mr CHAELTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,That is the cry we get immediately. If the,60
325,Mr ATKINSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,If this measure is upset it will be for the same reason.,60
326,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Can we not, then, up to the time that this measure is wiped out, control the question of leather prices? Can we not protect the people until the end of 1920 in regard to boots, clothes, and food?",60
327,Mr ATKINSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I understood that this Bill deals only with the actual contracts the Government have entered into.,60
328,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"It is not a question of actual contracts, although the Minister puts it that way. The honourable member will find from the schedules that in connection with the commodities enumerated the prices to be charged to the people of Australia, who have no contracts with the Government, are regulated.",60
329,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Tak e butter, for instance. We are under a contract to supply the Imperial Government. There is another contract covering wool. We also have a . contract with the Queensland Government in the case of sugar.",60
330,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"So far so good; but the Government take control of the whole of the consumption of the people of Australia in regard to those very commodities, although there is no contract between the people and the Government. There This measure not only covers those commodities where they are contracted for , but also where there is no contract in existence. Yet the Government intend to allow some things to go unchecked, and people handling certain lines to make additional profits, because increases"" are taking place every day. Those interested are not satisfied for one week. Directly they get an increase, up goes the price again, and we are allowing this io go on. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Atkinson) says the Constitution will not permit us to interfere, but the Constitution will permit the Government to regulate the price of butter, cheese, sugar, and wool to the people of Australia. If the Constitution permits the Government to do that up to the end of 1920 for certain specified articles, it will permit them to do it for everything that they care to specify in this Bill. This measure, therefore, will not give the satisfaction which the public expect. I question very much whether it will stand the test of an appeal to the High Court. The Government ought to be sure about the constitutionality of any measure that they bring forth, and get the best legal advibe to guide them. We should not be doing certain things, and setting up new Departments, in the dark. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr. Bruce Smith"") rightly pointed out that we have been governed by Departments for a long time past. I have said the same thing myself here, and many of those Departments have not given the satisfaction that the public expected. Having established that system of government, however, we cannot abandon it all at once. It must be a matter of gradual evolution, and during that evolution the people should be protected in regard to all commodities, and not only in relation to certain specified articles. The dairy farmer has no greater sympathizer in .this House than myself. I know how he and his family have to toil. He has a perfect right to get a fair price for his commodities, and I do not bhink he is getting more than a fair price now. But what happens between the man that produces and the man who retails the stuff to the consumer? That is where the leakage takes place, and 'we are making no endeavour to control it. We are allowing those interested a free hand. If , later on, we ask the people to give us gi'eater powers to control these things, Ave shall lay ourselves open to the charge of hypocrisy, because, when Ave had the poAver. we would not attempt to exercise it. HOAV is the public protected on Mr Charlton. > the Boards enumerated in the schedules? See Who are on those Boards, and you will find that the consumers have no representatives. If Ave seriously intend to try to keep down the cost of living, 'and to do what is right between man and man-OU T guiding principle in fixing prices should be to see that the man who produces gets a fair return to enable him to keep his family in decent comfort and provide for old age, and also that the consumer gets a fair deal-w e should give both sides representation on these controlling Boards. Whoever represents the general public on the Boards will be able,to put the point of Ariew of the consumer. Surely he will carry some Aveight, and he may be able to prevent exorbitant charges being made to the people of Australia. The Minister says we have contracts for certain things entered into by these Boards. The Boards seem always to take the ruling price abroad as the guiding principle, and then expect the people here, in a country which produces in abundance, to pay exactly the same as they would have to pay in other parts of the world which depend on us for supplies; although so many miles of sea roll between us and them that the cost in freight alone to carry our commodities to them represents a good deal of money. Even then tremendous profits are made out of our produce. The Boards persist in regarding the needs c-f our OAvn people from the stand-point of the demands of the people abroad, and this is - due to the fact that only one class is represented on them-that is, those directly concerned in the commodities which are dealt Will. That sort of thing should not continue. NOAV that the Minister proposes to prolong these controls until the f>nd of 1920, Avhy does he not invite the House to alter the composition of the Boards? Why does he not provide for representatives of the consumers to have seats on those bodies during the remainder of the term? The honourable member for .Grampians (Mr Jowett) told us the other night that his Board did not charge the same for AVOOI here as they exported it for. That may be so, but it does not follow that they are not charging too much to the people of Australia even then. It is quite' possible, if there were representatives on that Board looking after tbe_ in terests of the consumers, that they mightfind it necessary to urge that even less should be charged here for wool, in order to enable the people of Australia to get their clothing much cheaper.",60

332,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Q u it e so; but those who have to pay for these commodities have no voice in the matter. We regulate the price of sugar, for instance, through/the Customs Department. A few months ago the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) and myself got a surprise. The co-operative people asked us to meet them at Newcastle, and pointed out what the wholesale merchants were doing. When I speak of the wholesale merchants, I invite honourable members to look at the Inter-State Commission's report on groceries, and see who they are. They are called the Co-operative Distribution Company, and certain wholesale firms are members. They fix the prices. Manufacturers have to supply them, and they distribute to the retailers. claimed that they are fixing - exorbitant prices. This wholesale Co-operative Distribution Company evidently had sufficient influence to deal with the Government in regard to sugar. A certain rebate was given to all who bought sugar from that source. But it is strange that the various co-operative societies, which belong to the consumers themselves, and are not capitalistic concerns, did. not secure the rebate whioh was allowed to other storekeepers. The co-operative societies in my district, where they are strongly established and have their own wholesale society, could not get sugar on th© same terms as otlier retailers, although it is a commodity which the Government are regulating.",62
333,Mr SAMPSON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I think you will ""find that that has now been remedied.",62
334,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"It had not been until very recently. Why should it have occurred at all, when we had the sugar ourselves ? Why did the Government, who had charge of the sugar and its distribution, permit those middlemen, who produce nothing, .to decide what re-, bate ought to be paid, and to whom it should be allowed ?",62
335,Mr CORSER,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I think the honorablo member is mistaken. There is no such arrangement, so far as I know.",62

This all goes to show that the consumers ought to be represented on the Boards; that is all I urge. end of 1920, why is not provision made in the Bill for the representation of the consumers ? Prices have been going up, despite the control we have been exercising. There is a screw loose somewhere. We have a right to demaud an explanation of the mystery. We should insist that the interests of the consumer be protected. No one is against those concerned in business securing fair returns; t u t we want to prevent profiteering, which is rampant. Nothing is being done. This measure seeks to perpetuate what has been carried on for the past two or three years. I want to see the people getting a fai r deal. I am not much concerned about the Shipping Board, but I believe we would It is be no worse off if the Board were disbanded tomorrow.",62
337,Mr MCWILLIAMS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,A jolly sight better off.,62
338,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Probably ! The Board is composed of men directly concerned in shipping. While we have taken over their ships and are paying them rental for their vessels, they have been practically permitted to run the boats to their own satisfaction. Wherever they have been concerned in a particular commodity they have not been hindered in using their craft to carry that commodity to their own choice of markets, to the exclusion of other people. Take the carriage of coal, for instance - I cannot complain with regard to my own district, for the miners hate been kept going fairl y constantly. But the honourable member ' for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) cannot say the same, unfortunately. The shipping managers have worked their own favoured propositions, and have carried coal in their ships quite independently of Commonwealth control; but a fair deal has not been given other districts. I am not'satisfied with the Wool Board, either. I am not assured that it has been in the best interests of the country. We have seen wool taken past Newcastle 100 miles and more to Sydney for appraisea ment. The biggest boats visiting Australia put into Newcastle for loading. We can load the biggest wool-carrying ships at that port. Y e t all the wool the north goes past Newcastle for appraisement in Sydney.  ing sheds.",62

We desire that these arrangements should come to an end within a certain time after the war; but this Bill proposes to extend them. With the experience of the operations of these Boards during the last five years, we have learned their defects. If it is necessary, because of certain contracts with people abroad, to extend the operation of these powers, what is ito prevent us remedying the defects which have Ibeen discovered?

360,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I have said so over and over again. It is a one-sided business to provide that only those directly concerned in a particular commodity shall be represented on the Board dealing with it. If honourable members wish to restore public confidence in these matters, they will see that the public have representation on 'these Boards. If we do not do so, the public will say, ""Who are running these Boards that fix the prices that we have to pay for bread, sugar, butter, and other thing's? They are .people who are directly interested in tbose commodities."" I have said that the price of dairy products is not too high; hut the very fact that there is no representation of the: public on these Boards creates suspicion in the public mind. _ If the public were represented, everything could be investigated, and the .true position made clear.  presented on the Wheat Board.",64

362,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"During the last sittings of this House I went through the list of these Boards. There is a very large number of them, and if honourable members will examine them they will find that they are all composed of interested persons. That is what the "" public are crying out against. If we are going to regulate the prices of commodities, the public demand a voice in the business. It is only human nature that if men personally interested in a particular article are appointed to the Board regulating the price of that article they will get as much for it as they can. If a man is given the opportunity to exploit the public in any way, he will avail himself of it. The public should be represented on these Boards, to prevent that sort of thing.",64

370,Mr CHARLTON,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"If a man is a member of a Board, and the majority of the members of that Board differ from bim on a particular matter, he will, ordinarily, accept the decision of his colleagues. He may think that it is entirely wrong, but he will not come out and stand on his own aud make a fuss about it - The great majority of the persons who compose these Boards are interested in the commodities with which they deal, and they fix the prices in their own interests. I ask the Acting Attorney General (Mr Groom) to say that something will be done to give the public a say in these matters, by securing their representation on these Boards. If the Minister has the power he thinks he has, though I doubt it , there is no reason, why he should .not bring other commodities under the Bill ; there is no reason, for instance, why leather snould not be included, and thus bring about a reduction in the price of boots, instead of the constant inflation we bave experienced. This is a matter entirely in our own hands; and I ask the Minister to consider wihat I have said with a view of doing something which will give a little meed of satisfaction to .the general public. Unless something is done in Tegard to the fixing of prices in the near future, and thus some relief given in connection with the cost of living, I see nothing but trouble ahead. People cannot be kept in submission all the time. It redounds to the credit of the people of this com- : munity that, although they were hard pressed during the war, .and had to go short of many things, they felt that a patriotic duty devolved on them to make sacrifices. Many, owing to their age, were not able to go to the Pront, but fchey made what sacrifices lay within their power. Nowj however, they cannot continue to make those sacrifices; their stocks of clothing have worn out, and their purchasing power is not sufficient to secure more; and they anticipate that, now Peace has been signed, some effort will be made to quickly return to normal conditions. As I say, unless some relief is afforded, I see nothing before us but ohaos, leading we know not where. I am one who believes, and always have believed, that whatever we do should be done in a constitutional way, because with adult suffrage all the power is in our hands.. People are constantly being told that Parliament is what they make it, and they look to us to protect their interests, and, now that there is no necessity for further sacrifices, to bring about a state of society in which they can live in decent comfort.",65

Although we were unable when we last met, at the end of 1918, to get our own way in the matter, we got a promise from the Government that the operation of this Act would be curtailed as far as possible, and at the earliest possible moment; and this Bill, I take it , is the fulfilment of that promise.

Then our opponents take the case to the High Court, which reverses the judgment' of the Supreme Court. Where are we then? This is too fanciful picture, for it represents a frequent experience. Sueh a case may be taken to the Privy Council, which reverses the decision of the Court below. - In one case, a decision by a Police Magistrate was carried through the Courts right up to the Privy Council, which in the end decided that the Police Magistrate was right; so it can be seen bow much reliance can: be placed on the opinions of lawyers. I shall not mention names, because that might lead to the identification of the party concerned, but there was a case in which we had occasion to obtain a legal opinion oh' a certain matter. We obtained that opinion from a very prominent lawyer. Later on it was found that our opponents had secured from the same gentleman an opinion contrary to that which he had given us.

389,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,That is their opinion.,66
390,Mr BOYD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"But until their opinion has been tested by the Courts it is not worth, anything. ""While the certificate of these legalgentlemen may be a perfectly accurate one so far as the passing of this Bill is concerned, it contains nothing to warrant us in believing that when the War Precautions Act ceases-to operate it will possess any value whatever.",66
391,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The Committee mean that if. we pass the Bill it will stand valid law.,67
392,Mr BOYD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Thei r certificate does not say anything of the kind, and Hansard does not record that the Acting Attorney General made any such statement.",67
393,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The certificate says it is within the competence of this Parliament to pass the Bill .,67
394,Mr BOYD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"But it does not say that when it has been passed the Bill will be valid. The opinion of these gentlemen, therefore, can have no value u n t i l the matter .has been determined by the Courts.",67
395,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The members of the Committee can only give their opinion.,67
396,Mr BOYD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,And I am giving mine. I know that the Acting Attorney-General will not value my opinion half as much as he values theirs.,67
397,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,I put just as much value upon the honourable member's opinion as it is worth.,67
398,Mr BOYD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"The honourable gentleman puts just as much value upon my opinion as he is capable of judging it to be worth, which is a very different proposition. ' ' The second paragraph of the certificate given by these legal men, and upon which so much stress has been laid, readsWe have carefully considered this Bill, and are of opinion that it is within the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament, subject, as regards Part IV. (Sugar), to the proviso that the Bill becomes law before the termination of the war. At a later stage they define "" termination of the war "" as the "" exchange of ratifications."" Does not that circumstance show that in their judgment, if we pass this Bill after the "" exchange of ratifications,"" it will not be legal so far as sugar is concerned? I understand that the It a l i an and French Parliaments are the only Parliaments which are now required to r at if y the Peace Treaty. If tomorrow we learned that they have already done this, clearly a doubt would exist in the minds of Messrs. Knox and Hemsley, two of the Sydney members of the Committee who have given their opinion on the question of the constitutionality of this Bill , so far as sugar is concerned. If the measure would not be legal in the case of sugar, how could it be legal in the case of other commodities? If we desire to get this matter in proper perspective, we as a must viewi t from the stand-point of the conditions which existed prior to the war. If we had no power to deal with these matters then, I venture to say that we shall have no power to deal with them after the war. l i the validity of the Bill be contested before the Court it is quite possible that it will be held to be ultra vires of our Constitution. If that result were achieved many matters would be materially complicated. But quite apart from sugar, other commodities which the Government desire to bring with in the scope of this measure would affect a number of producers, who will probably realise higher prices for their products under Government control than they could otherwise do. That being thecase,, it is more than unlikely that a test case would be put up. .On the other hand, I am assured that the j a m manufacturers of the Commonwealth intend to contest the Commonwealth power in regard to fixing the price of sugar.",67
399,Mr GROOM,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,What are they going to gain from action of that kind?,67
400,Mr BOYD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I do not know. But even while the Government are controlling the price of sugar under the W a r Precautions Act, the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) himself admits that in New Zealand sugar is being sold cheaper than it is in Australia. I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. PEACE CELEBRATIONS : SITTINGS OF TH E HOUSE-HOSPITA LSHIP ""KAROOLA"": LANDING OF INVALIDS - CASE OF PAU L FREEMAN - TAXATION OF PATRIOTIC ENTERTAINMENTS .

401,Mr TUDOR,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Y a r r a ) [ 4 . 0 ] - I should be glad if the Acting Prime Minister (Mr W at t ) would state, for the convenience of honourable members generally, the intentions of the Government with regard to the sittings of the House next week in view of the fact that Peace Celebrations in the case of some of our schools will commence on Priday next. An announcement at this stage would be of value to those Inter-State representatives who propose to take part in the Peace Celebrations in their respective States.",67
402,Mr HIGGS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Capricornia) [ 4 . 1 ] have been asked by the relatives of returning invalid soldiers to put this brief statement before the HouseThe hospital ship Karoola moored at - Woolloomooloo wharf at 0.30 a.m. on Saturday, 28th June. On board were twenty-three eot cases, some very bad indeed. Breakfast was served while in the stream at 7.30 a.m. Shortly after the vessel was moored, eight or ten' of the invalids were taken on deck, most of the invalids dressed in pyjamas only, yet the weather was cold, a sharp windblowing. Shortly after 11 a.m., cot cases were removed to the wharf, where they lay in the cold without sufficient covering. The Karoola then pulled out to the stream. Through an insufficiency of motor ambulances, it was 3 p.m. before the last of the invalids arrived at Bandwick Hospital. The invalids had no food or refreshments of any kind from 7.30 a.m. until 3 p.m., while the exposure to cold through want of sufficient clothing resulted in some of the invalids contracting severe colds. Notwithstanding this, we read in the evening newspapers that the Governor General met the hospital ship, addressed words of welcome to the returned men, that a plentiful supply of cars were in waiting, and that everything went without a hitch.",68
403,Mr CONSIDINE,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Barrier) [ 4 . 4 ] view of the answers given by the Acting Prime Minister to questions 1I have asked with reference to Paul Freeman, and the refusal of the Government, either, to release him on bail or to submit him to trial, I desire to ask the honourable gentleman what course of action the Government intend to adopt with regard to the man - When I brought the case of Paul Freeman before the authorities, I also drew attention to the case of a man named Abraham Marks, who was sentenced to six months' imprisonment in the New South Wales penitentiary, but was kept in gaol for seventeen months, and was deported, I gather, from the reply of the Defence Department, about the time that Freeman was sent away. I should like to know whether the Government intend to keep Paul Freeman in gaol?",68
404,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I l l a w a r r a ) [ 4 . 5 ] - - - I desire to direct the attention of the Treasurer (Mr W at t ) to certain phases of the administration of the entertainments tax in New South Wales. In connection with repatriation work, and the welcoming home of our returned - I soldiers, we have, in many centres, associations and societies which, by means of concerts and other entertainments, raise funds to enable the returning men to be entertained. The officer administering the entertainments tax holds, that such entertainments are subject to the tax if (the expenses of conducting them amount to 50 per cent, of the gross proceeds. As the number of returning men increases, with a consequent increase in the "" welcome home"" functions, more and more difficulty is being experienced in securing a full attendance at these gatherings. A charge is - made for admission merely to recoup the societies the expense incurred. They very often find nowadays that, in stead of having a surplus, they have a deficit, and the taxing oflicer thereupon demands that the tax shall be paid on admission tickets. This is a rather serious matter for the people concerned, many of whom are not in affluent circumstances, and have to provide the tax out of their own pockets. It seems to me that if the officer were to "" turn a blind eye "" on such - In cases, he would do more good to the community than he does by taking a strictly technical view of the wording of the Act. In another case, to which I shall referin detail later on, the power of the Department has been used in a most extraordinary way because of Ihe inexperience of the man concerned. This man, who is a miner, failed to secure the authority which he could have secured from the Department, exempting from the provisions of the Entertainments Tax Act the patriotic entertainment for which he was responsible. Notwithstanding that his mistake was due to inexperience, the Department put him to the expense of at r i a l , sent counsel to the town where the tria l took place, and compelled him to pay the costs of the prosecution. And all because of his failure to pay the tax on tickets of admission to a patriotic entertainment which was conducted by hi m without any object of personal gain. So far as I can see, there was not the slightest justification for the action of the Department, which refuses to grant any redress. I hope the Treasurer will look into these cases, and see whether the strict letter of the law should be enforced in respect of patriotic and charitable entertainments that are not a source of profit, but, on the contrary, an actual loss to the promoters.",68
405,Mr WATT,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.7] - The honourable member for Illawarra (Mr . Lamond) knows, as I do, that the case3 that worry honourable members most, and are often the most embarrassing to M in isters, are frequently those of which the. latter have no personal knowledge, but in respect of which the action complained of has been taken by officials. I am not able to say whether the cases cited by the honourable member are within or outside the Act, but my own view is that the law was never intended to burden gatherings of the kind described by him. I shall an early opportunity of ascertaining exactly the purport of the law with respect to such entertainments, and, should it be necessary, in the judgment of the Government, to amend that law, I shall not hesitate to ask Parliament to alter it . The honourable member for Barrier (Mr . Considine) has referred to the case, of Paul Ereeman. I say, with great respect to the honourable member, that that matter has been made the subject of a political agitation in another State, and that, in connection with it , a good deal of public excitement has been caused, largely, so far as the Government is aware, by a misrepresentation of the facts. In these circumstances, I am not prepared to answer any further questions, without notice, in regard to the case. The honourable member will recognise the necessity for, and the wisdom of, that course.' I was pained to hear the remarks made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) regarding the arrival and treatment of invalid soldiers on the Karoola at Woolloomooloo Bay last this month. I assume that the 'hotnorable member knows the source of the information.",69
406,Mr HIGGS,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"I believe it to be true, but cannot vouch for it .",69
407,Mr WATT,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"Althoug h the honourable member does not vouch for it , such a statement demands, and will receive, the immediate investigation of the Acting Minister for Defence (Senator Russell). A f t e r our experience in dealing with in valid cases, there is not the slightest'justification for blundering of the kind. Mr MCDONALD^-If the complaint is found to be correct, will any one be punished ?",69
408,Mr WATT,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,The honourable member knows how difficult it is in some cases to allocate the responsibility.,69
409,Mr MCDONALD,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"But if the responsibility is allocated in this case, will any one be punished ?",69
410,Mr WATT,POST AN D TELEGRAP H,"If it is allocated, then punishment should follow the blunder. I do not love punishment, but if the men who take responsibility for dealing with cases of this, kind are unable to do the job, they should relinquish it . If they undertake the work, they should deal with take it in the spirit in which the Parliament hoped and intended that it should be carried out. On Wednesday next, either one or both of the Bills relating to the War Precautions Regulations will be advanced to the stage which the Commercial Activities Bill has reached. We shall then go on with the Commercial Activities Bill until it is passed. On Wednesday we shall meet at the usual hour and sit in the afternoon and evening. If it will suit the convenience of honourable members, we shall meet on Thursday at 11 o'clock in the morning, and if we make reasonable progress, Inter-State members who desire to do'so may catch the Inter-State expresses. This will enable them to reach their respective States in order to take part in the Peace celebrations. If it can be arranged with the concurrence of honourable members on both sides, I hope it will be possible to have a similar sitting on Friday. However, we can settle that point on Wednesday next. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.12 p.m.",69
