It is stated further that high authorities of the Admiralty hope that Australia will accept a g if t of such vessels, including dreadnoughts.

20,Mr YATES,REP OK TED OFFEBBYBBITISH,"Some time ago I drew the attention of the Defence Department to the case of a returned soldier who served at the Front for from four to four and a half years, and was wounded on four occasions, but who, owing to petty offences while in the field, had no deferred pay to draw, and arrived here penniless. I have received a reply that the question as to whether any grant should be made to this soldier is a matter of policy.

23,Mr SPEAKER,REP OK TED OFFEBBYBBITISH," The honourable member was good enough to supply me with a typed copy of his question. I do not know of the particular case to which he has referred ; but, as I understand the honourable member's reference is to some one employed in a portion of the building not under my immediate control, I shall make inquiries in regard to the matter from the President of the Senate.

Mr HIGGS,-Can the Minister for Home and Territories say whether any Australian-born citizen is to be prevented from voting at the forthcoming general election for the Senate and House of Representatives ? At the same time, will the honourable gentleman mention what is likely to be the nomination day for the election ?",22
24,Mr GLYNN,REP OK TED OFFEBBYBBITISH,"There is nothing in the law, nor is there any proposal to bring in legislation to prevent natural-born British subjects already qualified under the Constitution from voting. As the Prime M in ister stated last week, the date of the election will be, approximately, the 13th December; therefore, nomination day should be about the 14th November. COUNTRY POSTAL SERVICES - STEAM-SHIP SERVICE TO GUARANTEES.",22
25,Mr GREGORY,REP OK TED OFFEBBYBBITISH,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has it been brought under his notice that settlers are being advised by the Postal administration that, unless they make good 41) per cent, or 50 per cent, of the estimated loss on their postal services, such services will be cancelled or curtailed r ' 2. With a view to promoting settlement, will the Government give instructions that the usual postage stamp will carry a letter to its destination without any' section of the community being especially penalized 1",23
26,Mr HUGHES,REP OK TED OFFEBBYBBITISH,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. I am aware that this is being done in certain cases where the disproportion between the cost of the service and the revenue derived from it warrants such action, but the instructions issued in the matter, in 1916, were as follow:- "" The Postmaster-General's wish respecting non-paying services in outlying districts established prior to Federation is that these are not to be interfered with where the disparity between revenue and expenditure has not unreasonably increased in the interval, having in view the effect of penny postage and where contracts can be renewed at existing rates or thereabouts."" 2. If this question means, as it may, that, the prepaying of postage is to be regarded as imposing on the Post Office the obligation of delivering a letter to the person to whom it is addressed, at his address, no matter in what part of the interior or elsewhere in the Commonwealth ho may be located, and without regard to the cost involved in making the delivery, it will be obvious that such a proposal could not be seriously entertained. But if it is intended only to mean that the Post Office will make every effort to deliver letters to .settlers in outlying districts, so that a progressive policy of land settlement may be stimulated, and men desirous of settling on the land may not be discouraged from doing so, the answer is in the affirmative. PEACE TERMS - not CLAIM FOR REPARATION.",23

32,Mr GLYNN,REP OK TED OFFEBBYBBITISH,"It will not be possible to give any idea u n t i l the proposed in vestigations have been completed and. reports obtained. Mr J. H . CAT TS asked the Minister for Works and Railways, upon notice I.

35,Mr HUGHES,PROHIBITI ON OF SALE OF,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. No. I have not seen the message referred to. 2. This question involves a inatter of policy, and it is not the practice to make a statement upon such matters in reply to' questions. AUSTRALIAN IMPERIA L FORCE.

40,Mr WATT,PAYMENT TO IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT,"The sum of £500,000 was set apart as grants to local government bodies to enable additional works to be undertaken, to open up avenues of employment for discharged soldiers. In order to apportion that sum, it was divided among the States in the first place on the basis of population, and then subdivided according to the number of local government bodies in each State. The grants thus payable to each of the local government bodies were-In New South Wales, £599; in Victoria, £749; in Queensland, £374; in South Australia, £243; in Western Australia, £216; in Tasmania, £406; average, £465.

42,Mr MASSYGREENE,PAYMENT TO IMPERIAL GOVERNMENT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. No. 2 and 3. Shipments .may be made to' Australia on the understanding that all such shipments will be held under Customs control pending introduction of the new Tariff, after which delivery will be given subject to the payment of duty. 4.

Whether it is true that a large number of hides are being reduced to pulp fonm in Australia and exported to America in connection with the motor tyre making industry? 2. Has the Department any statistics showing the quantity of hides exported in this reduced condition; if. so, will the Minister supply a return for the twelve months ended 30th June, 1919? ' I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :1. No. 2. There have been no exports of hides in pulp form from the Commonwealth during the year 1918 19. ; NA SOLDIERS.",26
49,Mr WISE,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Wit h regard to Mr. Kelly's statement, on the motion for the t adjournment of the House on Thursday, on the subject of the treatment of consumptive soldiers in New South Wales, at the present time we have a sanatorium at Bodington, in the Blue Mountains, another sanatorium is in course of erection at Kuring-gai-chase, and we have also a building in the hospital grounds at Randwick set apart for the accommodation of consumptive patients-this building was selected only after careful consideration, and with due regard to the interests of all concerned. The sanatorium in the Blue Mountains is full, and pending the completion of the Kuring-gai-chase sanatorium, it has been necessary to find accommodation for the overflowin the building at Randwick. This building, however, is intended for patients in an advanced stage of consumption, and as soon as the Kuring-gai-chase sanatorium is ready the patients (with the exception of the advanced cases) who cannot be accommodated at Bodington will be removed from Randwick to Kuring-gaiohase. Patients at Randwick will then be limited to advanced cases only, and the medical authorities state that in such cases treatment by the sea is at least as good, and probably preferable, to treatment in a mountainous area. Randwick is certainly far more convenient for most of the friends of such patients, and this must be a source of comfort to the men. The statement of the Principal Medical Officer, Sydney, that the men appreciated the action of the medical authorities in arranging for their treatment at Randwick, and that of Mr Kelly that 75 per cent, qf the men denied this to the Secretary of the Returned - Soldiers' League, is probably due to the fact that the Principal Medical Officer's statement referred only to those in an 'advanced stage of the disease, for whom alone the hospital is intended, while the Secretary of the League interviewed cases in all stages of the disease. The Principal Medical Officer still insists that the patients in the advanced stage prefer treatment at Randwick. With regard to the statement that the men were prevented from going to the mountains because certain places there had been occupied for a long time by men who had not been to the war, I am informed that there are no non-returned men in the departmental sanatorium in the Blue Mountains, though, of course, some may be at private institutions. The Department has no objection to offer to Mr Kelly's suggestion that where a man, who is in an advanced stage of consumption, desires to be treated in the local hospital near his home, arrangements should be made for him to be permitted to do so, and instructions will be issued to the medical authorities that this be done so far as it is practicable. . I am further informed by the departmental medical authorities that, so far as the interests of Randwick are concerned, there is no danger to surrounding inhabitants from a well-managed consumptive hospital.

Motion (by Mr Glynn) agreed toThat leave he given to bring in a Bill Act to amend the Referendum (Constitution Alteration) Act 1906-1915. Bill presented, and read a first time. LANDTAXBILL (No. 2 ) . In Committee of Ways and Means:  ister) [3.2S] - I move- . That, in addition to the land tax payable under the provisions of the Land Tax 1910-1914, there be imposed for the financial year 1919-1920 an additional land tax, to 20 per centum of the amount of landtax payable under those provisions. There is no alteration in the measure as passed last year. It continues the super land tax imposed then for one year. the income taxpayer. There is no amendment or variation, and there is therefore no need to occupy time in explaining the Bill .",26
50,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Y a r r a ) [3.29] - In the case of the income tax, there is, first, super tax of 25 per cent., and then additional tax of 30 per cent., which was put on last year for the first time, and is continued this year. I do notSome know whether the 30 per cent, is calcuside lated on the original tax, or on the original tax, plus the 25 per cent.",27
51,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,It is on the two added together.,27
52,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Then that makes at least 55 per cent, additional burden horne by those who have to pay income tax, whole. whereas the rich land-holders have to meet an increase of only 20. per cent. No one can say that they are not well off, because before a man is called upon to pay the Commonwealth land tax, he must be possessed of land to the unimproved value of at least £5,000. H must be in a fair position before he has to pay land tax.  ing now up to 10£d. in the £ 1 .",27
53,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"If a man made an in come from that land, would he not have to pay income tax ?",27
54,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I am calling attention to the differential treatment. Income taxpayers are required to pay an additional 50 per cent., whereas the landowners-and the persons who pay this tax, exoept the owners of city lands, are not small land-owners-ar e asked to pay only an additional 20 per cent. The income tax comes right down to the man who for an earns only £ 3 per week, which today is less than a living wage, b ut the land tax does not reach any man who owns land of an unimproved value of less than £5,000, which means, with improvements, an estate worth at least £8,000 to £10,000.",27
55,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"So m e States i m pose a land tax on even the smallest land-holders. Act Mr TUDOR - Yes , but the States imequal £>ose an income tax, too. In Victoria there is a small exemption, and I believe that this year, for the first time, a deduction is to be allowed for children. The land-holder is able to bear an additional impost at least equally as well as",27
56,Mr JOWETT,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The land-holder pays both the taxes.,27
57,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Of course he does a when he makes an income, b ut on acan count of the Government buying lands all over Australia for the settlement of soldiers, land values are being inflated. persons may ask why we, on this pf the House, do not move for an amendment of this tax in order to make the land-holder bear a heavier burden. The explanation is that only a Minister can move to increase the rate of taxation, and that means that an increase must be sanctioned by the Ministry as a  the laud tax about 10$d. in the f l on the highest grades, so that the landholder is being made to pay fairl y stiffly.",27
58,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"V e r y likely, b ut the e Budget-papers show that the Commonwealth derived a very small revenue from the land tax in comparison with that earned by the income tax. Y e t the Goare increasing by 55 per cent, the impost on a man who earns upwards - of £ 3 per week, whilst the land-holder is required to pay only an additional 20 per cent. There is another differentiation in our taxation. When we increased the postage we required the payment of an additional Jd. uniformly over all letters and jpapers. I have never heard one person complain of that tax, but there is an anomaly in the fact that the insurance companies, banks, and other big financial institutions, which post bulky documents on which the postage is 5s. to £ 1 , pay only the same increase of Jd. We, on this side, can take no steps to remove that anomaly, because it is outside the province of a private member to do more than suggest an in crease in a tax. I believe that the Treasurer is making a mistake in increasing . the land tax by only 20 per cent., when bhis House has already increased the in come tax by 55 per cent. Question resolved in the .affirmative. Resolution reported, Standing Orders suspended, and report adopted. Ordered pare and bring in a Bill to carry out foregoing resolution. Bill presented, and read a. first second time. In Committee: Clause 1 (Short title).",27
59,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Y a r r a ) [3.37] - The clause merely re-enacts the land tax for one year. Some of the other taxes are imposed without any such limitation. The entertainments tax is one of tliem, and - if no amending Bill is introduced this year the people will soon be paying the same-tax. Why are not all taxation measures placed on a uniform basis, complaint either with or without a time limit? Clause agreed tc*. Title agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.

One penny for the first shilling and 'one half-penny for every sixpence or part of sixpence by which the payment exceeds one shilling - ""Continuous place of entertainment"" means a place of entertainment which is open for more than four hours on more than.two days in the week for the admission of persons to the entertainment upon payment. the It was in 1916 that an entertainments tax was first imposed, at the rate of i d . , and on every 6d. charged for admission. In November, 1918', the Act was amended, and the rates fixed were Id', on any charge-not exceeding Is.; and, exceeding Is., l d . for the first Is., and - Jd. for every additional 6d. Mr . MCWILLIAMS - How much revenue will be lost by the new Bill ?  is £92,000 on the year's transactions. The amendment now proposed will remove the continued complaint of irregularity in the incidence of the tax ; that is, the that the rate is as high on the lower priced ticket as on the higher price of Is., making the percentage-on the 3d. ticket higher than that on the Is. ticket, and so on. Another complaint in regard to the present tax is that it penalizes the children; the proposed amendment exempts all under sixteen years of age. The Government think that they can now see their position in regard to their (No. 2). commitments, and they have come to the conclusion that they can at least remove this imposition as it affects picture shows. n - There has been much complaint by picture-show proprietors, but I am afraid by the their anxiety is not so much concerning the children as concerning themselves. These proprietors have from time to time been very severe on the Government, because in tlieir opinion the tax is an unjust one. They, however, did not directly refer to the children, but to the tax as a whole; and it would be as well to show how far they have shown consideration for the p u b l i c' One would think, from the criticism of the proprietors, 'that the tax represented a great hardship on the people; but, as a matter of fact, the complaint of the people who attend picture shows is not as to the tax, but as to the increased prices of admission.",28
60,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Hear , hear! The "" r o p ing off "" of reserved seats on holidays and Saturday nights.  the question I have received the following report: Further reports indicate that average prices of admission to Melbourne theatres have been increased from 2s. to 2s. lOd. in 1909, and 3s. 3d. to 5s. 6d. in 1919. This excludes charges of 10s. for hooked seats on ""First nights."" In Sydney, the average prices have been increased from Is. 3d. to 2s. 9d. in 1!)09 and ls. 10*d. to 4s.

In the year 1916, before the entertainments tax was imposed, average prices of admission to Melbourne theatres were 2s. 6d. to 4s. lOi'd. This year, 1919, the entertainments tax being levied, the average prices are 3s. 3d. to os. 7*d. The report of the Commissioner shows(a) The ls. admission has been discontinued at Her Majesty's theatre on ' all days, and at all theatres on Saturdays and public holidays.

This proposed amendment will relieve my honourable friends opposite from the necessity of telling their oft-repeated story about the 33J per cent, charged on the admission tickets of the children, and I am afraid they will never forgive me for depriving tliem of a very fine election cry. However, the fact that there is this tax on the children has been prominently brought under my notice by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor).",29
64,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,That will make a good election cry for me.,29
65,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The Government will want it all.  we shall want all the revenue we can raise, but I think we can manage to remove the tax on children's tickets, and even up the incidence of the taxation in the way provided in the Bill .",29
66,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Y a r r a ) [ 3 . 5 0 ] - I am pleased that, the Government have decided to make this reduction, .because I have always held that no tax should be imposed on 3d. entertainment tickets. I have f r equently spoken in Opposition to such an impost, and I am glad that it is to be removed. At a conference, of the National party held recently at Bendigo, it was urged that the tax on 3d. tickets should be removed, not because it wasuujust, but for the reason that it supplied the Labour party with a stick with which to beat the Government. When this tax operated for the first time last year, complaints were made by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr . Mahony) and others - that children who paid I d . for admission to baths had to pay an extra l d . by way of tax. I desire to know whether those who pay l d . or 3d. for admission to a swimming bath will have to pay this tax i ",29
67,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I sliould like to see all swimming baths free to the public; but I recognise that some provision has to be made for their upkeep. I take it that it is not intended that this tax shall applyto merry-go-rounds, ocean waves, or other amusements of that kind. . I hope that when the regulations are framed, care will be taken to confine the tax to picture shows and such like entertainments, and not to allow it to apply, as was done last year, to swimming baths and various other establishments. This proposal will grant some measure of relief, and I am very glad that even at the eleventh hour the Government have realized the justice of' the contention of the Opposition, that children's tickets of admission to places of amusement should not be taxed. The Honorary  afraid that the people will take the view that, but for the approach of a general election, this measure of relief would not have been granted. I again express my pleasure that the Minister has seen fit to yield to the arguments of the Opposition, that the children of the Commonwealth should not be subject to heavy taxation, when their parents desire to provide them with a 3d. seat in a picture show.",30
68,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Franklin) [3.55]. - When the Entertainments Tax Bill was before the House last year, I suggested that the Government should adopt the scale of taxation applied to amusements in Great Britain. Under that, scale the taxation on the liigher priced tickets would be considerably increased, and the revenue - correspondingly augmented, while at the same time relief would be granted in respect of the lower priced tickets of admission. I recognise that it is quite useless, on the eve of a general election, and when many honourable members . are already on their way to their constituencies, to deal with general principles; but I intend to express my regret that the Government are prepared to forego any revenue whatever at the present time. The Budget statement, which we have yet to consider, shows that we have to face an enormous increase of expenditure, and that our public indebtedness per head of the population is heavier, perhaps, than that of any other country. In the circumstances, the Government are making a very serious mistake in throwing away, as they will do under this proposal, revenue to the extent of £92,000. If it is deemed advisable to remove the tax on the low priced tickets, the Government should make good the loss of revenue so sustained by increasing the taxation on the higher priced tickets. It is better that the people should be taxed on their amusements and their follies rather than in respect of their necessities.",30
69,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Is recreation a folly?,30
70,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"No . This tax, however, unquestionably relates to amusements, and those who go to places bf amusement can, in my opinion, afford to pay something by way of taxation. When the matter was before us last year I urged the Government to remit the tax on the lower priced tickets, and to considerably increase the sliding scale of taxation relating to the higher priced tickets of admission to places of entertainment. Would it not be better for the Government to adopt the scale of taxation applying to entertainments in Great Britain ? In that way relief would be granted to tliose who purchased the lower priced tickets, while those who could afford to purchase the higher priced tickets would have to pay increased taxation. We read of record attendances at stadiums, football and race meetings. Surely the people who attend such gatherings might.reasonably be asked to contribute something to the revenue of the Commonwealth. Having regard to the fact that drastic retrenchment and increased taxation will be necessary, I think the Government arecommitting almost an act of criminal folly in deliberately throwing away reveuue to the extent of £92,000. If I thought I could, carry an amendment at this stage I would propose that the Government be asked to. adopt the scale of taxation for amusements now - operating in Great Britain, but, for the reason I have already given, I recognise that it would be.useless at this stage to attempt to do so.",30
71,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Maribyrnong) [4.0]  claims to have satisfied the public demand by proposing the remission of the tax on children's 3d. entertainment tickets. His statement that this will involve a loss of £92,000 a year proves conclusively that the Opposition have been right in urging from the firstthat the taxation of children's 3d. tickets is a cruel injustice.",30
72,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The last Labour Government intended to impose a heavier tax on children's tickets.,31
73,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The Treasurer in that Government (Mr Higgs) made some such announcement in his Budget speech, bu t the honourable who was then a member party, will bear me out when I say that the proposal had not received the approval of the party. I have behind more than one Labour Governtickets ment, but have had occasion sometimes to vote against them, and I would do so again is such a proposal were made. I have never believed in the taxation of low-priced tickets. If we are to have a tax on amusements it should relate only to the higher priced tickets, purchased those who can well afford to pay such taxation. I should be very sorry to see amusements so taxed as to deprive the poorer sections of the community of the opportunity to enjoy an hour or more every week at a picture show or some other entertainment. Even under this proposal the mother and father of a family who purchased 3d. tickets for a picture show would pay tax of I d . , and if they took with.them boy and gir l over sixteen years of age, they would pay a tax of 2d. in respect one night's amusement. Threepenny tickets, whether used by young or old, should be exempt from taxation.

75,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The 3d. seats in a picture show are immediately in fron t the screen: but people who can afford purchase the higher priced tickets are commodated with luxurious seats.,31
76,Mr BURCHELL,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,How would the honthis orable member make up the loss of venue ?,31
77,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"A suggestion in that direction has already been made by the iti honourable member for Franklin (Mr . MCWilliams). He says that the Commitassented tee is in such a state, immediately prior in the House. to an election, that it is not capable of giving a second thought even to profound proposal that could be submitted by a Minister. However, I am not taken. in favour of the taxation of tickets below Is., and move That the following words be left out of the motion:""Not exceeding fivepence for the admission to a continuous place of entertainment of persons apparently over the age of member, sixteen years-On e halfpenny of our Sixpence-On e halfpenny.

79,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Then the tax by would not be worth collecting.,31
80,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"All I can say in reply to that statement is that the people now proposed to be taxed are those who are paying the greatest share of the taxation of the country. It is difficult, immediately following the Minister's explanation, to properly formulate an amendment, but, in any case, my proposal should improve the schedule. Amusements and recreation are part and parcel a of the life of the people. I regret that a municipalities in large centres of population did not have sufficient foresight in of the early days of picture shows to build halls and enjoy the revenue which is now flowing into private pockets. I regret, also, that the Honorary Minister (Mr . Poynton) has not seen his way clear to give greater relief to the poorer section of the community, who, under our unfortunate and unscientific methods of the taxation, are called upon to contribute everything.  of ister) [4.10] -'It is marvellous how virto tuous some people become the older they acget.

In addition to the £92,000 which I am prepared to lose, the carrying of this amendment would mean a loss of over £100,000 in revenue. I am not prepared to give up that amount. The schedule as it stands jjrovides for a reasonable concession, and the Government must oppose the amendment.",31
84,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Melbourne Ports) [4.13] - Accordin g to the Honorary M i  marks, people do not growl at the entercome tainments tax, but growl because houses of entertainment have raised charges. That may have occurred in the cities, but there have been no increases charges in the suburban picture show? except, perhaps, on Saturday nights. the Minister is seeking for fresh avenues of taxation, he could easily exploit the high-priced tickets for theatres and meetings. I do not think that the person who is prepared to pay 10s. for a first night seat at a theatre would object paying 2s. in the shape of entertainvote ments tax. Racing clubs charge their patrons 12s., as against the old rate 10s. 6d. I do not think that the person revenue. who is prepared to pay 12s. for admission to a racecourse would object to paying an extra 2s -6d. in the shape of entertaintroduced. ments tax. I wish to draw the Minislyzed, ter's attention to the taxation which is imposed upon national associations and friendly societies. 'Members of associations, such as the Caledonian 'Society, the Hibernian Society, St. George's Society, pay from 5s. to 10s. per annum, and, in addition to the ordiable nary meetings at which national questo tions are discussed, they meet in social have done so. gatherings, or have dances, or sing-songs. Yet the Commissioner of Taxation lects a portion of their annual subscripMinister tions. Of course, it is said that tliese societies can make an additional charge to their members to cover the amount of the tax, and that no one would growl, but those who take an interest in such organizations know that it takes the committees controlling them all their time to make ends meet.",32

The officials who conduct them for national love have many times had to n - put their hands in their pockets to make Y e t the taxation officers in every year, and collect a portion of the membership fees.

91,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"My faults may be colmany. Heaven knows how many the will have to answer for. Every theatre has increased its prices of admission during the war, and I accept the statement, made either in this House, or outside by one who is in a position to know, that the theatre proprietor's have largely increased their profits. It is the profits that should be taxed, and I say to the Government, "" Tax the profits as high The taxation on profits in Ours Our income tax rates cease to increase at between £6,000 and £7,000 per year.",32
92,Mr MASSYGREENE,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"That does not apply to the war-time profits tax. ' Dr MALONEY - That is a little heavier. Why should the man who has to pay income tax on a very moderate wage, and to pay, also, the unjustly increased prices of the present day, have to pay another tax on his ticket if he goes to a place of amusement? The present day taxation, like the taxation of the past, is all in the direction of making the workers pay and letting the rich escape. The ratio of this tax is not fair / Its cidence is not fair. It is contemptible to begin by taxing the Gd. ticket. I thank the Government for doing away with .the tax on the 3d. ticket; but would I be unjust in attributing their action to the shadow of the coming election?",33
93,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Franklin) [4.24]. --The authorities in the Old Country have levied much heavier taxation to meet the war expenditure than we have done. Their expenditure on the war out of revenue has been enormously greater in proportion than ours'has been. They have faced the question of war expenditure by taxing their people to a much greater extent than we have, because we have confined ourselves almost wholly to loans to meet our expenditure on the war. In Great Britain the 2Jd. ticket pays a tax of Jd., the'4d. ticket pays Id., the 7d. ticket 2d., the ls. ticket 3d., the 2s. 4d., and so on until the 10s. 6d. ticket pays a tax of ls. 6d. If the Committee desires to relieve the 3d., ticket of the I would again urge the Government so to increase the. tax on the higher priced tickets that we may not lose this revenue. I would impress on them, before they surrender one penny of revenue, the fact that as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow, every penny of taxation that we are remitting today will, have to be re-imposed with much increased force when the new Parliament meet's. We are extremely ill-advised in deliberately throwing away £92,000 a year just on the eve of an election, when we know that this House has not faced the financial problems which are being forced, upon our attention. No private member can move to increase taxation, and so if would urge the Government again-if they intend to remit this amount of taxation, from the lowest priced tickets-so to amend their scale that at least the amount they are throwing away will be made good out of the taxation on the higher priced tickets. In that way, we shall not be asked to surrender revenue - to the extent of £92,000 which we need now, and will need in the future. I appeal to the Government not to throw away deliberately money which we want so badly. If the tax was retained, it would not constitute one scrap of punishment, injury, cruelty, or hardship to any class in the community. We have invaded practically every avenue of intaxation that was left to the States, and I do not know where we are to get the increased revenue that we shall be called upon to provide in the near future. I urge the Government to consider the position seriously. If they are not prepared to face the question of raising theenormous taxation that will have to be imposed in the near future, they should at least not throw away revenue, every penny of which will have to be re-imposed when the new Parliament meets, that is, if the new Parliament intends to face the liabilities which are pressing upon us. I cannot understand a proposal to throwaway deliberately £92,000 a year coming from. any Government when we are in such serious straits for the money.",33
94,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Adelaide) [4.29] - I intend to support the amendment. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr. ticket MCWilliams) would conveythe impression that to save Australia from financial chaos and insolvency we have to come down on the "" k i d d y "" who goes to the tax, picture show - I thought the soldiers had already placed Australia high and dry and safe for Democracy. The honourable member should be a working man, with four or five ""kiddies,"" and earning only the bare minimum wage offered by Mr. Justice Higgins, or any other man who sits in a cosy chair and crucifies the working man's wife in the witness-box as to the least she can live on. He would then know what a hardship the tax on the picture-show tickets is. The honourable member has never focussed his attention on the position of a working man with four or five "" kiddies ""- a man who likes to see his children have a little pleasure in this life. God knows that a threepenny picture show is little enough pleasure. When the father pays the tax on tickets for four dr five children, he pays a big l u m p; and if the children get the enjoyment that should be theirs he is actually paying a weekly tax. According to the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) wheu this tax was first imposed, there was nothing left to tax out of a minimum wage of £3 per week. If that was true at that time, it is doubly and trebly true today. Still , the Government "" get into "" the worker. The honourable member for says the tax will have to be re-imposed, and talks very seriously about it. about the £102,000,000 increased posits in the cheque-paying banks of Australia ? I do not believe in a class tax such as this.' I do not agree with the man who never goes to a picture show escaping his national responsibilities. the honourable member for - (Dr Maloney) says, we should impose a scientific system of taxation, under which every one would pay in proportion to his ability to pay. The only way that can be done is by means of an income tax adjusted with no light hand in accordance with the amount of income each possesses. It is the height of absurdity to say that that cannot be done, or that the revenue cannot be raised, in view of the tone of the Budget speech delivered in this chamber only last week.  another insight today into the means by which we may do the riglit thing by the people of Australia. Recently, when we were discussing the Bills for the alteration of the Constitution, every, time the word ""profiteer"" was mentioned, we heard a guffaw from one honourable the other"" on the Ministerial side. asked us where the profiteer was. Honorary Minister told us .of profiteering in the amusements business. patronize picture shows or theatres to any great extent; but, comparing prices of admission that _ ruled times gone by with those charged today, I am satisfied that the have not administered the profits tax in the way it should have been administered, in view of the fact they collected only £1,886,000 through its agency last year. A big part of that amount, according figures, could have been obtained entertainments alone: and it would be interesting to know, if it was possible to ascertain the facts from the Taxation Deilr. Yates. partment, how much of the tax came from that source. The Minister's statements regarding entertainment charges . astonished me, and I hope that something, will be done to bring these people to book. They are evidently taking advantage of the extra money that has been put into circulation owing to the exigencies of the war, to quite as great an extent as has any boot or clothing profiteer Franklin that we have heard of. We are asked what we suggeJt as a means of raising, What revenue. I have already suggested a way de- out which can be taken as soon as the people are prepared to accept it and act upon it . The most efficient manner of meeting the financial troubles of the Commonwealth is to get hold of the wealth of the Commonwealth. We shall never As get "" o u r b it "" u n t il we do so. I Melbourne .reiterate that the most scientific system of running this Commonwealth, in the way of providing the financial wherewithal, is to grapple with finance itself. We must devise some method of utilizing the wealth that is here, without individual paying the exorbitant interest on it that the war times - called for. The then Acting Treasurer (Mr . Poynton) stated in his Budget speechThe results of the 1917-18 season were highlyThe Honor- satisfactory, as the value of pastoral producgave lis tion amounted to £93,700,000, the highest sum on record; while all round increases occurred in the live stock figures throughout Australia. Yet, honourable members talk about ruining the Commonwealth by removing the i d . tax on the "" kiddies'"" 3d. picture show tickets. Shame to the honourable member or member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) if They he upholds this tax when the Acting The Treasurer's statement shows that the in dustry which the honoraible member reI do not presents earned in 1917-lS £93,700,000. I do not wonder at there being Bolsheviks the in Australia. So long as honourable memin bers try to cheat the people, sd long will they be hatching Bolsheviks-o r ProGovernment gressives, as I prefer to call them-wh o war-time will see that - the cost of the Commonwealth's upkeep rests equitably upon the that wealth that is produced. That is the policy that should be adopted instead of placing a Jd. tax on the tickets of persons to the Minister's who, after toiling and moiling year in from and year out to produce the wealth of the country, and to pay every tax which is passed on to them, seek a little amusement - for themselves and their "" kiddies."" I have mentioned the pastoral industry, not because I have any grudge against it , but because it is the first industry mentioned in the Budget speech. But the same story is to be found throughout the production Statistics for the war period, and the Committee will be doing no more than bare justice if it removes a tax that ought never to have been imposed on those who seek to keep themselves virile and sunnytempered by paying for a little recreation in their spare time. Do not let us say that we will save the Commonwealth by collecting a Jd. on each 3d. that a ""kiddy"" pays to go into a picture show, or even by taxing the amount that a'man pays to go on a race-course. The wealth production of a Commonwealth should bear the bur-, den of taxation, and the statistics show that there is a wide area of taxation to be developed without imposing this iniquiti-, ous tax. I"" shall vote for the amendment.",33

No vote was ever - taken upon either. The honourable member for Capricornia continuedWAU-TIME PROFITS TAX 1915-16. The Government propose to take 50 per cent, of the profits for the year 1915-16, allowing an exemption of £200, and a profit standard of 5 per cent, and C'per cent. What did the Nationalist Government do? They proposed an exemption, not of £200, but of £1,000, and a profit standard of not 5 per cent, and 6 per cent, but 10 per cent. The Labour Treasurer continuedWAR-TIME PROFITS TAX 1916-17. The Government propose to allow a standard of 7 and 8 per cent, for this year, and an exemption of £200, but propose to take all the war profits over this sum. Government supporters defend themselves by saying that the honourable member for Capricornia proposed an entertainments tax ; but they are silent upon the fact that they dare not proceed with the war-time profits tax which he I refer proposed. When they say that we on this side proposed an entertainments tax, will they also tell the people. that the other financial proposals of the Labour Government were a wealth levy of l j per cent., and a tax on war-time profits, allowing an exemption of only £200, instead of the £1,000 allowed by the Nationalist Government, and that it was intended in the following year to take all war-time profits in excess of die exemption and the profit standard of 7' and 8 per cent. I hope that I have disposed once and for all of the statement that the entertainments tax was voted upon in this House. None of those financial proposals embodied in the Ministerial statement which I have quoted was the subject of a vote of the House. The then Treasurer (Mr . Higgs) made his statement on the 27th September, 1916, and within a week Parliament had been adjourned, and we were in the midst of the' conscription referendum campaign. The vote took place on the 2Sth October",35
103,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The House did not sit from the 3rd October to the 29th November.,36
104,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Honourable members will see that within a week of the making of that statement by. the thenTreasurer honourable members were facing the electors on'the conscription issue. . Mr LYNCH - Does the honourable member deny that the Labour party did not repudiate the principle of a wealth tax?  policy speech.,36
105,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,I am anxious to state the facts fairly. It is unfair to pick out - the - entertainments tax asone of the financial proposals of the Labour Government in 1916. and to ignore the fact that it was part - of a series which included the wealth levy and the war-time profits tax. If the oarty abandoned' the wealth tax it is only fair to say that we abandoned also the entertainments tax.  must have been aoproved by the party as part of the policy of the Government before being introduced by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs).,36
106,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"So was the wealth levy, but, later, the party became wiser, and abandoned both those proposals. But we never abandoned the war-time profits tax. The former honourable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) stated in the House that the war-time profits tax proposed by the Nationalist Government was useless, and that the Bill might as well be thrown into the waste-paper basket, because the shipping companies, the mining companies, the coal-mining companies, and all the other firms which were making big profits, would go. absolutely scot-free. The question of an. entertainments tax was never voted on, though the Labour party as a whole may have agreed to such a tax. On this latter point I am not quite clear.",36
107,Mr LYNCH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The Labour party agreed to it , and also to an exemption for each child under the income tax.",36
108,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Howeve r that may be, the financial proposals were then introduced as a whole! The position today is quite different, and a man who will not (learn from experience is a fool.",36
109,Mr ATKINSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Y o u are not against the motion?,36
110,Mr TUDOR,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"So f ar as the enter-' tainments tax is concerned I would wipe 'out the whole, because I do not believe in the principle. It may be quite accurate, as stated, that the proprietors of certain places of amusement have raised their orices of admission, but, perhaps, those proprietors may have something to say in reply. I remind the Committee that when the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) introduced his Bud-' get he dealt with the finances as a whole, and did not single out one section of the their community.",36
111,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Maribyrnong ) [4.52] I agree that there is a black time ahead of us; but there has been a black time ahead for the poor people of the country for several years now. It is probable that the question of an entertainments tax was discussed at our party meetings, but its incidence' was never related, that being a Cabinet matter. At any rate, on the 27th September,. 1916, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs) introduced his Budget, in which was in cluded the entertainments tax proposals. From then up to the3rd October several financial' Bills were put through, but an Entertainments Tax Bill was not among them. The House then adjourned for the referendum campaign, and after we reassembled on the 29th or 30th November the honourable member for Yarra (Mr . Tudor) moved a vote ,of want of confidence in the Government. W it h the exception of an Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill', and one or two other small money measures, no financial proposal was introduced between the 27th September and the 30th November. That parties were all askew, and had no opportunity to record a vote concerning an entertainments tax, is proved conclusively by the motion of want of confidence; and there is thus cleared up a lot of "" tarradiddles "" in connection with the matter. Government are not prepared to accept the amendment they ought to accept some modification of it .",36
112,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Melbourne Ports) [4.55] - I merely wish to inform the M i n that during his absence from the chamber I pointed out that there are organizations, the members of which are charged so.much a year, and then hold an entertainment at which certain outsiders are allowed to attend on paying a charge. I do not think that the money paid by members of such organizations ought to be taxed, seeing that there is no profit made out of these affairs, which are conducted by people associated in a friendly way. Similar organizations are conducted by some churches, and I hope that the Government wil l see their way to do something to meet the position.

I erroneously referred 6d. and Is. tickets, whereas I should have spoken of the ratio of taxation on 3d. and 6d. tickets. The tax upon 3d. tickets is double what it has been on the 6d. tickets; in other words, a tax of Jd. on 3d. tickets is equal to 1 6 | petcent.,, whereas a tax of Jd. on 6d. tickets is only 8J per cent.

We have not yet been able to secure, with respect to this matter, a reading of the law that satisfies the Government. I have only to say that it is not the desire of the Government to tax entertainments to raise funds for the building of memorial halls, or any of the objects about which considerable dispute' .has arisen in recent months.

In Gommittee of Supply: Ordered That the consideration of the General Estir mates be postponed until after the consideration of Estimates for Additions, New Works, ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC. had DEPARTMENT OE WORKS AND RAILWAYS . Proposed vote, £140,852. (Balaclava-Treasurer ) [5.25] - For the information of the Committee, I propose to give a very brief survey of the figures in connection with this For some years past, when dealing with the Estimates of Expenditure, it has' been the practice to defer consideration of the Estimates, and deal first with the Estimates for additions, new works, and buildings, so that the construction of works in progress may proceed.with full and appropriation authority, and not await prothe passage of the general Estimates. The total amount included in the Estif or additions, new works, and for the current financial year is £397,144, which is £57,807 less than the amount appropriated for the year 191819 j and when it is remembered that the submitted for last financial were £802,666 less than the amount provided for the year 1917-18, it will be that every endeavour is being made curtail this kind of expenditure wherever possible. The provision made in the Estimates' before the Committee is mainly to conis tinue works which were in progress on the 30th June; 1919, and only under very or urgent circumstances have new services been provided for . The principal items of expenditure are as follow: Quarantine buildings .. Federal Capital Territory-'Physica l testing plant and incidental works Drill halls and ordnance stores for the Defence Department . . Other Defence works and buildings . . .10,944 Post Office buildings .. Water boring, dredging, and other works and buildings, Northern Territory .. Telegraphs, telephones, and conduits 165,000 Warlike, stores, including field and machine guns, equipment, &c.

144,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"No . I am merely giving a rough survey of the schedule of expenditure. Ministers will be in charge of the Estimates for their respective Departments, and will be prepared to give every detailed information that honourable members may desire.",40
145,Mr BURCHELL,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Fremantle) [5.29] At such a late stage in the session, on the evp of the prorogation of Parliaon ment, it would, perhaps, of place to appeal for additional expenditure on works, but there are many parts of Australia very much aviation in need of post-offices and halls. ^In this respect the constituency Fremantle has been very harshly treated in the past. The mention of isolated cases,- which may not seem to be of great importance, raises the question of the fence. broad policy of expenditure of this nature. I think that the whole situation ought to be reviewed, particularly with the object of providing more post-offices and improving existing facilities. The lack of expenditure on drill halls may be due to the recent decision of the Government to discontinue - the general training scheme pending the consideration of the whole financial outlay on defence; but I urge that further consideration . . £12,552 should be given to the claims of Cottesloe, in Western Australia, for a drill hall. 4,800 The local authorities there have arranged with the State Government to have a por49,100 tion of some land, which is vested in the municipality, made available for a drill 43,974 site, and they have levelled it and cleared it , so that there will be no expense on . . 15,100 the part of the Defence Department in regard to the land itself; but the council are asking that some shelter should be pro. . 20,000 vided for the trainees. The district is right on the sea front , and during the 40,000 winter the boys suffer great hardship i l 17,192 they are exposed to the weather, when 9,000 undergoing training. There is a drill hall at Claremont, the adjoining suburb, but .. ' 5,100 the Defence Department makes no pro4,382 vision for the boys to meet in one central . . £307,144 place. Some years ago the then Postmaster General agreed to purchase a site for. a post-office at Cottesloe Beach, and the land was bought, but as hard times subsequently beset the Government of the day, the provision for the building was struck off the Estimates. We are again faced with the necessity to make ends meet. I should like to know if anything can be done to go on with the original plan of providing a separate building to conduct the post-office work at Cottesloe Beach. This should be underaken by the Government if it is at all possible. I have touched only on local wants and wishes, although I am not one, as a rule, and to adopt that course. I prefer to speak broader questions. In that con'be oub nexion, I wish to discuss aviation. Will the Minister state what is proposed to be done with the £40,000 provided for in the works and buildings esti-. drill mates ? Is it only for land and buildings, of or how is the money likely to be expended ? I had some experience in France extending over thirteen months, and know the value of air defence and of-.' If ' the r e is one phase of the Australian Defence policy that should receive more than ordinary consideration at a time like this, it is aviation, including the provision of the necessary hangars and personnel in different parts of the Commonwealth. We have very widely separated areas to protect. We have a huge coast-line, and it is absolutely essential to provide the speediest means of communication from a defence point of view. In the advance made towards the, end of October at. the northern end of the Commonwealth. the British line in France, the authorities, by means of aeroplanes, kept up with the advancing troops after they had long, passed over Passchendaele and the surrounding coumtry, not only in the matter of munitions, but actually in the protwo. vision of food supplies. From t alone, honourable members:, will realise what an important part the aeroplane played in the war in the matter munication and transport. I must exshifted. press my regret that the Government propose so small an expenditure for aviation purposes. I am not in their confidence how. as to their proposals, but I would impress on them that the question of aviation have to be handled quickly. We need get the best machines and the most exber perienced men. There are Australianl 'born men who can control our aviation - defence remarkably well. The Austraquestion lian Flying Corps did good work in France, and we can easily get omcers with the necessary experience who advise the Government and see that best machines are obtained. When i London recently, I was informed by an Australian then serving in the A i r Force Department that the request of the tralian Government to be supplied with plans and specifications of the latest of aeroplane had been replied to A i r Department in London supplying plans of machines which had been disthose carded at least six months before by the Imperial authorities themselves. That in formation came to me from a source upon which I can absolutely rely. I therefore urge the Government to be very careful to see that they get the latest plans, above all , that they do not place their confidence wholly and solely in Imperial - officers, but take advantage of the brains, energy, and ability of our Australianground, born, who have learnt in the school of - experience. I hope we shall have a repreparations view of the whole of the aviation defence proposals, and that the Minister will us definitely what is to be done with vote of £40,000. The future defence this country, by means of aviation and submarines, is one of the most important questions which we have to consider. Our air defence schould not be concenwealth trated in one or two places. We have at Point Cook, perhaps, the nucleus our Australian air force, but I want to, see hangars erected also in other parts of;",40
146,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,And they are. talking of shifting the Point Cook school to Gee,41
147,Mr BURCHELL,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"An y one who knows the comparative closeness of those sites must wonder why any such deh at fact cision has been reached.. Mr TUDOR.'-They have been looking around Drysdale way for a site, but I do of comnot know that the school has been",41
148,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,They must keep up the expenditure in Victoria some,41
149,Mr BURCHELL,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I do not say that will the Government are actuated by the to policy suggested by the honourable memf o r Illawarra (Mr Lamond), but we a d l y need considerably more aerodromes in other parts of Australia. It is not a of bringing men to one central place to train them. We have a sufficient number of experienced instructors, who cancan be sent to other part? of the Comthe monwealth to train the younger men on n the spot as they offer themselves. Tho day is rapidly passing when we must concentrate everything in Victoria and in AusNew South Wales. Everything connected with naval examinations, for instance, is type concentrated in Victoria. I should like by the to know why, from a Commonwealth point of view, we cannot have some of examinations held in other parts of Australia. The outlying States should be - given more consideration in the construction of aerodromes than has been shown them so far. We cannot have too many aerodromes and - landing places around the and, Australian coast. The Frenchman who, according to the cables, has left Paris on a flight to Australia can, it is true, land on practically almost any level piece of but as he has no knowledge of the local.conditions, we shall have to make for his guidance. All the world over, aviation is rapidly coming to tell the fore, not only from a defence, but the also from a commercial point of view. The of G'overnment must take the matter seriously in hand. They must decide whether the whole of the aviation arrangements in Australia shall be under Commoncontrol, or whether State Departments shall be created' for organization of and general administration from a commercial point of view. They must bear in mind, at the same time, our defence needs, and avoid the mistakes that have been made in the past through overcentralization.",41
150,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Maribyrnong) [5.47] I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Burchell) that, although we are living in times of considerable financial stress, the creation of postal facilities has snch a developmental effect on the wide reaches of a continent like ours, that they should be in no way curtailed. While in some cases they may not be revenue-producing to the extent of paying for the work done, there is at the same time a developmental aspect which should never be lost sight of. There are two sections of the community which suffer more than any other by the lack of postal facilities. The one comprises those who are pioneering in the way-back country, and the other those who live in the outer suburban areas of the various capitals.",42

In regard to the Blythe River iron ore deposits, I have wondered why the Commonwealth Government did not accept the verdict previously given by experts bo the Government of New South Wales. W it h in a few days of the announcement bhat the Federal Government had taken an option over those deposits, a letter was published in the press of Melbourne, and possibly, of Sydney, too, from an ex-Minister in the New South Wales Government, practically warning, the Commonwealth not to incur any expenditure in connection with these works, because the New South Wales Government had already obtained reporbs from their experts, in consequence of which no acbion had been taken.

At a time like the present when the people are staggering under financial 'burdens, expenditure of this kind might well be deferred until more prosperous times, when we are not being called upon to pay out millions of pounds annually as a consequence of the greatest war recorded in history. The expenditure on the Federal Oapi'tal site also can very well wait. Parliament is asked to sanction hurriedly, expenditure on the Institute of Science and Industry, and the Federal Capital. The former is a project that Parliament may not sanction. It is more than likely that the new Parliament will feel inclined to wipe clean the slate of many of the propositions that appear upon these Estimates - So far as the Federal Capital is concerned, we have waited until now, and we can wait longer.",42
158,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"That is Victoria's policy. Mr Fenton"" - Before I realized how heavy were the financial burdens that the people would be called upon to bear, I was inclined to believe that it would be desirable to remove this Parliament from a State capital to a Federal city, where the political atmosphere would be rarer. But the expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing by leaps and bounds. We promised our soldiers when they left Australia's shores to fight our battles, that on their return they would be well looked after. If we pay to our soldiers a gratuity, as is proposed, we shall only be following the lead of New Zealand and Canada: I make no complaint regarding that proposal, but I remind the Committee that if we do even a modicum of justice to those men, the gratuity will involve the country in an expenditure of £25,000,000. Therefore, it - becomes all the more necessary to cut down or eliminate some of the items that appear in the Estimates. The proposed expenditure on the Federal Capital can wait.",43
159,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,To what item is the honourable member referring?,43
160,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Unfortunately , items of expenditure which are closely allied and relate to the one subject are spread over various Departments, and one has to hunt through page after page of the Estimates in order to ascertain how much money is to be expended on the Federal Capital during the current financial year.",43
161,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"There is no provision on these Estimates for expenditure at Federal Capital, except a few small items.",43
162,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The items on the Estimates total nearly £15,000.",43
163,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"There is a total of £5,100.",43
164,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"There is an amount of £4,800 for incidental works and a physical testing plant. Elsewhere there is a total of £11,445 for new works,* buildings, & c , in various States and Federal'Territory . Whatever may have - been our opinions three or four years ago, they must be revised in view of the present financial position. Expenditure on the establishment of an Institute of Science and Industry, and on the erection of an expensive Federal Capital, might well be postponed.",43
165,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The honourable member will get a paragraph in tomorrow's Age.,43
166,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"i l opposed this expenditure on a previous occasion, when, during the term of office of the Labour Government, I and others kept the House sitting all night on the Works and Buildings Estimates.",43
167,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The honourable member is in favour of honouring the terms of the Constitution?,43
168,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"That is all very well; but will the Minister contend that this expenditure is justified in view of the financial burdens which the country is required to bear?. The Government prate about economy. I know what kind of economy will be practised after the elections if the Nationalists are returned to power. The unfortunate workers in side and outside the Service will be made to suffer. The Institute of Science and In dustry will result in .the duplication of work that is already being well done by some of the State Governments. The Government are not content that the State authorities shall expend thousands of pounds in employing experts to carry on research in every branch of science, but particularly in connection with primary uroduction; they propose to duplicate that expenditure and say, "" We have a few more thousands of pounds to waste. We shall t i p - it into this particular bin, and establish a new Department, provide a few men with good billets, and - commit the country to an exthe penditure that may ultimately amount to millions."" This is a cruel proposal. The Government are treating the people in a disgraceful fashion, and I feel confident the electors will resent it. We shall shortly £0 before our masters, and they will be iustified-in questioning every one bf us regarding each and every one of the items on these Estimates. No matter what State an honourable member represents, he cannot justify some of the expenditure which the Government are proposing. Honourable members mav say that this item represents only a few thousand pounds, but, in the aggregate, the various items total millions of pounds.",43
169,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Well , cut them out.",44
170,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,I am willing to do that.,44
171,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,I have no time for the Federal Capital project.,44
172,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,In several parts of the Estimates there-are items of expenditure for the Federal Capital .,44
173,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,There will be bigger items after the election.,44
174,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Not for penditure on the Federal Capital.,44
175,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Parliamen t will require to consider the financial burden which the country has to bear, and will rightly declare that the Federal Capital shall not be proceeded with. We cannot at this stage afford expensive Ministerial fads like the Institute of Science and In dustry.",44
176,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Cu t a bit off that item.,44
177,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The State Government authorities are doing very effective research work, and the taxpayers do not object to the few thousand pounds that is being expended, but. they will object to a needless duplication of suchdisbursements. Unless honourable members wake up, these items will be passed through hurriedly, and later we shall be told that - we readily consented to the expenditure, and we should not therefore complain. Last year, when the Treasurer (Mr Watt) pleaded for the speedy consideration of the Estimates, he allowed three days for the discussion of the finances of the country. We require more than that time to discuss the estimates of the Postmaster General's Department alone.",44

179,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,I do not know why the honourable member is always referring to what Victoria is getting. If he expects to pass a vast expenditure of this kind without being called to book by the electors - he has marvellous faith in the patience of the people.,44
180,Mr RIOHAED FOSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Indicate some item that should be cut out?,44
181,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"On page 314 there is an item of £4,800 for the Federal Capital Territory.",44
182,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,What would the honourable member cut out of that item?,44
183,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I should like to cut out the whole of it, but all one can do is to move for a reduction of it. Then on page 315 there are two items-Incidenta l works, £1,700; and physical testing plant, £3,100",44
184,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Is not the honourable member in favour of preserving the expenditure that has been already incurred at the Federal Capital? ex- Mr Fenton - Certainly .,44
185,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,That is all that is proposed.,44
186,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"What is the physical testing plant for? .There is, for instance, the item of the Institute of Science and Industry, establishment and equipment, £3,000, which I should like to see struck out altogether.",44
187,Mr SPENCE,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,You would strike items out without knowing what they are!,44
188,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The item is plain enough. I know that the honourable member takes a fatherly interest in the Bureau, owing to the fact that for a few months he presided over its deliberations. The Bureau has published a number of papers, but these, in a number of cases, only repeat what State experts have already said.",44
189,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,How many have you read?,44
190,Mr FENTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Quite a number. These papers are "" trotted out "" as something new, but the same men who wrote them for the Bureau penned similar articles years ago for the Victorian Journal of Agriculture.",44

201,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Melbourne Ports) [6.9] - I am surprised that there is no reference in these Estimates to the shipbuilding proposals of the Government. I understood that we were to have a comprehensive system of shipbuilding in Australia ; and the Minister in charge of ship of the Dromana, made the statement that there was to be an extension of the Williamstown yard in order to carry out the policy of the Government. I desire to keep parochial considerations . out of this discussion; but I understood the honourable gentleman to whom I have re-, ferred to say that ships are necessary to us, and that we' can produce them in Australia at a price to compare favourably with that of imported vessels. In Great Britain, America, and all other shipbuilding countries, including Japan, there has been an enormous increase in the cost of producing ships. . We cannot get back to the pre-war price of tonnage; and if we are to become a self-contained nation, shipbuilding is one of the great essentials. There - are yet some nine months of ,the present financial year to go, and if shipbuilding does not receive consideration now, it will be well into the year 1920-21 before we shall have an opportunity to consider thenext Works Estimates. That, of course, is a black outlook for Williamstown; and I had been hoping that the Government would be prepared at the present time to lay before us a comprehensive programme of shipbuilding. I am not now talking of men-o'-war, but of cargo ships; and, whether we like it or not, we have launched our policy of State shipowning, from which I do not think Parin liament would dare to depart, unless we are prepared to lose enormously on the venture. Even if the cost is somewhat high in Australia, we ought to be prepared to provide our own vessels; and I am sorry that the Minister was in charge of shipbuilding is not here, because I desire to know what possibility there is of the Government keeping faith with the people in this regard. We have men trained to do this work, and they ought to be utilized. . At the initiation of Commonwealth shipbuilding the newspapers told us that it had cost twice as much to build the Brisbane in Australia as it had cost to build one of the imported vessels of the same standard. That may be so, because at the initial stages of a huge industry like this money must be lost. No man can go into a new business without suffering in this respect; and while the loss here was great the men employed' received invaluable training which otherwise would have been impossible. The Adelaide was built at a considerably less cost than the Brisbane, and with an expedition that somewhat surprised the opponents of State shipbuilding. The Dromana is admittedly one of the finest of her class, and there is another vessel on the stocks which it is hoped - will be launched, shortly. With that vessel, however, the work would appear to be finished, because we hear no proposals for any further building in Australia. Are we to allow these men, whom we have trained at great expense, to wander away, as has been the case with other. men trained under similar conditions? The Eisher Government, it will be remembered, sent young men Home from time to time to learn engineering in special branches, but when they came back, most of them found their way to other countries, because their talents were not appreciated in Australia. . Mr ELEMIKG - That has been the case, not only in relation to shipbuilding, but in other directions, particularly in connection with the Bureau of Science and Industry.",45
202,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I am in favour of a Bureau of Science and Industry, and do not regard any money spent on that object as wasted, provided, of course, we have the right men at the head. However, if we drop shipbuilding now we shall have wasted all the money already spent.",46
203,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Shipbuildin g is dealt with on the Loan Estimates.,46
204,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I have not looked through the Loan Estimates; but my trouble is that we shall not, meet again until after the elections, with, probably, a change of Government-which , of course, would be for the better-and much time will be lost. We have been told that the rest of the Estimates are to be dropped, and we may not haye an opportunity to deal with the Loan Estimates.",46
205,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,They Will come on later in the day.,46
206,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"If the Minister will assure me that before Parliament prorogues we shall have the Loan Estimates before us, and they deal with shipbuilding, I shall be satisfied.",46
207,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"If jthe, honourable member will curtail his remarks we might reach the Loan Estimates before the dinner adjournment. The Loan Estimates are to come on immediately after the Works Estimates. . Mr MATHEWS - Then I am satisfied. I should now like to indulge in a little bit of provincialism, and I am sorry that some of those "" sharks"" or ""whales"" for getting so much for the "" M a "" State are not present. Victoria is not treated fairly, so far as the repairing, refitting, and reconditioning of vessels of the mercantile fleet associated with the Royal Australian Navy are concerned. It does not get anything like the proportion of such work ""that should be allotted to it by the Commonwealth Government.",46
208,Mr ARCHIBALD,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,What about S.outh ' Australia ?,46
209,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Sh e gets still less.,46
210,Mr RICHAKD EOSTEK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Victori a gets practically the whole of such work.,46
211,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The honourable member has evidently not inquired into the matter. During the last 'six months I have been endeavouring to induce the Government to recondition troopships at Williamstown. Such vessels as the Canberra, Indarra, aud Kyarra, had the whole of tlieir first and second class cabins taken out of them when they were being fitted for the conveyance of troops oversea. That work was done in Victoria, and the fittings were allowed to remain here, the understanding being that the vessels would be reconditioned in Victoria when they were no longer required for transport purposes. Instead of that being done, however, the fittings were ultimately put on board these vessels for replacement at Cockatoo Island. We certainly thought that Williamstown would get its share of that work, but it did not. I find no fault with the Minister  who did all that he could to secure for this State some of the work. The position, howevez, is a peculiar one. The British Government pays for the reconditioning of these vessels, and the owners of them insist that the work shall be carried out at Cockatoo Island. It cannot be denied that the work can be well done there; but I think that preparations should have been made to fit the Commonwealth dqckyard at Williamstown for undertaking some of it. Many men, who were unable to find employment at this class of work, in which they have always been engaged, have had to remove with their families from Melbourne to Sydney. The Government ought not to encourage the shifting of population from one State to another. If the situation is unavoidable, I have nothing more to say; but I think that, by a little judicious expenditure, justice could be done in this matter to all the States - ' ' The honourable member for Hindmarsh (' Mr Archibald) has said that none of this work is done in South Australia. J hold that every State capital offering facilities for repairs to shipping should receive its share of the work. Unlike some honourable members, I do not say that a fair share of the expenditure of the monwealth in this regard has not taken place in Victoria. I wrong to make such a statement.. But ' New South Wales, because of stances that should not exist, gets more thau its share.",46
212,Mr LYNCH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,That is because of the natural facilities offering at Sydney.,47
213,Mr MATHEWS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"B y the expenditure of a reasonable sum, the dockyard Williamstown could be made quite effecMinister tive for the carrying out of all work of in the very this kind. Difficulty, has arisen owing the parsimony and want of foresight played by State Governments in failing to properly equip the Williamstown yard when it was the property of the State. They frittered away money; at last brought out from Home Mr. Greenlees, a thoroughly capable man, placed him in charge of operations. new machinery was then installed, but much that was obsolete was allowed to main. Now that the dockyard has been taken over by the Commonwealth, its velopment and progress are not such might reasonably be expected, having gard to the population of Melbourne its big water frontage. I do not wish to raise a provincial but South Australia undoubtedly robbed the people of the rest of the Commonsalary, wealth when it got r id of the Northern Territory and the burdens attaching to The building of the East-West railway has also been an advantage to both Australia and Western Australia, while Island. New South Wales, in different directions, has reaped the advantage of much Eederal expenditure.",47
214,Mr LYNCH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Surely the honourable member does not object to' Australia, shouldering her responsibilities in respect Eederation to the Northern Territory? Mr MATHEWiS - Not at all; but think that the States should be fair their dealings with the Commonwealth.

Anything that can be done in the direction of improving the Victorian reyards for the purpose of enabling repairing .work to be done locally will give them a degreaber chance of earning a livelihood.

The honourable memI ber for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has in talked about the heavy financial burden upon the country - It seems to me that the some heaviest financial burden the Commonwealth bears is the cost of maintaining a Capiba! in Melbourne. The evidence of that fact is in every line of Victorian influence comabounds everywhere. I have looked through a couple of pages of the Estimates, and baken out a few figures. The proposed expenditure on defence in South Wales is nil; in Victoria it is £8,599. Under the heading of Science and Industry, £3,000 is to be spent Victoria; nothing is to be spent where. A sum of £371 is to be spent Victoria under another division.; there to be no expenditure under the same heading in any other State. £8,436 is to be spent on post-offices New South Wales, no less than £19,776 is to be spent on post-offices in Victoria, although this State has a smaller it will HECTOR Mr. population and. a much more comthe great Australian library, ' pact territory. The same story as told in the Estimates of previous have years, except that it is a little bit worse. In the Federal Capital, which is to the the heart and centre of Australia, £6,000 was voted last year,, but Victorian influence prevented more than £1,000 being spent. One thousand - pounds to keep =an agreement solemnly - entered into 'on the honour - of the 'other .States!

We do not wish to (remain the guests of - any State; we want to 'be in our own (home, where ""'around this great dem'ocratic ttiament there 'can be built up an Auswhich tralian sentiment that 'shall look, not - one part of Australia 'only, but to every - part of the continent, .an.d that shall be concerning itself about - Flinders-lame or Collins-street, - as 'the great Ai-gus is, cern. or about Carlton beer and sheep dip, - as - the Age is, but shall take a broad Australian view of - things, and say that whatever is to be done shall be done in 'before them. the interests of Australia.

They ""simply mean that the great - postal - services .which, ^outside' this little State of Victoria, are 'the very 'life-blood rof ibhe 'country, are iso 'be ourtailed. They mean that everything that is for the encouragement of industry and the extension of industry in Australia is to he stopped. They mean that we are to turn back ten or fifteen years to Estimates that were adequate for our people then, although today the call is for statesmen who can look ahead, and provide for the growth of population that must be here if we are to meet our wax obligations, and the obligations to our soldiers and their dependants. The call today is for statesmanship that will spend money in the direction in which it will earn money, and that will encourage the industries of Australia, not only Tariff taxation, but also by scientific investigation that costs money. If those business men who meet together, ,and call themselves taixpayers' associations, and so on, applied to their own businesses the principles which they want us to apply to the business of the Commonwealth, they would have to put up their shutters in six months. Their contention that we should deny the in sistent call for the extension of the industries of this country, 6hut down on postal facilties, allow our railways and tramways to rot, and, like R i p V an Winkle, dream of things in the future, and yet do nothing to bring them about, does not mean a policy of economy, but a policy of waste and reckless disregard for the best interests of the Commonwealth. I regret that the Ministry have listened to the' 'call for economy, and have cut down postal services until , in one instance in my electorate, a post office built twenty-five years ago to'serve the purposes of 2,000 people, is now called upon to serve the purposes of 12,000 people, and the accommodation is so paltry that if the building were a factory the Postmaster-General would be prosecuted for overirowding his employees, while the facilities for paying thousands of pounds over the public counters would be inadequate for a banana shop in a back lane. Y e t these people say it is economy to run the business of the country in this "" expensive"" and "" e x t r a v a g a n t "" way, and that we are doing good to the people by refusing them the facilities whioh they ought to enjoy for the conduct of their business. It is not economy. It would pay this country to spend more than a million pounds in shifting the Seat of Government to its permanent location at the Federal Territory. We are throwing away money every day by erecting buildings in Melbourne for a temporary purpose. What man running his own business would want a temporary arrangement if he could build on a certain future? Much of the money spent in Melbourne in the past ten or twenty years has been an absolute waste. It would have been better to spend it in improving our own property. What is the effect of the expenditure of this money but to send up the land values in Melbourne, and enable the people who by own this city to draw more rents from business people who conduct enterprises here, and enable those whom the Argus ' represents so well to levy a heavier toll on the industries of the State of Victoria ? All the while We are spending our money to produce this result the land that the people of Australia own in the Federal Territory lies unimproved and useless. The other day there was an .article in one of the newspapers deploring the fact, that it was proposed to shift so many thousand civil servants to Canberra. I think it was mentioned that 2,000 homes were to be built there. Is .there anything Australia wants today more than the building of homes ? Is there any one who will say that it is better to build more homes in the congested cities than to go out and do so in free air and a good climate? If the choice is between building homes in cities and building them in the country we should always choose to decentralize rather than continue the policy of centralizing the people of Australia. It is no economy for us, writh property at Canberra, to continue to improve other people's property and neglect our own. If we threw the thing open, and formed a company to take over Canberra, build the Commonwealth buildings, and take the land values for the next fifty years, any business man would entertain the proposition. The real reason we aTe kept here is that the whole of the people of Australia are feeding this city of Melbourne. Take the proportions in which the taxes collected are spent in the various States. The money is a toll that this city is enabled to impose upon the rest of Australia, and, u n t i l the other States realise that fact, and realise that we are building up an artificial city here at the expense of the rest of Australia, and at the expense of the taxpayeis of Australia, we shall get ho further. In the State of New South Wales, at any rate, the people are waking up, and making some effort to secure the keeping of the agreement. Whan it was before our State Parliament, nearly twenty years ago, Sir George Reid was asked what guarantee he had that the compact would be kept. He said the people of New South Wales could rely upon the honour of the statesmen of the other States. The honour of the statesmen of the other States has, so far, proved a very unreliable foundation for their faith, and the honour of past Federal Parliaments has not been much higher, when they have allowed this thing to go on from year to year. without any real effort to keep the bargain made with New South Wales at that time. Apart altogether from that, if the matter were new today, I should still say the Capital ought to be constructed in the interests, of the growing national timent of this continent. We shall never be the nation that the Constitution designed us to be until we have some common centre that belongs to Australia and not to a State. For that reason, I urge that this work be undertaken. What better work could be found for the soldiers who fought for Australia, and made their name reverenced throughout the civilized world, than the building of their own Capital for their own people? It would give to the people, to whom they have brought a broader nationality than they ever had before, a city which would be their city, associated with their great work on the other side of the world, and which would be to coming generations of the Australian people a shrine, to be held in the same sentimental regard that, the British people have for the city of London, the American people for the great city of Washington, and the people of every country for the city which represents to them the centre of their government. Surely, if the Governments of old-world countries oan erect these cities for their people, we, who enjoy the freest and most democratic form of government in the world, should have a city worthy of our people, and of the institutions that we hope to establish there. Mr J. H. CATTS (Cook) [8.5] - It is quite evident that we are within six weeks of an election. The honourable membeT for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) has been expatiating upon the deficiencies of his own Government, 'which he sits there and supports, and for whose actions, he is absolutely responsible. All this talk of his is very cheap. He knows that he can stand up and move a motion on these Estimates to give some effective registration to his protest; but, while he indulges in so much beating of the air, he takes no effective action.",48
222,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I could only help Ryan, Wren, and revolution by that.",50
223,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The honourable member's wild statement shows how annoyed he is at being exposed. I have heard this stuff about the Federal Capital before. There is 110 business in it. There is no earnestness in this Government about the Federal Capital. They do not mean to go on with it.,50
224,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,That shows that there senis one little bit of sense about them.,50
225,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Her e are two Government supporters, sitting side by side, one yelling out that his Government ought to go on with the Capital, and condemning them for not doing so, while the other says that the Government show their good sense in not going on with it . The Government are trying to balance between these two widely differing view6 on the part of their ""own supporters. We were told a little while back that a. majority of members have signed a requisition calling upon the Government to go on with the Capital. If there is a majority of members in the House desirous that the Capital shall be gone on with, that majority can have their will carried out, because if a majority of members put the gun up to this Government, the Government would back as fast as ever they could, and give way to them. Those honourable members who talk so much about it know perfectly well that if they once showed their Government that they were in earnest, the Government would mighty quickly go on with the Capital rather than risk their offices. I have seen this kind of thing going on before. Another honourable member, who i6 not here, has time after time called, us together to meet him. He takes the chair at the meetings, where they talk about the Capital, and form a deputation to the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr . Glynn). When I pick up the news-' papers published throughout his electorate, I find that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) occupied the chair at a largely attended meeting of members of both Houses of the Federal Parliament; that they had at a l k ; that so-and-so was going to be done; that they had promises from the Minister; and thab all parties were helping the honourable member. Later on, there is a report in the papers throughout his electorate to the effect thab he introduced a large and influential deputation to the Minisber; bhat he said some nice things to the Minister; and the Minister said some nice things back to him. Eeporta of this kind are jcircul!a.bed .broadoast, but they contain not one word about any of those who are associated with the honourable member. It is all merely an electioneering dodge for the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. The names, of none of the other members associated with him , not even of the senators from New South Wales, are mentioned in these reports', which are printed in the newspapers throughout his electorate, to which he sends them. It is just about time the electors surrounding districts "" took a tumble "" the kind of hypocrisy that is going on. As soon as ever the election looms i sight these gentlemen' get on their hind legs and shout themselves hoarse about the Eederal Capital being gone on with but we hear nothing about it from them for the rest of the time. Those very know that they are a party to what is the table. going on. They - themselves are responsecret sible for the Capital not being proceeded with . They keep the Government office. If a motion is moved to prove of the action of the Government public ? they will not vote for it . What, then, is the good of all this empty talk on their part about the Government not doing tain things? I asked some questions here today about the Federal Capital. Commission was appointed to make an vestigation. Mr Will f r ed Blacket, Royal Commissioner, presented six ports, and in one of them he said tinctly that the man in charge of the construction of the Federal Capital been for two years prevented from ing out the duties of his ""office. He had been paid £1,000 a year for two years, and had not been allowed to carry on the work of his office because of the obstacles put in his way by departmental officers.  Government was in power. Mr J . . H . CATTS - It was for a very short time, while the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) was M in ister. When the party found out what was happening, they quickly made a change in their Ministers. The honourable member knows that perfectly well.",50
226,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,What did Mr. K in g O'Malley do when he got there?,51
227,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"He could do very little, as the inquiry was proceeding. The Royal Commission took some time, and when the reports were presented there was a change of Government. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . Watt),' who was one of the representatives of the metropolis of Melbourne, had charge of the business, and what did he do? Secretly he appointed accountants to present something to him - G o d ' knows what it was-behin d the back of the Royal Commissioner who had held his investigation in public, and practically put the Royal Commissioner's reports in of the the waste-paper basket. When I asked to today that the reports of these accountants should be laid on the table for in n vestigation by honourable members, I was told that it was not considered to be in the public interest that they should be , given publicity. There is evidently something very shady about it ; otherwise we men should have had those reports put upon What is there about that investigation by the accountants behind the back of the Royal Commission in in connection with the Federal Capital disapthat ought to be withheld from the One statement made by the honourable cermember for Illawarra was perfectly true-that there is a huge vested in terest preventing the Capital from beA Royal ing built. Before the outbreak of the in - war £250,000 per year was being paid the in Melbourne in salaries and wages reto departmental officers who are asso-disciated with this Parliament and the central staffs. Since then I think that had amount has been almost doubled. It carrywould not be too much to say that £500,000 a year is paid now in Melbourne in salaries and wages tohuge departmental staffs, because this is practioally the Seat of the Commonwealth Government.. I believe that, approximately, about £1,000„000 a week has been spent in Australia in the shape of war expenditure. The great bulk of that expenditure goes through the central offices in Melbourne, and Victoria gets - an undue share of it i",51
228,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Hav e you any figures to show that?',52
229,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I can give the honourable member a couple of instances ta show the length' to which it goes. WhenFord motor cars were wanted for the Eederal Capital, although there is a big central agency for those cars in Sydney, practically close at hand, from which they could have been driven to the Capital in two or three hours, the. Department bought Eord cars in Melbourne, carried them on the railway to Albury, transhipped them at Albury, and had them carried to Goulburn, and from Goulburn to Queanbeyan, where they ran them off. . When they wanted some common kitchen gt6ves for a number of houses they were building at the Eederal Capital, they did the same thing. They bought them in Melbourne, and carted them all the way round through Albury to Queanbeyan. I have no doubt that if the total were reckoned up, there would be found to be a huge war expenditure in addition to the civil expenditure in Victoria, because of the Eederal Departments being centralized here. The Commonwealth civil servants in Melbourne are a great obstacle to the building of the Eederal Capital. Heads of Departments are settled in the suburbs. The social interests of themselves and families are centred here. Their grown up girls and boys are being trained in various professions, and there is a regular discussion at thefiresidewhenever the issue of the Eederal Capital is raised in this Parliament. The families say, ""Eor God's sake don't let,us be shifted into the bush in New South Wales. Whatever shall we do if we are shifted out of. Melbourne? Our friendships and social interests are here. The future of our sous and daughters will be sacrificed if we are shifted to that beastly place, Canberra, which is so much decried by the Melbourne press."" When the whole of the ""heads of Departments are combining to prevent the will of Parliament being carried out,., a very powerful, influence is exerted. Few Ministers can stand up against even one departmental head. The statement made in this House some time ago about Ministers being merely "" rubber stamps "" is true in the majority of cases. A file of papers is dumped before a Minister, and he signs so many to the minute, without knowing half the time what he is signing; he is in the hand's of the head of his Department. We know the influence one head of a Department exerts over a Minister, and when they all combine for the one purpose, there is practically an insurmountable obstacle to the carrying out of the Federal Capital scheme. The Federal Capital area was practically the hinterland to Queanbeyan. The locking up of this huge area, and the prevention of its development, is a gross injustice to Queanbeyan, which is being practically ruined. It is true that lands in the Federal Territory are being let on short leases, but everybody knows that there can be no real development under present conditions.",52
230,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,More money was spent at Canberra in a month since the Federal Capital was started than was spent in fifty years before.,52
231,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Whil e the work was in progress, the local towns were better off than they had been before, but latterly the whole of the work has been at a stand-still. All sorts of excuses have been advanced, as, for instance, that the capital could not be built during the war.",52
232,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,That was a pretty good one.,52
233,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"It was absolutely nonsensical, as the orgy of extravagance of this Govermnent proves. The work has been delayed from time to time on various pretexts. I doubt if the Federal Capital will be. built in our day and generation.",52
234,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Hear , hear!",52
235,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Alread y it has been postponed close on twenty years, and Heaven only knows when it will be built. It is only fair to say to the people that nothing has been done in regard to the Federal Capital except what was done by a Labour Government. , Let that be thoroughly understood. This question was the shuttlecock of party politics u n t i l the Labour party came into power; and soon after the Fisher Government assumed office in 1909, the Capital site was definitely settled. Then the Labour party went out of office, and practically nothing was done u n t i l its return to power in 1910. From that year u n t i l 1913, there was a policy of rapid development; the work was proceeded with in earnest.",52
236,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The honourable member means that a lot of money was spent there.  spent on the cursed .western railway. That is an incubus we shall be carrying all our lives in order to please ""Western Australia.",53
237,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I joined with Western Australian members in seeing that the Federal compact was honoured so far as Western Australia was concerned. When the Labour Government were in power from 1910 to 1913 the work of building the Federal Capital was proceeded with in earnest. . The foundations were started, and some works were completed. Then the war broke out, two or three rapid changes of Government followed, the whole country was turned topsy-turvey over the conscription issue, and since that time practically nothing has been done. One can see at Canberra plant exposed to the weather and deteriorating. Not enough' expenditure is being incurred to keep in decent order and repair the works already completed. The Federal Capital will not be proceeded with until there is another Labour Government in power, for the reason that the Labour party is the only party that can defy the vested and moneyed interests. Victorian interests look to see what is in the Age and Argus leading articles every morning, and they are backing and filling to please those papers all the time, lest they should oppose them at the next elections. I have never seen in any other part of the Commonwealth the same backing and filling as is shown by Victorian members in their fear of the daily newspapers. The honourable member for Illawarra who has had so much to say about this question, is in a position to move a motion which will compel the Government to proceed with the Federal Capital. Let him do it . The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch), no doubt, will support him.",53
238,Mr LYNCH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,I shall have something to say on it .,53
239,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,But will the honourable member do something?,53
240,Mr LYNCH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,More than the honourable member will.,53
241,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"We on this side of the House, numbering only twenty-two in a total of seventv-five, can do nothing but talk. Honourable members opposite, who are responsible for keeping the Government in office, can do something, and they will receive good support from this side of the House if they show that they are really in earnest. The honourable member for Illawarra complains of the unsatisfactory postal facilities in his electorate. What is the good of Illawarra being represented by a Nationalist if the Nationalist Government deprive the electorate of facilities granted by a previous Government? The inference is that the electors ought not to support the Nationalists, but ought to return another Government, who will give them something like the fair deal they had before the present party came into power. The honourable member for Tllawarra helps to keep the Government in office, and he cannot blame them without blaming himself. He is responsible for what they do. What is the use of criticising the Government and appearing to the electors outside to agree with them, when, as a matter of fact, by.every vote he records in this House he hones to keep the Ministry in office? I do not think that the honourable member has recorded one solitary vote against the Government since he has been in the House.",53
242,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The honourable member is too busy attending to other affairs to know how I vote.,53
243,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The honourable member has not given a vote against the Government on any question.,53
244,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Why did the Labour party appoint the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Webster) Postmaster-General ?,53
245,Mr JH CATTS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"He was all righ t as Postmaster-General until he came under the influence of the Government of which he is now a member. The present Government will not allow him to do anything. They will not give him the necessary funds to carry on the functions of his Department. But the honourable member for Illawarra keeps the Postmaster-General in office, and is partly responsible for his administration. He cannot blame the Postmaster-General when on every test division he votes to keep him in office. It does not lie in the mouth of the honourable member tocriticise Ministers. His complaint about lack of postal facilities will not convince the electors of Illawarra in his . favour when they know that every time he has a chance of acting he refuses to do anything. He has an effective way of registering his protest, and that is by ing and not merely talking. When the honourable member is prepared to do something in earnest he will receive the support of honourable members on ""this side jn petting for the electors of Jllawarra that justice which is denied them by the present Government.*",53
246,Mr LYNCH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Werriwa) [8.2S] - I shall not attempt to follow the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) through all the phases of his characteristically unfair speech. I feel sorry for honourable members on this side when I realise from the utterances of the honourable gentleman that they cannot attain to the lofty standard of virtue from which he alone regards things. But I think that there are some circumstances which might be mentioned in justification of the inanition of which be says we have been guilty. He forgets that the present Government were returned to nower for a purpose far greater than the building of the Federal .Capital. The Government were put in office in order to prevent a disruption which"" the honourable member for Cook would have very much liked to foment and which would have relieved us of any necessity to build the Eederal Capital or do anything except leave tracks as we fled with our heels to the enemy. The honourable member should recollect that the Government and the party supporting them, whabever bheir shortcomings may be, having thab greab duby bo perform, had to subordinate all questions of domestic importance, especially one like the Federal Capibal, regarding which there is such a diversity of opinion. The honourable member made much of the fact bhat the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) had raised through a fellow member a discordant' voice on this side of the House. He ignored. the fact that a few moments before, at his own elbow, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenbon) proclaimed the project for the building of the Federal Capital as an absurdity. I at least attempt to be fair and just, and I am quibe conbenb to bake, my share of whatever blame may attach to this party in respect to the Federal Capital. I have an interest in the project apart from the national one, which I hope I shall pub firsb on all occasions, because my electorate partly surrounds the Federal Territory. Apart from that interest I feel that the national act- aspect of the question is one that can no longer be ignored. Every Sbate of the Union is inberested in seeing bhat the compact so solemnly made in the Constitution shall be honoured. I do not believe that amongst the majority of the representatives in the Commonwealth Parliament there is other than a feeling that the greatest danger of all is over, and that although we may have been lefb financially crippled, and unable to dream of marble palaces and £1,000,000 lakes, they still intend to carry out the Federal contract., We who have been, as the honourable member for Cook chose bo pub ib, quiescent during the war, may now, wibh good reason, claim with in sistent voice that the promise shall be redeemed. If it can be shown that by proceeding wibh the Capibal we shall add boo heavily to the burdens of the countrybhab we should thereby be unable to meet our obligations to the returned soldiers or our financial and other obligationswe would,.of course, still have to hold our hands. But, as has been said already, we can now in the Federal Territory make use of much labour for which we must find employment. We can assist returned soldiers in little businesses without prejudically affecting the interest of other people already in business; and we have an opportunity of settling even partially-disabled men on very liberal conditions, of giving them a monopoly of the new market that would be created at the Seat of Government, and of enhancing by millions the value of hundreds of thousands of acres now largely idle. It is a splendid opporbuniby, and ib is only one of obhers that we shall have bo grasp wibh both hands if we are to fulfil our obligations, to not only provide for our soldiers, but open up fresh avenues of employment and development in the country. I believe, too, that we shall have to "" formulate and give effect to a growing progressive policy in order to develop and settle the Northern Territory as part of this great work of development. For the past eighteen months or more I have had on the business-paper a motion, which I cannot discuss now, but by means of which I hope to show how that great work may be begun. V e are losing a great opportunity when we lose the services of scores of thousands of those labour-loving and valorous young men who went forth to fight, and were fortunate enough to come back uninjured, and who might spend a probationary period in learning cattleraising, and, with assistance, return to the Government fifty-fold the wealth expended on them - We could thus solve the problems of the Northern Territory, however tough those problems may be. It is certainly not a high credential to the intelligence of the House to find us like senseless children, throwing taunts at one another-taunt s from Victoria to South Australia, and from New South Wales to Victoria. We are all one family, and if one goes down, we all go down. The object of men who, at least, ought to attempt To develop statesmanlike instincts, should be the common good of their common country. As the Treasurer (Mr Watt) will admit, if we can only show how progress can be made by the expenditure of millions as a preliminary, there is a very short way to travel in view of our opportunities. But I have the greatest confidence and faith in what I call the principles of self help. I 'believe it is possible to utilize the labour, not only of the turned soldiers, but also of others, with out the expenditure of much capital, in a w<iy that will create arid develop would find one there pretty quickly. fresh wealth to assist in the still greater work beyond. It is idle to say that the Government that, and I regret to see the spirit. must be condemned because they cannot meet the requirements of every growing district throughout the continent. As representative of Werriwa, I require post-offices in my constituency, and find fault with the Government on that score. Some of the post-offices there, present, are only fit-for nests for but I have ' to realise that the men charged with the administration of finances are at the present moment the father of a big family who finds cupboard almost empty, and every one his people clamouring for a meal from "" Gunslers."" But I feel it a reflection on that spirit of independence which is the characteristic of our race, and found such splendid, and noble expression in. the valour and daring of our troops, to say f h at the young men, and young women, too, of our time are not game to face the battle of life unless they are armed with all the advantages and refinements of civilization. I remember in my early youth people who had come from the Old Country, and must have been absolute strangers to the conditions here, going hundreds of miles into the in terior, and there subjecting themselves to hardships and trials in their work of knocking the bush into shape-wringin g from nature's arms a sustenance. But nowadays, unless a fellow is within cooee of a picture-show, and can wear a pair of patent-leather boots, he does not con-, sider he is a civilized being. That spirit of adventure and independence, of which we had so much in the past, must be fostered. It is not that the men of the present day have not strength, courage, and spirit, but there is too much of the molly-coddle idea. I recollect the time when, if a man got hold of a paper two or three months old, he considered he was lucky and right up to date- a time when, we would be happy but for the devil's agencies in. the shape of roadside shanties, causing men to get talking to themselves.",54
247,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Havin g a word or two with sensible men.,55
248,Mr LYNCH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"E x a c t l y ; that is a good reidea; and I often think that if some of - the people whom we hear talking of proand fiteers would look into a glass they I feel there is too much of this insistent claim on the Government to do this and I remember the day when diggers went for t h to develop new country and pioneer the settlement. M a n y died and perished by the roadside, but their independence was could so strong that if you wished to offend them you had only to offer assistance at while they had a kick in them. What crows; sort of spirit are we now developing? Men in the flush of youth will come to a the member of Parliament and ask if the like Government cannot do something for his him in the way of a soft job-the y have of a cobbler's constitution and cannot stand hard work! Of course, we all want something pretty light ; but, as one who had - a rough experience in my youth, I - say that to a man there is nothing like the pleasure of achieving a task that seemed insurmountable. It is not the value of the reward that gives the pleasure, but the fact that a man has tried and conquered; and, even if he fails, he has the satisfaction of having tried. ""We on this side are now called "" shirkers "" by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts) because we have not taken some heroic rand direct action against the Government. Surely the honourable member might give us credit for a little common sense, seeing that on this side we have the intelligence which he so slavishly followed for years, and found nothing wrong with u n t i l the parting came. The honourable member charges us with insincerity, but surely he knows that there - are considerations to which we must pay some regard. No man with any sense would k ill an elephant simply in order to destroy a flea that happened to be fattening on it . "" Elephants "" in the shape of bigger in terests than the .Federal Capital must be kept alive and well. Of course, I know that my constituents look to me to see that the Federal compact is not forgotten; but I tell them that if , in my opinion as an independent representative, I feel that to proceed with that work would endanger greater interests essential to the welfare of the country, I shall unhesitatingly turn it down. But the probationary period of "" wait"" through which we have tp pass is fast disappearing, and the interests of the Government and the country-the too, of the people who are seeking employment-depend on our keeping Federal compact. It does not necessarily follow that we must fulfil the contract in an expensive way. The majority of us have lived in very humble I lived in the ""Sky Hotel"" for years, and thinlc that I bear my fifty-seven rather better in consequence-but accessories of ordinary and reasonable civilized life can be provided for a few hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the advantages that will follow to the country will more than counterbalance the little disadvantages which may seem apparent now. Mr Lynch. I should like to bring before the Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) works that are required in Werriwa. We have to remember, however, that the honourable gentleman can only do what the funds at his disposal will enable him to do.",55
249,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE, The Post and Telegraph Department is not before the Committee.,56
250,Mr LYNCH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I shall merely say that we can all suggest numerous new works and buildings that would doubtless be of great service, but the man charged with the duty of providing, funds and the responsibility of spending them, must be allowed to say in what order those works are to be entered on. The agitation in connection with the Federal Capital is no ephemeral movement, but one that has been stemmed and dammed up for years in consequence of the war. It is a movement that will gradually become insistent, and I am sure that the claims made will not fal l on unheeding ears. The Government, even as at present constituted, with a diversity of opinion on the question amongst their supporters, will , on the whole, I think, give effect to the promises made in the past, and vindicate the Constitution.",56

I blame the representatives of New South Wales for not standing solidly together to prolodgings- tect the interests of that State. New South Wales has not been properly years treated. The honourable member for Mariall the byrnong (Mr Fenton), who is always anxious to have money spent on the Cordite Factory and the roads leading to it , is not prepared to support the building of the Capital. This is not a party matter. It is our duty to see that the compact made with New South Wales is carried out. There might have been some excuse for th© failure of the Government to prowhen ceed with the building of the Capital during the war, but now that the war over they should state what they intend to do. Many returned soldiers of employment; last week I saw 4,000 of them registering for work, and I blame the Government for not coming forward with a public works policy. _ It would be to be erecbed. far better tp spend money on reproductive works than to make sustenance ments to our men.

262,Mr ARCHIBALD,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Hindmarsh) [3.55]. - A good deal has been said this evening ns to the failure of the Government to proceed with public works at Canberra. It is amusing to watch the cornedy that is being played by the representatives of Victoria and New South Wales. Representatives of Victoria naturally desire that the Federal Parliament shall continue to meet in this wonderful city, where it is under the influence of the daily newspapers; but I think that a few observations by a representative of another State, which is not deeply interested in this "" pull baker, pull devil"" struggle between Victoria and New South Wales, may not be out of place. I agree that the promise made to the people of New South Wales when the Constitution Bill was before the electors should be redeemed. But it is a huge joke for any member of Parliament to complain of the failure of the Government to proceed with the building of the Federal Capital while we were engaged in a war unparalleled in the history of the world. The common sense of the people will lead them to commend, rather than to blame, the Government for the stoppage of works at the Federal Capital during the great struggle. Having regard to the war liabilities that confront us, the time has arrived when the Government should provide the House with an estimate of the expenditure that-would be necessary to accommodate the Federal Parliament alt Canberra. I dm not th ink it is necessary to erect the wonderful legislative halls designed by the distinguished American who discovered where the sun shone. It should be sufficient to erect suitable temporary buildings. There is a great deal in what the honourable member for Illawarra (Mr Lamond) has said as to the influence of Melbourne, Sydney, or any other State capital having an undesirable effect upon Federal work and sentiment, and I believe that as soon as we go to the Federal Capital our legislative work will improve. At the same time, I do not think we should plunge headlong into an expenditure of millions of pounds without knowing what the ultimate cost of establishing the Capital will be. v I would be no party to such a move. The Government, however, should be able to estimate within £5,000 or £10,000 the cost of housing the Federal Parliament at Canberra. Surely the present generation is not to bear the cost of erecting there buildings to last for all time. Australia belongs not to us alone, but to the unborn generations to comej and we should deal with questions of this character from that stand-point. We have only a life interest in the Commonwealth. If the Government came forward with an estimate of the cost of building the Federal Capital, we should "" be able to say at once - whether we could afford to spend £100,000 or more, and could proceed with the work in.a systematic fashion. The work at Canberra has been standing still for years. I regret it , because we have there the most valuable electrical plant in Australia. However, the loss on the Federal Territory cannot be very much. By this time, we must have acquired the whole of the area by buying out the improvements of the residents. Therefore the revenue derived from the agricultural land ought to be sufficient to meet the current expenditure. We have been told by the honourable .member for Cook (Mr Catts), with his usual characteristic love of the truth, which he knows nothing about, and about which he is not desirous of knowing anything, that I was removed from my office as Minister for Home Affairs in consequence of the mess I had made at Canberra, and that a Royal Commission had condemned me. Leaving for the moment the matter of my removal from office, let me deal with the other aspect of the question. 1 There was an agreement which was a very unsatisfactory one between the ' Commonwealth Government and Mr Griffin. It was of a very debatable character, one which the lawyers would like to handle. Mr Griffin claimed the right to have a Department under him, and to do the whole of the work in connection with the building of the Federal Capital. He also claimed the right to have the officers engaged in the work responsible to him alone. On the other hand, the Fisher Government declined to have two Departments dealing with the public works of the Commonknow wealth. I agreed with that decision, and, in consequence, the Cabinet decided that the work to be done at Canberra should be carried out through the officers of the Works Branch of the Department of Home Affairs, which had anample staff for the purpose. However, the ister who succeeded me reversed that cision, and gave Mr Griffin the power be absolute master of the work at the .Federal Capital, and full jurisdiction do what he liked there. Of course, the Government that succeeded the Governfive ment of which that Minister was a memtors ber very speedily put that policy to rightabout. As for my being removed from office because the work at Canberra was going on well enough, or because the work on the East-West railway was not proceeding properly, the truth is that came about because I would not allow the Trades Halls to dictate to me as how I should do my duty. The honorwas able member for Darwin (Mr Spence) and I were both driven out of office cause we chose to keep our oaths. It is ber? not uncommon - for members in Lahour Governments to break their oaths; but did not do it . As Mr Lloyd George says-the Government must be on top. The sooner a Minister of the Crown who is not on top is out of office the better do. it is for the country. I was removed from office by the most corrupt Caucus that ever existed in Australia. The honourable member for Cook says that my administration was subject to inquiry. I came into this House > in 1910, and found the honourable member here engaged then as he has been ever since in intriguing against his own leagues to get into office. He has not succeeded, and is not likely to do so for character. a time at least. Some of his tribe have got into office, and I was removed because I was an obstacle in the way. inquiry conducted by Mr Blacket was too big a job for that gentleman to undersaid. take. He should not have gone on w i it , or should have applied to the Governmuch ment for the assistance of assessors. any case, it was a lame step for a vernment to take to appoint a Royal so forth . Commission to inquire into the administration of one of its own Departments. men. According to Mr Blacket, I was pushing on the departmental plan for Canberra, and not Mr Griffin's. I happen what was in my mind, and I say solemnly on my honour that I never once. had in my mind the departmental plan. Mr Blacket may come to any conclusion he likes for all I care- I have nothing but scorn and contempt for his verdict-bu t when he imagines that he M in - knows what I had in mind better dethan I do myself, I respectfully inform to him that I am the best judge upon such a matter. Those who have known me in to this House for the past nine years, and those who have known me for the twentyyears in which I have served my eleci n the State and Federal Parliaments, the know that my word is worthy of acceptance, not only here, but also in the State of South Australia - I shall not go further not into the matter. The Government of the day very wisely closed the incident, but a more infamous, costly, and terrible it waste of public money never existed than during the administration of that Caucus to which turned me from office, and which responsible for it. to the bitter end.",58

Some men know the inside running of it better than I On seven or eight occasions the union controlling the building of the East-West railway dictated that bosses should be removed, and they were removed.

I was astonished to hear so "" pull devil pull baker "" criticism In of one another, and so much talk of cerGotain gentlemen not being statesmen, and",59
266,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,We are all states,59
267,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I believe the honourable gentleman and I , who went to the war, to are statesmen. Did we not make history ? As to the honouring of promises, 1 had nothing to do with the selection of the site of the Eederal Capital, or with decision as to what should be done there, but I believe that the people of New South ""Wales have a very good case for the honouring of the promise made to them. There is also a promise to South Australia that should be honoured.",59
268,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Anothe r little railor way will not do us any harm.,60
269,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The right honourable gentleman is quite right, and I 'hope that he will be able to convince (Mr ""Watt) of the advisability of allowing an adequate sum to be placed on the Estimates to take a railway into the Northern Territory so as to minimize the loss the Commonwealth is incurring there each year.",60
270,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The best way to convince me is to put these Estimates through. That is what I am waiting for.,60
271,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"There is nothing in the Estimates to satisfy me that the Government are sincere in the matter of honone ouring the promise made to South Austo the ' shivoo' this afternoon 1"" tralia. It is time that Australia set about finalizing the idea of the Federal Capital. If we could raise £300,000,000 to fight the war, we can raise something to velop this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has sounded a tocsin. He says that Australia, to get out of the turthe Empire. moil into which it has been brought by the war, must ""produce, produce, prois duce."" Looking through the Estimates, how much do we see that ""produce, produce, produce""? I thought that the Prime Minister would have something in them over and above the shipping programme that would have approximated to the ideals held when he first came into this Parliaitself ment as a Labour member. The men who left the Labour party- I will not say "" ratted "" on it , because to do so would be offensive-declai m that they are still La'bour men, and that they have merely added patriotism to their platform. I they are still Labour men they must still hold to the tenets they accepted prior the split which drove them into the arms before. of the Nationalists-the National Political League, or the Women's National League-and finally into the Farmers and Producers Associations; and naturally time one would expect these Estimates to reveal some of the characteristics of those tenets. If the Prime Minister is still a Labour the man, and desires Australia to produce, as he says it must do in order to meet its liabilities, he could not do better than honour the promise to South Australia, and build a railway that would open up the Northern Territory for tropical cultivation, for which it is eminently fitted, develop the woollen-cloth industry, instead of sending our.wool overseas to be woven into cloth elsewhere - Let him develop some of the potentialities of Australia. We have heard a lot of the word the Treasurer "" potentialities """,60
272,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,I apologize for having used the word.,60
273,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Of course, I will have the support of the right honourable gentleman who went with me to the war. I did not see him there. He may have been in that "" hop over "" that I saw the Prime Minister's party take.one morning between Corbie and Bray. On that occasion I was on one side of a canal and our infantry were on the other side. Some said to me, ' ' Are you not going over I said, ""What's on?"" He said, "" The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy are over there.""- I said it was too far for me to walk over the bridge, debut I heard "" God Save "" played by the - band, and some cheers, and I knew my honourable friend was doing his bit for The feeling of the people of Australia that we have seen too much of the practice of sending overseas to foreign counwill tries the goods that we raise here, and then buying them back with the cost of freight and the price of manufacture added. The Customs revenue as between he Japan and America is plain enough in to show that Australia needs to do something to protect itself. If we want a strong, virile community, let us find enough opportunity for work and production for our people in Australia. Let us create opportunities not only for the natuf ral increase of our population, but to bring here immigrants without having to to. resort to the methods we had to use I will support the New South Wales members in the matter of the development of the Federal Capital site. It is quite we.did this work. It is a big project; a project that we ought to be proud of; but apparently some one now would like it to be kicked out like a stray dog.",60
274,Mr BRENNAN,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,It is so good .that we ought to keep it as a project.,61
275,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I can understand Victorian members taking up that attitude. Evidently the Victorian members of the Works Committee were of that opinion when they recommended the erection of a building in Melbourne for the noteprinting offices. The note-printing work has come to stay. It is essentially a ral work, and requires a Federal building.",61
276,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"There was only one New South Wales member on the Committee, and he was not there to vote. ' Mr YATES - The New South Wales members were caught napping when the question was referred to the Committee. If they had been alive to the interests of their State they would have been on deck when it was proposed to hand the question over to the Committee, and it would not have gone there.",61
277,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"They were all in the House, and there was not even a division on the question.",61
278,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"When it came to a division, the fighting force was away sick. Anything can be carried under those' conditions. As a man who is interested in the question of the note-printing establishment only from the point of view of what is best for Australia, and not because my own State is interested, I say it will be a crying shame if a permanent building of that character is established iuvMelbourne and not at Canberra; that is, if we really intend to go on with the Federal Capital. I am prepared at all times to assist in honouring the compact embodied in that part of the Constitution which enacts that the Federal Capital shall be in New South Wales. Another promise which, although not a constitutional one, should be honoxired just as fully as.the Federal Capital compact, is the building of the railway line to the Northern Territory. I remarked jocularly today that if the Commonwealth was not honest in its intentions regarding the. Territory, it should be handed back to South Australia, and South Australia would develop it. have sufficient faith in the power and ability of my own State to think that if we had had it as long as the Commonwealth Government has had it, it wpuld not have been in its present parlous condition.",61
279,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,You had it much .longer.,61
280,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"But we were much younger thenThe Commonwealth should give us credit for putting the transcontinental telegraph line across that enormous tract of territory, and for doing a great deal to develop the Territory. I believe that if it had been left in the hands of our State, Fede- which kept its development within the realm of practical politics right up to the time it was handed over to the Commonwealth, we could have done a great deal more with it than the Commonwealth has done. An offer was made to Mr Tom Price to build the railway on the land grant system. A similar offer has now been made to the Commonwealth by Messrs. Timms and Kidman.",61
281,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Are you in favour of that?,61
282,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"No , I am not in favour of-the land grant system; but I believe that if the Government were honestly prepared to bring the matter into the region of practical politics, and to deal with those who are ready to carry out that great work, a modus operandi would soon be found, and the railway would be built. The question of money does not come into it. That question is fast going out of the sphere of consideration in connection with State or Commonwealth public works. In a number of works carried out in 'South Australia, the firms concerned have been prepared to take Government bonds in payment. I understand that Messrs. Timms and Kidman were ready to take 'Government bonds. If the Government are sincere in their desire to honour the promise made to South Australia regarding the completion of the North-South railway, there are ample opportunities for them to act.",61
283,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Why does the honourable member keep quoting a case that he does not believe in ?,61
284,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The Treasurer (Mr. Watt) shook his head when I suggested that Messrs. Timms and Kidman's offer was ou the land-grant system, so I took it I that it was not. Still, there are plenty of other ways in which the work could be undertaken and completed. I read carefully the reports of the Royal Commission on the Northern Territory, and found ample evidence there to show that, although the Territory may not turn out to be an Eldorado, its resources would have justified us in keeping it. If the Government wanfto reduce the cost of the Territory, and to make it safe from a defence stand-point, they must honour the promise made to South Australia, and construct the railway. ""Will the Minister for Works and Railways* (Mr Groom) tell us what has become of the enormous amount of working material used on the East-West line 1 We were given to understand that it would be used in constructing the railway to the Northern' Territory. If that was not promised in definite language, it was at least suggested. Is that material going to waste? Is it left out in the desert to deteriorate? - Sir JosEr-ir COOK - I saw a lot of it at Cook Station the other day when I came through.",61
285,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I hoped-to see a lot of it at Kingoonya, which was ""suggested as the best place to start the line northerly to Hergott and Oodnadatta, and. thence through the Macdonnell Ranges. Tbis is a matter of vital'interest to South Australia, which carried the burden of the Territory for many years. ' The late Mr. John Darling always considered that we made a mistake in disposing of it. There is nothing on these - Estimates for' that work. All I can find is an item of £192. We are getting a deuce of a lot out of Federation, are we not? It is the duty of this Parliament, and of those who believe in the development of Australia, to act up to their professions in this matter. If we want to shut the gate in the Northern Territory, the only way to do it is by constructing a railway by the most direct route. The only way to stop the "" Bolsheviks"" is to let them come down more frequently and see what civilized people are like. The Government should let them get into touch with them, and then possibly they would not kick the Government's officers out and determine to govern the Territory themselves - By the way they have treated the Northern Territory, the - Government have sown the wind, and now they are reaping the whirlwind, which is their just reward. Some time ago I put on the notice paper a question as to the number of Federal . offices scattered about Adelaide. They are all over the shop in that city, and if you want to see them all you have to travel over half Adelaide. I said at the time that our people would be prepared to consider the question of the Commonwealth buying the best site in Adelaide-ou r State Parliament Building-to house the whole of the Federal Departments, plus the CommonwealthBank. I commend the suggestion to Ministers, and if it is carried out it will only be doing for South Australia something equal to what has been done in the other States. They have all got their big buildings, to connote the fact that they are in the Federation, but up to now Adelaide has nothing of the kind. I must now touch up the Postmaster General (Mr Webster). I and others had a conversation with him on Saturday, and I hope I did not misunderstand him when I thought he said that an amount was on the Estimates for the renovation or extension of the Adelaide Post-office.",62
286,Mr WEBSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I said it was on, but it is not on now.",62
287,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The members of the deputation will be astonished to know that that is what the Minister said. Personally, I am bowled over, because I thought the honourable member was telling me the truth when he said the amount was on the Estimates. He did not say it was on last year and would not be on this year.",62
288,Mr WEBSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I said I had put it there, but it is not there now.",62
289,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The honourable membermet representatives' of most of the branches of his Department over there. I told them"" before they went in that, if they would give the Postmaster-General a fair spin in regard to the performance of their duties, they would find him a jolly decent fellow to get on with.. I - was only telling them what I honestly thought. I do not wish to retract it,, but I am surprised to learn that he did not mean what he seemed to mean when he told the deputation that the amount was on the Estimates, clearly indicating to them that there was a possibility of an early realization of their request to him, that is, the extension of the post-office with a view to establishing a postal institute. They reminded him that the young telegraphists were at present being trained down in the cellar, where you can touch the ceiling with your head, and the atmosphere is far from healthy. The Postmaster-General's reply - encouraged them to believe that there was an early possibility of the work being done. However, there is not a line on the Estimates for, the purpose. ""When honourable members complain about the Capital at Canberra not being gone ou with, I remind them that there are public functions that are remunerative and that need attention in the existing cities. The Postmaster General has put up a record with regard to the finances of his Department. His annual report reads well, but if he is going to make a profit by keeping his men working in the dungeons, after promising them some likelihood of redress, I am afraid that efficiency and contentment in the postal service will not continue. There is another point which, perhaps, it is not within my province to dwell upon, but I mention it because the honourable member for the district (Mr Archibald) has just resumed his seat without calling attention to it. I warn the Postmaster-General that there will be a repetition of the Northern Territory trouble if he does not do something to provide a new post-office at Port Adelaide.",62
290,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE," Order ! The honourable member must confine his remarks to the question before the Chair. ' Mr YATES - There is no mention of that work in the Estimates, although the inadequate facilities at Port Adelaide have been the cause of much discontent. If the Treasurer will consult with the Postmaster-General he will find that he would be doing only fair justice to the residents of the district if he made money available to build a new post-office there. The only expenditure proposed in these Estimates for South Australia consists of two items-centra l office, £175; and Henley Beach telephone exchange, £17.",63
291,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Order ! The honourable member will have an opportunity later of discussing those items.,63
292,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,I know that the people in the districts affected are much concerned about the matters to which I have referred. The increased business that would result would make the provision of these facilities profitable to the Department.,63
293,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Dampier) [9.32] - I presume that, although an amendment is before the Chair, honourable members will be allowed to deal generally with the Estimates, in order to avoid repetition. As I shall be leaving for Western Australia this week, I should like to take this opportunity of drawing attention to a few items of expenditure respecting which the Oommittee should demand some promise from the Government before agreeingto them. A sum of £40,000 is provided for. an aviation school.",63
294,The CHAIRMAN,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE, The discussion must be confined to items of expenditure controlled by the Department of Works and Railways. The honourable member will be in order in discussing any work .that is controlled by that' Department; but I have already called other honourable members to order for attempting to discuss items in other Departments.,63
295,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I shall confine my remarks to the amendment, the purpose of which is to elicit from the Ministry a statement of policy in regard to the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra. So far .as State interests are concerned, I am indifferent as to whether the Seat of Government is in Melbourne, Sydney, or elsewhere; but honourable members should consider seriously whether they are justified in consenting to an enormous expenditure on the establishment of a Capital city in the bush. We have heard a lot of talk about building a North-South railway and other projects involving large expenditure, but the Estimates show that we are to raise this year £16,000,000 in direct taxation and £17,000,000 through the Customs Department. I do not know how we can get much more revenue from the people through those channels.",63
296,Mr HECTOK LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,That is hardly the value of the increased price of wool.,63
297,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The honourable member would like to use the wealth that somebody else has produced for the purpose of building the Eederal Capital. Notwithstanding that large revenue the Treasurer (Mr Watt) anticipates a deficiency. He estimates an ordinary expenditure of £48,000,000, and a further expenditure from loan of £53,750,000. I have met many persons who talked economy. When I advocate economy I have no desire that there shall he any stoppage of public works; but .1 desire to insure that all the works we undertake shall be of a reproductive character, so that they may help us to pay the enormous bill with which we find ourselves saddled in consequence of the war - Still larger sums must be found for the purpose of carrying out the pledges we made to the soldiers. Therefore, we must have economy. We see Departments growing larger year by year, existing staffs being increased and new ones being created, and when we ask for economy we ask for it in connection with administration. At the same time, we realise that the Government must carry on a progressive policy, particularly at the present time, when a large number of soldiers are returning to Australia for whom work must be found. But let such work be reproductive. Eor instance, I would nob care how much money was expended in the locking of - the Murray, Goulburn, and other rivers, knowing as I do that that expenditure would increase production and enable us to settle a larger population on the land. Centralization is the curse of Australia today. 48 per cent, of the population of Victoria is settled in and around Melbourne.",63
298,Mr BLAKELEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The proportion is greaber bhan that.,64
299,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"There is no other country in the world where the proportion of city dwellers to rural dwellers is so great as ib is in Australia. If the Government are to get out of the financial hole in which they must find themselves, they must do everything possible to in crease production. A great mistake would be made by sanctioning at the present time further expenditure upon the Federal Capital, because we have no estimate of what the project will cost the Commonwealth. I am quite convinced bhat the accommodation required for the Commonwealth Parliament and the Federal Service cannot be provided under a cost of fro m £15,000,000 to £20,000,000 .",64
300,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,That - like blie estimabe of a Victorian civil servant.,64
301,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"That is my opinion, and it is in accordance with the scale upon which the Federal Capibal works were sbarbed. This. Parliamenb approved of plans which included the creation of ornamental lakes and great boulevards.",64
302,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Thos e have not been started.,64
303,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"But we have had . the plans before us, and the honourable member would have been only boo-pleased bo recommend bhose works to Parliament a few years ago. I saw at Canberra the great avenues that were being built, not only of immense width, but rising in some instances to heights of from twenby to thirty feet. Stone was blown from the hills and carted away at an enormous cost, and this involved further immense expenditure in making the whole area reasonably level. The engineerswere literally blowing down mountains and filling up valleys, because houses could not be b u i lt alongside a huge embankment without filling up the surrounding count r y . In connection with the arsenal at Tuggeranong, a Government official estimated that the cost of housing 5,000 workmen, assuming half of them to be married, and providing them with the facilities of a township, including schools, hospitals, roads, sewerage, and lighting, would be £1,750,000. That.was between two and three years ago. Costs have in creased so much since then that the estiFully mate may now be advanced to not less than £2,500,000.",64
304,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"We propose bo expend £20,000,000 in erecting soldiers' homes. W hy should we nob expend some of that money at Canberra ?",64
305,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Because when we had established the soldiers there they would be producing nothing. If the honourable member can inform the Committee what the soldiers could produce if they were established ab Canberra, he will destroy my argument.",64
306,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,What do they produce in Melbourne ? ,64
307,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Bank-note s and rent for landlords.,64
308,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Surely the honourable member does not assume that a Federal Capital can be esbablished and maintained by the employment of 220 hands sounds in a note-printing office.,64
309,Mr FLEMING,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,That establishmentwould help the Federal Capibal.,64
310,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I b would; but there are people who would be foolish enough to establish that note-printing office at Canberra at once at an expenditure of £180,000, instead of waiting until the Capital is esbablished and bhen bransferr in g Federal departments and activities to it . On the plans prepared,, no amount less than £10,000,000 to £15,000,000 would be of any use",64

312,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The honourable member has been a-sociated with me in the in it i al work connected with the Capital,, and he must agree that it will require, at any rate, £8,0OO,OOO' to £'I0,000',000to provide Parliament House and the public offices. I believe the Government are going to open the designs to the competition of th© world.",65
313,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,An Australian architect would do the work justas well.,65

On the contrary, I thimik that, it isa very wise step to open the competition to the world, so that we may get the best; and, of course, the best may be found in Australia. Knowing this Parliament as I do, I feel perfectly satisfied that it would not be. corifcent with a Parliament House which cost less than £2,500,000 or £3,000,000 . What did this building cost?",65

I do not assume that Parliament would expend £2,500,00 0 on the Parliament House at the start, but that the plans would be so arranged that the work could bei spread over from seven to ten. years, or longer. In my opinion, when the Seat of Government is taken to Canberra,, the Parliament of the day wilL not care how much extravagance there is,, so long as everything is in apple-pie order, and the result is something of which we can boast. Mr WEST. - You would like the money spent in Melbourne,, instead of at the Capital ?",65
318,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I have no special interest in Melbourne. My only desire is to see this country b u i l t up, and people encouraged to come here; indeed,, we cannot build up the country unless people do come. I b must be remembered bhat we are nob going to sell any land in the Federal Territory, and all the work must be done with money got fro m the people of the Commonwealth.. At present, we are paying through the Customs £17,000,000,. and in direct taxation over £1.6,000,000; and the people cannot paymuch more than tliey are doing at present. The designs for the Federal Capibal show a civic quarter with ornamental lakes and boulevard's, with a group of buildings for the various , public offices, all of which means an enormous expenditure; and then there is the Capitol, but that, I suppose, will not be b u i lt for the next fifty years. How much money has been spent up to the present time?'",65
319,Mr LIVINGSTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"£1,700,000 .",65
320,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"It n i nk it is more like £700,000 or £800,000 . Mr HECTO B LAMOND - We are the only country that will not improve its own lands ?",65
321,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"And it is proposed to improve' our lands by expending am enormous-- sum of money on buildings, that will never return a single sixpence. And if we have spent £1,700,000 on the Federal Territory, what have we got for that expenditure? If honourable members go there, they wil l find a power-house that will, not be wanted for years, a dam over the Cotter River, a pipe-line,, and a couple of large excavations for a water supply. Beyond those works, what have we got for the expenditure?,",65
322,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,We have brickworks and a nursery.,65
323,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Hav e any ""bricks been turned out?",65
324,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Yes , good bricks; but the works are like this Commitbee-: they are not working.",65
325,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"There are a number of other matters with which I should like to deal. For instance, there is an item of £40,000 for the construction of an Arsenal, and there are many other items about which one feels doubtful , and on which some information should be forthcoming. There is also the Aviation School at Point Cook, in regard to which I asked some questions a short time ago. Altogether, about £78,000 has been spent* on this latber work, some £18,000 or £20,000 being the expenditure last year; bub now we learn bhat the authorities are negotiating for land at Geelong for the purpose of establishing a new school there. I wonder if even, the Minister i u charge of the Estimates was aware of that fact. These are all matters on which we ought to be supplied with proper information, because there has been some awful waste. Honourable members will recollect how I fought the Arsenal proposal for a couple of years. I believe, of course, that we should have an Arsenal and manufacture our own munitions; but, with all respect to the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Groom), who so eulogized the Small Arms Pactory a little while ago-although , of course, his statements were those of the officials-ther e is no greater disgrace in the history of Australia, so far as our industrial Departments are concerned, than the administration of that Factory.",65
326,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The past administration.,66
327,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The past administration has been absolutely, damnably' vile and wicked, and it does not leave much room for boasting on the part of Ministers. From four .months after the war started not a rifle was sont out of Australia. According to the - guarantee of the builders when the Government took over the Factory, it should have turned out during a certain period from 55,000 to 60,000 rifles, and it only turned out 16,000. I have an official report as to 300 rifles which were sent to Perth, and it shows that over 100 of them would not take the cartridge, and that in many the rifling was broken. It would, in my opinion, be much better to take the control of work of this sort out of the hands of the Defence Department. A report came into my hands, given to me by a man who, I believe, had stolen it , and the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) got an anonymous letter at the same time. Hundreds of the rifles ready to be' sent out had all been condemned, because they would have been absolutely dangerous to use. Never a machine-gun has been made at the Factory, although there is a pattern Lewisgun there, and the manager stated that if he were supplied with a small amount of machinery he could immediately start - the making of such guns. Before embarking on a great enterprise of this kind the Government ought to obtain the best expert advice from the Old Country. I may say that we paid an enormous price for the manufacture of such rifles as were turned out. The estimate was £ 3 9s. l d . per rifle, but, as honourable members will remember, I offered to put up £ 5 0 if each rifle did not cost over £ 1 1 .",66
328,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,We got an expert from Americato start the Factory.,66
329,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Nothin g of the sort; that gentleman was sent from America to erect the Factory.,66
330,Mr RILEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,And the Government took him as the best man.,66
331,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Is not all this ancient history?,66
332,Mr GREGORY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The same Minister is still in charge, and still boasts of the Factory's output. I am urging that the Government ought to hav.e the best expert advice from the Old Country in such enterprises as this, and more par-' ticularly when they are thinking of starting a work at the Federal Capital which will cost from £2,500,000 to £3,000,000. W it h the management of such enterprises as the Small Arms Factory taken out of the control of the Defence Department, we could rest assured that if anything went wrong the departmental officers would cry out immediately; but, under the present circumstances, if they make any protest they are criticising the work of their own Minister, and things are hushed up which ought to be made public. I shall da my utmost to prevent any expenditure on the Federal Capital at the present time.",66
333,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Melbourne) [10.0] I shall vote for the amendment if it goes to a division. Putting aside the supposed jealousy between New South Wales and Victoria, I desire to look at the question from a purely Australian point of view. One of the greatest abominations that ever disgraced the country is what is known as the departmental plan of the Federal Capital. Certain officers in high position sucked the brains of every man who had sent in a design for the. Federal Capital, and in that way produced this departmental plan. They gave no credit whatever to the men whose ideas they had used, and if it had not been for the present Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) that design would have been carried into effect. I shall always thank the right honourable member for having done justice to Mr Griffin, .a great genius, who was being injured by a circle of highly paid officials. The right honourable member sent for Mr Griffin, who had won the first prize, and decided that the future Capital of the Commonwealth should be given, a chance. I shall thank him still more if he will see that the Federal city is built. 1 believe that he.once agreed that the Capital could he erected under a system which would ultimately involve no cost to the people. We have large 'areas of land there where we could build the note-printing office and* other Commonwealth structures. I do not think the Government are treating fairly the owners of the old Turn Verein site, which has been selected for the note-printing office. I belonged to that old German Club for forty years, and there learned most of my Democracy. The amount offered for the site is small, but if the building were erected at Canberra the land would cost us nothing. I desire also to thank the Postmaster General (Mr Webster), who with Mr . Griffin has made the Melbourne Post office what it should have been years ago. The genius of Mr Griffin, under the guidance of the Minister, has converted it into a building that is the delight of all Melbourne citizens. It is to be regretted that it has not been extended rightthrough to L it t l e Bourke-street. Had it been in Sydney, such an extension would have been made. As it is, we have at the corner of Bourke and Elizabethstreets a magnificent pile of buildings that dwindles down to a building of one storey at the northern end, and next to it we have a galvanized iron shanty. If the complete design had been carried out, we should have had plenty of room there for a note-printing office.",66
334,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,We could also have had the Navy Office there.,67
335,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I agree with the right honourable member. I should like to draw the attention of the Government to an eyesore in the shape of the small enclosure immediately to the north of Parliament House. It is at the present time an absolute disgrace. The iron* palisading should be removed, and it should be converted into a grass plot where the children of the congested areas near by could play. The civilization of the present day has swept away the fences surrounding our publio parks and gardens, and the reserve to which I refer should also be thrown open.",67
336,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,We have nothing to do with it . It is owned by the State.,67
337,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The honourable member will agree that the Victorian Government are treating us most generously in giving us the free use of this building, and I am sure that if they were approached they would improve the reserve , to which I refer. The building which we now occupy is badly ventilated, and in the effort to i m prove it many architects have almost broken their hearts. The State Parliament House in the Exhibition Buildings cost about £50,000, and is far more comfortable and convenient than is this building. I do not think we should erect expensive parliamentary buildings at Canberra. The work could be financed on the lines adopted by the people of Guernsey in erecting a market place at St. Helens. The people there wished to build a market about 120 yeare ago, when - it was rather difficult to borrow money in London, and, on the suggestion of a citizen occupying a high position-, it was decided that the work should be financed by means of notes issued by the local governing body. The contractor agreed to accept these notes in payment for his work; the townspeople accepted them as legal - tender, and' the municipality also accepted them in payment of rates and taxes. Once a year the municipality burned all the notes that had been returned in payment of rates and taxes, as well as notes representing whatever additional amount could be spared. In ten years every note issued for the erection of the market place, which cost £4,000, had been burned, and the municipality had a rent-producing property for all time. Why should we not earmark every year by way of rental 5 per cent, of the cost of building the Federal Parliament House. If we did that, in twenty years the whole cost .would be liquidated.",67
338,Mr WEBSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"O r in t h i r t y years, at all events.",67
339,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Q u it e so. Shops, hotels, and banks could be erected in the Federal Territory in the same way, so that ultimately the Capital would be established without having cost the country a penny.",67
340,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Shortl y put, the honourable' member proposes that the Federal Capital works should be paid for with paper money.",67
341,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Yes . We could have a note issue based upon the security of the Territory, and every building in it . Behind that security we should have the guarantee of the Commonwealth.",67
342,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"If a mau who had money the invested in the Federal Capital was carrying ahout to'leave Australia.; and wanted his money, he would not be able to get it , and he would not take away a brick.",68
343,Dr MALONE Y,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The honourable memgreatest ber would not take a brick.,68
344,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"At all events, I would not take any of that paper money.",68
345,Dr MALONEY,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I come now to anshould other phase . Of this question. Griffin has designed two garden cities i New South Wales, which are known as Griffithsville and Leeton. They are as carried out. nothing compared with what they will be in the future, but even now theyshow the genius of the designer. South Wales continues on these excellent lines, she will lock the whole of her I tributaries of the Murray, and upon them beautiful garden cities worthy of Australia. In reply to the honourable member Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald) , I propose little simply to read the report on the Federal Capital administration. Mr Will f r Blacket, who was appointed a Royal missioner, set out the following findings which, in justice to Mr Griffin, I desire to place on recordUpon all the evidence, and particularly upon that which has been stated or referred to in this report, I find that the reasons why Mr Griffin between 18th October, 1913, 15th November, 1915, performed no substaning tial part of his duties under his contract the Commonwealth are' as stated in four five charges advanced in his behalf, viz., charges 1, 2, 3, and o, and are as under:(1) That necessary information and sistance were withheld from and his powers were usurped by tain officers; (2) That he and his office were ignored, his rights and duties under Ms tract denied, and false charges default made against him; (31 Tliat the Honourable W. O. Archibald and members of the Departmental Board endeavoured to set aside his design and to substitute tlic own design; and (0) That there was in the Department combination, including the Honourable W. 0. Archibald and certain officers, hostile to Mr Griffin, to his design for the Capital city; and that the Honourable W. O. Archibald the oflicers mentioned in my references to the evidence under these charges are severally responsible to the extent already indicated me for this result. But I think it necessary that I should emphasize the fact that after Mr Archibald's accession to office it must have been perfectly clear to all the officers that Ministerial policy was directed against the out of Mr Griffin's design, and any acts they did in frustration of Mr Griffin's efforts were therefore done in furtherance, as they believed, of the Minister's desires - I cannot say that this excuses them: still the respdhsihility in respect of the obstruction to Mr Griffin is with the Minister. Holding the views that he did as - to the ""grave mistake"" that he considered had been made in the engagement of Mr Griffin, he have adopted one of two alternatives; Mr either to have cancelled the contract and reverted to the design of the Departmental n Board, or else to have allowed Mr Griffin's contract to be performed and his design As to the fourth charge"" That in order to prevent Mr Griffin's design from being carried out wilI f New fully false estimates of its cost were given""; find that it wholly fails, and that no such build false estimates were made. These are the highly paid oflicials who have caused the waste of .possibly foT £250,000 at the Federal Capital. On 'a post-office opposite the .South Y a r r a railway station built during the terrible e d times following ithe land boom in VicComtoria when labour was cheap, there is some splendid stone carving, but the Commonwealth Directorof Works, or Colonel Owen, or Colonel Miller, actually gave orders to paint it to make it look like stucco. I do net know of any other in and stance in the world where spendid carvhas been so desecrated. If a parliawith mentary body had been in control of that of the officer he would have been dismissed. In the erection of all public buildings as I hope that outside architects will have him the opportunity of competing, and that cerwhen the prize has been adjudged, the successful architect will be given control of ""conthe work, apart from the men who tried of to implant an abomination on Australia instead of the splendid Capital, designed by .the genius who won the first prize.",68
346,Mr WATT,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Balaclava-Treasurer ) Board's [10.18] - I appeal to the Committee to pass these Estimates as speedily as posa sible, and the BiJl that follows them.. If this is done, the Government promise and that no furthe r business will be taken tonight; but the Loan Bill , which covers the and loan works, and involves the same principles, w i ll be brought forward tomorrow, by when, if I am permitted, I shall take the opportunity of explaining a few facts in connection with the Federal Capital, and shall make some calculations as to the probable cost of it. My friends opposite, and those in the Ministerial Corner who are keen upon the prosecution of this great national project, will find some interesting food for thought in the figures which I shall be able to give. I am not detaining the Committee at this 'Stage, I am simply .asking 'it to proceed to a conclusion as early as possible this evening.",68
347,Mr LIVINGSTQN,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Barker) [10.22]. - I find that £1,723,000 has been spent on the Federal Capital Territory. Although 51 per cent, of the people of Australia live in cities, and although, the thoughts of honourable members should be turned in the direction of getting the people out of the cities and on to the land, is proposed to establish yet another big city in a place which offers little advantages for such a project. When we have Sydney at the front door of Australia, with one of the finest harbors in the world, why is there any need to go to Canberra? It is a ridiculous proposal to talk of transferring 4,000 civil servants from Victoria to a new city. The cost of building houses for them would exceed £3,000,000, and altogether, with the establishment of hospitals and schools, and other conveniences^ the expenditure would run into million's and millions' of money which we cannot afford at the present time. We could spend the money more wisely in placing our soldiers' on the land, and in encouraging them to produce, and in that way create wealth for the community. Theire is neither wiood, nor' water, nor stone at Canberra; very little could be produced there which could be turned into money. Why do we not look forward to doing something big ? Why not build the North-South railway through some of the most fertile country in the world? It is ridiculous to talk of spending money at Canberra when we have country in the Northern Territory; and are doing nothing with it. No wonder the people in the Territory are on strike when we refuse to build a railway for them. I have a few figures which, are interesting. In the Northern Territory we have 213,430 square miles of country with a 20-inch rainfall, 96,790 square miles with a rainfall of 20 to 30 inches, 120,600 square miles with a rainfall of 30 inches to 40 inches, and 80,500 [505] square miles with a rainfall of over 40 inches. Yet, we are doing nothing with this territory. We ought to be ashamedof ourselves. On the Barclay Tablelands, there are 20,000,000 acres capable of supporting 10,000,000 sheep. There are 80,000,000 acres of land with a 15-inch rainfall on which wheat could be grown. At present the country beyond Oodnadatta is like a great river that cannot be bridged without a railway. It can be bridged. Messrs. Timms and Kidman have offered to bridge it by means"" of a railway built either on the land grant system or by accepting Government bonds. What is the good of this country if it is not peopled? What good will the land be to Messrs. Timms and Kidman ? They would put people on it it. The railway would open up the finest country in the world on which our soldiers could be settled. An honourable member has mentioned a loss of £14,000 a year on our horse-breeding establishment at Maribyrnong. If this railway were built to the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth's horses could easily, be transported to the Barclay Tableland. In the Macdonnell Ranges we have 120,000,000 acres of land capable of growing wheat. In fact, we have more wheat-growing land in the Northern Territory than in any other part of Australia, but at present it is absolutely idle, while down here we are bickering among ourselves, and not doing what we ought to do. Mr YATES.^-South Australia will take back the Territory.",69
348,Mr LIVINGSTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"It ought to do so if the Commonwealth will not work it . South Australia would have been very much better off if it had not handed ever the Territory to Federal control. I say to the Commonwealth Government, "" Do not touch the Federal Capital, but go. on with the work of building the NorthSouth railway, and this country will be very much better off."" Earl Kitchener said to another honourable member and myself, when we saw him in Great Britain just prior to our return to Australia, not so many years ago, "" Do not forget to advocate the building of that railway in the interests of the defence of Australia, and if I live long enough I will come and - see the first sod turned."" We cannot defend Australia properly until that line is built. It is a work that must be carried out, and that immediately. There is a chance of doing it now - that this offer has been made. We can get the line built, and settle men on.the land. If we do not embrace the opportunity we ought to be blamed. I hope that I shall live long enough to see this work carried out in the interests of this great country of ours.",69
349,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Brisbane) [10.30]. - It has heen delightful to hear some honourable members on the Ministerial side of the House complain of lack of enterprise on the part of the Government in regard to expenditure on public works. I agree most heartily with everything that has been said in that direction. I listened to the honourable member for Dampier (' Mr Gregory) with great interest when he spoke about the expenditure that he thought was necessary on public works to develop this country. How grandly he said that he would not complain if the expenditure Tan into millions so long as it was for reproductive enterprises! I thought that he was a great Australian, and then I suddenly found as he went on with his speech that he was, after all, only a little Western Australian, because his complaints soon began to pour in regard- 1 ing the very items that he had previously approved of in connection with the expenditure on public works. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Livingston) also started splendidly. He, too, approved of a forward, progressive, pushful public works policy to develop this great country. I thought he, too, was a great Australian ; but I find, after all, - that he is only a little South Australian, and that all he is thinking about is how he is going to advance the interests of South Australia. . Mr LIVINGSTON - Nothin g of kind! You want to centralize everything in Brisbane!",70
350,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"On the contrary. I entirely agree with the honourable member in regard to the building, not only of the railway that he spoke of, but of any other railway that is necessary to open up the unoccupied paTts of - this continent.' It is because I approve of - that policy that I disapprove of his parochialism when he objects to the building of the Capital at Canberra. If there is land anywhere lying idle that can and ought to be put immediately to' public reproductive use, it is the Capital Territory at Canberra. That is where the honourable member's whole argument fails, and shows that he has only a one-eyed view of the development of Australia by the building of Tailways. He can see only one railway.",70
351,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Will the honourable member show how the building of the Capital at Canberra would add to the wealth of the country?,70
352,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"^I shall tell the honourable member that in the course of my argument. I am an enthusiastic supporter of the building of the Capital at. Canberra. It ought .to have been gone on with years ago. Had the policy followed for some years of - quietly proceeding in a careful, honest, progressive way with the building of the Capital been pursued we should have been there by this time, as we ought to have been. We have land there of great agricultural and pastoral value, lying, practically idle.",70
353,Mr FLEMING,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,It is all under occupation.,70
354,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"It is not, and i i is not producing anything approaching what it ought to produce and would produce if there wa3 any settlement there. It is our business to promote settlement there. There are two reasons for being anxious that the Federal Capital should be moved to Canberra and established there as soon as possible. The first is based primarily on the promise made at the beginning of Federation that the Capital would be removed from the capital city either of '""Victoria or New South Wales. It would be equally objectionable to have the Federal Parliament located in Sydney as it is to have it in Melbourne. I do not think w.e shall ever realise honestly and fully what Federation means until the we have the Federal Parliament removed from the influences of a State capital.",70
355,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"When your party were in power, for about sixyears, why did you not do it?",70
356,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,It was .while the Labour party were in power that something was done.,70
357,Mr BOYD,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"That was when"" O'Malley's traction engine ran into the creek and was bogged.",70
358,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Mr O'Malley made a start, and the honourable member's party blocked him. At page 74 of the Budget-papers presented last week, figures are given to show that it was while the Labour party were in . power that something was done. Money was expended on the Federal Capital Territory as follows:1911-12, £ 8 4 , 4 3 9 ; 1912-13, £ 3 1 6 , 8 1 8 ; 1913-14, £432,121; 1914-15, £253,153; 1915-16, £ 9 6 , 2 1 1 ; 1916-17, £ 2 3 7 , 6 6 9 ; 1917-18, £ 9 9 , 1 9 7 ; 1918-19, , £ 3 , 7 1 5 . By far the bulk of the expenditure on the Federal Capital so far took place during the regime of the Labour party. I hope that with the advent of the Labour party again to power after the forthcoming election a progressive policy will be once more adopted in regard to Canberra. We shall not realise what Federation is, or ought to be, u n t i l we remove this Parliament from the influences of a State capital, because, whether we like it or not, we are consciously or unconsciously influenced by the Melbourne point of view. ' Melbourne interests are pressing upon us on every hand; local interests affect our decisions; we are approachable and approached by Melbourne interests, Melbourne concerns, and Melbourne institutions in a way that is not proper or suitable to enable us to get a Federal view of things. Not u n t i l this Parliament is in a position where it is free from all those social, political, and industrial conditions that are purely local in their influence and perspective, shall we be able to do our duty properly as a Federal Parliament. The smaller States of the Federation-Queensland , South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania-wil l never be able to get a fair deal i u this Parliament u n t i l we move from Melbourne, and it would be equally bad if we were located in Sydney. For those two reasons I am enthusiastic regarding the removal of the Capital to Canberra. It would relieve the congestion in some of the States if we were to establish the Federal Capital at Canberra. It has been suggested that the Small Arms should be located there. If that were done it would immediately remove from Lithgow a pressure that has brought about a scandal in regard to the housing of the Small Arms Factory employees there. The present conditions have been good for the landlords at Lithgow, but the Commonwealth owns the land at Canberra, and is in a position to establish workmen's homes there, which would not only vastly improve the living conditions of the employees, but would aI=o enable this country [505]-2 to realise for its own benefit a satisfactorv return on its property, which at present is lying idle. That is one. specific instance where we could put it to a proper reproductive use, but it is only one item in connection with the settlement of that area. Immediately the Parliament is established there, the economic and productive value of the Territory will be in creased, because settlement will be attracted. A return for the money that we employ will be created. If we had adopted the proposal made eight years ago, to appoint a Commission to have charge of the Capital Territory, and had placed £500,000 a year for four years at their disposal to carry out a progressive public works policy in the Capital area, that £2,000,000 would have immediately become interest-producing, and each succeeding year the return from the outlay would have been of increasing advantage to the Commonwealth. I do not know any other way that could be adopted if we wish to follow business-like methods. Those who have been to the Territory know that all the diatribes and complaints made against it are based either upon personal prejudice or on some local interest. I have been there several times, and am an admirer of the country, and an enthusiastic admirer of the scheme submitted h y Mr Griffin for the lay-out of the city and the building of the Capital. It is a design, that is beyond challenge by anybody in Australia. I do not think there is any person in Australia competent to criticise it successfully, or to put against it anything equal to it .",70
359,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,You are criticising it very favourably now ,71
360,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,I am only commenting.,71
361,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,But you are quite competent to do that?,71
362,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I am not. I am only basing my comment on the fact that Factory I have had the advantage of hearing the opinions of experts on both sides; and, speaking from an entirely impartial point of view, I believe the design is incomparable for the character of the country and the purposes for which we want it. Not only in regard to Canberra do I regret the position in which we are placed to-night, but it is most unfortunate that the Government are so slow in their public works policy generally. I notice that in the estimated expenditure for this year, a sum of £6,085,000 is set down for , soldiers' land settlement. There is also £1,500,000 for the local authorities, and £70,000. to be spent in regard to forestry in connection with the same object. These are all splendid items; but is that money going to be spent in the righ t place and in the righ t way ? The £6,000,000 odd for land settlement for returned soldiers could be better spent by settling the men on the vacant lands in our own Territory-no t only in the Eederal Capital area, but also in the Northern Territory-rathe r than by paying extortionate prices for repurchasing estates under the State Governments. One of the scandals in connection with our returned soldiers' settlement policy is the amount of money that we are throwing away, giving away, or being robbed of, in the prices that are being paid for repurchased estates. This is particularly a vicious policy, because of the fact staring us in the face that here we have territory of our own immediately available, territory suitable in many directions for a variety of purposes, and that we are making no use of. By the expenditure of this money directly by us on our own country, we should obtain an immediate and satisfactory return.",71

364,Mr CORSER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Why when you know there is so much good land in Queensland, so easily got at?",72
365,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I d id not suggest sending them to the Northern Territory. I was asked if I would like the settlers tp go there, and I said they would make excellent settlers there. member should recognise that there is a distinction in the use of words. trying to make me say something that I did not say.",72
366,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The . honourable member is pretty canny.,72
367,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I know what I said, but the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) is trying to make me say something else. I am one of those who believe that the Northern Territory includes land equal to any in other parts of Australia, and not only is there room for many of Australia's returned sols diers, but we ought to make settlement possible for any other soldiers of the Empire who could be .invited to go there. There is another respect in which I regret the paucity of the Government's proposals in regard to public works. The Government propose to spend from revenue during the current financial year £397,144, and from loan £1,460,221. I have taken the trouble to look up the expenditure on new works and buildings in every financial year since the commencement of Federation. The figures are most instructive. I shall give the figures only from 1910-11 onwards:1910-11, £2,452,960; 1911-12, £3,797,252; 1912-13, £ 4 , 7 2 9 , 7 4 8; 191314, £5,470,640j 1914-15, £ 4 , 8 2 8 , 3 7 8; 1915-16, £5,399,253; ' 3916-17, £4,301,530. TJp t ill that time all the expenditure on works and buildings was from revenue. But probably under the compulsion of war conditions we established in the following year the principle of providing portion of the works expenditure from loan. In 1917-18 we spent from revenue £622,203, and from loan £1,803,447, making a total of £2,425,650. Honourable members will notice that there was a heavy reduction. In 1918-19 the expenditure from revenue you send was £405,159, and from loan £1,085,364, making a total of £1,490,523. This year from revenue and loans combined the Government propose to expend only £1,857,365 . If ever there was a time when there should be a courageous policy of public works, either from revenue or suggest that, loan, it is now, when the soldiers are returning and development is so urgently necessary. We are faced with the glaring fact that men who sacrificed useful and lucrative positions in society in order to go to the war have returned to find that their positions are not open to them. The honourable Unfortunately, some of them are not fitted to resume the work in which they were He is employed before the war, but others are willing and able to resume their places in civil l if e , and the work is not available for them.",72
368,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The honourable member is overlooking the other glaring fact that our loan nearly failed, and the New Zealand loan d id fail .",72
369,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"But a saving is possible in directions in which expenditure does not return interest, or where it is not as necessary as that which will find reproductive employment for our soldiers. Of course, to carry out works merely for the purpose', of findingemployment is a temporary and unsatisfactory experiment. I believe that if we are to hold this continent, against the forces, that seem to he multiplying against us,, we must, settle it with people who. are directly interested in it , and we must' attract others fisom overseas, thus getting a big population which, will cause increased production, which, in turn , will mean, increased wealth. How can w e do that unless we carry on a policy of worlcs which will give our people something to do ? We aregetting an advertisement throughout the 'world today because of our repatriation scheme) thanwhich there is. no betteri n any country. But I believe that half the money which is spent in repatriation would: be better expended int building railways and open1 ing up the-country for settlement. The men who. are drawing sustenance money, who are obliged to go to the Department in order to get enough) money to keep body and soul together, would rather geinto rhe country to work if jobs were available for them'. The money that is being expended on sustenance and on land settlement could be better expended in settling' the soldiers, on our owm territory and' in the construction of public works..",72
370,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I suppose honourable member is awarethat, ninelaunch tenths of. the soldiers say that, they w not go intothe way-back country. Mr FE t f LAYSON - Q u it o probably; but let me-mention one specific instance of other work that could be done. At the preseut time, the Commonwealth is spendincompetent, ing £25,000 per annum in renting ings for public Departments in the capital cities alone. Yet we all know that, ther the Federal Capital be transferred Canberra soon or late, accommodation our employees will be required in the State capitals in order to carry on work of Commonwealth Departments. But when it is suggested that we should soldiers ? erect public offices in which, all the De Mr FINLAYSON partments could be concentrated instead of being spread all over the city Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - That will continue whether or not there is a Federal Capital.",73
371,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"We should undertake immediately in each capital the erection of Commonwealth Government offices. By so doing, we should effect a saving in rents, and increase the efficiency of the Departments. Even Ministers must be handicapped im administration through"" the fact of their Departments; beingscattered in buildings' in various parts, of thecity: Supposethati t would cost £1,000,000' toerect decent Commonwealth offices in each capital city, why should we not incur thatexpenditure? That would provide work straight way for returned' soldiers, and forothers who are ' walkingthe streets looking in vain foremployment.",73
372,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"That would add £25,000to the annual interest bill.",73
373,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The right honourable gentleman overlooks the fact that this expenditure would be reproductive; it would obviate the payment of the present big rent bill. The money that is spent on sustenance yields no return. I can never forget Queen Mary's statement that "" E m ployment is better than relief."" Our soldiers do not want sustenance if they can get work.",73
374,Sir JOSEPH,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"COOK.:-Quee n Mary's statement had' much more force in Eng1 land"" than it has here. The Imperial Government were spending scores of millions of pounds on sustenance.",73
375,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"The trouble is the the same there as here- a lack of courage to. out in schemes that will provide ill ' work. In Australia we have less excuse than there is. in the Mother Country, because we have undeveloped areas in every direction requiring works and workers.",73
376,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"They are a l o t of nincompoops, in the O l d buildCountry,, of course^",73
377,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I did not say so. wheBut if the right honourable gentleman, to who has been to England recently, makes for that declaration, I accept it .",73
378,Mr ATKINSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Do you not admit the that the number receiving sustenance is small considering the total number of - It is too . large. I am not complaining of the number receiving sustenance, but am saying they should be given work.",73
379,Mr SAMPSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"-Would not those men 5 be better employed' in constructing, 6ay, telephone lines?",73
380,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"That is an excellent suggestion, and I hope that it is one the Postmaster-General will take into consideration. I. wish to bring before the Oommittee a suggestionin connection with tha growth of a product which is urgently needed in this country. cotton as well as any other country in the world, and I do not think there is a product that would give a more satisfactory and prompt return. miles of territory in Australia eminently suitable for the growth of cotton.",73

383,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I recently read a statement in a Brisbane newspaper relating to the returns from cotton, which showed that those who had been experimenting had made a success of it . Mr RICHAB D FOSTEB - What were paid?",74
384,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Accordin g to the information I have received, the question of wages is not the important one in conthe nexion with the growing of cotton.",74

388,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I went into the question exhaustively, and prepared a speech which I hope to have the opportunity .of delivering on some f u t u re occasion. I have had incontrovertible testimony from America showing that, in stead of cotton growing being a coloured labour question, or one which can afford to pay only small wages, it is paying the highest wages of any product in America.",74
389,Mr BURCHELL,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Is not the honourable member dealing with machinery for stripping ?,74
390,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Accordin g to the opinions of those engaged in the growiug of cotton, only one machine is necessary, and that has. not yet been perfected.",74
391,Mr BUBCHELL,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Variou s types'are in existence.,74
392,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The growers are in need of a satisfactory . machine for cotton picking. I have seen one in operation in Queensland that is equal to the best in use in America.,74
393,Mr BUBCHELL,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,There is room for imW e can grow provement.,74
394,Mr FINLAYSON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"In the cotton growing States of America, picking machines are not in general use, and much We have of the work is done by hand. Even when the cotton is picked by hand, it is not a question of low wages. The American be authorities on the question have clearly stated that the cotton industry can pay as good wages as any other. We have miles of territory, not only in Queensland, but also in the Northern Territory question and Western Australia, eminently suitable for cotton-growing.",74
395,Mr GLYNN,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,It is a question of wages in the Northern Territory.,74

400,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"Hunter) [11.5] There are very many complaints from the public as to unsuitable buildings used for carrying on the postal business in New South ""Wales, and I find, on looking at the Estimates, that New South Wales is not going to be in a much better position in this respect this year than the State has been in the past. I do not wish to be provincial, but it seems strange that considerably more money is expended on public works in Victoria than in New South Wales. There may be a good reason for this, but I point out that last year, on postal buildings, there was spent in New iSouth Wales £17,9 5S, and in Victoria, £22,009, while this year it is estimated that in New South Wales there will be spent £8,436, and in Victoria, £19,976. The fact stands out that in New South Wales' there are not the postal buildings there should be in the important towns.",75
401,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,That applies to all the items in these Estimates.,75
402,Mr OHARLTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"That is so, and it only shows the concentration of the Departments in Victoria, where the heads are, and, of course, they have great influence, with Ministers. Cessnock is, perhaps, the third town in New South Wales, ranking next to Newcastle in point of population, and there the postal buildings are altogether inadequate. Whenever representations are made on this head, we are told that the buildings are supposed to be satisfactory; but, as a matter of fact, they not only give rise to complaints from the general public, but are doing much harm to the health of the employees. Without sufficient air space the health of the oflicials must suffer, and this is accentuated by the fact that they are doing more work than they ever did in' the history of the Department. Every piece of legislation which entails the payment of money provides that the payment must be made through the post offices, and this means so much additional work that very many men are on the point of breaking down in health. This may seem exaggerated, but I honestly believe it to be true, and the least we can do is to find our oflicials suitable accommodation, and not overwork them.",75
403,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,Brin g thera under the Factories Act.,75
404,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I do not care what is done so long as the position is relieved; for, if it is not, we shall have many breaking down from nerve trouble. It is not true economy when it is exercised at the expense of the public and the officials. The Minister may be able to explain why the expenditure in Victoria is so much greater than in New South Wales, especially in view of the fact that in the latter State the population is larger.",75
405,Mr GROOM,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,The expenditure 'Varies fi'om year to year.,75
406,Mr CHARLTON,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"I have been told that often. Two or three years ago, when I drew attention to the matter, I was told that the expenditure was necessary because certain works were required' in Melbourne, and now we find the position the same this year. Is it to continue for all time? Has New South Wales never to get a "" look in "" in connection with post offices and postal buildings? Victoria may be entitled to all that State is getting, but, if so, New South Wales is not receiving what it is entitled to. Every representative of a country constituency knows that postal facilities are being cut down every week, and no endeavour is made to meet the requirements of the public. Proposed vote agreed to.

407,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"South Australia) [11.17]. - Some days' ago, I put a questiou to the Assistant Minister for Defence regarding kits belonging to returned soldiers which were inadvertently carried on to Tasmania, and he gave me a reply to the effect that they had been returned, with the exception of one or two belonging to the officers. I drew attention to the matter because the father of one of thesesoldiers, whose kit was missing, said it contained material valued"" at over £20. This gentleman has been down to Keswick Barracks on several occasions - to make inquiries. When I furnished him with the official information, he again called upon the officials at Keswick Barracks; but they ""pooh-poohed"" the idea, and, I understand, treated him rather dis-courteously. I have every right, as a representative of my constituency, to make the inquiries, and I think I am entitled to due respect in my oflicial capacity. WJien this gentleman was informed that they could do nothing for him, he told them that he had had the official reply given to me in the House, and they said, ""You bring Yates here. We will soon deal with him."" ' Naturally, I expected this sort of thing from some of these people who get the military uniform on; but the gentleman to whom I Tefer did not care to go auy further in the matter until he had heard from me. His letter reads as follows:223 Halifax-street, Adelaide, Bear Mr Yates, Saw Sergt. Gill this morning. Showed the letter, and - asked him why the CommanDepartment; dant had reported that all the kits returned to South Australia, and delivered. He said he did not know, hut knew it was not at Keswick. He said we were making such a h fuss about a lost kit which was enough to make a man mad. I told him if he had lost his he would not talk like that. He then walked away.",76
408,Sir JOSEPH COOK,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,I lost mine; too.,76
409,Mr YATES,TREATMENT OF CONSUMPTIVE,"As the Minister was at the scene of the war, he will know that our soldiers prize what they have in their kits; though I do not suppose that the Minister would grieve very much about his loss, because probably he could get all he wanted in Sydney if he desired. I do not mean, of course, the star with red, white, and blue ribbon which he wears on his breast. I realise that that is an honour conferred upon him. Speaking seriously, I do not think that any father of a soldier, or the soldiers themselves, should be treated as this gentleman has been treated. I may tell honourable members that his name is Mr Joseph Rundell, a well-Jqiown South Australian cricketei', and a ihan very well known and respected throughout the State. He is not a man to raise trouble unnecessarily. I hope the Minister will have full inquiries made into this matter, and see that, if the soldiers cannot get their kits returned to them, they get an 'equivalent in the way of a grant.",76
