We are putting lead in our exporters' export markets overseas but placing them background. That is why anything we can do is very important. The specific concern I have about this bill to the market failure test. In the explanatory accepts that competitive neutrality principles have a net competitive advantage over other means for small business is that EFIC does major banks, because the reality is that when assist them with their exports, here in Australia When we talk about market failure and failure about small business when they ask for improvements estimates period. Small businesses have every have been abandoned by this government, as is obvious that Labor never seems to appreciate half of all employees in Australia today. The about jobs and growth, but he forecast a rise in growth, and small business bears the brunt for small business to have a government on its bill may provide some support for small and to enter export markets. The coalition will not pleased to speak on the Export Finance and and Other Measures) Bill 2013. EFIC is a small businesses in their efforts to export to the this bill. However, I am concerned by some of the detail will need to be looked at very closely in that it does benefit small business. I have EFIC to look for export finance and insurance sets out the purpose of this bill as giving Corporation to better support Australian in global and regional value chains'. And at the moment! The only way our small businesses field is if they have some type of competitive seems to want to take away that competitive of the carbon tax that the government is disadvantage and making it harder for that all other nations are having a carbon on a carbon tax. The facts are that Australian tax, which simply puts them at a competitive saddlebags, forcing them to compete on at a competitive disadvantage. That is the to assist our small and medium sized exporters is changing what is known as the market gap test memorandum it notes that the government should apply to EFIC to ensure that it does not business or potential competitors. What that not have a competitive advantage over our four our small businesses want to seek finance to they only have a choice of the four big banks. in markets, one thing that is often thrown up in competition laws or they suggest that competition is not working is that competition possible that all four of our big banks are at at the same time? It simply defies the logic see is the Reserve Bank interest rates, the decline simply not being passed on to the interest rates Why are small businesses in Australia being has mandated? Why are they not being passed Australian small business at a competitive disadvantage. working on a tender in the Middle East, in are competing against firms from those countries, from their banking systems at much lower banking system here. Why is that? I suggest government there has been such a blowout conditions for small business that the banks high rates. The alternative is that the banks interest rates. The third explanation is a concern over the wording of this bill when businesses seeking finance, especially for strong case that market failure exists at the When it comes to the principles of competitive support, providing those markets are competitive. government in this respect, especially Efficiency Program, because that program neutrality. It is a program that is only available small business community. One example of that swimming lessons. If a council owns a swimming entitled to seek to offset some of the higher seeking a grant through the Community Energy competing against that locally run government we have the government in this bill talking principles but doing the opposite in other directions. As I said previously, the coalition does changes affect it in principle. We must keep to see situations arise in this country where Australian small businesses at a greater competitive all the government's mistaken policies. Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills-Parliamentary members for their participation in this debate legislation before us, the Export Finance Mandate and Other Measures) Bill 2013. I wish to comment on the remarks made price. He ran out the tired old chestnut Mr Craig Kelly interjectingharms competitors. If that is true, how is it the moment substantially increasing their profits that competition harms competitors. So what we we have seen in the Reserve Bank cash rate, that small business is paying. Why is that? denied those interest rate decreases that the RBA on to small business? Again that places If a small business in Australia is America, in Europe or somewhere in Asia and they those companies have access to finance rates than Australian exporters do from our there are three reasons. Firstly, under this in the risk and such a deterioration in the are factoring that in and charging small business are simply gouging small businesses with higher combination of the above. Therefore I have great it talks about a market failure test for small their export activities. There is already a very moment for a small business seeking finance. neutrality, they are principles we should However, we have seen hypocrisy from the with what is known as the Community Energy does not follow the principles of competitive to local councils but it is not available to the is in the area of private swimming pools and pool at which it teaches kids to swim, it is electricity costs caused through the carbon tax by Efficiency Program, but a small business institute cannot obtain that same grant. So here about the importance of competitive neutrality not oppose this bill, but we must see how these a very close eye on them because we do not want this government does a single thing more to place disadvantage than they already are with Secretary for Trade) (11:10): I thank and I thank the opposition for its support of the and Insurance Corporation Amendment (New by the member for Hughes concerning the carbon of the world's highest carbon tax.
