1,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Yesterday , when the Minister for the Navy -(Sir was speaking, he suggested by the words that he used that I had something to do with the getting together of a very large House. gathering, amounting to many thousands of persons, that assembled within the cincts of this House on Thursday evening.",19
2,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I made no such suggestion at any time.,19
3,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Then I misunderstood the right honourable gentleman. He suggested that the gathering synchronized with my advent to the House, although a War Precautions regulation had been in existence for quite a long time prohibiting such gatherings. I assure you, Mr.plied, Deputy Speaker, honourable members, and the people at large, that I had nothing whatever to do with the getting together of that assembly, and knew nothing of it. I addressed some words to it, but only in response to the request of the gatherin ing, and with a view to urging it to keep within the law, and to use that self-reto straint-thos e were my very wordswhich I thought necessary to save the right honourable gentleman and some of those associated with him from the consethink quences of the public indignation aroused hy their arbitrary exercise of the powers conferred by the War Precautions Act.",19
4,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"In reply to hut what the honourable member has said, also by way of personal explanation, wish to say that the Government are very much obliged to him for his offer of help. We should, however, appreciate more his action in refraining from addressing unlawful gatherings.",19
5,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,I desire to make a personal explanation.,19
6,Mr LISTER,Unknown,How long is this farce to continue? [122],19
7,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,I ask that that objectionable expression be withdrawn.,19
8,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Will the honourable member withdraw the expression complained of?,19
9,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"I made the interjection, and I repeat it .",19
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable member applied the words to any other honourable, member, he must withdraw them.",19

13,Mr LISTER,Unknown,"In deference to you, Mr. preDeputy Speaker, I withdraw what I said.",19
14,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"It is reported in the press that yesterday, just before the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) invited the Serjeant-at-Arms to a cup of tea, the Minister for thÂ© Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) referred to me as an "" insulting brute."" It is almost incredible to me that .the right honourable gentleman could have used such words, and it is unthinkable that they should have been apas is suggested in the press, to one whose manners and deportment have been modelled always on those of the late Lord Chesterfield. It is true that I heard the right honourable gentleman use the words "" insulting brute,"" but I regarded them as the nature of a soliloquy rather than of an epithet, and did not take objection them, because I was under the impression that he was applying them to you,' Mr Deputy Speaker, or to himself.",19
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I hardly that that is a personal explanation. The honourable member takes exception to an expression used by the Minister for the Navy, which he considers derogatory; at the time the interjections across and the chamber were causing such a babel I that it was impossible for me to hear what was being said. The occurrence shows the need for obeying the rules of the infinitely House by keeping silence. THE TREASURERSHIP.",19
16,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"In the absence of the Prime Minister, I ask the Leader of the House what is the reason for the undue delay in filling the position of Treasurer. It is over a month, since the right honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Watt) resigned his portfolio, and statements have been made as to the extraordinary position of our finances. I wish to know when the office is likely to be filled.",19
17,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I candidly confess that I cannot give the honourable member an answer that he would like.,20
18,Mr TTJDOK,Unknown,"Tell us what you would like, and we shall ithen know whether it is what we would like. ,",20
19,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Eo r one thing, I would not like a Treasurer from the Labour party, with all due respect for the capacity of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West). HIGH COMMISSIONERSHIP.",20
20,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"In the absence of the Prime Minister, I ask the Leader of the House whether, in view of the rumoured probability of his being appointed High Commissioner for Australia in London, the Government will give honourable members an opportunity to discuss the suitability of .the proposed appointee before any appointment is made?",20
21,Sir JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I know nothing whatever of any rumour as to any appointment to the High Commissionership. I have said that before, though the honourable member keeps repeating a contrary statement. At this moment I know nothing whatever of any appointment to the High Commissionership. The position is not vacant, and will not become so for some time.",20
22,Mr TTJDOK,Unknown,Senato r Pearce and the late Sir Edmund Barton made similar statements. PRICE OF BUTTER.,20
23,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"Is it the intention of the Government to continue price fixing in relation to butter after ithe termination of the current contract with the Imperial Government, which expires on the 31st instant ?",20
24,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I have already given notice of my intention to move for leave to - bring in a Bill to enable the contract which has been entered, into between the producers of butter here and the British Government to be carried into effect; but the Crown Law officers advise me that, beyond doing that, it is not possible for the Government to fix the price of butter after the termination, on the 31st July, of the existing contract. NA CONFERENCE.",20
25,Mr BOWDEN,INTERNATIONAL POSTAL,Is it proposed that Australia shall be represented at the forthcoming International Postal'Conference ?,20
26,Mr WISE,INTERNATIONAL POSTAL,The Secretary to the Postmaster^General's Department has been appointed to represent Australia at the Conference TELEPHONE MATERIAL .,20
27,Mr RILEY,INTERNATIONAL POSTAL,"Can the Postmaster General tell us when supplies of telephone instruments and material may be expected? There is a dearth of telephones now, and the public are worrying members to get connexions made.",20
28,Mr WISE,INTERNATIONAL POSTAL,"I shall make inquiries, and ascertain when the material is to be, expected. WAR TROPHIES.",20
29,Mr RODGERS,INTERNATIONAL POSTAL,"I understand that war trophies are now being distributed only to centres having a population of not less than 300 persons, and I ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether a certain number cannot be set aside for distribution in the great back country which sent such a lot of fine young men to the Front?  member is aware that a Committee consisting of State and Federal members of Parliament has been appointed tp deal with this matter, and has arrived at a decision in connection with the distribution of war trophies. However, I shall be pleased to put his suggestion before the Committee, that they may consider whether there is any necessity for an alteration of their proposals to secure a better distribution in country districts. If the honourable member will set out in a letter just what he desires should be done, I will submit it to the Committee at an early date.",20
30,Mr BOWDEN,INTERNATIONAL POSTAL,"I ask the Minister for Home and Territories whether it is possible to arrange for the distribution of war trophies on the basis of the population of shires and municipalities rather than on the basis of the population of certain centres?  given of questions of this kind. I suggest to the honourable member that he should do what I have asked the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) to do-se t out his views in a letter, which I will put before the Committee. MERCANTIL E MARINE . WAB SERVICE.",20
31,Mr BURCHELL,INTERNATIONAL POSTAL,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Is the Government taking any steps to issue war medals to members of the mercantile marine of Australia; and, if so, at what time will they be issued, and what are the'medals? 2. Are all grades in the mercantile marine, who have qualified by service in the war zone, to he duly recognised by the issue of these medals ? 3. Are the returned sailors of the mercantile marine of Australia of all grades eligible for participation in the Government schemes of repatriation, including housing?",21
32,Mr HUGHES,INTERNATIONAL POSTAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l low:1 and 2. In May, 1919, the Government decided to issue a mercantile marine war-zone badge to masters and seamen of the mercantile marine who had served on a vessel under Australian articles which had traded within the war zone for any period during the war, and 3,500 badges have already been issued. The term "" war zone "" applies to routes followed by such vessels when proceeding to and from a port on the Atlantic side of North America and Africa and/or in the TJnited Kingdom, the Continent of Europe, or on the Mediterranean coast of Africa, and commences or terminates in each case at (a) the eastern end of the Panama Canal; (6) the Cape of Good Hope; (c) Suez. In the case of a deceased seaman who would have been entitled to a badge, it was decided that the badge should be awarded to his next of kin. The distribution of these badges has heen undertaken by the Superintendent, Mercantile Marine Office, Melbourne, and applications may be made to that officer direct, or through the superintendents of marine of the other States, from whom the necessary application forms may be obtained. 3. Members of the mercantile marine are not eligible under the Repatriation Act, but the Government have agreed to include within the provisions of the War Service Homes Act seamen and others who have been awarded the Australian mercantile marine war-zone badge or the British mercantile marine medal.

Dr EARLE PAGE asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether, in view of the hardship imposed on the provincial press through the present method of assessing the value of newsprint for Customs purposes, the Minister would fix the home consumption price of unglazed newsprint, flat or reel, at, say, Â£30 per ton t ill local consumers are able to purchase their requirements at fair trade values, or, alternatively, a fixed duty of not more than Â£3 per ton?",21
34,Mr MASSYGREENE,PRICE OF NEWS PRINTIN G,"It is not practicable to grant the honourable member's request witnout an amendment of the Customs Act.

What are the terms and conditions under which a foreigner may become naturalized in Australia, and the procedure to be adopted in making application for naturalization? 2. What foreigners may not become naturalized in Australia?  honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The necessary conditions of the law as it stands at present are: (a) residence for two years; (6) good character; (c) knowledge the English language. The procedure is for the alien to apnly, giving the information and certificates character as required in the departmental forms and to advertise his intention to The .Department then makes inquiries, and the result is satisfactory the Governor General is advised to approve of the issue of a certifinot cate. The applicant next renounces his former allegiance, and takes the oath the King, after which the certificate is prepared and issued. 2. Aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, Pacific Islands, excepting New Zealand, declared by law not to be eligible to At present it is not the practice to naturalize former enemy aliens or Russians unless for exceptional reasons approved by the Minister. I may add, for the honourable member's infortralia. mation, that a new law on the subject is course of preparation, and a Bill to give throughout the Empire to Australian certificates will be introduced shortly.

45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,CONGESTION OF AUSTRALIAN,"I understand that of the business of the day has been called on, and therefore the honourable member's of motion is too late.",22
46,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONGESTION OF AUSTRALIAN," The particular Order of if the Day appearing first on the paper has been called on, and therefore the motion of the honourable member for Dalley of allegiance to is in order.",22

PAIBS. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER --In reference to the point of order raised by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr . Ryan), the standing order relating to the closure reads:(a) After any question has been proposed, either in the House or in any Committee of the Whole, a motion may be made by any member, rising in his place, and without notice, and whether, any other member is addressingthe Chair or not, ""That the question be now put,"" and the motion shall be put forthwith and decided without amendment or debate. Therefore, I rule that the motion of the P r m e Minister was in order.",23
52,Mr RYAN,CONGESTION OF AUSTRALIAN,"The standing order uses the words "" after any question has been proposed."" That means proposed from the Chair. I submit that there is no question before the House u n t i l it has . . 17 been stated by Mr Speaker. The mere . . 32 fact that some honourable member rises and intimates that he intends to move a 15 motion does not place such motion before the House; it must he submitted to the House from the Chair. Therefore, no motion to closure debate can be entertained until the question has been submitted from the Chair.",23

NA INDUSTRY BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 22nd July (vide page 2964), on motion by Mr MASSYGREENEThat this Bill be now read a second time.",24
63,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"(Cowper) [11.48]"". - I drew attention last night to the various methods that had been called into operation in the United States of America and Canada-the two great Federations which are similar to this country in their extent, in the time of their development, and in their problems - in order to co-ordinate Federal and State activities. I should like to outline the methods adopted in those countries to insure that there should be no duplication, overlapping, or friction between the State and Federal Governments, either in administration or in the work itself. When the original Commission of Conservation was appointed in Canada, these were the lines that were In determining the lines upon which action should be taken, it was recognised that there was grave danger that the authorities of the Provinces might look with jealousy upon any Commission created by Federal legislation, and the provisions of the Act were expressly in such a way as to preclude the posprosibility of any ground for such a feeling, the being, in fact, such as to secure, as far as possible, the most effective representation of the views of each Province. The Commission is, in fact, probably the most truly national in its composition of any body that has ever been constituted in Canada. I commend to our Government the lines adopted by the Canadian governmental activities, as shown iii the first annual report of the Commission:Where the scope is almost infinite, the effort should be to choose that which is immediately practical and useful. And, first of all, it appears clear to us that provision should be made for making a comprehensive and accurate inventory of our natural resources, so far as our available information extends. The beginning of all proper investigations is the ascertainment of facts, and there is no country that 1 know of where it is more urgently necessary in the public interest that the natural resources should be tabulated and inventoried than it is in Canada. When the Commission was appointed by the Canadian Government to go to Washington last winter, we set on foot a preliminary movement to tabulate information. The results of that work are now among our records. It is, we may say, of the most fragmentary description. That was what the Canadian Government found regarding State activities, such as we have had, which had been in operation for many yea^gI t was surprising to find how difficult it was to get anything like accurate information. Statistical information of the class which our census officers prepare is abundant and accurate, but it does not assume to deal with the question of natural resources. At the present moment there are but few publications of any Government in Canada which give accurate and comprehensive information upon these subjects. The utility of such an inventory hardly needs discussion. Both for the purposes of development and of conservation it is the first essential to have an accurate and complete statement of the facts, readily available, accessible to all, and couched in language that the average reader can understand. Those were the lines on which the Canadian Government carried out this project, and now, ten years afterwards, they have, I suppose, one of the most complete, far-reaching, and comprehensive tabulations of the natural resources of their territory to be found ih the world. The lines on which they have developed are worth imitating in Australia today.",24
64,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,How Provinces represented 1,25
65,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"They have representation practically on the lines of the advisory councils, which I gather were provided for in the previous measure proposed to this Parliament. understand from this morning's press that the Government intend to re-introduce provision for those advisory councils in this Bill.",25
66,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Then the Provinces have representation and some share of power ?,25
67,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Bot h in Canada and the United States of America the Federal Government, in many instances, subsidizes the State or provincial activities. In the case of agriculture, for instance, it does not overlap. It appoints its men in certain departments of work, but it does not "" butt"" into those which the State or Province already fills. In those cases, it simply subsidizes and increases the possibilities for good of the officers already in existence. It does not interfere with their control in any degree.",25
68,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Fro m what you have said, evidently the Provinces, have some right of representation and some share of power.",25
69,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"There has never been any conflict there, because there has been a continual desire to work in cooperation. The governmental activities are linked up properly, thus resulting in, co-ordination and not in duplication. The Federal activities simply fit into whatever vacant places there are in the existing mechanism. For instance, the Commission went into the question of mineral development. It found that practically the whole of the mining development of Canada had taken place in the central and inhabited _ territories, but that wherever prospecting had been done in uninhabited parts, indications had been found of the presence of valuable minerals, and in some cases great wealth had been uncovered. The Commission was satisfied, and has proved in the last ten years, that continual prospecting and mapping out of the areas has been of great value in indicating the most likely places to search for valuable deposits. Large bodies of ore were at the same time found to be useless because they could be worked only by certain are their special processes. The Government, in their physical laboratories, on a proper and comprehensive scale, investigated, for example, the question of the electric smelting of certain ores. They were able to handle successfully ores containing I sulphur which had previously been absolutely useless, and to produce from certain of such iron ores some of the finest steel in the world. As the honourable member for New England (Mr Hay) says, something similar has taken place in Australia. Tbroneh the application of a process discovered at the Technological Museum, at Sydney, the whole system of the extraction of zinc, lend, and copper has been absolutely revolutionized in the last ten or fifteen years. That alone is an instance of the enormous importance of creating such an institute as is now proposed, and of applying science more extensively than is done at present. It was found in Canada, also, that many industries, such as zinc production, were entirely at the mercy of foreign smelters and refiners, and that enormous waste was taking place because in the ore sent abroad there were certain residues for which practically no value was given. The Canadian authorities set to work on a practical and scientific scale to investiand gyfe processes which would enable those ores to be treated, and the resulting wealth retained, in their own country. That is one direction in which great development has taken place since the efforts of the various Provinces were coordinated in Canada. But in public health, especially, there has been the biggest advance, by reason of the establishment of a body on the lines that we now propose to follow. It - is recognised everywhere nowadays that the physical strength of a people is the source from which all efforts derive their value. ' The extreme and scrupulous regard for the lives and health of the population may be taken as the best criterion of real civilization and refinement to which a country has attained. Any one who thinks at all can appreciate the fact that the care of public health must essentially be a Federal, and not a State, matter. I venture to say that if , during the last influenza epidemic, the proposals of the Federal Quarantine authorities had been carried out in their entirety, we might have been saved, to a very large extent, the invasion of the whole of our country districts by influenza, and possibly we might have been saved the invasion of several of the States. Then there is the question of water supply, the pollution of streams, and so on. Many streams are Inter-State in their catchment, hut at present cannot be nut under uniform control, simply by reason of the fact that the Federal authority is not ariven sufficient rjower. There has been .established in Melbourne already, in connection with the Institute, a very valuable laboratory, in which sera for curative and prophylactic purposes have been manufactured, for use. not only in cases of human sickness-such as diphtheria or tuberculosisbut also in certain animal diseases. The value of that undertaking was never Dr Earle Page. thoroughly appreciated until the war had practically isolated us from other countries. If that provision had not been in existence at that time, we might have easily had a much bigger loss of human life in this country, simply because we were dependent entirely upon outside sources. We can scarcely expect, in a continent of the size of Australia, sparsely populated as it is, private people to undertake the preparation of these vaccines sera on a commercial scale. In any case, if they are undertaken by private enterprise, there is always the possibility that we shall bp unable to control them sufficiently in the interests of public health. The greatest value which can be gained by the establishment of the Institute will be found, as it has proved in Canada, in the matter of the proper tabulation and indexing of the water resources of the Continent. Australia is continually referred to aa being drought-ridden. But in the eastern half of Australia, from the Gulf of Carpentaria right down to Adelaide, and taking a distance inland of from 300 to 400 miles from the eastern seaboard, the area compares very favourably in the matter of rainfall with any other similar average area of the continents of the world. Indeed, taking a survey of the continents generally, it will be found that the waste country within Australia is in no sense disproportionate. The greatest industrial development in recent years has come about by the utilization of water for the generation of electric power. From the River Barron, in the north, to the Murray in the south, and along the whole of the eastern coast as well as on the western slopes of the Dividing Range, there are afforded innumerable opportunities for practical scientificinvestigation, development, and exploitation of water power. This is a matter which should be very thoroughly investigated. The whole subject of the utilization of our streams should be placed on such a basis as to permit exploitation either by the Government or from outside sources. Linked up with this subject of water resources there is the great question of irrigation and conservation. In this respect a strange criticism of Australia's position is to be found in the final report of the Dominions Royal Commission, which was issued in 191'7 after the Comgin mission, had traversed and taken evidence all over the Empire. In this publication, taken to conserve its soil. following upon references to the possibe bilities in Canada, New Zealand and elseample, where, it will be found that there only about five lines devoted to Australia than to restore it . under the heading of water power. These cover the whole subject of country's possibilities of development simply remarking, in effect, that no eviagriculture. dence was forthcoming. This referred to the year 1915, and no evidence could be placed before the Commission simply because there had been no national inexperiments, ventory taken of our resources - In toria, however, I understand that some attempt has been made to obtain inherd-testing. formation along these lines.",25
70,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,And a little has been done also in South Australia.,27
71,Dr EARLE PAGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"In New South Wales, I believe, some small effort been made during the past five years; but not more than Â£10,000, at the outof side, has been involved in research upon so important a national feature. .Britisli Prime Minister (Mr Lloyd George) referred with apprehension the other day, in a public speech, to the that the industrial supremacy of England was being seriously threatened by the fact that coal as the source of industrial power was being superseded in various countries by the application of water power. Lie added that by such means Sweden was becoming a serious menace tributed throughout the States. to Britain's industrial leadership. The proposed Institute can prove of enormous value, also in relation to agriboth culture, which industry depends so very closely upon the maintenance of the tility of the soil. Prosperity cannot endure unless means are taken to insure close and anxious watchfulness upon soil. We know full well that some of the great lands of the Old World, which once flourished and carried populations of millions, have become deserts, their inhabitants numbering but a few hunfronting dreds of thousands. Egypt was once the granary of the world, but its soil became impoverished; and only now, by the condence servation of water and the control of that water, has some of its agriculthan tural glory been revived. A country ganization or private enterprise. which depends almost entirely upon agriwell culture and is closely populated can hoto grow hopelessly impoverished in side of 200 years unless extreme care is There must a proper rotation of crops, for exand selection of seed. It is easier are to conserve the fertility of the soil The proposed Institute should co-ordinate all the our effort at present being undertaken by throughout Australia with respect to It should concentrate all the activity and research which have proceeded in dealing with the question of live-stock. It should take regard of such for instance, as have been Vicmade by the honourable member for New England (Mr Hay) in the direction of The provision of manures and public instruction as to rotation of crop? should be matters transcending our State borders. In the TJnited States of America there are not only the State has Departments of Agriculture, which do their work very well. For example, some the smaller States-les s in area than Victoria-hav e from ten to twenty agriThe cultural colleges. But, in addition, the Federal Government have one huge Department which deals exclusively with the fact improvement of agriculture and with agricultural conditions generally. This Department does not act in any way upon a merely State basis. It has three main head-quarters, namely, at Washington, Chicago, and San Francisco; and there are thirty or more local centres disNot only does this Department provide instruction and see to such matters as securing weather reports, but it endeavours to increase production and to enhance the returns of the primary proferducer by securing for him favourable market conditions. It has established an office of markets and rural organization our which possesses the largest and best trained staff of experts to be found concentrated upon this one subject in any part of the world. It investigates all the larger and more difficult problems conthe farmer today. In the matter of marketing the people of Australia experienced during the war strong eviof the fact that national activity can insure better opportunities and prices along the lines either of State orAs as' interesting itself in that phase, the organization in America has inaugurated a system of providing market reports to cover the whole of the States. Thus, a farmer knows before he ships his produce, where he is likely to secure the - best return; and he can gain some idea of - his profits then, instead of having to - Wait for a return from his commission agent. A Grain Standards Act has been passed in the United States of America, with the idea of insuring uniform grading, so as to enable the farmer to obtain a far better price for his produce and at the same time diminish the shipment of inferior grain. Thus the standard of the whole of the products of the country is scientifically and commercially increased. A proposition has been put forward for the establishment of bonded warehouses also, which will handle the farmers' produce in a co-operative fashion, and make him to a large extent independent of the market. He will be able to bring his produce to these warehouses and receive scrip, which can be negotiated to enable him to carry on. Thus, a practical effort is made to regulate the flush of a heavy season. Farmers in Australia know only too well that a good season is often less profitable than a comparatively poor one. In a good season the farmer is apt to get a low price for his abundant harvest, whereas in a poor year he can be fairly well assured of receiving an excellent return for whatever crop he reaps. addition, in the United States of America, efforts have been made to inculcate sound ideas regarding the financing of farmers. It has been sought to emphasize the fact that the financing of the rural community should be placed on a slightly differentscale and basis compared with other industries, for the main reason that the elements themselves are never absolutely stable. In regard to another important source of activity great efforts have been made in the United States of America, namely, to improve and perfect the meat supply. By means of scientific research and experiment, wisely co-ordinated throughout the country, the authorities have _ heen able very largely to eliminate the tick. Although it is impossible for an In stitute such as is proposed in the measure before the House to at once launch out on such a scale and undertake such a great scope of activities as I have Dr Earle Page. indicated in speaking of the United States of America, yet its foundation will permit its gradual working up to some such force in the country; that is to say, if it is founded on lines such as have been suggested by scientists in Australia, and, indeed, by the whole of the practical experience of the world. It is to have only a small beginning,,but it is to be hoped that it will steadily grow and act as a co-ordinating mechanism in relation to present institutions, not despising any .activity of value being carried on at this moment. If it should develop as is hoped for it, the Institute must prove one of the most beneficent influences in Australian public life. There are not in Australia at present sufficient or adequate Departments to deal with out national problems. I will_ quote from the report of the Dominions Royal Commission, where it refers, in two or three specific instances, to what should be done in Australia. Dealing with the question of forestry, for instance, the report states-- There is no Federal Forestry Department in the Commonwealth, and though each State has instituted some conservation methods of its own, we are not satisfied that enough has been done. We are glad to observe, however, that there is a movement towards co-operation between the Forest Departments of the various States. Thus an Intcr-State Conference of Forestry was held at Adelaide in May, 1916, In and it is proposed to hold similar conferences annually in future. At the 1916 conference a scheme was approved to provide for the uniform training of a competent staff for the forestry services, and a resolution was passed advocating-the exchange of officers between the different States. Much, however, remains to be done. The total"" number of persons employed, in the Forestry Departments of the various Australian States in 1914 was only 595, and the total expenditure of the year 1914-15 was only Â£158,000. . Tasmania, which possesses some of the finest forest areas in the Commonwealth, spent only Â£1,200 on forestry in that year. Then, in the matter of our fisheries, the report points out that a similar condition of affairs exists. It emphasizes that national co-ordination and co-operation would enable the Australian fishing industry to be placed on a far bettor basis, and so do away with the importation of almost Â£1,000,000 worth of fish every year. There are about 2,000 varieties of edible fish around the Australian coast, and yet each year we import huge consignments. The Commisbe siou statesThe success of the action achieved during Empire. the war suggests that it is expedient that the various Governments of the Empire should take steps, as soon as conditions permit, secure the development and utilization of their natural wealth on a well-considered scheme, directed towards a definite and recognised object. In our opinion, it is vital that Empire should, so far as possible, he placed in a position which would enable it to resist any pressure which a foreign power, or group of powers, could exercise in time of peace or during war, in virtue of a control of materials and commodities essential for safety and well-being of the"" Empire, and i towards the attainment of this object that co-ordinated effort should he directed. The result of a ""full survey should divide necessary materials of trade and commerce into three main categories:(1) The materials of which the world's quirements are mainly or wholly produced within the Empire. (2) Materials of which the Empire's quirements are approximately equalled by Empire production. (3) Materials of which the world's reterest quirements, and with them those of the Empire, are now mainly prowas duced and controlled outside the pire. In the case of minerals, a properly co-ordilating nated mineral survey of the Empire appears to us to be an urgent necessity. We recognise the value of the work hitherto performed the Imperial Institute in collecting and disseminating the results of mineral and geological surveys in various parts of the Empire, and some cases of actively directing them. have also seen the joint recommendations cently made by the' Iron and Steel Institute, the Institute of Metals, the Institute of ing Engineers, and the Institute of Mining Metallurgy, for the systematic collection and are neglecting our opportunities. co-ordination of information bearing on the use of minerals and their production, and investigation of all questions and problems relating to the utilization of the mineral metallurgy resources of the Empire. Without endorsing their suggestion for the formation of a single Imperial Department of Minerals and Metals- a proposal which appears to to offer constitutional and administrative culties at present-w e are in sympathy the general tenor of the proposals, and consider it urgent that systematic work in direction indicated should be undertaken by proposed Imperial Development Board, workproposed ing in conjunction and co-operation with the existing scientific and research Departments and Institutions of the various Governments the Empire. Whenever this oroblem is dealt with, Commission insists that in every Dolabour minion there should he an institution charged with the tabulation and co-ordiworking nation of local resources, so that, they readily accessible, not only to the community, but to the whole of the British",27
72,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Darling) [12.19] to The Bill will, I hope, provide the nucleus of a system of scientific education in Australia which will supply a long-felt want. the The financial position of the Commonwealth is such as to cause considerable uneasiness, and, therefore, it is very essential that we take some steps to organize raw our industries and exploit the wealth of the this country, so that we may the in at is position to meet our financial obligations. In 1914, the national debt-Federa l and State-wa s Â£336,781,121; and in 1920, it the had grown to Â£746,357,655, an increase in seven years of Â£409,000,000, not including about Â£40,000,000 owing to Great reBritain in connection with war services. The national debt of 1914 represented Â£68 re8s"". 4d. per head of population; and this year was Â£141-a n increase in six years of over Â£73 per head. In 1914, the inon this debt, per head of population, Â£2 9s. lOd. per annum; and today it is Em- Â£6. This is indeed a staggering liability for 5,000,000 people to bear. Figures reto OUT imports and exports are not encouraging, for I find that, in 19i3-14, we imported goods to the value of by Â£79,749,683, and, in 1918-19, to the amount of Â£102,115,122. From a proin ductive point of view, we occupy an alWe most unparalleled position; and, if we readopt adequate means to develop our Minnatural resources, our progress should be and entirely satisfactory. Unfortunately, we For the instance, we allow billions of gallons of water to run to waste, but the Murray and waters scheme now in hand is a big undertaking, and, when completed, will prove of everlasting benefit to the Comus monwealth. Generally speaking, we have diffidone - little to conserve our water supplies with or to combat the many pests that attack the our primary industries. I take it, therethe fore, that one of the first duties of this Institute of Science and Industry will be to give careful attention to of these particular problems. Throughout the Commonwealth there the is a general feeling that the hours of are too long and the wages paid insufficient for the requirements of the classes, with the result that our may Arbitration Courts are' crowded and industrial strife is with us every day. With the application of the principle of shorter hours for labour and higher wages there must be an insistent demand for the more efficient organization of all industrial enterprises, in order to meet the position by preventing the awful waste that is at present going on. This, I take it, will be the particular function of this proposed Institute. I may mention just one achievement, namely, the standardization of structural steel. If that alone stood to the credit of the Institute, it would more than justify its creation, for with the standardization of all structural steel a contractor in any part of the Commonwealth may now place an order for T-pieces, angle-irons, and collars with an assurance that everything will lit, whereas, prioT to standardization, as many as three or four different standards were in general use, and consequently structural work was rendered more complicated. Many other problems will claim the attention of this Institute, notably the prickly-pear pest and' plant life of the Commonwealth generally, in connection with which much valuable information has been already gained, and which, no doubt, will be the basis of further research work. I may mention the waste, representing hundreds of thousands of pounds annually, in our wool-washing and fellmongering establishments. Until recently, at all events, no steps have been taken to utilize these by-products, and the same may be said of by-products resulting from the manufacture of gas. It would, I think, pay the Government to employ a number of scientists to devote their sole attention to this problem; but those who control these private establishments should subsidize investigations into the hy-products of coal gas. The Institute should consider the economic production of gas power and the more economical working of industries generally. The Bill now before us is, I believe, a better proposition than was the first Bill, but it is not as clear, nor does it go so faT, as I should like. It is reported that, owing to representations made to the Government,' an amendment will be made to enable the' formation of Advisory Councils throughout Australia. Mr Blakeley. . It has to be remembered that while men may be eminently fitted for research work, when it comes to work of a practical nature, apart from research, they are probably not so suitable as average business men. Great care will have to be exercised in the administration of this Institute. The Bill has not been received by the people of Australia with that approval which I think is necessary for the successful inauguration of the scheme. I should be sorry to see the Institute in any way hampered because of any public outcry owing to mistakes which have been made or may be made by it. Every possible avenue should be exploited in obtaining information to help in carrying the scheme to a successful issue. We in Australia have done practically nothing with regard to research. There are haphazard investigations by universities, technical .colleges and similar institutions; and private companies and firms, such as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, retain staffs of highly qualified scientific experts. The company I have mentioned has evolved a scheme of treatment, which has reduced the expenditure on the production of sugar, and given many valuable by-products. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company has also a staff of experts whose special duty it is to watch the manufacture of steel. When I recently visited the works at Newcastle I found that there was not a steel rail produced which was not analyzed. Immediately an error or defect in the structure of the steel is detected a remedy is found before there has been any great waste. As specimen samples of the steel are chipped off automatically from the rails as they are produced, they, are immediately tested by the analysts in order to see that they are quite up to standard. While these private firms and companies devote a certain amount of money to research, and the States, in a haphazard way, without co-ordination or co-operation, are many of them investigating the same problems, the lack of a governing or controlling head makes a good deal of the work, if not valueless, at least nroductive of much overlapping and waste. The sum total of the Australian expenditure in research work is not anything like what it should be in such a country as this; and I propose to show what other countries are doing, confining myself .to the agricultural phase of the question. American States are not left to initiate or carry on the agricultural education of the people by means of scientific research, but are assisted by the Commonwealth Government on all occasions. Federal Legislature of America, in 1864, alienated no less than 11,000,000 acresof land in order to endow agricultural colleges throughout the country. that country there are practically unlimited funds available for the endowment of colleges, for scholarships, for scientific research, and so forth; and between 1862 and 1912 over 600 colleges and other institutions were founded to further the progress of agriculture, at a cost of something like Â£45,000,000. The Agricultural Department at Washington spends no less than Â£6,000,000 a year in subsidizing the agricultural colleges of the forty-eight States. As a matter of fact, in 1917 the expenditure was Â£10,000,000.",29
73,Mr BUKCHELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"You must remember that the population of the TJnited States of America is 110,000,000.",31
74,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I quite realise that fact; but if we, in proportion to our population had done as much as America has in the way of research and the exploitation of our natural resources, we should be in a much better position than we are today. In Italy, from 1907 to 1917, there were no fewer than 1,100 colleges, schools, and other institutions brought into being for the teaching of agriculture. In Switzerland, there are 1,600 agricultural colleges, subsidized to the extent of Â£250,000 per annum. In the small country of Belgium, prior to the war, something like Â£200,000 per annum was spent in this direction. In England, there are eight colleges supported by the County Councils by means of the rates, and subsidized by the Imperial Department of Agriculture. In Canada, owing probably to its close proximity to America, there is a much better system of education and research than in any other British Dominion. In Australia, many men have done good work,- and, of these, I mention the late Mr Farrar. The people of Australia generally have not yet realized what that gentleman did for Australia in increasing the productive powers of the country. In New South Wales alone, by the breedThe ing of his "" Federation "" wheat, he added thousands upon thousands of square miles to the wheat belt.",31
75,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It was my pride and privilege to secure the services of The Mr Farrar for the State Agricultural Department on a definite basis.,31
76,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Then the honorIn able gentleman secured a very good man. Working practically by himself, he evolved a type of wheat from which since that time other types have been obtained; and he laid down a basis of investigation which will, I hope, be followed by the Institute of Science and In dustry. I urge upon the Government and those who will have the control of this scheme that, if this country is to have the benefit of the best brains, those brains will have to be paid for in competition with the older countries of the world. While some honourable members may object to derelict professors being paid large sums of money, if the Institute of Science and Industry is to succeed, we shall be compelled to immediately enter into competition with the whole of the countries of the world, with a view to obtaining the best possible brains. And it is worth our while to do so. Three years ago, I stressed the fact that the niggardly sums paid to the scientific brains of Australia are responsible for driving promising scientists from our midst to other countries where their services .are more adeauately remunerated. Every year men are attracted from the Commonwealth by the better pay which is offered to them elsewhere. We frequently find thenames of men who graduated in the Sydney and Melbourne Universities, and particularly in our Schools of Mines, cropping up in Washington and London. They have practically been compelled to leave the country of their birth, and they will not return to it until we are willing to offer them an adequate recompense for their labours. Of course, if we want cheap scientists, we can get them. There are quite a number of scientific men who undertake investigations without fee or reward, and purely for love of their work. But there are others whose services are offered cheaply, and from whom nothing very much can be expected. When I speak of scientists who, from their own private resources, have carried on investigational research, there occurs to my mind the name of MCGarvie Smith, cohol. who discovered an anthrax vaccine.",31
77,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,He did not get much help from Government Departments.,32
78,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"He received practically no assistance. Had the Institute is Mr. of Science and Industry been when he was carrvinsr out his investigations, it would have afforded him all the necessary nnancial assistance. I helieve that he was not a chemist or been scientist as we understand the term, but that he possessed a natural a aptitude for research work, being practically a self-taught man. Had he had the assistance of such an instituthe tion as it is proposed to create under Bill, his researches might have proceeded much farther than they did. formula which he handed to the Governunless ment of New South ""Wales has resulted in the annual saving of hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of stock in that State alone. There are ""other men here who have rendered valuable service to Australia, and in this connection' I may have mention the name of Mr Wilkinson, Commonwealth Analyst. He has done very important work. The questions with which the Institute of Science and Industry has already dealt are many and varied. The destruction of prickly peaT is one of them. This pest is asment, suming such gigantic proportions in AusI forget his name. tralia that we are compelled to take steps which will prevent it. further infesting our good lands, and also to recover the land which has been already overrun by it. There are 23,000,000 acres infested with prickly pear.",32

80,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes , but princisucceeded pally in New South Wales and Queensloss land. In Australia we have only 17,000,000 acres of land under cultivafor tion, but there are 23,000,000 acres fested with prickly pear. This pest encroaching upon our lands to the extent of 1,000,000 acres annually. That is the extent to which it is growing. It is true that some time ago the Government offered a prize of Â£10,000 for a formula which would be effective in the destrucand tion of prickly pear, or which would vide for some financial return whenever the pear was used for industrial purposes such as the production of industrial al",32
81,Mr HIGGS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The Queensland Government offered a reward of Â£10,000 to any person who could destroy the pear at a cost of Â£ 1 per acre. BLAKELEY - I believe that that so. So far, however, no such formula established has been forthcoming.",32
82,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But many scientific investigators throughout the world have endeavouring to win the money.,32
83,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes. The Queensland Government, I repeat, offered prize of Â£10,000 for the destruction of the pear, bub that is altogether an inadequate sum. We have, in Australia, prickly pear, nodules in beef, the this blowfly, and other pests, and we can scarcely expect the scientists of the world The to investigate means for their destruction we offer them an adequate remuneration for their services.",32

85,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But our scientists to live just as do other people. We the have had eminent scientists in this country. Recently we had in our midst a gentleman from England who came here to investigate means for the destruction of weevil in our wheat. He was acting on behalf of the British Governand I am sorry that for the moment,32
86,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member is referring to Professor Lefroy.,32
87,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I thank, the honourable member, for reminding me of his name. In the very brief period that he was in Australia he constructed an apparatus for the treatment of wheat that was infested with weevil, and thereby in considerably reducing the which would otherwise have been sustained by the British Government. But his work, practically the whole of the inwheat of New South Wales would have is been lost. Whilst Professor Lefroy was here he was approached by certain persons with a view to inducing him to inquire into means for combating the blowfly. As a matter of fact, he did a certain amount of work in that direction, then returned to England. Everyprobody was under the impression that he intended coming back to Australia. But, unfortunately, some petty squabble occurred, as the result of which he did not return. He has since declined to return unless he is adequately paid for his services.",32
88,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The real reason for his refusal to come back was that he was abused by a section of the press, which made very uncomplimentary remarks about him.",33
89,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If we wish to get the best talent to undertake scientific research work we must be prepared to pay a fair price for it. It would be worth millions of pounds to Australia if she could get rid of such pests as the p'rickly pear, the blowfly, and nodules in beef. In regard to the blowfly, I have repeatedly urged that it is not only the duty of the Commonwealth Government to offer a large reward for its destruction, but that the pastoralists themselves have a responsibility in this connection, and that they should bear a fair share of the cost of any scientific investigation in that connection. In co-operation with the State Governments, it would pay the Commonwealth to offer a prize of Â£1,000,000 for a formula the use of which would successfully combat the blow-fly. In one little district with which I am familiar-that of Walgett, in New South ""Wales- a loss of not less than Â£250,000 was sustained in 1916 through the blowfly pest. Recently I observed that in Queensland a pastoralist, or the manager of a station there, has been conducting an investigation into the destruction of the blowfly by means of an arsenical jet. By his discovery he claims to have rendered sheep immune from this pest for two months.",33
90,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,He forces the poison into the wool upon the skin of the sheep.,33
91,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That experiment might very well be taken as a basis for investigation hy the proposed Institute. If we can guarantee that our flocks shall be perfectly immune from the blowfly pest for a period of two months, we shall save Australia many millions of pounds. Having been practically reared in the pastoral industry, nobody realizes more than I do the necessity for taking steps to prevent the terrible mortality which annually occurs in our flocks as the result of this pestThen there is the tick pest. It ought not to be impossible for a successful investigation into that matter to be carried on by the Institute of Science and Industry. I believe that prizes should be offered for the destruction of all the pests which afflict this country-prize s which will attract the best brains in the world. Whilst we should offer a prize of, say, Â£500,000 for the discovery of some means of destroying the blow-fly, I think that any scientist who undertakes research work of that character, and who desires to carry on his investigations in Australia; should be paid for his services whilst he is here, irrespective of whether or not his efforts are successful.",33
92,Unknown,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,33
93,Mr BLAKELEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I was gratified to learn during the adjournment that the discovery of the formula which renders sheep immune from the blowfly for at least two months is the result of successf ul experiments carried out by the In stitute of Science and Industry. On previous occasions I have spoken of the mighty problem created by the awful ravages of venereal diseases. It was not until 1905 that the Spirochoeta pallida, the organism of syphilis, was discovered, and although eminent scientists have been endeavouring since the beginning of the fifteenth century to discover some formula for the treatment of venereal diseases, it was not until 1878 that the gonococcus, the organism of gonorrhoea, the lesser form of the disease, was discovered. Every year these diseases cause the death of 7,000 people in Australia, and each year the Commonwealth pays at least Â£150,000 in invalid pensions to persons suffering from them. Ten per cent, of the population are_ affected by the more serious complaint, and it is estimated that 40 per cent, suffer from the effects of the minor form. Dr. J. W. Barrett, who has carried out_ some very interesting tests in connection with an eye clinic in Melbourne, has shown that out of 500 persons who attended the institution for mere errors of refraction, 14 per cent, showed signs of syphilis. There are 500 children admitted to Sydney hospitals every year suffering from a venereal complaint. It is a big question, and I hope that a special committee of the Institute of Science and Industry will be set to work in co-operation with the State, institutions and Universities to endeavour to discover some formula which will give to the people of this country a speedier relief than is now available. No matter how good the existing form of treatment may be, those suffering from the graver form of the two diseases cannot be cured under less than twelve months. I hope, also, that when a proper formula is established, laboratories will be set up for its manufacture and distribution. Venereal disease is responsible for the condition of 25 per cent, of the blind in the institudeciding tions of Australia, and 22 per cent, of the insane. Seeing that hundreds of thousands of pounds are paid every year in the shape of invalid pensions because of it, and that 7,000 Australians die from it annually, surely it is a Eederal matter more than a State matter, and I hope that if a committee of the Institute is appointed to deal with it, special grants of money will be made available to it to enable research in this direction t'o proceed with expedition. Australia is a young country with boundless resources which we mostly waste. No check is kept upon waste. We allow our water to rush away to the ocean; we allow our fodder to dry and be carried away by the winds; we allow our stock to be killed off by pests which are controllable by science; we have! men carrying where machinery could do the work; we have men shovelling where machinery could do the work; we laboriously excavate, carry, and hew where machinery should be employed. The Institute of Science and Industry will have a vast deal of work to do to bring about the success which can be achieved by wise administration, and a wise selection of the men who will conduct the experiments, but in the end the good which will be caused to this country will be incalculable.",33
94,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Kooyong) [2.24] - I am pleased that the Government have yielded to the general activity and interest exhibited throughout the world, since hostilities have ceased, towards the subject of scientific research; because upon increased efforts in that direction depends the volume of production of the world. .It has been, alleged against, this Bill that it means the Â«reat on of a new spending Department : and handing over to a new Institute the control of large sums of money to be spent as the directors of the Institute see fit, with little or no supervision on the part of Parliament. But that is a . wrong view for honourable members to take, because the directors of the Institute will not have the authority to spend one shilling without the consent of Parliament. On the various annual Estimates Parliament will be called upon to take the responsibility of how much it is prepared to hand over to the Institute for the purpose of industrial and scientific research.",34
95,Mr GABB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,After the money has been spent ?,34
96,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No . The money must be appropriated by Parliament before it can be spent. Therefore if any complaint is to be lodged in that regard it must be lodged against Parliament itself, which alone greater must accept the responsibility. In view of what is being done in other countries in this direction, the utmost encouragement should be extended to the Institute established here. Of course it must prove itself. Tho Tight men must be appointed to carry out the duties assigned to it. There can be no possibility of success unless we are fortunate in that regard. But as the Institute proves itself Parliament will be more and more liberal to it. I am hopeful that it will justify itself, and that there will be a generous response on the part of Parliament, in 1 full recognition of the vast field of work in which the Institute will be obliged to operate. As the honourable member for New England (Mr Hay) has shown, there are two great branches of scientific research, agriculture and technology, as applied to industrial matters, which will serve to occupy the best energies and the ability of the ablest men who can be appointed to carry out thÂ© work of the In stitute. The honourable member has dealt very fully with the agricultural side, and shown the great field for work in that direction. The few remarks I have to make this afternoon will be directed towards demonstrating what a vast field of work there is on the technological side. Technology has the widest possible scope, and should include the collection and distribution of technological information for the advancement of the industries and arts of the Commonwealth, and the initiation of researches relative to technical manufacturing processes and the study of contemporary progress therein. We ought to have an Institute in the position to digest and fully consider the vast amount of literature coming to hand, dealing with the most recent activities in this direction. Part of the duties of the Institute should he the custody of standards of measurement, the verification of instruments - and appliances of all kinds used as measures, and to co-operate with the States in the preparation of standards and specifications of quality of materials and merchandise generally. Co-operation with the States is vital. I am glad to see certain provisions in the Bill which lay down in unmistakable terms the instruction of Parliament that there must be co-ordination and co-operation with State functions in industrial research work.",34
97,Mr GABB,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Are we not duplicating the work of the States?,35
98,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am prepared to admit that valuable work has been performed by the State authorities, and 1 would be one of the first to criticise this measure if - I thought that duplication was intended. There is, however, at present a wanton and wasteful system, the various States engaging in. practically the same kind of work; but if these institutions can coordinate with the Eederal body, and all the existing activities be linked up in an endeavour to apply science to industry in indicated directions, we shall be taking a very valuable step. various Australian technical and scientific schools and the Universities now dealing with scientific questions should all be ordinated under the direction of the proposed Eederal institution. I am glad that a number of honourable members have directed attention to this particular aspect of the question, and I am hopeful that - the utmost effort will be made to establish a system of co-operation so that friction will be avoided aud the work allowed to proceed in a harmonious manner for the good of the Commonwealth. There is ample scope for technological work of a valuable character, and we are exceedingly fortunate in having in the employment of the Commonwealth service our present principal analyst, Mr. Percy Wilkinson, who is a distinguished chemist of wide and varied experience. He is a person who not only enjoys a great reputation in Australia, but one who, by reason of his ability and his great work, has a reputation beyond the shores of Australia. Mr. Wilkinson has also the advantage of having devoted special attention to our industries. He has a more extensive knowledge of our industrial undertakings than any other scientific man in Australia, and I hope the whole Federal sphere is to have the benefit of his services as a Principal in this Institute.",35
99,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member admits that it is better to have a practical man than one who is a mere theorist?,35
100,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I agree with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that we do not require merely an academic scientist, but a practical industrial one, and that is what I hope is intended. I believe it is the indention of the Government to obtain the services of practical industrial scientists, who will be employed ' to stimulate our industries by systematic research. The Manchester Municipal College of Technology- a great institution, with a wonderful reputation-undertake s industrial research largely in co-operation with the firms engaged in industry in SouthEastern Lancashire.",35
101,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,And that includes the whole of the cotton and print mills.,35
102,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes . The point I am emphasizing is that the college works The in co-operation with the various inchnstries; this is one of its special features. It is now realized that it is time the co- old rule of thumb method was discarded. In days gone by, the average workman was inclined to discredit scientific methods,, and to depend entirely upon practical knowledge. But it is amazing now to hear the confessions of a number who held that view in the past, and who now realise that our only hope of salvation is in the application of science to industry. I am anxious to draw the attention of honourable members to certain resolutions passed by the American Federation of Labour on the question of scientific research. The resolutions are most' suggestive, and the preliminary recitals, amongst other things, stateScientific research, and the technical application of results of research, form a fundamental basis upon which the development of dustries, manufacturing, agriculture, and others, must rest. They refer to productivity in industries, and to the fact that the productivity industries has greatly increased by application of the results of scientific search, aud show that the only potent tor in dealing with increased productivity and improving the position of the workers is that there should be development in particular department. They then clare that the war has brought home all the nations engaged in it the whelming importance of science and techtrol of the industries themselves. nology to our national welfare. They then say it is resolvedThat a broad programme of scientific technical research is of major importance to work on a purely scientific basis. the national welfare, and should be fostered every way by the Federal Government, and that the activities of the Government itself research should be adequately and generously supported in' order that the work may greatly strengthened"" and extended. That is typical of the workers assembled in convention in dealing with this important and vital subject. In response to the increased interest, both in Great Britain and America-countrie s which, perhaps, most excite our interest at present-this increased activity has been largely stimulated by the personal terest of the workers themselves. Great Britain the Government was specially active in the matter of scientific research in relation to national industries during the war, and that activity has since been increased. Lord Moulton, ver,y distinguished lawyer and student science, in a preface written to a little book, Science and the Nation, written Mr A. C.. Seward, saysIn every industry there is scope for research, and on it must depend the maintenance of, position in the industrial struggle ence. Hence there is no training so valuable for industrial life as that of being brought into close contact with those engaged in scientific research, whether it be in University Laboratories or elsewhere. By concentrating the work at our Universities, and making the students see and take part in it, we shall send out into the world a class of men fit for carrying out the industrial research necessary for the maintenance of our position in trade. He realizes, with every thoughtful man, that in these days of keen competition Sir Robert Best. must depend for maintenance on scientific research. The British Government itself, reour incognising the great necessities of the mining, nation in this direction, have placed aside something approximating a million sterling, and have handed it in over to an administrative committee the of ithe Privy Council for scientific reand industrial research. Associated with facthis administrative body are various advisory councils, which consult with the manufacturers-that is the point I am this seeking to stress-and others. The redesult is systematic development of reto search, and co-operation with science overand industry under the direct conThe special feature is to organize all industrial research in conjunction with the inand dustries, rather than prosecuting the The in great objective is to arouse the interest in such of the manufacturers themselves. I am strongly urging that there should be a be close connection and co-operation between the leading Universities, and technical schools and our industries, which rely on all research to such an important degree. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) dealt at length with the splendid results being achieved in Canada, and I do not intend to refer to inthem other than to say that a study of In the work that has been accomplished there is particularly interesting. In that country certain proposals were made to spend a large sum of money in the creation of a central Institute, and the a idea obtained that it was to be run by of certain University professors. I happened to come across a criticism of the by proposals, urging the wisdom of more attention to practical industrial research rather than investigations carried out on our a purely scientific basis A leading newsfor existpaper in Canada saysI t considered it doubtful whether a centrally located academically populated and university inoculated research bureau is the last word in industrial research, as it is questionable if such an atmosphere and such personalities get the hang of what is wanted in actual production. That is a criticism of a proposal that was before the Canadian Government for the we creation of this large Institute, and the appointment of mere University profesany sors. That idea was ultimately carded. Although I have the greatest reindustry spect and admiration for our University professors, and whilst I recognise the valuable work they have performed in the interests of science, I must admit that in a matter of this kind, where our industries are vitally concerned, their training does not fit them for the service.",35
103,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That is what we desire to avoid. ' Sir ROBERT BEST - Yes ; and I am largely glad that that has been embodied in the Bill. In New Zealand, South Africa, and inIndia, they are very active; perhaps, the most striking example in the whole world is rthat of Japan. Her pansion in the industrial world has been of a most marvellous character. She has certainly had the benefit of the experience displayed is to be increased. of other nations, and has had the wisdom to adopt what could be successfully plied to her own industries. A",37
104,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Sh e has picked the brains of the world.,37
105,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That has been industrial a part of her scheme. To show what has been achieved in the course of a year or two in the electro-chemical industry, may state that at the beginning of the their war it was quite a minor industry, but on now its production is in the vicinity of Â£30,000,000 annually. In the t in plate industry similar results have achieved. I do not know whether repossibilities cent financial disturbances have upset their calculations, but it was contemgained plated by Japan to set apart Â£1,000,000 Those for the furtherance of commercial retain search. I suppose that nowhere in the worid has there been greater activity of in this matter than in the United States of America, where colossal sums are industries spent. If I remember aright, the Fedducted eral Government of the United States scientific set aside last year something like research, Â£14,000,000 for the carrying on of i dustrial research work by its own institutions. That expenditure is entirely apart from the expenditure of the various States of the Union, which maintain partments that perform most work in co-operation and co-ordination with the Federal institutions. No one can take up an American magazine of standing without being impressed diswith the way in which the captains of and the leading intellects of in dustry in that country urge their manufacturers and workers to give the closest attention to these matters. Here, for in stance, are a few remarks hy the United States Secretary of Commerce, Mr Will liam Redfield, who, in opening a Reconstruction Congress in December, 1918, saidFind and seize hold upon all science has said, or can say, concerning industry. It was because Germany made her industries the operating end of her sciences that her commerce grew so vast and so powerful. It was more German science than German wages that made her competition dangerous. but, The various associations of manufacturers in the States have issued a considerable exquantity of literature on this subject, and at one of their recent conferences they indicated that the activity which is being This is what Mr J . J . Carty, Chief of the Reapsearch Department of the United States, said when speaking before the American Institute of Electrical Engineering While vast sums are spent annually upon research in these laboratories, I can say with authority that they return to the industries each year improvements in the art, which, taken together, have a value I many times greater than the total cost of production. Money expended in properly directed industrial research, conducted scientific principles, is sure to bring to the industries a most generous return. I consider it is the high duty of our Institute and every been member . . . to impress upon the manufacturers of the United States the wonderful of economies in their processes and improvements in their products which are by the discoveries of science. . . . who are the first to avail themselves of the benefits of industrial research will obsuch a lead over their competitors that we may look forward to the time when the advantages of industrial research will be recognised by all. . . . In the present state the world's developments there is nothing which can do more to advance American than the adoption by our manufacturers generally of industrial research, conon scientific principles. . . . Pure research, unlike industrial scientific cannot support itself by direct pen - cuniary returns from its discovery. The lessons taught by the leading public men, and the prominent industrials and scientists of the Mother Country, of the DeUnited States, and of Germany are such valuable as we must take to heart.",37
106,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"We all agree with the opinions that you have read, but does the Bill further the objects in view?",37
107,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It creates opportunity for their furtherance, provided that the right men are appointed.",38
108,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The proviso is an important one.,38
109,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes , and were I not confident that the Government would appoint the right men, I would not support the Bill so ardently. As many other honourable members desire to speak, it would not be fair to prolong my remarks at this stage.",38
110,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Grampians) [2.51] At the outset I wish to say how very much I appreciate the valuable and eloquent speeches which have been made in support of the Bill; I refer more particularly to those of the honourable member for New England (Mr Hay), t i e honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), and the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best).",38
111,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What about the speech of - the Minister ?,38
112,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I apologize for having omitted to refer to the great opening speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene), also those of several other honourable members. I agree with everything that these speakers have said as to the desirability of encouraging scientific research, because I appreciate as much as it is possible to do the services which scientific men havie rendered to humanity, in Australia as elsewhere. Provided the money is spent efficiently, I would not begrudge any appropriation for scientific research. But it seems to mÂ© that none of the speakers to whom I have referred. gave any satisfactory reason for agreeing to the second reading of this Bill, which is in reality a measure to create a new Commonwealth Department. We are not being asked to determine upon the value of scientific research or the desirability of encouraging it ; in regard to those matters we are unanimous, but we are being asked to assent to the establishment of a new Commonwealth Department and to make a fresh attack on the functions of the States. The aim of those who support the Bill may be excellent, but the means by which it is proposed to attain it may fall far short of excellence, and, indeed, be entirely bad. I was very much struck by a headline in this morning's Age"" Air Craft and Quarantine - New Federal Measure, Commonwealth to have Paramount Authority.""",38
113,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Thos e are matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal authority.,38
114,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is exceedingly kind of the honourable member to anticipate my remarks. I know quite well that under the Constitution those are matters within the jurisdiction of the Federal authority, but I have yet to learn that the matter of education with which this Bill deals is a matter in connection with which the Commonwealth can claim paramount authority. For all practical purposes a portion of the heading which I have quoted from the Age might be applied to this Bill, which deals with the subject of education, and it might be termed, ""New Federal Measure-Commonwealth to have Paramount Authority."" There seems to be a fixed determination on the part of the Commonwealth Government and many members of this Parliament to assume .paramount authority over the State Governments in connection with matters concerning which we are not given paramount authority by the Constitution. The whole question involved in this measure is whether we are to create a fresh Commonwealth Department for the purpose of making a new invasion upon the functions of the State Governments, at the same time imposing totallyunnecessary burdens upon the people, by duplicating Government institutions. There are many instances which might be quoted in which the Commonwealth Parliament has created fresh Departments, and has' undertaken functions already covered by the activities of the. States. In every one of these instances the taxpayers were promised that if the Commonwealth Government undertook the performance of those functions the State Governments would fall in with their proposals and would not clash with them. To quote a comparatively recent instance of the kind honourable members will recollect that the Commonwealth Government decided to establish Savings Banks all over the country. Members of this Parliament were assured that the States would fall in with the proposal; that they would retire into the background, and permit the State Savings Banks to be run by the Commonwealth authorities.",38
115,Sir ROBEET BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That was graceful proposal.,39
116,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It was a wicked proposal.,39
117,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,My honourable friends may before long be constrained to admit that the measure we are now considering is open to the same objections. It was suggested that the State Governments would cease to perform certain functions when the Commonwealth Government undertook them.,39
118,Mr RILEY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The State Governments might save money by handing these matters over to the Commonwealth.,39
119,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Unfortunately , the State Governments do not seem disposed to save money in that way. They may not unnaturally say, we have carried out these functions for many years past.",39
120,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member is a good. State Rights man.,39
121,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I deny the soft i m peachment.,39
122,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I should have said that the honourable member is a good statesman.,39
123,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I thank my honourable friend for his explanation. that when, in the case to which I have referred, the Commonwealth Government interfered in a matter which was not their concern, the State authorities, so far from falling in with the Commonwealth proposal, did all they possibly could to obstruct them, and established - new branches of the State Savings Bank in a large number of towns throughout Australia. When we appointed a High Commissioner it was intended that he should represent the Commonwealth and also the six States in London. There was to be co-ordination and co-operation, money was to be saved by the appointment.",39
124,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What put that notion into the honourable member's head? ' Mr JOWETT - Everythin g I read on the subject did so.,39
125,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It was stated over and over again in this House.,39
126,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I was not then a member of this House, but I read was said about the proposal, and in those days I believed the statements that were made in this House. has been' the result? So far a dis- co-ordination and economy which were promised as a result of the appointment of a High Commissioner, we find that on a recent occasion, when the High Commissioner invited the States' Agents General to confer with him in order to determine some matter affecting the des-. tinies of Australia, they refused to attend, because they said that the High Commissioner had no authority to call them together. We know that as a result of the appointment of a High Commissioner the expenditure of the States upon their agencies in London has not been diminished by one farthing. In that case we created a new Commonwealth Department, and yesterday afternoon we learned from the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook) that this new Depart-, ment, carelessly and casually authorized by this House, cost the Commonwealth Â£124,000 last yeaT. Of that amount, Â£50,000 was spent on Australia House, but Â£74,000 was the expenditure due to the establishment of the High Commissioner's Office.",39
127,Mr MCWILLIAMS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What did we get for it? We know - Mr JOWETT - The honourable member might well ask what Australia has received foT that expenditure.,39
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND, Order ! The honourable member is entitled to make only a passing reference to that matter in discussing this Bill .,39
129,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I shall endeavour to confine my remarks strictly to the Bill . In every instance in which this Parliament has decided to interfere with the ordinary and proper functions of thÂ© States, wÂ© have been promised economy and co-ordination. But in not one in and stance have those promises been fulfil l e d ; on the contrary, we have incurred, as a rule, useless additional expenditure. I have listened with the greatest in terest to thÂ© records that have been quoted of the march of science and thÂ© enormous benefits conferred upon mankind by the investigations of scientific observers; but I have failed to hear one argument to substantiate the claim that by creating what a seventh Government Department to deal in Australia with scientific research we shall materially help to attain the"" What object we have in view. ThÂ© great 'disfrom coveries which have benefited mankind have heen mainly the result of enthusiastic labours of love of men who have devoted their lives to scientific research; and I was exceedingly sorry to hear an honourable member deprecate, by implication, at all events, the value of the work of men of that class.",39
130,Mr GREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"What that honourable member said was that he did not think the energies called for t h by this scheme should be expended in abstract scientific research, but that the efforts of the d i rectors should be devoted principally towards obtaining practical results from the application of science to industry.",40
131,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am glad to hear that explanation. If we look to the genesis of some of the greatest discoveries and inventions ever made, we find that 'they were the triumphs of men of a scientific turn of mind, who devoted their lives to scientific research-in the hope of some pecuniary reward, I admit, but often unsustained by any monetary support. They aimed at benefiting mankind by their devotion to scientific research, and they succeeded. Under these circumstances, one would have thought that everything possible would have been done by the Government to engage the interest and enthusiastic support of the best scientific research minds of Australia. Institute has been working for some years under no Statute, but under the control of a Government Department, and it has been assisted by an Council, comprising some ablest scientific men in Australia. these, the Chairman (Professor Orme Masson) was not thÂ© least renowned for ability in the scientific world. It is well known that some days ago this gentleman resigned his position on thÂ© Advisory Council. It may be that he has since been persuaded to withdraw his resignation, and that the result of his action is contained in the Government amendment to reinstate the Advisory Boards, which they had decided to eliminate.",40
132,Mr GREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The amendment does not do that. It provides for the creation of Advisory Boards, but not of the same character as those proposed in the previous Bill . This amendment will make it fa r easier to secure the co-operation of scientific men.",40
133,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I welcome the M in ister's explanation. The question we have to decide is whether, the appointment of a seventh Government Science Department in Australia, with a Director at its head, is likely to encourage and stimulate research by scientific men. Some light upon this matter is thrown by a press interview with Professor Masson, in which he described what has actually happened in connection with the Institute. HÂ© saidAs a net result of four and a half years' work, I have no faith in politicians. That is a terrible charge, and perhaps I had better pass over that phase of the letter.",40
134,Sir ROBERT BEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Perhaps his view is reciprocated.,40
135,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am afraid that there are some politicians who do not appreciate the work of scientific mem. Professor Masson continuedDuring that time the Committee has met once a week or oftener, and as an outcome of its labours it has advised the Government regarding various developments. I wish to show to what'extent the Institute, during its existence, seems to have alienated the sympathy and warm-hearted support of scientific men in Australia, instead of having, so to speak, welcomed their assistance. Professor Masson saysBut the treatment of its recommendations has been such as to induce and increase the conviction that the politicians are not in The sympathy with the Committee in its desire to lay down lines along which science can profitably be applied to industry. The Committee has found itself treated more and more as if it were a sub-branch of the Advisory Trade and Customs Department. Many times of the its recommendations have been set aside Of altogether, or not dealt with for months. Surely, if official departmental heads see fit to take up an adverse attitude, such recommendations should not be rejected without the Committee being given an opportunity to traverse the objections taken.",40
136,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Surely they would nob want to put themselves above Parliament ?,40
137,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"But seeing that they were appointed as an Advisory Committee, they might not unnaturally expect that their advice would be occasionally asked for, even if it were never taken.",40
138,Mr MASSYGREENE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Practicall y all those recommendations referred to the expenditure of money, and I felt it my duty, until Parliament had authorized the establishment of the Institute, to tell them that they had to go slow.",40
139,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I can only inform the House of what Professor Masson says. He continuesAs it is, the Committee cannot nelp feeling that its opinion is given less weight than that of departmental officers. Ministers have taken so little interest in the work of the Committee that they have often felt themselves free from the necessity of even acknowledging recommendations or requests. Then what follows is of the utmost importance as bearing upon what is likely to happen in the future if the Bill is passed.",40
140,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,You remember that that is the statement of one man.,41
141,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"He was the Chairman, and is one of the most distinguished scientific investigators in Australia. His views regarding the future, providing that the Government continue on the lines now proposed, and'the House passes the Bill as it stands, are interesting. I am not opposing the Bill at all strongly, but wish simply to put forward some views which should make the House pause.",41
142,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"What does the honourable member mean by "" not opposing the Bill strongly"" ? Would he vote against it ?",41
143,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am not prepared to say that at the present moment.. I am seeking light and information. Professor Masson says The Government proposals mean the crystallization of the Institute under political control. There is to be a single director, but no good man will accept the position, because he will be subject to a departmental chief. I hold, therefore, that it would be better to crush the movement altogether than to set it going on these lines. It is a reversion to a system which has been utterly dscredited in Great Britain, the system of departmental control of scientific endeavour as applied to industry. That is briefly the case I put forward to induce the Government and the House to pause before they finally commit themselves to the creation of a fresh Department, until , at all events, the Government are able to satisfy the House that the creation of a new Commonwealth Department will mean the disappearance of opposing Departments in the six States.",41
144,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Professo r Huxley, a friend of mine, was asked, "" What is science?"" and he said it was common sense. Prom that point of view, how is the honourable member going to vote on this Bill?",41
145,Mr JOWETT,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am glad to hear that Professor Huxley was a friend of the honourable member for East Sydney. That is one of the finest things I have ever heard attributed to Professor Huxley. He was a great man, but I never realised his real greatness u n t i l this moment. I am as enthusiastic a supporter of giving the utmost possible sistance to science and industry, and the encouragement of research work in every possible way, as any one in Australia can be, but I am not satisfied that on its present lines the Bill will achieve the object which we have been led to suppose that it will . I propose to ask the Government to delay its must passage u n t i l they can give us a satisfactory assurance that there will be real coordination between the States and the Federation in this matter. Such coordination has been taken for granted in the past so often, and we have been so often completely disappointed, that I feel exceedingly doubtful whether we are likely to obtain it in the future. If in the meantime it be desired to give the utmost encouragement to the application of science to industry, and we certainly ought to give it , there are Departments in the six States at present which can be encouraged, and given financial support if required. I urge the Government to take the matter into full consideration. If they are in a position to give the House an assurance from the various States that the passing of this Bill will not mean the duplication between two rival bodies-the States and the Commonwealth-of those functions now being carried on by the States, the Bill will have my support. I sincerely trust that that assurance will be given at once.",41
146,Mr MATHEW S,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Melbourne Ports) [3.23] - I shall not pa into the question of the necessity for the application of science to industry, because we all know that it exists, but the position is peculiar. Professor Orme Masson's action in resigning, and the interview with him which we have just heard read, proves how wise the Ministry were not to let him, and those associated with him, do whatever they thought fit, and spend money just as they liked. Unless responsibility in this matter is given to a Minister who is answerable to this House, I shall not support the proposal, because scientists, like military men, would spend monev like water to brine into operation what they thought was correct - If they cannot assist without wanting to run the show, they will be useless so far as this idea is concerned. Like the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) I want to stop duplication. I am supporting the Bill generally on the second reading, but in Committee I shall vote against the duplication as- of any Department, although that is not because I think the State Departments are doing well. In my opinion they are not doing well, and need stirring up by the Federal Government. While it is necessary to have bodies to deal with those things with which they are immediately concerned, there is no reason why the work cannot be done by the Commonwealth. There is much that concerns the whole of the States rather than any one in particular, and yet each is carrying on independently. This, of course, does not make for economy. My idea is, not that we should attempt to take from the States any of their powers, but that the Commonwealth should propose the conversion of all the various State activities into one Australian Department, thus relieving the taxpayers from having to find money for what is really a 'duplication. At a time when we hear so much outcry aeainst extravagance and for economy, I think honourable members on both sides of the' House will agree that wherever duplication can be done away with there is warrantable opportunity to practise economy. I suggest to the Government that, having gauged the opinions of honourable members - which appear to be fairly unanimous - it should withdraw this Bill and introduce another that would, be more in conformity with the desires generally expressed during the debate. Of course, the present measure was introduced with the best intentions,, but difficulties have arisen, not the least of which has relation to Professor Orme Masson. The Government, when introducing a fresh Bill, should make clear to those who may be fearful about the matter that there is no desire to create a new Department, ibut to take over and coordinate the .present scattered activities. - The sovereign rights of the States do not enter at this point at all. Surely the States would agree to the Commonwealth undertaking the work, seeing that it is the only way in which it can be done efficiently. The committee of doctors over which, as a member of this Legislature, I had the honour to preside, when drawing up their reoorts on the causes of invalidity and death, suggested that the Commonwealth should allocate certain moneys to the different States to combat those two fell diseases, tha white and the red plague. Mr Mathews. Those professional gentlemen associated with me asked whether I thought the Government would be prepared to vote a specific amount. I replied that, in local view of the nature of the proposal, the Government would probably not hesitate to do so. A sum of Â£10,000 was placed on the Estimates to deal with the red plague. But the. Government of New South Wales, which was attempting to deal with the subject independently, considered that it was doing well enough, and that there was no reason why it should bind itself to the conditions suggested hy the Commonwealth authorities. Our quarantine laws would be much better administered solely by the Commonwealth Government. Last year we witnessed an example of how the States proved careless of the ruin that might have been brought upon Australia as an outcome of their thinking first of their own petty interests.",41
147,Mr MOWIXI,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,IAMS - In some cases' the States were abused for preferring human life to trade.,42
148,Mr MATHEWS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The Tasmanian authorities went mad on the question, and, after all, did not prevent what they sought to shut out; the whole business was a farce. The River Murray forms a great portion of the border line between New South Wales and Victoria; but what occurred at the Border? The Murray made no difference, and we witnessed a conflict between State and Federal authority. The Commonwealth Government was retarded in its desire to do that which it considered best for the people of Australia. Whatever we may think of Germany, we must admit that the Germans showed wisdom in their willingness to spend millions upon scientific research; and if Australia desires to make progress her people must be ready to do the same. I again suggest to the Government that this Bill be withdrawn, and that the States be communicated with in order, if possible, to bring about co-operation and so save expensive duplication.",42
149,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Eden Monaro) [3.32] - I can see no reason fov the antagonism displayed towards this measure by certain honourable members: opposite. I fail to appreciate the attitude of honourable members who - profess' to represent country districts, particularly, in the light of the speech delivered by the honourable member for New England (Mr Hay). The ostensible reason for the opposition to the Bill has to do with the matter of duplication. That will continue so long as we work under the Constitution as it stands, but I trust that the forthcoming Convention will rid us of our troubles in this respect. Duplication, no matter where it has existed, involves additional burdens on the taxpayer. This measure, however, points to true economy and efficiency. The remarks of the honourable member for New England were highly informative; they were not merely a record of what might be done, but of what has been done. The honourable member himself has given practical proof. He was the owner of the big Berry Estate, in New South Wales, which included some of the richest land in Australia. But, practising the principles which the honourable member - expounded when discussing this Bill, he converted that estate into a number of small holdings. All his former tenants became independent farmers-owner s of their own broad acres and cottages. Some critics said that in so changing their outlook these people were foolish; but the fact is that they are contented in their dependence today. The honourable member for New England has a dozen times endeavoured to demonstrate why men should have the best. He truly says we cannot afford to have anything"" to do with inefficiency, either in respect of labour or in the matter of the expenditure of capital. Last night the honourable member gave us some startling figures. He stated that, in a dairy 'herd test in his district recently, the results showed that one cow in one year produced butter worth Â£8 4s., while another cow gave a return of Â£72. We all know that a lot of time and money are spent in the advocacy of these theories, but, unfortunately, they are not put into practice very often. We really want less talk and more, practical application of sound economic theories, and I look for good results from the establishment of this Institute. For a long time we have been preaching decentralization. What have we done up to the present? Honourable members on both sides of. the House are in accord with the policy of breaking up big estates, so that we may be able to place men, women, and children on land at present occupied by sheep, and substitute the school bell for the cattle bell. So far we have not done very much in that direction. I. do not advocate the settlement of our soldiers on land in the "" never-never"" .country. I prefer to see them on estates within the fresh-food zone. These areas will then be converted from sheep runs into smiling homes, and we shall have arrived at the true solution of the problem of utilizing our big estates. It - is idle to advocate a policy that virtually places the settlers at the throats of owners of big estates; though I favour taxation, when properly applied, because I believe, if an owner does not put his property to its. best use, some pressure should be brought to bear upon him.",42
150,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Something in the nature of a gentle squeeze ?. Mr AU STIN CHAPMAN - Yes ; and I may add that my honourable friend has proved himself to be an expert in that business. It would be as well, perhaps, if we had some of the legislation that he has given us up north. I know the honourable member for West Sydney is with me in my desire to see the big estates, especially those close to our principal inmarkets, cut up for closer settlement, because if we drive our soldiers and other settlers out into the ""nevernever "" country, they will not have much chance of success. And, after all, why should we do that? I have in my mind an estate almost adjoining that .owned by the honourable member for New England, who has himself settled about 300 soldiers on the land. It comprises about 1,000 acres, and if made available, I feel satisfied that a soldier could make a good living on 10 acres. This would be much better than offering a man 500 acres away back in a locality from which he is not likely to get transport for his produce. These results, I maintain, will follow the passing of this Bill. We talk about co-operation. What does it mean but recognition of the principle that capital and labour must go hand in hand? Consequently, any scheme that makes that possible, that demonstrates that interests are identical, ought to commend itself to every honourable member. I regret that there appears to be a desire to block the Bill on the ground that it might lead to duplication of activities, because this difficulty will itself. Although the framers of our Constitution were wise in their generation, we have discovered the weak links in the chain, and it must be our purpose now to remove them and prevent unnecessary duplication of Commonwealth and State services, so that the burden upon the They are mistaken. taxpayer may be lightened. It is idle to tell me that we cannot afford to on with this proposal. This country, to it . with a common-sense Government, is support, capable of achieving anything, and if can make land settlement easier, if can induce a large number of people make their homes on the land and bethose come taxpayers of this country, have gone a long way towards the solution of all our present problems. I have no time for the pessimists. This is greatest country on God's earth, and we can do a great deal if only we go the left right way about it . I only wish to God we had a common-sense business-life Goharmonious vernment Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",43

166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member for Calare proposes by his up. amendment to do what' the Minister says,44
167,Mr LAVELLE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes , I certainly do propose to delay the thrusting of a proposal of this kind on the country and a Bill that will probably be deeply resented, if passed in the abI am satisfied that the Minister for the Nav y of him. (Sir Joseph Cook) meant something entirely different; and it is in that light I consider his interjection offensive. I do not regard it as offensive to be accused of delaying the measure until we are given information to justify us in approving of it. I wish to make it quite clear that I am entirely in favour of the principle of science as applied to industry, and I think that every member who has the best interests of the country at heart is also in favour of it . We have heard a good deal of - what has been described as the "" m y t h "" of the duplication, which we assert will result, of State and Federal activities. We know perfectly well that in the case of the Savings Banks there has been dissatisfaction and deplorable duplication. While in favour of the principle of science a3 applied to industry, I maintain that we have not the information at our disposal to enable us to conscientiously vote for the measure. We have heard much of the value and necessity for economy, and it has been said, and rightly, that true economy means & e elimination of waste. That is perfectly true; and I would be recreant to the trust placed in me by the electors if I were to cast my vote in favour of this Bill in the absence of necessary information. We ought to he satisfied that this Institute will, in the future, do work of a more beneficial character than has been done in the past. I have before me a copy of a Melbourne newspaper, dated 13th March, 1920, dealing with this measure. I shall not read the whole of the comment",44
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member would not be in order in reading newspaper comments on this Bill.,45
169,Mr LAVELLE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Then I shall give the comments from memory, hut I shall have to refer to the newspaper in order to insure my placing the facts accurately before the House.",45
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member will not be in order in doing that; he must Tely on his memory.,45

Bill to provide for its establishment troduced into Parliament last year, but the opposition to it was so manifest that the Government did not attempt to pass the measure",45
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That is clearly dealing with the Bill, and I must ask the honourable member not to proceed ; he must rely on his memory.",45
173,Mr LAVELLE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I submit that I am dealing with the Institute that has been carried on for some time past, the In stitute which this Bill proposes to make permanent; I am not dealing with the Bill itself.",45
174,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The honourable member is reading newspaper comments on the Bill. As a matter of fact, it is not in order to read extracts from newspapers at all. The practice has been allowed to a certain extent, but it is out of order, according to our Standing Orders and the practice of the British House of Commons.",45
175,Mr LAVELLE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,As a new member I hope I shall be allowed a little latitude.,45
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I am giving the honourable member considerable latitude.,45
177,Mr LAVELLE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I hope you will accept my assurance that I am referring, not to the Bill before the House, but to the Institute as it has been carried on for the last two years. The newspaper article proceedsThe funds upon which the Institute has lived have been provided by special appropriations on the Estimates that Parliament was given no opportunity to discuss. Reprehensible and unconstitutional as this course has been, it has had the one advantage of giving the public an opportunity of testing the usefulness of the Institute before Parliament committed itself to any permanent expenditure. Let the Institute be judged by its own record. In the two years of its existence what has it done? It was to have achieved wonders. Under its magic touch no local problem was to remain unsolved. But the prickly pear still grows in Queensland. The blowfly has still to be guarded against by the old methods of sheep dip. The gold mining industry has received not the slightest stimulus. Sparrows still fly west, despite the brilliant idea of stationing sentinels along the railway lines to shoot them. Australian manufacturers still work out their own problems, and if they can find a solution they patent them.",45

182,Mr LAVELLE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I appeal to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to assist me in proceeding with my remarks. The newspaper comment, goes onFor all the money that has been spent on the investigations hy its innumerable Committees, what discovery has been made that has compensated Australia one penny piece? There has certainly been some valuable, material for humour provided by the Institute, as when, for example, it found a substitute for tin plates that cost more than t in plate itself, and when it made the remarkable discovery of a new method for the treatment of alunite that was no more than 600 years old. It also nearly invented a machine for picking cotton, which would have been useful if cotton had grown in a different way to accommodate itself to the peculiarities of the machine, and it has discovered a process for baking bread rapidly, that takes only a few hours longer than the process already used by the bakers. It might have done many more wonderful things had it not been hampered Motion (by Mr GREENE) proposed-That the question be now put.  Mr Deputy Speaker, be good enough to state the position for the benefit of honourable members who have just entered the chamber?
