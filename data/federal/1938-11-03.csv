1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. G. T. Bell) took the chair at 11 a.m., and read prayers: CABINET RECONSTRUCTION. STATEMENT IN "" CANBERRA TIMES "" .",13
2,Mr MENZIES,Unknown," by leave--The Canberra Times this morning has published, under appropriate headlines, the statement that the Attorney-General-meanin g myselfhas served on the Government, or on the Prime Minister, an ultimatum in relation to the reconstruction of the Cabinet. J take this opportunity to say at once that the story that I have served an ultimatum either on the Prime Minister or on the Government is completely untrue. I have not done so either directly or indirectly, and I can attribute the report only to a malicious desire to engender bad blood between the Prime Minister and myself who are, not only colleagues, but also friends. I merely add that any matter concerning either the constructing or the reconstructing of the Cabinet is, on my side of politics, one for the Prime Minister solely to determine, NA CONFIDENCE. Debate resumed from the 2nd Novemthe ber (vide page 1154), on motion by Mr. CURTINThat, because of its lamentable lack of leadership in regard to urgent national problems, the Government has forfeited confidence of this House.",13
3,Sir EARLE PAGE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Uowper-Minister facts, for Commerce) [11.3] - I feel deeply grateful to the Loader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) for the action that he and the speech that he made yesterday. In the first place I thank him for tribute that he paid to the work which my colleague, the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby), has been doing. regard that as a very decent and sportsmanlike action. My colleague has been the victim of one of the dirtiest press campaigns ever instituted in Ausof tralia, culminating last Sunday week in the publication of a malicious slander in a Sunday newspaper, which said that he had left the conference Commonwealth and State Ministers order to attend a dance. What actually happened was that after the conference had concluded its deliberations the sphere, honourable gentleman attended Journalists' Ball at the. request of journalists themselves, and in the pany of the majority of those who had been present at the conference. We who are associated with the Minister for Defence appreciate the tribute paid his work by the Leader of the Opposition, because we know him to be as able and loyal a colleague as we could wish to have. As Minister for Defence he has had a super-human task to perform; he has had to arrange for the expenditure of exactly twice the amount expended in previous year, and I venture to affirm that he haB been the means of saving this country hundreds of thousands of pounds which might otherwise have been wasted.",14
4,Mr FORDE,MOTION OF WANT OF,Would it have been wasted if another man had been Minister :for Defence ?,14
5,Sir EARLE PAGE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No . But he is undoubtedly a man who pays great attention to detail; the comfort which honourable members enjoy in this Parliament House is testimony to that, - because he inspired most of the alterations for the convenience of members. My second reason for being grateful to Leader of the Opposition for having raised the issue of Commonwealth leadership at the recent meeting of the Loan Council and the conference of Commonthe wealth and State Ministers is that I am thus enabled, by an exact narrative of the and by the quotation of the official statements of members of that conference, to expose the misrepresentation and mistook statements of which a section of the press has been guilty in an attempt the to sensationalize a practical effort to solve a most difficult problem. By premature, ill-founded and incorrect I anticipation of what was to be considered, they made - worse an atmosphere which was already difficult;- by lacing the atmosphere with lying stories intrigue and motives, by publishing maliciously untrue accounts of my implication in these intrigues, they brought to the conference a feeling of misof trust and suspicion. On the Sunin day previous to the conference, I made an appeal to the press to refrain from an endeavour to create this atmoand pointed out that at that time, the some of the State Premiers had not even the received the communications embodying comthe Commonwealth Government's proposals that had been sent to them and that it was absolutely improper for myself or anybody else to.make statements in regard to to those matters - Despite this atmosphere, which unfortunately did not dis^ appear until the conference had actually concluded its deliberations, and an opportunity was afforded to discuss the matter in detail, the State governments respected the the confidence reposed in them by the Commonwealth Government, and up to the present moment have treated as confidential supporting documents which had been sent to them with our memorandum. This, to me, is the most practical proof that could be furnished of their desire to co-operate with the Commonwealth Government, and is a certain guarantee that we shall succeed in our aim to secure a national plan of development and defence and to evolve the necessary machinery to carry it out. Australian settlement and development have not been: along lines suited to the carrying out of a considered plan. Settlement was begun in different parts of the continent at different times, and from those various points, the country was "" peacocked "" in a more or less haphazard fashion. W it h such a huge continent, the development of ports was essential for the export of minerals and Other primary products, and those ports grew bigger and bigger. In the early days there was no question the existence of those ports as a principal Centre in the industrial life of the country was safe enough, sailing boats being the only vessels on the ocean and the range of guns being so short. But today, with vessels having a speed of 30 miles an hour, a gun range of 30 miles, find the ability to catapult aeroplanes into the air in order to launch an attack on our towns, it is quite obvious that steps must be taken to ensure that all of our vital industries shall not be on the coast but shall be distributed throughout the length and breadth of the country. If that can be done on a considered plan, we shall have such a distribution of population, such a lay-out of our railways, roads, water supplies and power propositions, as wil l ensure better land defence than would otherwise be possible. It is manifest to any person who considers the defence position in the light of the test to which it was subjected during the critical last two or three months, that the haphazard system of the past has not given the results that are needed in this country; there must be a concerted plan. The problem is further complicated by the fact that, in addition to the money that we need for our development, provision has to be made for an unexampled expenditure on defence works and equipment, and arrangements have to be completed for the conversion of a - huge amount of internal loans. Just after the war, Australia was faced with a very difficult financial problem; arrangements had to be made for the conversion of the whole of the war loans, totalling more than £200,000,000, during a period of three or four years, and simultaneously money had to be raised for developmental purposes. This Jed to the constitution of the Loan Council. It would have been absolutely impossible, without the elimination of competition between governments, to achieve the result of, first, the conversion of the war loans raised in times of enthusiasm, and - secondly, the raising of the money necessary for developmental purposes. So successful was that co-operative arrangement that the people, at a referendum, agreed to its being embodied in the Constitution. We are now faced with an even greater problem, in that we have not merely to convert loans but have also to that find money for developmental purposes and for defence. The Government believed that the Loan Council was the proper body to initiate the necessary planning, and that an expert committee should be attached to it for the purpose of obtaining all the details of the different plans. It took to the Loan 'Council and the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers three specific proposals. The first proposal was that arrangements should be made for the conversion of loans aggregating £70,000,000 which are fallin g due, and, concurrently, that an additional £4.000,000 should be raised for definite purposes. The second proposal was that the States should agree to substitute for certain of their proposed works other works which would have an indirect defence value and would not cause any displacement of labour. The third proposal was for the formation of a council to advise the Loan Council and the various governments regarding the order of importance and priority in public works needed for developmental and defence purposes. When a statement on these lines was made in this House, the Leader of the Opposition first said that it containedplatitudes; but immediately afterwards he saidThese suggestions are on all-fours with everything the Opposition has said during the last few years as being the basis upon which to make Australia a safe country. If they were platitudes, what the honorwhole able member had been saying for many years also was platitudinous; but they were not-the y went right down to the very fundamentals of the position. honourable gentleman further said I believe that the suggestion for an advisory committee",14
6,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,Hon. G. J. Bell) Order 1 The right honourable gentleman is not in order in reading the report that debate.,16
7,Sir EARLE PAGE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Leader of the Opposition, I am sure, will acquit of any intention to misquote him - when say that he believed that the suggestion Wales said:for the appointment of an advisory committee was a good one.",16
8,Mr CTJBTIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Hear , hear!",16
9,Sir EARLE PAGE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable gentleman suggested that that committee of should be attached to the Loan Council, development, the activities of which should he expanded to permit of that being done. committee That was exactly the proposition which the Commonwealth placed before the cers, State governments. Co-operation was their secured on all of these three points. It would was a matter, not of passing any faceto saving resolution but of actual agreement on specific details. I suppose that no one will doubt that arrangements were made for the conversion of £70,000,000 of loans, and for the raising of an additional £4,000,000 for defence purposes. In the second place, arrangements were made for works to be dealt with in detail, and for the transfer of works between the various governments. Far. from the Commonwealth Government not having brought down specific recommendations, the Premier of New South Wales told the conference that his officers had already been in communication with the Defence Department, and had prepared schedules of works which were at that time under discussion. Mr Stevens, according to the official report of the conference, said:Our officers, in conjunction with the military officers and the Minister for Defence, have prepared fairly comprehensive schedules of works. These are now before the Defence authorities. It is for those authorities either to accept them or substitute others. That gives the lie to the story that the conference had nothing to consider. The matter had already been discussed between the officers of the Defence Department and officers of the various States. The Minister for Defence yesterThe day gave testimony as to the kind of work that would be required in the several States. If one glances at the statements made by the other Premiers one sees that they either submitted certain propositions or were ready to submit them, as was of also the Commonwealth Government. This brings me to the third point, the formation of an advisory committee. me This proposal was supported in every I quarter. The Premier of New South  that the Loan Council should appoint an advisory committee, and that its functions should be defined in relation to (a) such works as will serve the dual purposes defence and development, and (6) purely developmental works and industrial coupled with migration. The suggestion is that this advisory shall consist of officers of the Loan Council, officers of the Commonwealth and State Governments, military offiand men chosen from outside because of knowledge of industry. Its constitution necessitate an agreement to extend the activities of the Loan Council. I am prepared support such a proposal, provided that the committee will also deal with the financial policy which will be necessary for the success of the scheme as a whole. It was suggested that there was a vague proposal, but here was a proposition stated in precise terms by one of the State Premiers. The Premier of Victoria (Mr. Dunstan) declared:Victoria will be only too pleased to cooperate in forming an advisory or investigating committee, but I emphasize that the powers of the governments must not be handed over to any committee. Should a committee be appointed it must be purely advisory to the governments which must accept the final responsibility for any action that may be taken. That is what the Commonwealth Government suggested, and I take it that it would also be the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition.",16
10,Mr CUB,MOTION OF WANT OF,TIN - I am not prepared to surrender governmental powers to boards or committees.,16
11,Sir EARLE PAGE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The committee was merely to recommend the order of priority of certain works, and the various governments concerned would have to take responsibility for their decisions regarding them. The Premier of Queensland (Mr Forgan Smith) remarked:I believe that the, resources of Australia are such that with national planning the defence expenditure can be met, and a large amount of developmental work can be done; but we should not overlook the necessity for organizing, not only jobs and works, but also the finance on reasonable terms which is necessary to carry out the scheme. Therefore, I give every support to the proposal for establishing new industries in the areas that are economically most suited for them. The Government should do everything in its power to encourage the establishment of now industries. Our watchword should be the establishment of industries right throughout the Commonwealth, not their concentration in any one area.",16
12,Mr CURTIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does the right honourable gentleman say that the Commonwealth Government did not intend that the advisory committee should decide the priority of works?,17
13,Sir EARLEPAGE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall quote the words of the motion submitted by me at the conference, which will show that no such suggestion was made. The motion was in these terms:That an advisory committee be appointed to consider the problems of industrial development and the location of industrial facilities in Australia, and to report upon the order of priority in which public works related thereto should be carried out. That the advisory committee consist of representatives of the Commonwealth, of the States and of industry. That the committee report from time to time to the Loan Council. The Premier of Victoria suggested that the motion should be amended to read as follows:That an advisory committee be appointed to consider the problems of industrial development and the location of industrial facilities in Australia, and to report thereon to the Loan Council.",17
14,Mr CTJETIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,It seems extraordinary that Mr Dunstan should have moved such an amendment if he had not placed a stronger construction on the Commonference wealth proposal than its text suggested.,17
15,Sir EARLE PAGE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The suggestion of certain State Premiers was that the representation on the committee would so strong that the various governments would be compelled to adopt its recomwas mendations, as those of experts. The representative of Western Australia, Mr . Troy, saidSo long as the.States do not lose the initiative that they now possess in regard to public works, I cannot see much wrong with the proposal. In any case, the States should not refuse to co-operate in a matter of such importance. Mr Ogilvie, the Attorney-General of Tasmania, statedWe are prepared to co-operate with the 'Commonwealth and the other States in an endeavour to arrive at a plan aimed at development for defence. The Commonwealth Government's proposals so far have been on extremely broad and general lines, and are capable of very varying interpretation. A body of the nature suggested should be appointed, even if it only undertook the investigation of an insignificant portion of the expenditure of loan money by the various governments. W it h the exception of about £130,000,000 expended in connection with primary production, the public debts incurred by the States since 1918 have represented expenditure on public works. In addition, in the last eight years, £48,000,000 has been expended on semi-governmental works, whilst about £78,000,000 has been expended by - way of unemployment relief works. This expenditure totals well over £600,000,000. If , in regard to even 10 per cent, of that total, a planned investigation had been made as to the best way to use the money, so that the works undertaken would stand behind Commonwealth defence activities proper, ensuring that in respect of vulnerable industries there would be alternative sites for the provision of transport and power, Australia would have been in a much better position than it finds itself in today. I take it that, in the next twenty years, we are almost certain to require a sum almost equal to that already expended on development. Surely we cannot start too early to arrange a definite plan under which the Commonwealth and the States can work together. The proposal submitted to the conwas not published in the press in its precise terms. All sorts of wild stories were - circulated about extraordinary expenditure on development, but the idea be of giving effect to the plan immediately was carefully concealed. The impression given that it was a long-range and visionary scheme. Certainly it was a long-range plan, but not a visionary one. I have previously brought forward proposals for co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States, and they have been regarded as fantastic. They have been objected to by the Opposition in this Parliament, yet they have received the active support of State governments composed of men of the same party as the Opposition. These schemes were actually brought into being. Mr Rosji - ic.'.R - What schemes? ",17
16,Sir EARLE PAGE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I shall give several instances. Take the formation of the Loan Council and the validation of the financial agreement. That proposal was submitted to the people, and agreed to by an overwhelming majority. Yet, in 1929, when we tried to ensure that the agreement would be given effect, the Opposition in this Parliament opposed the Financial Agreement Bill on the second reading and in committee, and even on the third reading, although Labour governments were in office in three of the States and had endorsed the proposal. I shall give another illustration of co-operation. When the Federal Aid Roads scheme was introduced in this Parliament, the great majority of the members of the Labour party voted against it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) supported it, as did several other Labour members, because they realized that it would be invaluable to the States, and would assist in developing the country, as well as give skilled and permanent employment.",18
17,Mr CTJKTIIT,MOTION OF WANT OF,The States had to ask the Commonwealth Government to amend the scheme drastically.,18
18,Sir EARLE PAGE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"When the original bill was submitted, the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin), who was then Leader of the Opposition, opposed the scheme on the ground that its continuation invaded State rights, but the present Leader of the Opposition objected to it more recently only on the ground that the Commonwealth was being made the victim of the States. That is typical of the opposition met with in regard to matters of this kind. The proposal for the standardization of railway gauges has for years been part of the policy of the Federal Labour party. The Bruce-Page Government took the first substantial step in the direction of - the standardization of gauges by providing for the conversion to the standard gauge of the line from Grafton to Brisbane, thus providing a uniform gauge from Albury to Brisbane. The right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), the honourable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) and the honourable member for Gippsland  Opposition kept us at work for two nights in succession in getting that measure through the House. Although the standardization of railway gauges wfis one of the cardinal features of the policy of the Federal Labour party, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition voted for the Grafton to Brisbane proposal, the majority of the members of the Labour party voted against it. To secure the standardization of the section from Grafton to Brisbane, we had to secure co-operation between the Labour Government of Queensland, the Government of New South Wales and the Commonwealth Government. The Bunnerong power station supplies electricity for the whole of the industrial life of Sydney. It is situated on the seafront. Its position is very exposed, and it Can readily be seen from the sea or the air. It stands out like a sore thumb, and it invites attack. Surely one of the first tilings that should be thought of is the provision of an alternative source of electric power, lest in . the first week or month of a war, the Bunnerong power station be smashed. Yesterday, Alderman Cramer, a member of the Sydney County Council, condemned the proposal to expend a further £70,000 on the Bunnerong power house, because of its excessive vulnerability. He suggested that the money should be expended in some other place on the provision of an alternative supply of power so that, in the event of war, the industries of Sydney could not be paralysed at a stroke. If , for instance, a supplementary power house were established at Lithgow, Sydney could still be supplied with power even if the main source of its supply were destroyed. However, to make that a commercial proposition, it would be necessary to develop a series of industries around the new source of power, so as to provide a profitable outlet for it. We must have our plans ready and carried into effect, because the destruction of iSydney's power supply is something that might happen at the very beginning of a war. The advisory committee would have such plans ready and determine the order of priority in which the works should be carried out. Let us consider another example of the need for planning. Great Britain has made tremendous efforts to provide in that country immense stores of food so that the population may not be starved out in wartime. However, because food is essentially perishable, and because it is diffithe cult to provide a large amount of storage except at excessive cost, the Government of Great Britain has requested the dominions in their turn to establish refrigerated store houses on deep water if possible, so that, at the outbreak of war> the stored food may be shipped across to Great Britain as quickly as possible. It is necessary at the same time to establish in the vicinity of those storehouses other industries which can use the refrigerated space. That is another development which must J>e undertaken without delay. Not so very far from here the railway between Sydney and Albury becomes a single track, which would create a dangerous bottleneck in time of emergency. Either the track should be duplicated, or another line should be constructed which could handle the traffic in time of need. These matters require planning and operation, and they will never be attended to unless a scheme of the kind we have envisaged be put into operation. Therepossible fore, we suggested that a new investigatin ing authority should be attached to the Loan Council, which is the only body really representative of the CommonPrime wealth and States. If that were done, Government would feel that its success sovereignty was being invaded. It would have the final say in regard to the allocasections tion of the money to be expended works. At the present time, the Loan Council allocates funds to the various States. Surely the seven governments ought to consult as to the order of priority of the various works to be undergovernments taken in order that precedence might be given to those of the greatest defence value. Moreover, having the greater part of our population in two of the eastern States, it is imperative that we should devise means to establish more industries in the States with smaller populations. That can be done only if all the facts are marshalled, so that we may know what steps should be taken to ensure that industries shall be established in those States. It may in some instances call for some form of Commonwealth subvention. An example of what can happen when such matters are unregulated is provided by the Lithgow ironworks. Years ago ironworks were established at Lithgow, 100 miles from the sea, and near coal supplies. Why were they shifted down to Port Kembla, a place which is vulnerable to attack, so that £400,000 has had to be expended on its defence? It was because of the State railway policy in regard to freights. Honourable members will realise the importance of having as many baskets as possible for our eggs. We must plan to bring about the proper distribution of our population, and the proper location of our industries. These matters were discussed by the Loan Council, which agreed to two out of the three proposals put before it, while consideration of the third point was deferred until a later meeting. Therefore, the suggestion that the conference was a failure is a grotesque libel of the facts. However, the results that we are seekcoing can be achieved only by co-operation between the State and Commonwealth authorities, and we should do everything to ensure that co-operation. If . the end, it cannot be obtained by the ordinary constitutional means, it may be necessary to adopt other methods. The Minister has appealed for unity no and co-operation in order to make a of the present system of volun tary military training. I appeal to all for co-operation in this on matter of planning our economic and industrial development. It is a matter which cannot be dealt with by any one parliament, or any one government. The co-operation of all parliaments and all is essential. I appeal first for unity within our own parties, and then for the co-operation of all parties in this Parliament, and of all parties throughout Australia, to ensure that this country, which we all love, shall be satisfactorily defended.",18
19,Mr BRENNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Batman) [11.38] Some of us have listened with interest, ro parts at least, of the most earnest and eloquent address just delivered by the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page). Some of us, no doubt, sympathized with him in the grievance which he discovered in the early part of his oration - Some of us, perhaps, did not sympathize quite so much. The right honourable gentleman concluded his speech by making a symposium of all that matter which he had already submitted to the Loan Council. As everybody knows, he went to that meeting of the Loan Council charged with a mass of undigested matter regarding public works of a defensive character. Even now he maintains that it was not a chimerical scheme, but a highly practical one to establish industries, and to enter upon works, which would be practical and more or less reproductive in their nature, above all possessing the attributes of defence, so that they might amplify the already enormously expanded defence policy of the Government. I should like to ask the right honourable gentleman a few simple questions. Is it not a fact that he was Deputy Prime ""Minister in the Bruce-Page Government for seven years? During all that time what did be do in regard to these matters which he foresaw were urgent, and which he still maintains are essential? He has been a member of the present Government for four years. During that time what has he done in regard to those so urgent matters ? - ""What has he to show for the time that he has occupied positions of power and responsibility in succeeding governments in this Parliament? What, in a word, has he done except talk about these things? He has done nothing. Are we to assume that he has been a mere cypher in three successive governments; that they did not take him seriously, and that he has been content to remain a Minister, even though not-taken seriously? It is idle for him to complain in this Parliament, and still more idle for him to make it a ground of complaint against the Opposition, that he has not been able to give effect to his proposals, when he has, apparently, not even been able to convince his own party of their importance. The right honourable"" gentleman began with a serious complaint against the press, and it is quite refreshing to hear such a complaint from such a source. He did not state' precisely what part of the press was blameworthy, against what particular newspapers he complained, but, in general terms he voiced a bitter complaint against the press as such. I confess that I am not here for the purpose of making a spirited defence of the daily press, but I should like to ask the right honourable gentleman does not he, and his Government, and his party, live by this press which he so roundly castigates? What, may I ask, would be the Government's chance of survival if it did not accept direction in regard to every hysterical, swashbuckling scheme that is adumbrated in the press, and put before the people? It could not live, politically, for a day. I suggest that it is only while because the Government is in extremis, because it is at its last gasp, that the right honourable gentleman is now biting his friends. It is because its members are fighting and contending with one another, that a leading member of the Government ventures now to make this belated attack. But does he think-h e is vastly mistaken if he does-that because the press is strong it will be merciful? He will be ridden to death as will every public man who places his political and personal fortunes in the keeping of daily newspapers. The Attorney-General sometimes complains that he is misreported in the press. I heard such a complaint quite recently. It is very amusing to realise that ever since the right honourable gentleman has been a member of this Parliament, he has been the darling of the press. He sits in his place in this chamber the very embodiment of wisdom, saying nothing, and basking in the unearned adulations of the daily newspapers. That, is the extent of his contribution towards a solution of the serious problems which are harassing the people of Australia. His efforts, it is true, have been no more fruitfu l than his inaction. The right honourable gentleman came to this Parliament as the chosen of the moneyed interests in Melbourne to rise to the Prime Ministership, when, in due course, the present holder of that high and distinguished office had been included in the long list of those, who, having left the Labour party, are themselves left. One newspaper published in Melbourne issued instructions to its special representatives in Canberra that whatever else they did, Menzies was to be praised. They may criticize even the head of the Government and other members of the Ministry, but as the Attorney General had been chosen by ""big business"" as the successor to this high office, whatever he says and whatever he does-if he ever does anything-h e is to be constantly praised. Because one newspaper said that he had no imagination-h e was shocked that any section of the press should make even a minor reflection upon his impeccabilityhe rose in indignation to disown the soft impeachment. There is nothing more disturbing in public life than to see a man in politics driven by external forces which are not responsible to Parliament. There is nothing more calculated to excite terror in. the breasts of the people than to find a public man in a responsible position with his ear to the ground in order that h,'.c popularity may not be disturbed. It is necessary and desirable to get to the root cause of the present failure in leadership and of the disintegration and personal jealousies and recriminations. When the Attorney General first entered State politics, he had the reputation of being an eminent lawyer, of possessing a striking personality, and of having courage, wit and originality. He displayed these qualities at the expense of our friends in the corner and also at the expense of the Assistant Minister. He stated his views forcibly and revealed himself as a man of originality and vitality. But he was not in the State Parliament long before he found that it did not pay. He then came to Canberra where he had an entirely different outlook. He became a different man. He came chained to the financial interests which had nominated him for the highest - position in"" this Parliament under marching orders. lesser things perfect, in greater things wanting. For example, in setting the seal upon Australia's nationhood by the adoption of certain relevant sections of the Statute of Westminster, he has failed lamentably. On several occasions he has declared that that statute embodies a significant part of the policy of this Government, but the voice of the flatterer has told him to "" go slow "" and he has not dared to do what he knows to be his duty. He has listened to the voice of the groundling, and has flagrantly broken pledges he has repeatedly given in matters of high statesmanship. My mind goes back to the men who made great names for themselves in this country. I recall such men as Higinbotham, Higgins, and going further back, Wentworth, men of individuality and courage, who did something to build up this young country, and were themselves. The Attorney-General is a tableau aud prefers to be a statue placed in position for decorative purposes. He is afraid to speak his mind. Even minor criticism which appeared in a section of the press concerning what is alleged to have passed between him and the Prime Minister unnerves him. Everybody knows that he has been nominated, and that he has accepted nomination, as Australia's next Prime Minister, under the terms and conditions of those who wish him to hold that office. He has competitors, of course. My honourable friend, the Treasurer, also complains.",20
20,Mr LANE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Why be so spiteful ? Mr BRErTNArT- I am not spiteful. I have always been on friendly terms, in a personal sense, with the Attorney General. I should like him to be a statesman, fearless and unashamed, refusing to be the instrument of outside interests. I should like him to stand up with shoulders squared to the newspapers which are covering him with adulation quite unearned. I shall now leave this potential leader. I am dealing'with the leadership of this Government, and all of the gentlemen to whom I am referring are at least potential leaders. The Treasurer is an amiable person of the English tradition, and, of course, loyal to the "" old school tie"". In his In opinion, no departure may be made' from the accepted tradition. He is a competent Treasurer in many respects. He is a pleasing man to deal with. He holds some views on finance, orthodox today, not so orthodox yesterday, and some opinions on defence that are not made in Australia. During this debate we have heard much on the subject of defence and finance. About a year ago the Treasurer attended a conference - at iCanberra- I think they designated it the (Summer School-o n political science, at which he contributed an interesting historical paper on Australia's relations with the Mother Country. Being historical it was for the most part historically accurate. At the close of the discussion at that ference the Government, which of course includes the Treasurer, was charged with neglecting the defence of this country. It was said that very little had been and that money for the defence of Australia was not made available by the Treasury. The Treasurer nose indignantly and said that whatever money was needed for defence would be provided, and that the Minister for Defence was the onlf Minister who could „"" write his own ticket"". That went very well until the House met; but when he entered this chamber he - was confronted with questions by honourable members in Opposition as to whether that statement was to be taken literally, and he replied, "" No , not literally; caution has to be exercised "". Such expenditure he explained had to run the gauntlet of investigation and examination. I have not his precise words before me but they are on record. He gracefully recanted. In due course a meeting of the Loan Council was held at Canberra. It was what is generally known as a "" frost"". It was a "" washout "". I think that is the correct phrase. Mr Lane interjecting,",21
21,Mr SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF,'Order ! The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) must cease interjecting.,22
22,Mr BRENNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The right honourable the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) elaborated a scheme for submission to that conference, which was, as the Sydney Morning Herald said, nebulous, and full of idealism, utterly impracticable. The right honourable gentleman submitted that scheme, but nothing was done about it. The Governments of the several States were represented at the conference. There was Mr Dunstan from my own State. There were at least three Labour Premiers, and there was, of course, the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Stevens. The newspapers had worked up an atmosphere of hysteria and public terror on the question of defence in Australia. The imaginary enemy! And what was the result of it all? The result was that the mountain laboured long, and brought forth not even a mouse; the conference produced nothing. And for what reason? The con- Premier of Victoria, Mr Dunstan, is a practical man, and he has a scheme of works, amongst other schemes, for the done, unemployed of Victoria. He is supported by the Labour party of Victoria and has his practical proposals put into operation andcarried through. He went to the conference and said, "" What is the proposal? An advisory council to decide the priorities of these urgent works in each of our various States in favour of defence "" ? Mr Dunstan rejected it. Mr Stevens from New South Wales rejected it ; all rejected it in various terms of polite negation. It was all left in the air. Nothing was done. Mr.""Stevens discovered himself, suddenly, as an inflationist, with an interest in the unemployed, and then this curious development occurred. The Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Casey) returned from the conference, at which high finance stood its ground and the Premiers got away with the hone. The Treasurer made an attack upon his colleague of the United Australia party in New South Wales, Mr Stevens. He accused him of being an inflationist, which, of course, he is; but then, in the words of the play, "" Aren't they all "" ? since the far-off days when Labour was turned out of office because it had the same ideas. The honourable gentleman accused Mr Stevens of being an inflationist, and the Argus of the 25th October reprimanded him. If it were a Labour newspaper advocating the raising of money for legitimate Labour purposes, for the people who are unemployed, for the rising tide of youth who have been cheated out of their rights in this country, for the construetion of workers' homes and for the abolimaw tion of the slum-in redemption of promise made several years ago by the Prime Minister, which has never been redeemed-on e could understand it , but the statement appears in the one time ultra-Conservative and profoundly rightmy thinking journal of Victoria. It makes these observationsThere seems to be more fear than rage in Mr Casey's attack upon Mr Stevens. This getting "" the blow in fust"" is poor tactics is not likely to perturb Mr Stevens unduly. "" In Federal circles"", Mr Casey says (whatever the phrase may mean), "" Mr Stevens' policy of liberal credit is regarded as of inflation."" How these brothers in the United Australia party do love one another- It does not matter how it is regarded what it is called. Money is required for defence of Australia, and the Commonwealth Government must find the money "" Must find the money""-no t even then "" real "" money, mark you! It continuesA courageous policy of defence is demanded, and the Commonwealth Government must find the policy-the present Government or another. A little lower down it saysTheories! What concern have we theories when we are .naked to our enemies ""Naked to our enemies"" ! In 1933, through its then Minister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill , the Government introduced a policy of defence which was considered to be completely adequate sufficient-all-embracin g and tionary in its magnitude, but still neceslished? sary and sufficient. It is now merely a a respectably Conservative journal. "" flea-bite"". A f t e r all these millions of pounds have been spent and a pro- ' gramme of £40,000,000 odd has been adumbrated and published, now, in the light of the public declaration of the sent Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) that this £43,000;000 programme is merely a beginning. Already we have unexpected £53,000,000 of expenditure in sight. spite of all, we are naked according to protagonists of the United Australia party. In my view, to a great degree, are naked because the more money which leading article. is poured into the maw, the insatiable to which there is no bottom, the the more naked do we become. Prom my point of view, it is ridiculous to expend money in amounts which increase by millions of pounds with every flow of hysteria from the swashbucklers. From point of view it is ridiculous, but from the point of view of the diseased sensationalists, it is the acme of perfection. The Argus saysBut the Commonwealth Bank is not, whatand ever the Federal Treasurer may think, or may submit to, the dictator of Australian Govern,mcnt. It has no responsibility to the people. a policy The CommonwealfchBank has no responsibility ! It must not stand in the way! That newspaper applauded the appointment of the Commonwealth Bank .Board; and when the Labour Government was in or power, and this country was scratching the for its life to find money for works, to pay the debts of the country, and to keep it out of the bankruptcy court, said that we must' be ""guided by men who were disinterested and had the stable wisdom of the members of the Commonwealth Bank Board. But today, for war purposes, when there is no war, it says that the Commonwealth Bank Board must not stand in the way of money being poured into the insatiable maw. In 1935, £7,000,000; in 1938, £53,000,000, and in with 1939, £100,000,000! The Commonwealth ? Bank Board must be swept aside, and the Commonwealth Government must find the money! From where? From out of the blue? - What was the reaction of the Treasurer and when he awoke and saw what this imrevoluperfectly orthodox newspaper had pubPreviously, the Argus had been It has now become a stunt journal, but, not being used to or trained in the profession of stunting, when it comes into competition with a newspaper which has prealways been a stunter, like the Melbourne Herald, it is completely out-distanced. The Treasurer was so concerned with this bolt from the blue that he not In merely made a statement, but actually wrote a letter to the paper, and the newspaper was so flatteredthat it gave the we letter a privileged place alongside the Under the heading "" Defence and Finance; Mr Casey States His Policy"" is a long letter signed "" R. G. Casey, Canberra."" He starts by sayingSir,-r l have read the leading article in your issue of today with amazement and consternationI quite believe itIn the whole of my political life, I have never experienced such a public misrepresentation of my views. The wheel is turning. This is the second phase of the somersault. The letter goes onYou state in effect that I say that the money necessary for defence cannot be found; that there is a certain quantity of money normally available; and that the necessities of defence in a national emergency must be restricted. Nothing is further from the facts. Why should it be? When did it become far from the facts in the mind of the honourable gentleman that there is a certain quantity of money normally available for defence? [Leave to continue given.] The honourable gentleman continued in this wayJust as much money will be found for defence-jus t as much and just as fast as it is wanted. Let me state, too, just as definitely and just as unequivocally that the Commonwealth Bank Board does not stand in the way of raising money for defence, and would be swept out of the way if it attempted to do so. Whatever the Argus may profess to fear, the idea of the board's attempting to dictate defence or any other policy to the Government is so ludicrous that further comment would be superfluous I repeat, as 1I have stated publicly before, that since I have been Federal Treasurer the Defence Department has in effect written its own ticket in matters of finance. And so the Treasurer-the inflationist, the orthodox financier and defender of the Bank Board, so familiar to us in his best English-Australian style with everything in perfect orderimmediately he is challenged in the inspired columns of the Argus, upon which he depends for his political existence, recants and makes a full confession of faith not in accordance with what he had conceived to be Argus policy but in accordance with what he sees to his great surprise and consternation is the suddenly-changed policy of the Argus. As the electors of Corio are still the electors of Corio, and still Argus readers, and do not discriminate greatly between the Argus of today and yesterMr Rrennom. day-the Argus of stunt days-and the Argus of pre-stunt days, it follows that the honourable gentleman who depends on the press to win the Corio seat must, as the weathercock changes with the moving wind, change ever so rapidly-fro m day to day if necessary-adjustin g his policy no longer in accordance with old school tie conditions but in accordance with that which will best suit him to hold his place or a better one in this extraordinary Government of spare parts. I come now to the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) who is a potential leader in this Government. But really one does not like to criticize him; * it is a shame to take the money; he offers such poor resistance. It is to the more hopeful gentlemen who are getting such liberal support from the press in respe6t of which they are so restless this morning that I wished rather to address a little friendly criticism and advice. No doubt as the result of press reports this morning, there will be a lot more personal explanations later in the day. Undoubtedly the Government is crumbling, and it is equally true that the seeds of disintegration and decay were planted in it at the beginning, not in the sense that certain organic matter possesses from its beginning its element of disintegration, decay and death, but in the fact that it has always been composed of mutually discordant parts. In the early stages it was a United Australia party Government composed'of an ancient order of quitters to which faculty a certain number of freshers antiwas added; but they were all United Australia party members. When the next election came around it could no longer be known as the United Australia party Government. Room had to be made for the Country party. Then the problem of the adjustment of portfolios followed. It was a protectionist Government and as it would never do to have a Country party representative as Minister for Trade and Customs so the page boy, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) was made the nominal Minister for Trade and Customs and the Minister for Commerce was chosen from the Country party because it would not sound so bad calling such a member a Minister for Commerce. Then when we - sent as a delegation to England the Minister for Trade and Customs ostensibly to uphold the inalienable protectionist policy of Australia, and the Minister for Commerce trying his best to pull it down, as he has frequently said he would do, it was also necessary to send the Attorney^General Menzies) to stand between them and keep the peace. The Attorney-General also stands nominally for protection, but as he has no views on this subject his task was easy; he looked the part to perfection. Consequently, when the great struggle took place in England it was not a struggle between our representatives and those of the British Government. The real struggle which took place was between the Minister for Trade and Customs, who abdicated in favour of the Attorney-General, and the Minister for Commerce, who was putting the opposite view. A friend of mine who was in London at the time, and who recently returned to Australia, said to me the other day, "" You sent over three Ministers, but they did not seem to know what they wanted. They were pulling in different directions, so that it was very difficult to tell exactly what Australia requires in regard to the adjustment of our trade relations "". The Minister for Trade and Customs got over his dilemma easily; he set out for Brighton with a. posy of - flowers which he presented to the Mayoress of Brighton and conveyed to the Mayor and. Mayoress of that city messages on behalf of the Mayor and Mayoress of Brighton in Victoria. He then faded out of the picture and was not heard of again except insofar as the newspapers published very illuminating and interesting pictures of all three gentlemen attending the various test matches. In one of these pictures they appear as three graceful curves on the grandstand observing a test match, and the Prime Minister is represented as looking quizzically into their faces and saying, "" Ah, there you are!"". That is the history of this important mission to England. To-day, in Australia, we no longer have government on principle by a number of persons holding the same political views like honourable members on this side do, standing to the same platform and the same ideals and, as the late Labour Government revealed, prepared to [43] form a homogeneous government capable of giving effect to a definite policy. Today it is purely a question of numbers against the Labour party. At - all times Labour, at a moderate estimate, stands at least for about half of the people of Australia. We possess a homogeneous (Mr policy, but opposed to us is a government which survives by taking a man into the Ministry today and rejecting him tomorrow-reconstructio n as the Government is pleased to call it-and today taking in men whose views differ from its own and carrying them along until circumstances make it essential to throw them overboard and appoint somebody else. Some are brought in because, like the Assistant Minister for Commerce and the Minister for Defence, they crash their way in by criticizing and attacking the Government. It is dangerous to have too big a tail, so this Government appointed two parliamentary secretaries. It gives them nothing to do but leaves them moving around like goldfish in a coloured bottle. These are the so-called parliamentary secretaries. In England such officials sit at the table and accept responsibilities. A Minister in the House of Lords is represented by a parliamentary secretary in the House of Commons, and vice versa, and that secretary shoulders responsibility. He exercises important administrative functions, but in Australia that is not at all the case. Here supporters of the Government are appointed as parliamentary secretaries and the Government says, in effect, to them, "" If you keep on supporting us long enough you will enter the fold in one of these reconstructions, but only providing you keep quiet"". In that way aspirants to Cabinet honours are kept quiet. On the other hand, however, we have the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Hughes), the rogue elephant of the Government, which does not know whether he is safer in or out of the Cabinet. The Government took him in and he opposed its policy. When the Government favoured sanctions he opposed them and was put out of this Cabinet, but when he threatened all sorts of ""things it begged him to return. He was less dangerous in than out. Then he discovered that the Prime Minister was getting the good oil direct from London and said that that would not do, so he attacked - the Dominions Office. I do not quite know why he did so, but the Prime Minister immediately defended the Dominions Office and we witnessed the spectacle of two senior Ministers fighting each other in the public gaze. Then the Minister for External Affairs' went off to New Guinea and decided to establish the capital in a certain place, but on his return he was told that the capital must be established on a different site. He does not know yet where the capital of New Guinea is to be. That is how this Government is carrying on. What wonder is it, therefore, that this motion should be moved? What a great thing it would be if it were carried by men anxious to do a public duty in scorn of consequences and in scorn of party. I invite honourable members to carry the motion, which readsThat, because of its lamentable lack of leadership in regard to urgent national blems, the Government has forfeited the fidence of this House. It has never had my confidence.*",22
23,Mr SPENDER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Warringah) [12.28]. - My remarks at this juncture will be confined to a limited ambit. My first comment is that I have always thought that purely destructive criticism advances no cause. After listening to the debate, and particularly to the address just delivered by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan), I am satisfied that whatever merit the criticism levelled against the Government for any of its past delinquencies may contain, no alternative has been given to any honourable member who has any sense of responsibility of government but to oppose the motion. I have heard many excellent speeches delivered by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) in this House. I always listen carefully to his speeches, knowing that he can be relied upon to make some contribution towards the solution of the problems confronting this Parliament, but I feel that in moving this motion he himself has no belief in his cause. When I am confronted with the choice of voting either for a government against which I have directed some criticism, or for an opposition which has advanced no constructive alternative for the solution of the very urgent problems confronting this country, my duty is very plain I say deliberately, despite the comments of the honourable member for Batman, that I would have no hesitation whatever in crossing the floor of the House to vote a government out of power if I thought that the result of so doing would be to place the destiny of my country in better hands. But I am not satisfied that that would be the result of such action on this occasion. Indeed, I am convinced that if it were, the bonsequence would be chaos in Australia. What we need in this country is scientific government. But no constructive ideas have been advanced by honourable members opposite for solving the problems that face us. I am earnest enough to believe that in any completely organized society every able-bodied man or woman should be able to obtain work. But after listening to the declarations of honourable members opposite, who claim that their primary purpose in this Parpro- liament is to represent the working people con- of Australia, I have been forced to the conclusion that if they were placed in charge of the affairs of Australia our condition would be worse rather than better. They have given us no idea as to how our defence programme should be managed, or as to how the disorganization of industry, due to the diverting of operations to defence work, could be coped with. The transfer of a large proportion of our industrial activities to defence work must inevitably cause a tremendous disorganization of industry. But apart from observations made by the Leader of the Opposition in a recent speech, and to certain remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), no honourable gentleman opposite has given any indication that he is at all concerned about scientific planning, or that he would attempt to adopt such a policy. It is necessary, of course, that any pronouncement in respect of scientific planning must be expressed in somewhat general terms; but it is my firm conviction that unless the Government is placed on a scientific basis, the democracies cannot hope to survive. We are being forced to incur wasteful expenditure on armaments. No one in his senses would deny that every penny ""spent on re-armament is robbing the - country of real wealth. Unfortunately, Australia at the present moment cannot adopt any other policy. As I listened to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition on this motion, I detected some measure of inconsistency in his views. He said there was necessity for adopting proper defensive methods in Australia, and that those which the Government had adopted were inadequate. Yet he went on to complain further unnecessary expenditure on defence measures was unwarranted. It appears to me that there can be no escape from expenditure on defence measures in view of world activities at present. Each nation of the world is indulging in what is known in Germany as ""defence economics""; that is, the complete control of the resources and economic strength of the country in time of peace for military preparedness. We do not desire war. The British .people, particularly the Australian people, desire peace above all things. But I am not foolish enough to believe that peace comes merely by expressing the pious hope that it will come. I have had forced upon rne, therefore, the obligation to support a programme involving a huge expenditure on defence measures, although I know that a careful analysis of the situation must strengthen the belief that money spent in this way inevitably lowers the living conditions of the people. It is because of this that I am particularly concerned about the nature of government. At present, democracy functions in a certain way. I do not propose to make any .comment upon the methods by which cabinets are chosen, nor, in the course of my speech, shall I discuss personalities. Appointments to a cabinet is a matter entirely for a Prime Minister. But, under the present system, Ministers have no time whatever to give any really constructive thinking to the problems of the country. As a continuance 'of this policy must finally bring disaster, it ought to be changed quickly. As things are, honourable members may at any time interview Ministers. Ministers find their hands more than full with administrative details. It is a remarkable fact that practically every letter which an honourable member receives from a Minister bears his own personal signature. The amount of time that is taken up by Ministers in purely administrative detail is wholly disproportionate. Ministers have no time, in present circumstances, to devote to thinking about the solution of the problems which face the country. Our system is to blame. I have heard attacks made upon the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby). I that shall not join in them. I realise that whatever criticism may be levelled against the honourable gentleman-and there is room for criticism of his administration in certain respects-h e has discharged his duties in an infinitely better way than did some of his predecessors. While I would prefer that persons whom I criticize were present at the time of the criticism, I feel that in justice to the Minister for Defence, I should say that the condition of the defence services of this country when he took over the portfolio were such as to place upon him a tremendous task, which he has done his best to discharge.",26
24,Mr JOHN LAWSON,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) is being very unjust to his predecessor.,27
25,Mr SPENDER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Justic e to one person may involve injustice to another. It does not matter a penny piece to me what comment the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr John Lawson) may make. I say deliberately that the task which confronted the present Minister for Defence when he took over his portfolio was one. of stupendous magnitude, and it would not have been so had his predecessor had sufficient vision in respect to the matter.",27
26,Mr GREEN,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is showing a very poor spirit.,27
27,Mr ROSEVEAR,MOTION OF WANT OF,He is criticizing a man who is not here to defend himself.,27
28,Mr SPENDER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I said that I would prefer that he was here. The duty of the Minister for Defence has been to discharge, to the very limit of his ability, the important duties that devolve upon him. But no Minister of this Government can discharge his duties properly under our present system, for he has practically no time to devote to policy. It is well known that re-armament must result in a complete disorganization of the industries of a country, for men trained to undertake industrial work of one kind and another are taken away from their own activities and absorbed in the establishments of the armaments manufacturers. . That must necessarily have a very disturbing influence upon the industrial equilibrium of a country. Moreover, the method by which rearmament programmes are financed may play an important part in the life of a community. The sources from which money for re-armament may be obtained are: First, taxation; secondly, loans; and thirdly, partly from taxation and partly from loans. If additional taxation is imposed for defence purposes, the puichasing power of the people is necessarily diminished. A re-armament programme dependent upon taxation must, therefore, not only disorganize industry but also lessen the purchasing power of the community. It also lowers living conditions. On the other hand, the expenditure of loan money on re-armament must necessarily result in inflation and boom conditions. Boom conditions always follow a programme of loan expenditure. In the light of these considerations, it is essential that Ministers should have ample time to think about the best methods of financing our defence programme, and they should also have the advice of competent experts. It appears to me that unless we adopt a system under which expert .advisees are available to the Government, we can never hope to develop Scientific government in this country. To obtain scientific government we must aim at a completely co-ordinated nation. Each department requires particular officers tofulfil the function of evaluating trends in national, economic, and financial affairs. These men should be able, by reason of their training as economists Or sociologists, to observe the trends in a country and to outline the possibilities Of the future. I shall never support the delegation of the supreme power of Parliament to outside bodies; but I am a Strong believer in the policy of making available to Ministers, experts qualified to advise them on national and international trends. If an officer trained for this purpose were appointed to each department, he could advise the Government as to future probabilities. He could say whether the probabilities were 90 per cent., 80 per cent., of something less that certain Sir. Spender. things would happen. Ministers would , then know the trend of affairs. Other executive experts could then give the Government advice as to the plans necessary to meet the trends that were observable. I suggest the advisability of appointing a highly-trained official to a permanent position as secretary of the Cabinet, with the duty of co-ordinating the information made available by these trained officers in each department. I think it would be advisable also for each Minister to have appointed a private member as his parliamentary secretary. Heaven alone knows that under existing conditions private members can do very little for the advancement of their country; and I am quite sure that very many of us would willingly give our time to serve in such a capacity as I have suggested, and to help Ministers with the administrative detail which at present snows them up. There is no more essential moment than the present for scientific planning. With one person advising the Government, for example, on naval matters, another advising it on military affairs, and a third making suggestions in regard to the air force, it is unlikely that we shall develop a properly co-ordinated defence service. One man qualified by training and experience should be able to evaluate the various proposals advanced by the representatives of particular branches of the defence forces, and place the various suggestions before 'the Minister with his carefully considered advice upon them. Under such a system co-ordinated and scientific government would be possible. I wish to revert.to a matter, at this stage, in fairness to myself. It has been suggested, by interjection, that persons snould not be reflected upon in this House if they are not here to defend themselves.",27

Because of that fact I stress the necessity for a sane and scientific financial policy being formulated by ters in consultation with their scientific advisers. I have suggested that the imgain position of taxes for the purpose of cing such a programme may result in a reduction of the standard of living, that loan expenditure may lead to tion. It may be, and probably will that by a proper co-ordination of botn those methods the programme can .be refer given effect to without serious results. An outstanding feature of the recent conference of Premiers was the desire of the State Premiers to find employment for every person capable of doing work. The defence programme of the Governapplying. ment will probably lead to between 30,000 and 40,000 persons being taken from the ranks of the unemployed and given ployment. No one can quarrel with the importance. necessity for concentrating on defence works at this juncture. Subject to that, in my opinion, the energies of unemployed persons capable of doing work should be directed to the creation of public assets. If the activities of and women be directed to the financial creation of public works, then an asset deal with it. is created, which may support the currency provided. Such assets are entirely structure take? different from most defence works. There is no reason why developmental works which create public assets could not financed by the Loan Council. We must realise that we cannot continue our armaments programme for all time. The nations of the world will not do that. is At some time or other- I hope that we shall not have to wait too long-disarma ment must be brought about, otherwise war must result. Money spent on armaa ments is money diverted from the real wealth of the community, so that the more money expended in that direction, the poorer and more impoverished the people become. When disarmament does come, another very serious problem will arise, because then the industrial structure will have to be re-organized. A p.m. diminution of the expenditure on armaments will lead to a contraction of with a falling off of profits, thereby causing unemployment, lower wages and, finally, depression. That is a . natural consequence unless proper. prebe seriously cautions are taken.

In passing, I wish to to the difficulty of determining what is the financial policy of the Commonwealth Bank.. I have read the Bank's monthly bulletin, but the way in which the figures are published makes it impossible for me to determine with any degree of certainty what policy the bank is One cannot be sure whether the bank is applying a policy of contraction of credits, or of inflation.

38,Mr SPENDER,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I have already indicated that only when full information be based on the advice of experts has been placed before one, can one say what is the correct financial policy to implement. I , personally, would not take the responsibility of saying "" This or that policy is the one which ought to be implemented "" unless I had before me the advice of experts. No man, unless he himself had been trained to deal with such matters, could safely decide on a policy, particularly in view of the complexities of finance and the varying details which must be considered before a satisfactory policy can be formulated. My view is that, in respect of developmental works whereby permanent assets are created, no difficulty need be experienced. But expenditure on armaments, which always causes dislocation unless carefully managed, since both capital and services are drawn from industry, and the effects on credit which usually accompany disarmament, are matters which I frankly admit demand a long-range financial policy which I would not venture at this stage to propose. It is a matter which must be dealt with by a proper balancing of the means of obtaining revenue, both by imposing taxes and raising loans, with the whole financial structure. I have merely sought to indicate that we cannot expect satisfactory resitlts unless there are in each department men, who, by reason of their training, are able to follow the trend of events and determine what plans should he adopted in the circumstances. Such plans should then be placed before Ministers, who should be given sufficient time to study the situation before being called upon to decide what course should be followed. In making the suggestion, I wish to make it plain that I am not advocating the delegation of the authority of Parliament to any outside body. I always have been, and still am, definitely opposed to the delegation of the sovereign powers of the Parliament. I am, however, convinced that the sovereign powers of the Parliament in this respect cannot be scientifically exercised unless there are available the advice and assistance of properly qualified experts. I agree with authority being given to other bodies in regard to certain matters, but not in respect of the financial policy of a nation. That is eminently a matter for Parliament. I do not believe that, under the present structure of democracy, and having regard to the heavy administrative burden thrown on Ministers, there can Mr Spender. be any scientifically balanced policy unless it is implemented in the manner which I have suggested. I am convinced that unless we do that, democracy will find itself unable to compete with those governments which are free from the difficulties associated with a democracy; and if we cannot compete with them, we must ultimately succumb to them.

39,Mr NOCK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Riverina) [2.26] - The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) has moved that the Government has lost the confidence of this House, and he has also asserted that it has lost the confidence of the people of Australia. I oppose his motion, because I recognize that the honourable gentleman and those who sit behind him are suffering from an illusion. The motion is a deliberate attempt to capitalize the panic conditions which have been created in this country by the press as the resnlt of the recent war clouds in Europe. We must beware of panic conditions. Honourable members know well that the press of Australia is frequently on the wrong tack. Only this morning we listened to the Attorney General making a personal explanation arising from a statement in the press. During the latter twelve months of the last Parliament numbers of election campaigns were planned by the press. In some instances, the date of the election was given. But these elections did not take place. The Parliament lasted for its full term, expired by effluxion of time, and the elections took place in the ordinary way. Honourable members know too, that the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Hunter), who was then in the Cabinet, was, according to the press, replaced a number of times, but the fact remains that he did not leave the Cabinet until he retired to give more time to his own business. We know also that some months ago, when Australia's trade delegation was absent pre- from this country, the press intimated that immediately on its return there would be a drastic re-construction of the Federal Cabinet. Some newspapers went so far as to name the new Treasurer and the new' Minister for Defence, as well as the prospective holders of other portfolios. In that instance also the press was astray. During the last week we have had a repetition of these prophecies. We get reports of party meeting matters that have not been mentioned. They remind me of the man in charge of the lift in a city building who, on Tuesday last, said to me, as I stepped from the lift, "" I have just given a chap the name of the winner of the Melbourne Cup"". I replied that, in that event, the lucky person would no doubt share the dividend with him. He proceeded, "" Yes, I am sure that I have given to one man the name of the winner, for I have given the names of 22 different horses to 22 different men, and I must be right in one instance"".

41,Mr NOCK,MOTION OF WANT OF,I appreciate that both honourable gentlemen exonerated the Minister for Defence from blame.,31
42,Mr FORDE,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is going too far.,31
43,Mr NOCK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Thos e of us who read the newspapers have noticed that for a considerable time there has been a campaign of calumny against the Minister for Defence. When negotiations in respect of the overseas air mail were in progress, the same thing happened, notwithstanding that the negotiations had been in progress for almost twelve months when the present Minister took over the portfolio. When he took control and was negotiating week after week he was condemned by the press for what he was doing and for what he had not done. When finally, the airmail agreement was signed and submitted to this House, and the Minister's second reading speech had been made upon it, honourable members were given a night or the week-end to consider it. Faults were found with it hy some and it was commended by others, hut when the debate was resumed it did not last more than two hours. The bill was passed by the House within that short space of time in spite of all the press condemnation. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The only complaint in connection with the air-mail agreement arranged 'by the Minister for Defence with the approval of the Cabinet since that time is in connection with the surcharge.",31
44,Mr CURTIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,The honourable member is utterly unfair. He knows that the bill was brought down at the death-knock of the session and was passed rapidly only because Qantas Empire Airways Limited refused to proceed unless the agreement was ratified.,31
45,Mr NOCK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What I know is what I have said; the debate lasted only two hours, and members know that the gag was not applied. That is evidence that there was little to complain of in connection with the bill. . The complaints against the agreement have been voiced only by city interests because a three-penny surcharge is being imposed. I come now to deal with defence matters. The portfolio of Defence is very different from that of Interior or Postmaster-General. If there is complaint in the press or by the public regarding the operations of the Department of the Interior or that of the Postmaster General, the respective Ministers are able to go before the people or come to Parliament and make statements as to what has 'been done and what is proposed to be done. They can explain and defend their position. But that cannot apply in connection with the Defence portfolio, because it is necessary that there should be very much more secrecy in regard to our defence operations. We do not desire that the world should know exactly what is being done in connection with the defence of our coast, the militia and our boom defences, our preparations for the manufacture of munitions and of antiaircraft guns, and the provision of aeroplanes and the types and the number provided. The information given by the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister during yesterday's debate will, I am sure, remove a lot of the apprehension that existed in the minds of the people of Australia and will give them a much greater sense of security. The knowledge of what is being done and that the 'Government haa not idled on its job must be reassuring. The crux of the complaint of the Opposition seems to be that now the Munich Pact has been signed, we have peace and all is well and that the Government is doing too much. We are thankf u l we have peace, but there is .no specific time during which peace may last. The policy of the Government is safety first. If it did not adopt that policy the Opposition would have reason to condemn the leadership of the Government for neglecting to take the necessary precautions to provide for the security of this country. I submit that that is the Government's first obligation. people of Australia look to the Government to do it and they will appreciate the information supplied by its leaders during this debate. Another step which the Government took was to assist a company in connection with the proposed development of the Newnes shale oil deposits. Was it not leadership to endeavour to exploit those deposits for use in case of emergency in order that we may have within our own country the necessary supplies of fuel for our aeroplanes and for transport in case of interference with the trade routes of the world? We appreciate it, even if it was opposed in the vote by the Opposition. I have known the Minister for Defence perhaps longer any honourable member in this House, and I am satisfied that it matters not what job he is given to do, he will do it well. For promptness in dealing with members' requests he has no rival in the Cabinet. information which the honourable gentleman gave us yesterday in connection with the training of personnel for the militia, the steps being taken for the manufacture of munitions or guns for our coast defences, the provision of mobile anti-aircraft guns, shore defences or less, or the provision of oil storage or other requisites for use in case of emergency, indicated to the House that he has a particularly good grip of the department, even though he has only had control of it for twelve months. I pay this tribute to the work and the energy displayed by the Minister for Defence in the administration of his department, and for Mr Votik. the way in which he explained the position to us yesterday. We have a respite at present; we are satisfied that, for the time being, we have peace; but surely that is no reason why we should disregard the risks of the future. We can see by the preparations being made in Great Eritain and France that those countries recognize that the world is not safe. You cannot press a button and produce a cruiser; you cannot malce an aeroplane in a day. We know that aeroplanes ordered from the United States of America will not be supplied for five months. The filling of orders sent abroad for the supply of aircraft The during the term of office of the previous Minister for Defence was months behind the delivery time schedule. I repeat that the Government's obligation is to make provision for our protection and to have regard to all the facts of the position. - Complaint was made by the Opposition with regard to the employment position. Honourable members opposite said that the Government was not doing anything to provide employment for those out of work. Surely it is ridiculous to suggest that this year we could expend £16,000,000 for our defence requirements, 75 per cent, to 80 per cent, of it in Australia, without providing increased employment. That is my answer to that charge. The provision of works for defence purposes, the than manufacture of munitions, guns, aeroplanes, and the construction of railways and roads, must mean increased work for the people of Australia.",31
46,Mr WARD,MOTION OF WANT OF,"What preparations are made to curtail excess profits? The Mr NOCK - I am not dealing with profits. I have not the balance-sheets to do so. Some of these works are not yet in operation; but I am sure we can accept the undertaking of the Minister for Defence, whom I regard as one of the most practical men in this House, that wirethey are being put in hand and that he will see that there is no unreasonable exploitation; also that if such is attempted action will be taken to endeavour to limit profits. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in his most entertaining speech yesterday, was so hard up for evidence' to sustain his leader's charge of no leadership that he dipped into the now dim and distant past. when the Bruce-Page Government was in power. The honourable gentleman recalled a reference by some other honourable member of this House to the present Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle Page) as the "" tragic Treasurer "". I think that most honourable members of this House know, even if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition does not, that so far as the finances of Australia during the period of seven years of office of the Bruce-Page Government are concerned, it was the State finances, and not the Federal finances, which showed a big slip. The figures show that during that period State debts increased from £520,000,000 to £719,000,000, an increase of £199,000,000, while the Commonwealth public debt increased by only £20,000,000, and against that increase there were asset increases in respect of extended telephonic and telegraphic facilities and buildings, valued at no less than £35,000,000.",32
47,Mr FORDE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"""What about the drift to the bad in the trade balance amounting to £70,000,000?",33
48,Mr NOCK,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Minister for Trade and Customs is not in control of the trade balance. Traders import what they require, and those who produce exportable commodities in this country export what is not used here. The limitation of imports is - automatic. If people have not the finance to buy, and cannot obtain credit, imports automatically decrease. It would have been much better if that automatic economic law had been allowed to operate when the Labour Government was in power, instead of an attempt to rectify the position by bringing down a mountainous tariff schedule, the only effect of which was to dislocate trade in Australia. I point out that if honourable members care to compare the position which existed when the huge tariff was imposed by the Labour Government with the position as it'is today, when there has been a reduction of 1,400 items in the foreign tariff and 660 items in the British preferential tariff, they will find that number of employees in factories today is 554,000, compared with 327,000 in the former period."" We also find that in the Bruce-Page period referred to, the federal ' debt had increased from £365,000,000 to £385,000,000, and since that time, in spite of the £12,000,000 deficit which accumulated in the two years after the defeat of that government, we have had, as the result of the leadership and the sound financial policy of the present Government, seven budgets and a surplus for each of the seven years, and the federal debt has increased by only £5,000,000. Against that increase we have expanded our capital city; we are extending our postal and telegraphic and telephonic services; we have paid for almost the whole of the cost, of our defence services out of income. The Postal Department, during the last two years, has spent on new works alone £4,000,000, and proposes to spend nearly £4,000,000 during the current financial .year. That is an indication of the financial capacity and leadership displayed by the present Government, and is an answer to the complaint by the Opposition that the Government has lost the confidence of this House and of the people of Australia. Give us more of such financial leadership which can extend our assets by so much more than the small increase of our national debt. The Minister for Commerce, who was condemned in a jovial way by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, was responsible for bringing into existence the National Debt Sinking Fund, the Financial Agreement; and the Loan Council, which has not only had its effect on the finances of the Commonwealth, but has also restricted unlimited and dangerous borrowing by the States. This Government is condemned as having no leadership; yet since it has been in office the basic wage has increased from 63s. l i d . in 1932 to 77s. in 1938. Not only have pensions been increased; confidence has also been restored. Enterprise has extended its activities. Previously people were afraid to launch out into new industries. The more new industries which come into activity the more employment is provided, and the the more competition there is for employees. That is automatic and the credit should be given where credit is due. As far as taxation is concerned we realise that this year it has been necessary to increase it ; but even having regard to that increase, taxation today is lower than it was in 1932. As far as .State aid is concerned, the States have received for their roads £28,000,000 between 1931 and 1938, and £81,000,00u has been distributed for other purposes, and in addition to that the primary industries have been aided to the amount of £20,000,000. A further illustration of leadership is the provision of national insurance, legislation which was condemned very largely by honourable members opposite. Yet we find that Mr Schroeder, one of the leading voices in the Labour organization, stated definitely that this was one of the greatest pieces of social legislation in the history of Australia. In addition to that, the honourable . member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward), who went back to the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, would have us believe that he is concerned about the interests of the farmers, and expressed apprehension with regard to the long-term mortgage bill which the Government has promised to introduce. It is known to some of us that the Government is preparing this measure, which, will be introduced and, we hope, passed, at an early date. We regard this proposal as still another sign of the sincerity and leadership of the Government in the interests of the people. Much has been said of late about planning for defence and development. was pleased to hear the Minister for Commerce speak about the resulrfcs the conference held recently in Canberra. The right honourable gentleman mentioned the recommendations made at that gathering, one being the class industries considered to be most essential, the locality of these essential industries, and the order of priority for their lishment. We know that a double line of railway is necessary from Albury Sydney. At the present time there is single line over one section. This should be duplicated or, better still, a branch line should be constructed from Junee to Stookinbingal to facilitate through traffic on that section of our railways. In another district there is a single-traffic crossing of the Hawkesbury River, a ferry punt on the main road from ney to Newcastle. If , during an gency, anything happened at that spot, Mr Nock. chaos would result, because, even under existing conditions, there is at times serious traffic congestion. The Government realizes this menace in time of national emergency, and proposes the construction of a second loopline, with additional roads and bridges, in order to provide freer access between north and south. Every honourable member will approve of this proposal. The hitch seems to be that the representatives of the Commonwealth and States could not reach an agreement about the committee being asked to suggest the order of priority. This somewhat parochial outlook should be removed, and we are all hopeful that soon there will be effective co-ordination and co-operation between the Commonwealth and State Governments on these important matters. These were the main points upon which I wished to touch. The Leader of the Opposition has produced no specific evidence of negligence, delay or oversight on the part of the Government. The only criticism which the honourable gentleman and his supporters have offered is that the Government is now doing too much with regard to defence, in view of the outcome of the Munich agreement. I contend that the Government's policy of safety comes from strength is a wise one. It is in the interests of the nation and is one which should have the conI fidence of all honourable members.",33
49,Mr HARRISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Wentworth) [2.4SJ. of - I was intrigued by the terms of the motion moved by the Leader of thh Opposition (Mr Curtin). I have given some study to its phrasing. The honorof able gentleman charged the Government with ""lamentable lack of leadership"". Those who have an intimate knowledge estabof recent events will appreciate the absurdity of this charge. As all honorto able memlbers are aware, the Leader of a the Opposition has come fresh from a Labour gathering in Sydney-at which he succeeded in convincing a conference to vote against him by some 500 votes to 46 votes-wit h the ""honours of victory"" upon him! We may assume that he possesses all - the qualifications of leadership, for did he not sucSydcessfully weld the two factions of emerLabour into one disunited whole? Surely a general of his capacity and qualifications should be capable of submitting a motion of want of confidence on the ground of ""lamentable lack of leadership "" ! Frankly, I am disappointed with the honourable gentleman, because if he has outstanding ability as a leader, one would have expected him to reveal it in a redblooded indictment of the Government. Instead, his attack on the Ministry is a poor, anaemic thing, with no red corpuscles in its structure. It is just a thing of shreds and patches. As an effective criticism of the Government, the honourable gentleman's speech was a lamentable failure. In his opening . remarks he declared that Labour had no confidence in this Government. May I ask if all sections of his own party have implicit confidence in his leadership of the Commonwealth Labour movement? Recent activity within that organization indicates that they have not. An influential section of the party has absolutely refused to acknowledge his leadership with regard ' to internal matters. If he. cannot hold his own party together how can he aspire to national leadership? How can one who has not displayed the qualities of ship in his own party challenge the Government on the same grounds? This statement of the position, I contend, poses entirely of the attack on the ment made by the honourable gentleman. What does the honourable gentleman offer to this House and to the country? Obviously no one would put forward a motion framed in the terms mentioned unless he were prepared to offer something which the Prime Minister has failed to give. Since the Leader of the Opposition is making a bid for national leadership, we are entitled to assume that he has"" something to offer the country. This is not so. The whole record of the Labour party has been such that it has occupied the treasury bench in this"" Parliament for only two years in the last 24 years.",34
50,Mr STAOEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,That was two years too many.,35
51,Mr HARRISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"As the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Stacey) has just interjected, it was two years too many, as I shall endeavour to prove before I resume my seat. Honourable members do not need to be reminded that Labour's term of office ended owing to a definite lack of leadership within the party. It was brought to a close owing to disagreement within the party and it is reasonable to assume that a similar fate would befall a future Labour government. When we remember the attitude of the various sections of Labour whenever defence measures have been introduced into this House, we get a pretty good idea of what Labour's defence policy means. Much has been said about its isolationist policy, which, we are told, would make Australia secure in time of emergency. That security, I point out, would be gained at the expense of the rest of the Empire. Labour's defence programme is but a pale shadow of what we on this side of the House consider Empire defence should mean. The Leader of the Opposition told us, in support of his contention that compulsory training should not be introduced, that voluntary training would be adequate in a well-managed country. "" Adequate "", in relation to defence, is to the honourable gentleman what that blessed word leader- "" Mesopotamia"" was to the unknown character in fiction. It gives him great support. Unfortunately for his party, dis- he was not very convincing. "" Adequate "" Governmay be construed to mean anything or nothing. By the last Labour Government it was construed to mean something much less than what we on this side consider offers a fair margin of safety to the Commonwealth. Action taken by the Labour party while occupying the treasury bench showed ignorance of the fundamentals of a true defence policy. The Labour Administration made such serious inroads into the defence programme that it prevented the building up of reserves, either in industry, armaments, or manpower. To be effective, a defence plan cannot be a thing of immediate growth. The expenditure of large sums of money on the purchase of aircraft, battleships, armaments, and on the training of men is necessary. Reserves upon which a defence plan can be built must be created. The action of the Scullin Government in drastically cutting down the defence vote prevented the establishing of the reserves. We have been told lately that a war in Europe would render Australia more vulnerable to attack. That statement came as a surprise to some honourable members because it presupposes that if the United Kingdom were not involved in a European conflict, Australia's safety would assured because the British Government would be able to come to our aid. That is the only interpretation that can be upon the statement.",35
52,Mr CURTIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If that is the only interformed.'] pretation which occurs to the honourable gentleman, his knowledge must be extremely limited.",36
53,Mr HARRIS ON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable gentleman speaks in such a manner as to make it difficult for any one to undertariff yesterday. stand just what he means. In this debate, he suggested that the Government was spending more on defence than it should.",36
54,Mr CURTIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not say that. said it was contemplating to spend more than this Parliament had been asked to vote.,36
55,Mr HARRISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable gentleman drew attention to the fact that conditions overseas today were much easier, and he claimed that the Government proposed at this juncture to spend on defence more money than was necessary according to the trend of events.",36
56,Mr CURTIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,No . I said that it was spending more than was provided for in the Estimates submitted to Parliament.,36
57,Mr HARRISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable gentleman cannot explain his remarks in any other way. He said that members of this House and the public in general were dissatisfied with the Government's leadership because of these things, and that the Ministry was being pilloried because of its inertia. If leadership means an ability to gauge public opinion, the charge made by the Leader of the Opposition fails, because the Prime Minister by his legislative proposals and his knowledge of public opinion, made a definite appeal to the nation. Indeed, the opinion is strongly held that .the Government should go further in its defence proposals. When the Leader of the Opposition failed, to present a case that might have provided food for thought, I naturally looked to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde), thinking that he would be able to give us something tangible. But, as happens always, that honourable gentleman dealt with tariff matters as if they had a connection with a motion of want of confidence. It was sheer temerity for the honourable be member to introduce such a subject in support of such a motion.",36
58,Mr FOBDB,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member put could not have been here, because I did not mention the tariff. [Quorum",36
59,Mr HARRISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member, with a banging of drums, told us what a wonderful job the Labour party had done with its tariff policy.",36
60,Mr FORDE,MOTION OF WANT OF,I did not mention the ,36
61,Mr HARRISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Eve n if I were not in the chamber, I could anticipate what the honourable member would say, because I we have listened to him so often. I was interested in the observations of the other half of the Labour party, which treated its federal leader so cavalierly on his visit to Sydney. Opinions were expressed, evidently with authority, by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) and the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan)-wh o so recently has moved across to the corner benches. These two honourable members have been reared under the protection of the British flag. They owe to it all that they possess, and are dependent on it for their future well-being, yet in a national chamber they deny the Mother Country and criticize its policies. They would deny their own mother. If that be the best which this section of the Labour party can provide in regard to defence, it is definitely lacking in leadership. The majority of honourable members will agree that my contention is logical has, and reasonable when I assert that no defence policy is capable of achieving immediate results,' and that there must be long-range planning. When the foundation has been, undermined, the task takes longer. If the plan be sound, if the fundamentals be correct, if the premises be solid, the ultimate result must be good. Those who criticize failure to achieve immediate results lack appreciation of what can be done by long-range planning. This Government has sought the advice of the best experts in the British Empire who, in matters of defence, may be regarded as entitled to precedence throughout the world. Its defence plan is based on the recommendations of those experts. There is no need to remind honourable members that it takes many years to produce the necessary armaments and gather the necessary supplies. There must be industrial planning, with the building of shadow factories, and the staffing of those factories. The required man-power and reserves must be raised. These matters cannot be finalized in a moment. The Labour party, and the critics of the Government outside of this Parliament, do not realise that immediate results cannot be achieved by any administration. I admit that the recent crisis disclosed many weaknesses in our defence system. * It was certain that it ""would, because we have not been obliged to go closely into the matter of national defence since the years 1914-19. The conditions have changed radically in the meantime. The centre of unrest was then in Europe, and there was no possibility of a challenge being issued to Australia. Our immediate neighbours were our allies, but today they are not. Therefore, the whole of our defence policy has to be altered. I take it that the weaknesses will be rectified. I believe that the Government completely understands what is required, and that in a short while it will develop a defence plan which will be quite satisfactory to Australia. I feel very strongly in regard to the matter of compulsory military training, but I am quite prepared, nevertheless, to support the Prime Minister if he considers that he is committed to a policy of voluntary training. In my opinion, we can achieve an efficiency of 100 per cent, only by means of compulsory military training. The voluntary system has had quite sufficient trial in Australia, and as it has not produced what was needed it should be discarded for a system of greater worth which will afford the rcciuisite security. In advocating compulsory military training, I am supporting what may be regarded as the basis of communal life. Every young man nf this nation should be prepared to pull his full weight in the defence of those things which go to make up communal life; it should not be left to the public-spirited only to volunteer their services. The communal basis is fundamental in every community, and every man should be compelled to pull his full weight.",36
62,Mr OTJRTIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"At making roads and bridges, and producing the other indispensables of life? Does the honourable member suggest that there should be an organized communal service to meet the requirements of the nation?",37
63,Mr HARRISON,MOTION OF WANT OF,"In all essential services there must ultimately be that control which I have suggested. The honourable gentleman knows that we shall approach that position; it is part and parcel of beliefs which he has expressed from time to time. He is prepared to nationalize everything for the sake of thf. country itself, yet he is not prepared to nationalize service. He is neither reasonable nor logical. He forgets that social services are of no value unless they can be protected. Without national regimentation for the protection of those services which he seeks to nationalize, - they would be worthless. The honourable gentleman has not reached the idealistic stage; he is a practical man with practical knowledge. All else is purely visionary, and is used merely for political expediency. It has been proved, although in the early days the proof was not apparent, that in all matters connected with national service and security man-power, ultimately, is paramount. It is necessary for us to have complete and adequate reserves of men to ensure the protection of Australia in aujr eventuality. I am not suggesting for a moment that universal service should be introduced with a view to participation in overseas defensive wars; that, I believe, should be left entirely to the will of the young men concerned; it has no direct bearing op their own country, but it has an indirect bearing, the value of which may be computed individually, and, therefore, the individual .should determine whether or not he shall volunteer for overseas service. That is a principle which I am prepared to support and advocate. But T say that for service within Australia for the security of the nation, there should be no.hesitation whatever in regimenting the younger men."" I feel that, any plan that may be formulated by the Government will not be successful or efficient unless the States are prepared to collaborate with the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth with the States. While we have several governments operating with individual sovereign rights, until there is recognition of responsibility for their development, and for the promotion of schemes which will make better and easier the social life of the community, there will be no efficiency in a national plan of defence. The first essential in any measure of defence is complete collaboration and co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth, but not along the lines followed by the conference held recently, which was used merely as a means for the expression of personal views. The different governments should appoint men of action who will be prepared to make recommendations out of which a complete plan may be evolved. - May I conclude by referring to some of the remarks of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), whose sjJcech I found very interesting. Most of the views voiced by the honourable member were excellent as ideals, but I suggest that they are far outside the realm of practical politics, with which we are concerned at the moment. The honourable gentleman expressed the opinion that a staff should be appointed to deal with trends, the value of which should be assessed and placed before the Minister concerned, who would take the matter to Cabinet, which would eventually determine what should be done. Surely, he is aware that machinery of this nature is already in existence, and that any Minister can delegate to a specialist in his department the task of watching these trends, and acquainting him with their value? Those who can best compute the value of these trends are the members of the Cabinet. Therefore, I suggest that, as we have in our own government departments, and in the Treasury, the means of gathering information regarding financial and commercial trends, both here and overseas, there is no need to set up a special organization for this purpose. We have our overseas trade commissioners to advise us regarding trade and financial affairs in other countries. The trouble is that though this Mr Harrison. information, or the means to acquire it, is already available, Cabinet Ministers are not likely to take advantage of it unless they see that there is some direct benefit to be gained. Perhaps I should not indulge in criticism, but I have a vivid recollection that certain embargoes were imposed at one time, not on the recommendation of our overseas trade commissioners, but in spite of their advice, and of the advice of officers within the departments themselves. All of the things suggested by the honourable member are inherent in good administration. A good administrator, if he does not find them to his hand, will create them. The honourable member said that if we did not apply more scientific methods to government, our democratic system must go under, to be succeeded, perhaps, by a totalitarian system of government. I remind him, however, that the very attributes which he suggests as essential to the success of a democracy are those which are conspicuously absent from the government of the totalitarian states. The existing Commonwealth departments can obtain all the information necessary, and it is the function of Cabinet to collate and co-ordinate this information. There is no need to go on creating one department after another, and for ever increasing the number of public servants. Even at the present time honourable members sometimes get lost amongst the mass of information which is available to them in the departments. Reports on various' matters are filed away and never looked at. If the administrator is not capable, the creation of new departments for collecting information will not be of any use to him; if he is capable there will be no need for the new departments in any case. I have much pleasure in supporting the Government. I do not intend to vote for this rather fantastic motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. I believe, as does the honourable member for Warringah, that the Leader of the Opposition himself has no faith in his own motion.",37
64,Mr HOLLOWAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Melbourne Ports) [3.20] - I am not a bit disappointed at the concluding statement of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison). I do not think that any one ever expected that he would support the motion. In my opinion, the fundamental issues when, led to the moving of this motion of want o;f confidence, have, not been seriously touched upon by honourable members who have spoken from the other side. It is quite certain that all of the Ministers, at any rate,, who have spoken, have studiously attempted to sidetrack the debate, so as - to keep away from the real problems, at issue, and confine it to. the two. questions, of - vyhether too. little or too much money has been spent on defence, and whether there has, indeed, been lack of leadership in the Government. Those were not the real grounds of attack, by the Opposition. They were merely incidental, except that, of course, one cannot describe defence preparations as being merely incidental. As for the question of leadership, what has that got to do with the Opposition? We do not care who leads the Government, nor do we care how many times Ministers are switched from one portfolio toanother, or how oftenisome are dropped and others appointed. The whole point, so far as we are concerned, is whether the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) and his colleagues are giving the country good government; whether they are courageously and efficiently tackling the problems they have to face, and giving effect to their election promises. I am not a bit concerned, nor is it my business, to worry about who the Minister for Defence may be this month or the month after. I am concerned with legislation and administration, and whether the Minister, whoever he may be, is carrying out the policy of the Government. We are concerned with policies, not with individuals. As a matter of fact, it is not the Opposition which has made so much of this matter of absence of leadership. It is a strange coincidence that the press of Australia, almost without exception, has ibeen attacking the Government because of its lack of leadership, and this is the same press that created the Government, and that always supported it until power became so evenly divided 'between the protectionist party and the free trade party within its ranks. That, perhaps, is the explanation for the change. Whatever She reason, the press that formerly supported this Government, and the one 'before it, is now unanimously telling the people of Australia that the Government is displaying; no leadership; that, there is . uo cohesion, no, unity and no. planned A policy, and that these things, are not possible because of bad leadership, Of course, it is not surprising that the attack should be made.. It has been obvious to every honourable member of. this House that, during the last year at least, the Government has utterly failed to bring before Parliament any planned or consistent policy. Every time Parliament meets-and , goodness knows it does not meet very frequently-the notice-paper is completely changed, and a new list of legislation is placed on the stocks, though the previous fist has not been completed. The Cabinet has been so rent with internal troubles that dt has lost all initiative. 'Strangely enough, after the launching of this, motion of want of confidence, the press of Australia has taken up the attack. It has not done so for the purpose of supporting the Opposition, of course, but the attack has synchronized with the moving of this motion. Mr Archie OAMERON.^Perhaps the Opposition knew what was. coming.",38
65,Mr HOLLOWAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"*We (lid not, nor are we particularly concerned with the newspapers' attack on the Government. For my part, I have no brief for one Minister as against another. I am in agreement with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin)' when he said we have no, special reason for condemning the Minister for Defence (M*. Thorby), (but we aye certainly opposed to the policy, or lack of policy, of the 'Government. I do not charge the Government with not expending enough money on defence; I make it clear at the outset that I think it is expending to "" much. When a government begins to expend on defence money which should be used for the internal development of the country, then, in my opinion, it is doing wrong. The?e is no need to sacrir floe the living standards of the people for the sake of this panicky defence scheme. The Government is expending much too rapidly on defence. It is making plans for more than the adequate defence of Australia. I make no excuse for saying that. When the Government suggests that more millions should be expended on defence, and that some of those millions should be provided out of the funds which - ordinarily the States would devote to their economic development, then it is time to call a halt, and that is where we are now, and where we should stop. I wish to follow up the arguments of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender), the only one on the Government side who has touched upon the internal economic problems of Australia. It is clear to observant persons that the economic barometer all over the world is falling. In spite of unprecedented expenditure on armaments, unemployment everywhere is on the increase,- and the aggregate wage share is getting less and less in Australia, as well as in other countries. Students of world affairs are predicting that this can end only in disaster. Honourable members cannot claim to be ignorant of these matters. The bulletins issued periodically from Geneva are available to them, and in these publications the situation is clearly set forth. I make no claim regarding them because they issue from Geneva, but it so happens that the League of Nations provides the only international machinery for the teaching of the world in regard to these matters. The experts who write in these bulletins point out that, while the volume of money expended on armaments has increased by an undreamed of amount, employment is all the time becoming less and less. Expenditure on armaments cannot solve the unemployment problem, either in Australia or abroad. Figures issued by our own Department of Statistics show that we are already entering upon another period of depression. Why was the recent Premiers Conference in Canberra a debacle? The circumstances were such that this conference should have been historic, but it ended in failure, and it failed because the Commonwealth Government placed certain unacceptable financial proposals before the Premiers, who knew as much, or more, about such matters as did the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Casey). The policy he put forward was one of extraction, repression and deflation. The money that he proposed to allow to the States to expend on normal peace-time projects for the economic development of this country was to be cut to the bone in Mr Holloway. favour of defence works. He offered as an excuse that the people who would have been employed on the normal developmental works would be absorbed into the manufacture of arms and munitions and into work on other defence projects. What was put before the Premiers was a declaration that peace-time operations could not be allowed to encroach upon the needs of defence. But the Premiers would not bow down. They refused the command and in doing so were watching the interests of the people of Australia. They would not allow themselves to be panicstricken into accepting the proposition that the whole of the energies of the Australian governments should be bent towards the defence, and away from the economic development, of this country. The Commonwealth Treasurer wanted a return to the old order of things and he , resented any suggestions from the State Premiers, who are at least as qualified as he is to give opinions on matters of public finance. If the Commonwealth Government wishes to go ahead with its defence programme it cannot adhere to iron-bound and obsolete methods of finance. I am supported in this by the Premier of New South Wales, Mr. Stevens, who when he was treasury officer of that State, was regarded as being one of the best treasury officers that it had ever had. He understands figures; he has been thoroughly educated in them; they are his profession, and, when he says that we cannot carry on with yesterday's methods in order to meet today's conditions, heed should be taken. I am not apt to agree with the Premier of New South Wales, because his politics and mine differ widely, but in the respect which I have just mentioned he has my ful l support. The only quarrel I have with him in this matter is that he is '20 years behind the time. The honourable gentleman was justified in risking the collapse of the conference in advancing his facts, because what he said is almost a fundamental of present-day economics. It is tedious to have to repeat what has been said so often about the last war and its aftermath, but the Australian people must be warned that we are steadily drifting back to the predicament which was brought about by that war. No matter how we may try, we cannot forget the vast number of men who were killed and wounded in that conflict, the thousands who are still in hospitals and sanatoriums, and the fact that, although 20 years have elapsed since its cessation, the cost of repatriation, far from failing, as one would expect after such a long period of time, is still increasing. We must not forget these things; but for the purposes of this debate I shall confine myself to the financial aspect. We are told that the last war cost us in money-apar t from the thousands of young Australians killed£850,000,000. We have already paid £350,000,000' and we are still paying £19,000,000 per annum almost entirely in interest. As the result of the policy of this Government we are drifting into a set of circumstances which will, even though we do not actually engage in war, and may never be at war, produce a financial aftermath similar to that of the last war. That being so, the Opposition is justified in attacking the Government and charging it with having lost the confidence of the people of Australia. By the expenditure of millions of pounds hurriedly on defence equipment, this Government will pile up an interest burden that will not be paid off when the ships, guns and every other piece of ordnance will have been scrapped as obsolete and useless, and long before we have ceased paying the £19,000,000 a year in interest and sinking fund towards the cost of the last war. I object to giving the Defence Department a blank cheque to be filled in as its experts desire. The statements made by the Treasurer in reply to the policy enunciated by Mr Stevens were the most foolish and ridiculous that have ever been made by a responsible Minister. All of the evidence is against the Commonwealth Treasurer and in favour of the Premier of New South Wales. In reply to the assertion by Mr. Stevens, to which no one could really object, that the financial policy of the Commonwealth must be altered to meet the conditions which operate today, the Treasurer merely repeated the stereotyped assertion that the Commonwealth Government-must not interfere with the Commonwealth Bank Board, that the bank board's policy is distinct from the operations of the Commonwealth Government, and that political influences must never be brought to bear on the Commonwealth Bank Board, it being sacrosanct. When honourable members in this House ask that credits be made available in order to solve the unemployment problem, the Treasurer says that it cannot be done for the reason that the Commonwealth Bank Board is beyond interference. None the less, the Treasurer declares that there is no limit to the amount of money which the Commonwealth Government may expend on the Defence Department; the defence authorities are to be given a blank cheque to be filled in as they desire. But the money to be spent upon our peace time works is to be cut down, and the people of Australia will never consent to that. My charge against this Government is that it has not honoured the promises that it made at the last election, and has not been moral in the way in which it has failed to implement the international conventions which its representatives have signed. For years past our delegates have gone from this Parliament charged with the responsibility to vote in favour of certain conventions and they have done so. Whilst other governments in the world have gradually but surely given effect to the conventions to which Australia is a party, this Government has consistently refrained from following their lead. As the result our delegates have been loath to attend the international conferences because of the ridicule which attaches to their signing of conventions which the Government of Australia will never carry out. In proof of the correctness of what I say I need cite only the international convention in respect of hours of labour. The countries represented at the conference which drafted that convention, the design of which was to meet the unemployment problem, which is the greatest problem confronting the world today, have mostly given effect to it, but not Australia. The right honourable member for North Sydney(Mr Hughes), himself a member of the Commonwealth Ministry, admits that the convention should be given effect. He has been chastised in Cabinet because he has given voice to that opinion. The Premier of New South Wales also is aware that the solution of the unemployment problem is the greatest need in the world today, and, in order to approach its solution in Australia, he has advocated a sound policy, which the Commonwealth Treasurer has treated with scorn.. At the last two elections - the Prime Minister in his policy speeches promised that money would be made available to the State governments and municipalities for the construction of homes for workers. That promise has never been honoured. The honourable member for Parramatta (Sir Frederick Stewart) returned from a trip abroad to talk in this Parliament about what the Government of the United Kingdom was doing to provide aid to municipal authorities in Great Britain to carry out a long-range housing scheme, the cost of which will be £700,000,000. That scheme has been in operation for three years and millions of new homes have been built. Tens of thousands of houses are being erected every six months as the result of the subsidies given by the British Government to the municipalities. The new homes in some municipalities are more than the number of homes that were within them before the scheme was put into operation. I know of one municipality in England where there are as many new homes as there were old, all as the result of the British Government's housing scheme. This Government has not only neglected to carry out its promise to assist the States in the development of a housing plan, but also has failed to do anything on its own account. There are 30,000 basic wage-earners in the Postal Department for whom the Commonwealth Government could build homes, but it will do nothing. A further promise was that the Comties monwealth Government would take homes. definite action to improve the lot of 60,000 youths in Australia who have never worked.",39
66,Mr WHITE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member exaggerates. The number was 25,000 and the Commonwealth Government provided hundreds of thousands of pounds for them. Mr Tlollowan.",42
67,Mr HOLLOWAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"No . This Government has done nothing. The honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) has on many occasions spoken about its neglect to tackle the problem of the unemployed youth, but has never received any satisfaction. The Government is deserving of censure for the way in which it appoints costly commissions whose reports are never discussed in this Parliament, which, if it had the opportunity, could decide either to take action or not to take action. One commission that was appointed was the commission which inquired into the high costs of petrol. The commission was appointed after a welter of agitation on the part of the people, took evidence and presented two reports, a majority report and a minority report, both of which caused controversy amongst the people. This Parliament has never had an opportunity to discuss those reports because they were pigeonholed. The same strictures can be made concerning the pigeon-holing of the report by the monetary and banking commission. We, on this side, do not agree with all of the finding of that commission, but we are satisfied that many features of the report, if given effect to, would considerably help Australia. Not one single recommendation in the report that is of any value to the people of Australia has been given effect to by the Government. Not only did the Government propose to do something to enable people to provide homes for themselves, but a proposal was also under consideration for the making of advances to persons in need. Before that could be given effect to, however, a conference took place between the Treasurer and the representatives of the associated banks. Nothing came out of it that was of any value. The private banks evidently had no intention to make advances to governments or municipalito assist working people to purchase The suggestion that small the advances should be made to help persons in temporary financial difficulty was, apparently, considered at the conference which the Treasurer held with the representatives of the banks, for one private bank is now experimenting in this matter. It has agreed to make loans of £50 to borrowers who are willing to make repayments at £1 a week, the idea being that the whole transaction shall be completed within a calendar year. The honourable member for Eiverina (Mr Nock) told us this afternoon that the Government' has decided to proceed with its proposal to establish a mortgage branch of the Commonwealth Bank. This will mean, of course, that the Commonwealth Bank will be expected to assume responsibility for the liabilities, overdrafts and mortgage obligations of certain people. The Government has agreed to take these bad debts from the shoulders of the private bankers and pass them on to the people. In other words, the associated banks will free themselves of this bad business, but will retain all the business that is profitable. There is clear evidence in Australia, as well as in other countries, that the world heading towards another depression. The snowball is beginning to roll. Even in Australia, the number of persons in employment is less this year than it was last year, less now than it was ten years ago, and less in September than it was in March. In Victoria, 10,000 more persons were unemployed in September than in March. The amount of wages paid this year was less than the amount paid seven years ago. The amount of wages paid par capita has dropped from £208 seven years ago to £179 last year.",42
68,Mr WHITE,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member must bo aware that the percentage of unemployment in Australia has been reduced from 30 per cent, to 7 per cent.",43
69,Mr HOLLOWAY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I know all about those figures. The depression through which the country passed* several years ago began in Europe. The ripples of it took a long time to reach the coast of Australia, but they eventually reached itThe report, from the International Labour Office, to which I have just referred, shows that already in Great Britain, in spite of an improvement of the quantity and value of the output of production, and in spite of the added impetus given to industry in consequence of the augmented output of war materials, munitions and ships, the volume of employment is falling. Fewer people were employed in Great continue his speech. Britain and in the United States of America last year than in the previous year. The percentage of efficiency has gone up, but the workers' share of the wages fund has gone down. The report indicates that it is useless to expect expenditure on armaments to result in a balanced budget. It may be true that every technical man engaged in the metal trades throughout the world is in employment today; but that is the only class of employee who can find work. People engaged in other industries will benefit very little by the expenditure on armaments. Just recently the manager of the aircraft factory in Melbourne told me that he could give employment to 500 more semi-skilled and unskilled men if he could get 30 or 40 more engineers. That is the situation all over the world. Unemployment is increasing day by day. In England during the last seven years, is the efficiency of man-power has increased by 14 per cent., and in the United States of America the efficiency of the workers has increased by 24 per cent. The report reveals that in spite of the extra money being expended on arms and munitions in Great Britain, the people out of work are not being absorbed. We need ordinary peace-time public works to give effective employment to our people. We must proceed with a normal developmental programme. The Commonwealth Government requested the Premiers Conference a few days ago to concentrate its attention on a programme of defence works. That was why the conference was abortive. We cannot have it both ways in this respect any more than in other respects. If the amount of money paid in wages and salaries falls and the number of people in employment decreases, the volume and value of output become subordinate considerations. The report shows that the pole representing production is getting higher and the pole representing consumption is falling lower. The gap between them is growing wider. That kind of thing inevitably leads to depression.",43

72,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Denison) [ 4 . 0 ] - I support the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr C u r t in ). I make no apology for the criticism which I shall level against the Government for the manner in which it has governed this country. One has only to read the newspapers during the last two or three days to discover the disruption that exists amongst the members of the Ministry and the utter dissatisfaction which is apparent amongst the supporters of the Government. One can only come to the conclusion that the people' of Australia have lost confidence in the Government, and that it has fallen down badly on its job. I - have always paid particular attention to the defence policy of the Government and the manner in which it has. attempted to put it into execution. Shortly after .. 28 the return of Ministers from abroad, the .. 37 Commonwealth Government convened a conference of State Premiers in order to 9 formulate a defence policy and to seek the co-operation of the States in its AYES. implementation. The States agreed to forgo their loan moneys if the Commonwealth Government carried out defence works in lieu of the public works which normally would have been carried out by the State governments. Subsequently, however, the States found that they had been "" sold a pup "" ; the Commonwealth Government let them down. In my opinion the Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby) was largely responsible for that. In order to cajole the States into acceptance of the Commonwealth's plan he told the State Premiers that if NOES. they agreed to it the defence works which would be put into operation would help to relieve unemployment. I recognize, of course, that money expended in the northern part of Australia has a beneficial effect on Australia as a whole, including the southern part of Australia ; but at the same time. I remind the Minister for Defence that the extreme southern parts of Australia are just as much in need of the provision of public works for the relief of unemployment as the northern parts. Eighteen months ago the then Minister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill , placed £37,000 on the Estimates for fortification of the River Derwent. The need for such fortification was recognized by the military advisers of the Government as important in any scheme for the defence of the Commonwealth. No attempt has been made to carry'out that work; and for that I hold the Minister for Defence blameworthy. I endeavoured to ascertain the reason why the work had not been proceeded with, and I was informed by an official of the Defence Department that it was vetoed by some one over the Minister for Defence.",44
73,Mr THORBY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"""Who is "" over"" the Minister for Defence?",44
74,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"F r o m all that we have heard it appears that some one will shortly be over the Minister for Defence. I understand, however, that the Minister's instructions were vetoed.",44
75,Mr THORBY,MOTION OF WANT OF,That is not so.,44
76,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,Then the Minister has fallen down on his job.^,45
77,Mr THORBY,MOTION OF WANT OF,To what work'does the honourable member refer?,45
78,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The Minister knows very well that eighteen months ago an amount of £37,000 was placed on the Estimates to carry out necessary defence works in Tasmania. If he does not know what those works are, I shall tell him.",45

82,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,-But it has not been put in hand.,45
83,Mr THORBY,MOTION OF WANT OF,We must undertake works in their order of importance.,45
84,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I see that the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence (Mr. Street) is prompting the Minister. I warn him that he might lead him astray. The provision of this money was sanctioned by the Parliament, and on the advice of tfye Government's defence advisers the work was to be put in hand. In my opinion, the Minister for Defence is not big enough to carry out the job which he has undertaken. I do not wish him to regard this as a personal attack upon him, but rather as fair criticism of his attempt to administer one of the most important portfolios in the Ministry. If he has not sufficient staff, it is his job see that his staff is augmented. Is it not correct that the Minister promised the Premier of Tasmania that if ' the States agreed to the Commonwealth's proposal, defence works would take the place of works normally financed by the States and absorb the unemployed?",45

91,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Withi n the last twelve months. I made representations to the Minister of the Interior (Mr. MCEwen) in regard to this statement, but his department is still understaffed. What is the use of going to the expense of bringing the Defence Department to Canberra if fortifications required for the defence of this country cannot be proceeded with? That, in my opinion, is a hocus-pocus policy. These are the actual facts, and because of them. I say that the Minister is not carrying out his job. Because pressure has been brought to bear by the more prosperous States, and because he is sympathetic to Nationalist State governments and antipathetic to Labour governments, the more prosperous States are enjoying more than their fair share of the defence works.",45
92,Mr STREET,MOTION OF WANT OF,Does not the honourable member think that there should be some degree of priority?,45
93,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes , and I say that the fortifications on Bruny Island should have been given priority over other defence works, because the money to put them in band was voted no less than eighteen months ago. If the Commonwealth Government cannot do its job, it should ask the State governments to 'undertake it. That is my conception of co-operation. If the Government were to prepared to seek the co-operation of the States in that way, it would have my wholehearted support. The Government has. made no provision of necessary equipment for the training of additional volunteers in the citizen forces in Tasmania.",45

99,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I received the information from an official upon I can rely. The Commonwealth GovernCurtin). ment later convened another conference of State Premiers to discuss the defence programme. What happened? It was washout, because the Commonwealth wanted the States to do work which i should have done. Defence preparations are the task of the Commonwealth Gosary vernment, and it is its duty to see all the necessary defence works are ried out. It has a majority in both Houses of this Parliament, and there no excuse for its failure to give effect its stated policy. Instead of fighting over portfolios, Ministers should get on with their job; but it seems that honourable members opposite are animated solely a desire to share in Ministerial honours. I have watched the international ation very closely. When the Attorneydefend General (Mr Menzies), the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) and the Minister for Commerce (Sir Earle service, Page) returned from their trip overseas they came back with nothing but big ideas. When the Attorney-General was in Germany, he apparently wanted to Nazi. Upon his return to Australia, he said that Germany's policy for the supdisgrace. pression of democracy and the strangling of Europe was the right one. He attacked the Minister for Defence, and said that that gentleman was not capAn able of carrying on his job, his idea being to discredit him so that he might achieve the ambition of securing that portfolio. The honourable member foT Henty (Sir Henry Gullett) also attacked the honourable gentleman. I know that United Australia party Ministers are prewas pared to prop him up in return for the support of the Country party. I have said previously that one of the worse things ever done was the bartering of army. the portfolio of Defence for the support of the Country party. A defence policy cannot be carried out in that way. principles of Fascism have been introduced into this House, and have the port of ministerial members. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison) this afternoon advocated the industrial conscription of the manhood this country.",46

The honourable member for carBarton (Mr Lane) abused honourable members on this side in a most shocking is manner. I am surprised that they allowed to him to "" get away with it."" He was supported by ex-Ministers, who are antagonistic to us because we believe in by voluntary enlistment for the defence of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition has definitely stated that the Labour situparty would take adequate measures to this country.

To-day, every country is armed to the teeth, notwithstanding the mis-statement that the last war was a war to end war. Some of the most eminent statesmen in the world have said that the conditions of Europe will determine the ideas of Europe. I say that the conditions of Australia will determine the ideas of the Australian people. I have never heard any member of the Labour party say that he would not be prepared to defend Australia should the occasion to do so arise.

If it were to establish an army of defence, the members of which would be paid the wages they would receive in industry, it would secure all the volunteers it required; but no one will volunteer to work for nothing. Every successful country today has such an army. The aim of the Government is to relieve the wealthy of the obligation to ptiy for the defence of this country, and to have it defended by the sons of poor people. I realise that a plan must be laid down. I have never shirked my obligation to do everything possible for the adequate defence of this country, but I shall not consent to its mankind being sent to Europe or Asia to be slaughtered for the benefit of foreign interests.

110,Mr MAHONEY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"My military advisers tell me that there is great weakness in the defence of this country, and that it lies in the Minister for Defence himself. Loving this country and its people, I desire that there shall be no weak link. If the Minister for Defence were a true patriot, he would stand aside and say that, as he was the weak link in the defence system and was not capable of carrying out the job, it should be undertaken by another. I would always act in that way in the interests of my country. To-day I heard the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) attack a man who is not now a member of this Parliament. That was a cowardly act; no man should be attacked behind his back. I say in fairness to the exrMinister for Defence, Sir Archdale Parkhill, that his word was his bond; if he said he would do anything, - he did it. He was a very capable man. I should like the Minister for Defence to explain why he has refused to accede to the request of the Premier of Tasmania, the Chamber of Commerce, and other representative persons and bodies, to make an aeroplane available so that the young men of Tasmania may be trained in aviation and thus be fitted to take their place in the defence of Australia. Quite recently, the Premier of Tasmania communicated with the Prime Minister on this matter. The Minister has mentioned the guns that have been placed along the coast of Australia. The only place he forgot to mention is the little island of Tasmania. Then there is the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt), another military genius, who was courageous enough to train as a soldier, but who failed to men remain in the forces. He should be today playing a leading part in the Citizen Forces, demonstrating to the young men that a member of Parliament is prepared to take his place side by side with them in the defence of the country. I give credit to the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin). He is still a general, and walks with the rank and file in processions. He is not a "" sooler "" like the honourable member for Fawkner, who is prepared to conscript the boys of Australia, but who is not game enough to be in the forces himself. The Attorney-General was a young man capable of going to the last war. He was in favour of conscription then, and he believes ""in it today, but the only thing he did for the defence of his country during the war was to duck an anticonscriptionist in the pond in the grounds of the Melbourne University. The Minister for Defence was eligible to go to the last war. He should have shown his patriotism at that time, and then he could have said, "" I fought for my country, and I believe that every man in Australia should be prepared to do the same "". Those whom I have mentioned, however, are not logical. They belong to ""the "" Be "" brigade, like myself. They will be here when the soldiers go away, and they will be here when they come back. I now come to one of the most important features of our defence policy, namely, the attitude towards it of the young men of this country. What has the Government done during the last sis or eight years to make the young men of Australia feel that they have a country for which they should be prepared tosacrifice their lives, if necessary? And it is the youth of Australia who will defend it when the time comes; it will not be those over 40 years of age. If the Government wishes to make Australia safe from any threat of invasion, it must give to the youth of the country the right to participate in industry, and to enjoy some of the good things of life. They must be given the right to earn a living, and to make a stake in the country for themselves, such as we old fogeys have. Far from having done that, however, the Government has denied them the right to work. I know men 26 years of age who have not done a day's work in their life.",47

113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MOTION OF WANT OF, The honourable member has exhausted his time.,48
114,Mr GREGORY,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Swan) [4.37] - Re - it? garding the general question before the House, I have nothing to say whatever. I wish to discuss only the subject of defence, which is the only one of any moment with which we are now concerned. It is desirable that we should consider the attitude of the Labour party to defence, and particularly the pronouncements of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), setting forth the policy of his party. That honourable gentleman seemed rather proud of the term, "" peace by negotiation "". He even"" claimed that his party was the originator of it ; but I do not think that there is very much to boast of in that. How could the Labour party hope to negotiate successfully and peacefully with any eastern power's demand on the subject of the White Australia policy unless we had some power to support our policy? Even with the full strength of the signatory powers behind it, the League of Nations was not able to achieve anything by peaceful negotiation when Abyssinia and China were attacked. What was necessary in both instances was that the countries concerned should have been in a position to protect themselves. The Leader of the Opposition said that we should not be dragged into war merely to uphold one form of government as against another. The whole tenor of the Labour party's policy is to the effect that Australia should take all it can from Great Britain and the Empire but give nothing in return. Its policy is wholly anti-British' so far as defence is concerned. I do not believe for a moment that the people of Australia would endorse that policy. It must be apparent to any thinking person that Australia, with its huge and its small population of less than who 7,000,000 people, could not possibly itself from attack by one of the totalitarian states without the help of the British Navy. Any one who believes we could is living in a fool's paradise. According to the Opposition, the best service that Australia can render the Empire is to attend to its own busiThe Leader of the Opposition said that we should prepare to protect ourselves. But how are we to do He does not appear to be prepared to make any sacrifice. Conditions throughout the world have changed tremendously in recent years, and the position of Australia has been gravely altered as a result. When the Empire parliamentary delegation from Australia was abroad three years ago, we were in Home when it was announced that Mr. Eden, the then Foreign Secretary in the Government of Great Britain, had asked the French Government whether, in the event of war with Italy, the ports and dockyards of France would be available to the British Navy. A declaration of war seemed imminent, but then it was discovered that, because of Britain's disarmament policy, the defences of the country had been so weakened that it would have been dangerous to attack Italy. The Prime Minister, and other Ministers, have been abroad during the last few years, and some of them have visited Germany, Italy, and other European countries. They must have learned something of the changed' situation in regard to world politics, and I have been surprised that, since their return, they have failed to tell the people the truth regarding these matters. Professor Berriedale Keith, an authority on international affairs, has written a history of events from the signing of the Versailles Treaty up to the present time. In the preface to that book he makes this astounding statementA very important declaration of his conception of the duty of a government by Mr. Baldwin on November 12th, elaborated on November 18th, revealed to a rather astonished world the fact that he had realized two years earlier the deficiency of British defence preparations, but had not attempted to remedy them because of the risk of loss of popularity and of seats at the general election. His doctrine, however, seems to have satisfied his followers and to go far to establish the principle that leaders should follow rather than seek to guide public opinion. The plausibility of this theory, if restricted to the sphere of domestic affairs, disappears when applied to external relations, for it is in the nature of things inevitable that the public has far too little knowledge of foreign relations to be able to form any intelligent judgment as to the needs of defence, and that it is peculiarly incumbent on Ministers in all matters falling within that sphere to take the initiative even at the risk of unpopularity. The Prime Minister, and other Ministers, must have realized the change that had come over the situation, and its effect upon the security of Australia. Do they, like Mr Baldwin, consider that the people should be kept in ignorance in regard to these strange conditions, fearing that it may have unfavorable political repercussions? Until the last year or two, we always felt confident that we could obtain ample assistance from outside in the event of Australia being attacked. That is not by any means so sure now. The policy of Australia makes us liable to attack by other countries. There is the White Australia policy, which tends to antagonize the people of India, China, Japan, and other Eastern countries. Then there is the policy of high protection and trade diversion, which has created a great deal of antagonism. We must recognize, therefore, that we are liable at any time to be attacked, and this makes it all the more necessary that those in - positions , of trust should tell the people of the dangers, which they have to face. I have an extract from the Sydney Morning Herald of the 17th October last on the obligation of secrecy, which readsMr W. J. Hands, who was Controller of the Ministry of National Service in Britain in 1918, said in an interview yesterday that public opinion in Australia was far out of touch with the actual state of affairs in England - and Europe, and it was a pity that the British Official Secrets Act prevented English visitors to this country from telling Australia just what was the real state of affairs. Mr Hands, who reached Sydney on Saturday in the Empire Star, said that Federal Ministers, who hod recently been in England, were in touch with European affairs, but it was a criminal shame that the public was not taken into the confidence of the Governments. It is a shame- I do not say a criminal shame-that those Ministers who have first-hand knowledge of the difficulty which confronted Mr Chamberlain recently when he made that courageous trip to Germany should not come into the open and take the people into their confidence. We know that more population is necessary and that it is also necessary 1 that this country should be well protected, and we want to do everything possible for the purpose of developing our defences. The August issue of M u f t i publishes an editorial in which the following paragraph appears:The need for trained men is indicated. In the near future, it might become imperative. What then would he the fate .of a government that had had the opportunity to raise and train an adequate defence force but lacked the necessary political courage; and what the late of the untrained young manhood of Australia? Just imagine what would happen, in the event of a sudden call to the colours, to our boys if they were not trained. It is outrageous that such a position might possibly arise. I have always believed in compulsory military service. I believe that it has a good disciplinary effect quite apart from the military viewpoint. I subscribe to the belief that, if necessary, the Constitution should be altered to make impossible the conscription of our men to fight overseas, but they must be trained to defend Australia. The returned soldiers who went through the last war and know the tragedies and horror of warfare, and whose only desire is for the efficient defence of this country, carried the following resolution at the Victorian conference of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia:That this conference, representative of returned soldiers in this State, registers its emphatic disapproval at the attitude of the Minister for Defence towards suggestions for the introduction of universal military training, and views with anxious misgivings the future of the Commonwealth.. and so on, strongly urging that-we should have universal training in Australia. It is in support of that that I rose to speak. Changes in the international situation seriously endanger Australia that it is incumbent upon us to make every effort to make this country secure. God knows what would happen if, in the event of invasion of Australia, the British Navy were unable to give us speedy assistance.",48
115,Mr GREEN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Kalgoorlie) [4.50] listened very attentively to the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) and I regret that I was unable to follow argument in respect of the part played the Australian Labour party in defence.

116,Mr GREEN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That was many years ago. The policy of the Labour party is one for the most adequate defence of this country, but it does subscribe to the policy of peace by negotiation, and it is not alone in doing so. All honourable members know that it was the policy of peace by negotiation espoused by the Prime Minister of England, Mr Chamberlain, that saved this country and Europe from being precipitated into war. If the honourable member for Swan had his way we should have been at war in defence of Czechoslovakia, which we could not have helped, and another vast amount of war debt would have been added to the £700,000,000 which we still owe in respect of the last war.  been thousands more dead.",50
117,Mr GREEN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Yes . Fortunately for the world Mr Chamberlain believes in peace .by negotiation. The honourable member for Swan accused this party of being lacking in so political courage. In what way? In what way does the Lahour party's defence policy 'become less effective than that of the party which he blindly follows? an The honourable gentleman claims that he is not in favour of the voluntary military training system, but for the last seven years he has been a supporter of a Go- I vernment which has made no move to substitute a compulsory system. Even yesterday the Prime Minister ,.(Mr. his Lyons) .announced himself in favour of by continuing the voluntary system. I do not intend to labour the defence question, our position is clear. We are prepared to defend Australia against any enemy coming to our shores. That policy is beginning to have the support of not That only some honourable gentlemen opposite but also men of high place in the Defence Department itself. If we in Australia prepared to protect 10,000 miles of coastline and a sparsely populated country against an invader, and thereby defend a key position in the southern hemisphere, we undertake a courageous task. We could not depend on the British Navy, if Britain were engaged in a war in Europe, to come to our assistance if Australia were being attacked; we should have to defend ourselves. It does not require any imagination to realise that. The motion of want of confidence was based not on what this Government has or has not done in respect of defence, but on the fact that the Government is lacking in leadership. The Prime Minister very adroitly refrained from attempting to reply to that aspect of the matter. With all the blarney that he has at his command, he set off on a different tack in order to show that so much more money bad been expended on defence since the Labour party vacated office than before. He cited facts and figures to show that this Government had expended more on defence than had been expended by the Scullin Government of which the right honourable gentleman himself was a member. I shall not dwell on the right honourable gentleman's change of allegiance because I have dealt with that matter before. I take this opportunity, however, to impress upon the Government that it could increase the numbers of voluntary military trainees, if it thinks it necessary, if it paid them for the job as the honourable member for Denison (Mr Mahoney) suggested it should do.",50
118,Mr RANKIN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Will the employers give them leave?,51
119,Mr GREEN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"If they will not i not beyond the power of this Parliament to pass legislation that will compel ployers to release volunteer trainees attend camps. The attitude of the ployers towards allowing employees time to attend camp has been a difficulty in the past. It requires a certain temperahappened ment for a man to offer himself for miliwas tary training, but if any one does first needs to be assured that his job will be safe. He cannot be blamed for that, and, in the circumstances, it is responsibility of the Government to see that he is fully protected.",51
120,Mr ISTREET,MOTION OF WANT OF,'Can the honourable ber suggest any sum that they should paid?,51
121,Mr GREEN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I should say that it should be more than it was 50 years ago, when I as a, perhaps, misguided youth was a member of the militia and travelled regularly seventeen miles back and forth on certain nights to attend drijl. We were paid 2s. 6d. for night parades, 5s. for Saturday afternoon parades, and 10s. for all-day parades. I should say that the payments should be more liberal now. The Labour party has been charged that when the right honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) was Prime Minister it reduced the amount of money that was being expended on defence by its predecessors, but the Bruce-Page Government, foreseeing the period of recession, set aside for expenditure on defence in 1928-29 only £3,600,000. At that time our population was 1,000,000 less than it is today, and consequently our danger was greater. * When the Scullin Labour Government abolished compulsory military training in 1929 the whole system was farcical. At that time when trainees were ordered to turn right they turned left and did other similar ridiculous things. Many of the men who would have been glad to participate in a properly organized system of training were disgusted with things as they were. The idea of Australians with a vote forcing young Australians who had no vote to engage in a compulsory system of training was objectionable. I well remember that in Boulder City on one occasion young fellows who were by t is no means slackers stationed their buglers on the dumps of the mines to emsignal when the police were about and, to in the meantime, they broke the windows emof the drill halls and in other ways showed their entire disrespect for unpopular officers. The same kind of thing elsewhere. When that system abolished the honourable member for so he Balaclava (Mr White), who was most hostile to the change, said that under a voluntary system we would not get 10 the per cent, of the number of men we required. He accused me of being a slacker, and said many other unkind memthings about me. But although he has be since been a member of the Cabinet for many years, he has not raised his voice in the House once to advocate a return to compulsory military training. He has been quite content to "" sit pretty"" and rely upon the voluntary system. The honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), who was also a strong believer in compulsory military training, said lot of nasty things about me and my leagues at that time. He accused the Government of having wilfully and maliciously abolished our defence His conduct since shows that his remarks must have been for the purposes political stunt, for he also has been member of the Cabinet and, so far as know, did not urge the Government to revert to compulsory military training. The Bruce-Page Government practiappeared cally suspended compulsory military training between 1921 and 1929. When the Scullin Government came into office Australia was supposed to have 371 trainter ing centres; but actually it""had only We were supposed to have 47,000 trainees in service, but actually we found only 7,000 attended drill on a Saturday States of America. afternoon. I cannot say that I was prised, for unless a man is a keen shot he does not wish to go to the rifle range every Saturday. About 40,000 of the trainees at that time watched or played football or other sports or went out with their girls, on Saturday afterplanes noons, and I cannot blame them very much for doing so. The plain fact is that, although the honourable member for Bala clava rattled his sword in its scabbard that time, and, as a military officer under oath to support the activities of the Defence Department, very severely criticized what was being done, he has since had ample opportunity to effect change of policy, but has taken no steps to do so as far as we are aware. In my opinion the Government made a wise decision when it declared that it would adhere to the compulsory system. I do not know how successful the present Minister for Defence is in his administrative work. I know, however, that his predecessor in office n very approachable man. We could always discuss defence matters with him, America. and obtain a certain amount of satisfaction. .If we asked questions in the House we received fairly satisfactory Mr Oreen. - answers. At any rate, we could be sure that what he told us was in accordance with the facts. I regret to say that the present Minister for Defence seems to regard every question asked him as a personal affront. Those who ask quesa tions of the honourable gentleman must colbe prepared to be browbeaten, and honourable members do not like that. Moreover, the information given to force. us by him. is not as correct as it could be. Not long ago, when of a the British Government was under a contract to supply Australia with a cerwe tain number of Avro-Anson aeroplanes, the deliveries were much behind schedule. Great Britain was, of course, anxious to strengthen its own force. A statement in the press on a certain day to the effect that Britain was purchasing machines from the United States of America. I thereupon asked' the Minisfor Defence whether the press state42. ment was correct, and, if so, whether Australia should not also purchase that some machines from the United Possibly the surBritish Government had discovered rifle that the American machines were more satisfactory than British machines for defence purposes, and in dealing with such a matter efficiency is the first consideration. Undoubtedly the defence that 'Australia obtained from Great Britain a few years ago were far less satisfactory than those obtained from America. We had many accidents with 1 at the British aeroplanes that could.not be said to be due to mistakes by pilots. The fact is, that the British aeroplanes were not suitable for the long-distance travelling in Australia. When I asked whether a the Government would consider purchasing some machines from America, the Minister said that it would not. If the honourable gentleman had wished to avoid giving a definite answer to the question he could have said that Government policy was involved. Actually, we find now that his statement was incorrect, for the Prime Minister has informed us was that 50 Lockheed bombers are to be obtained from the United States of Let me give another instance of incorrect information being given in reply to questions. Not long ago the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) asked whether certain statements that the Government intended to increase the number of trainees under - the voluntary system was correct, and he was told that there was no truth whatever in them. We now find that there was a great deal of truth in them. I can .quite understand that it may not be wise, in the public interests, to divulge certain decisions in relation to the Defence Department; but that is no justification for giving honourable members incorrect information in reply to questions. The honorbale member for Henty, the honourable member for Balaclava, and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis), who have declared themselves as keen advocates for compulsory military training, have all been members of the Government, and the honourable member for Balaclava is still a member of it. If they are so keen on compulsory military training, why do they not make a public declaration in the House to that effect, and bring their influence to bear upon the Government obtain an alteration of the present policy ? Our charge against the Governmentthat it is leaderless-d s undoubtedly true, for members of the Cabinet have been telling one another in the last few weeks that the great need of the country leadership. The Attorney-General (Mr. Menzies), with great courage, went to Sydney recently and made a speech to this effect. I do not know whether it would be quite correct to say that he bearded the lion in his den, but at any rate he made it very clear that the country needed leadership. The Treashould surer (Mr Casey) has made similar stateto ments. In fact, our need of leadership 1 has been shouted from the housetops. Owing to the lack of effective leadership we are surely entitled to information which will enable us to determine whether our defence expenditure of £16,000,000 this year, as against £3,000,000 ten years ago, is being wisely directed. We have good reason for believing that in certain respects, at any rate, we are not getting value for our money. Men whose word can trust, who were once officers of Defence Department, but are now not employed there, have assured me that many of the units of our Air Force are so much junk.",51
122,Mr BRENNAN,MOTION OF WANT OF,Was not the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Green) Minister for Defence at one time ?,53
123,Mr GREEN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"I was. These AvroAnson planes are on loan from the British Government. We have had experience of gift cruisers and gift submarines in the past; unfortunately they proved to be of second-rate material. These Avro-Ansons take so long to reach the necessary altitude for bombing purposes that the pilots would be shot to pieces by modern machines long beforethey would be able to reach their objective. No pilot in the Royal Australian Ai r Force would dare to take one of them into the air against, an opposing enemy plane. I understand that the Hawker-Demons have a range of under 300 miles. This is the sort of equipment upon which we have been spending our money. In the United States of America army planes go across the continent without having to refuel.",53
124,Mr LAZZARINI,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The American army to planes have a range of 4,000 miles.",53
125,Mr GREEN,MOTION OF WANT OF,"That is so. It therefore behoves us to make sure that for our expenditure of £16,000,000 on defence we get good value. It would be better to cut down our defence vote to £3,000,000 or is £4,000,000 per annum, and secure good value, than to lull ourselves into a sense of false security by purchasing inefficient defence materiel and fancying that we have thereby bought security. Expenditure on defence is provided for at the expense of the social development of the country, and for this reason alone we ensure that every effort is made get the best value for our money.",53
126,Sir HENRY GULLETT,MOTION OF WANT OF,"Henty) [5.17] - I would not have intervened in this somewhat futile debate were it not for the remarks dropped by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) who spoke in disparaging terms of the former member for Warringah, my old friend, Sir Archdale Parkhill. I do not wish to enter into a controversy with the I honourable member for Warringah, but I the was a member of this House when Sir Archdale Parkhill first came into it. His work is'well known to 'me, and to honourable members all around the chamber, both as a prominent member of the Opposition, and afterwards as a Minister upon this side of the House. I have known no honourable member in recent years who devoted himself more constantly, and more assiduously, to the task of the uiomeut and the day than did Sir Archdale Parkhill. Therefore, I deplore very much that his successor in this chamber should have thought fit to cast reflections on one who carried on his work well during his time as a member and who always supported his side in a very remarkable way, one who gave heart to many Ministers who were in difficulty at the table by his timely interventions and one who, to the best of my knowledge-and for years I was his - colleague in Cabinetcarried on the administration of his departments so admirably.",53
127,Mr WARD,MOTION OF WANT OF,What has that to do with the motion before the Chair?,54
128,Sir HENRY GULLETT,MOTION OF WANT OF,"The honourable member for Warringah was permitted to make those remarks, and I take it that I may be permitted to say something on the other side. It was said by the honourable gentleman that Sir Archdale Parkhill left to his ministerial successor, the present Minister for Defence (Mr Thorby), a very heavy task. I venture the opinion that the affairs of the Defence Department were quite as satisfactory when Sir Archdale Parkhill left it as they were found to upon the occasion of the recent ""mobilization "" during the European crisis. The only subject. I should like, very briefly, to touch upon this afternoon is the decision of the Government, as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) to adhere to voluntary training for our army in this country. I am profoundly disappointed in that decision. I regard it as an amazing one in the circumstances which prevail at the moment. I regard the perseverance with, and the enlargement of, the voluntary system as something which will give us no real results towards the defence of this country. I regard it as a great waste of public money. Indeed, I feel so strongly about it that I trust that this endeavour to expand the number of volunteers from 42,000 to 70,000 will fail. It carries good wishes of mine because I do not think it represents an effective contribution to the vital defence of this country. This country is either in danger today or it is not. We, who do not know as much as the Government knows, must assume from the declarations and the actions of the Government, that it is ir near and real danger. I take it that this Government, or any other government, would not announce the emergency purchase of 50 new Lockheed fighting aeroplanes from the United States of America unless it believed that Australia did stand in real danger. I take it that all this expansion and reconditioning of the Navy, the discussions relating to a battleship, the enlargement on a grand scale of the air force, the upbuilding of coastal defences, and the increased manufacture of munitions, are all evidence that the Government does believe this country to be menaced at this moment. I applaud all that the Government is doing in respect of the larger part of its defence programme. That I have previously made clear in this House. I believe that the defence of this country must be om a co-operative basis with that of Great Britain. I believe absolutely that Singapore is a great outside citadel for the defence of this country; but I would not bank, as the Government appears willing to do, entirely upon Singapore. Let us, by all be means, mainly with our Australian navy, and, perhaps, with portion of our air force, co-operate with all our might with Singapore, but let us be prepared for real resistance should our defences at Singapore fail, and should a hostile force get down here and engage in heavy raiding or an actual invasion of this country. If a hostile force comes to this country it will probably be a veteran force accustomed to actual campaigning. What have we in this country today to oppose such a force? We have some 35,000 young volunteers almost completely untrained with the exception of the country men of the force. I wish very clearly to distinguish between the light horse and other units raised in the country districts, and the great infantry contribution made by the metropolitan districts. Everybody knows that no our young country man is accustomed to the use of arms; he is accustomed to using sporting rifles from his boyhood; he is a horseman and accustomed to the use of heavy tools; trenching would be easy to him; and he might, with very little training, be made into a good soldier who could be put into a defensive line with some confidence that we were not inviting him to self-sacrifice. The position with respect to the city militia units is entirely different. To give to bred and born youths this wretched few days and nights of training a year and to depend upon them as a force which we could put into the firing line swiftly after an invading force landed here or war was declared, is ridiculous. In contemplating that, the Government is guilty of a very very grave offence. These imperfectly-trained infantry units would have to take the burden of the blow from raiders. High in spirit, but given no opportunity to become competent soldiers, they represent the nucleus on which a larger army of raw recruits would be based. The infantry units would be called upon to absorb the recruit who had never handled a rifle and who knew nothing whatever of war. The thought of that is, to me, an appalling one. The citizen force, with its present training, would be a mere suicide club, if it were ti> encounter any real invading trouble. As I say, I find it almost impossible to believe that a responsible Government could propose the continuance, nay, almost the doubling in strength, of this untrained and unfortunate force. ""Why, it fails from the very moment of its enlistment! It is thoroughly bad. First of all, it is grossly unfair in a democracy which, as I say, the Government has declared to be in danger, that the defence of this country should rest upon high-spirited volunteers. The only fair system is that the defence of the country should rest by law equally over all outyoung manhood. Any other system for the defence of this country in time of crisis must disappoint every democrat in this chamber. Some employers encourage their young employees to take part in this voluntary training; others do not, with the result that we have unequal sacrifice, not to the same acute degree as with the unequal sacrifice running through our young men, but nevertheless an unequal sacrifice which affects the competitive capacity of our various businesses and industries. Again, under the voluntary system, we do not get the most able potential soldiers. How many athletes are there in the citizen forces today? I suggest that there are very few. How many in the forces today excel in any way at cricket-no t in first city grade, but even in tenth grade cricketand how many are there who get a garniof any kind of football or any other sport? Athletes do not take to the militia forces, and thus we miss the very salt of our youth under the present system. What is the physical standard demanded of a trainee? We have now a very much reduced standard. Not 50 per cent, of those being enlisted today would be accepted if a war-time standard were imposed. Then we come to the matter jjf their training. We all know .that it is a farcical training; they know as much about soldiering when they have undergone a year's training as they would know about science or an intricate trade if they spent from five to ten days intermittently in the study of it. The system does not permit of the establishment of any reserve. To me, perseverance with the system causes a feeling of dismay. Surely in the development of the defence force we have not in contemplation the winning of a war! We wish to avoid war. We do not desire the satisfaction of defeating hostile alien troops that had landed on Australian soil. Our aim all the time should be to make this country so repellant and dangerous that no invader would come here. I believe that it is absolutely in our power to do that, small though our population is. We have the necessary financial resource's. The Government, out of political weakness, out of some utterly unworthy political consideration, refuses to make a real attempt to tackle the task in hand. It certainly has gone a long way; it is expending £15,000,000 or £16,000,000 a year. Yet it contemplates the continuation of a system under which, if the outer ring of our defence were broken, this country would be defenceless, and our nationhood, of which we dream on the grandest scale, would possibly be destroyed before it had really begun to develop. To-day Australia is a temptation to all overcrowded countries. There are those who Cameron, Archie still dream that, in a period of crisis, Casey, R. G. friends would appear from some quarter Corser, - I know not where-in great strength, Fadden, A. W. swiftly and surely, to aid us. I again Fairbairn, J.

Bill brought up by Mr WHI TE and mid a first time. SECOND READING.",54
129,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Balaclava- Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.551] - by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to validate until the 4th May next year, the collections of duties imposed under a customs tariff resolution introduced on the 4th May this year. Honourable members will recollect that, under the Government's trade diversion policy, a licensing system was applied to the importation, of certain classes of goods from certain foreign sources. Towards the end of 1937, the Government ""reviewed its policy on trade diversion and, on the 7th December, 1937, I informed the House of the intention of the Government to alter the licensing system, and to substitute a system of adequate duties where such action was necessary for the protection of Australian [44] NOES. industry. Ultimately, the licensing system was terminated, except in the case of motor chassis. In the meantime, inquiries had been instituted with the object of ascertaining to what extent Australian manufacturers had incurred additional capital expendiG. J. ture in the production of the goods covered by the trade diversion policy, and the need for further tariff protection to safeguard that capital expenditure, pending reports by the Tariff Board after public inquiry as to the amount of the protection necessary. As the result of these inquiries, the Government came to the conclusion that, pending a public inquiry by the Tariff Board, there was need for additional duties under the general tariff on a number of articles to PAIR: safeguard the new capital which had been incurred, or the extensions which had taken place. Accordingly, in May last, the Government introduced tariff proposals increasing the general tariff rates on a BILL 1938. number of lines, including lawnmowers of certain types, refrigerators, fractional horse-power motors, electric fans, spring hinges, advertising posters, pencils of wood,' motor vehicle springs, and shock absorbers. It was made clear that these duties were to be regarded as of a temporary nature, at least until such time as the Tariff Board had reported upon the various subjects. Up to the present, the Tariff Board has not completed its reports upon the subjects covered by the tariff proposals of May, 1938, and in order that the capital expenditure incurred may be safeguarded in the meantime, the Government is desirous of validating the duties from the time of their imposition until the 4th May next. There are no politics in this, and there is no reason for a general discussion on rates of duty or on tariff policy. Because of the tragedy which led to the adjournment of the House last week, this bill could not then be passed, and it is necessary now that it be passed through all stages in both Houses by tomorrow. Honourable members are aware that tariff proposals must be validated or ratified within six months after being"" tabled. These duties are not to be ratified. They will merely be validated, so that no importer will be able to sue the Government for the recovery of duties already-collected ",57
130,Unknown,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Sitting suspended from 5.57 until 8 p.m. . Jjr. /FORDE (Capricornia) [8.0] - I dp. not-intend to oppose this bill, but I wish to make a few observations in regard to certain aspects of it. . It is rendered necessary because the .Government was not prepared to allow Parliament to consider the items contained in the tariff schedule, which it seeks to ratify, within six months after it was tabled. That schedule was tabled on the 4th May last, and this bill, when passed, will validate the collection of the duties set out in the schedule, without our having first considered the wisdom of the whole of the items. The validation of these collections will mean that the collection of duties under the schedule will be continued for another six months, a full year from when the schedule was tabled. It is well to point out' that this process is a departure from the intention of Parliament when it accepted an amendment to the Customs Act making it mandatory for tariff proposals to be considered by Parliament within six months of being tabled.",58
131,Mr MAKIN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,I suppose that this bill is really a promise of an early session next year ?,58
132,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I presume that that is so, unless the Government intends again to circumvent the intention of Parliament by introducing another validating measure. Probably, that is what it will do.",58
133,Mr GBEGORY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The amendment that was made to the Customs Act, at any rate, makes it compulsory that tariff proposals be brought before Parliament for approval.",58
134,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"What is the use of bringing it before Parliament in this way? We are asked to accept it en bloc without knowing what we are voting for. Eventually, we hope we shall have the opportunity to discuss the individual items, but that is to be denied us at present. I am sorry that the Government did not call Parliament together at an earlier date, in order to afford it that opportunity, instead of asking honourable members to pass legislation before tomorrow in order to safeguard the revenues of the Commonwealth by the validation of past collections of customs duties under the schedule ",58
135,Mr BEASLEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The idea of this bill, apparently, is to avoid compliance with the direction - given by Parliament to the Government to place before Parliament for consideration each tariff schedule before the elapse of six months after its tabling.",58
136,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"That was the intention of the honourable member for Swan, (Mr. Gregory) and of Parliament in 1934. I give that honourable member credit for being consistent in his attitude towards the tariff. We, on this side, do not agree with his view. He stands, as do most of the members of the Country party, for a low tariff.",58
137,Mr MAKIN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable member means _ "" for free trade "".",58
138,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Yes , some members of the Country party are free traders, but the policy of the Australian Labour party is for a protective tariff that will give effective protection to Australian industries. There is no halfway measure about our policy, whether it be in relation to primary industries or secondary industries. I return to the point that - the action of the Government in bringing down this bill is tantamount to introducing a tariff schedule and leaving it on the table for a year, whereas it was intended, when the Customs Act was amended, that it should not lie on the table for more than six months without being given consideration by the House. Unless Parliament does consider and pass this schedule within six months from now, the Government will have to bring down another validating measure. What guarantee will the Minister give us?",58
139,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Unles s the duties are altered. I remind the honourable member for Capricornia that they are only temporary duties, imposed pending inquiry by the Tariff Board. , Mr Forde - That is possible. We were told that six months ago, and I did not object to them. I do not find serious fault with what the Minister for Trade and Customs is doing, but I remind him that he took me to task when I was Minister for Trade and Customs for depending on the recommendations of departmental experts for decision as to the. rates of duties that - should be imposed. The leaders of the two parties opposite, when the composite Ministry was> 'formed, declared that no Customs duties -.would , be imposed unless the Tariff Board had first considered the ; items iand made.,recommendations thereon and that-the Government would abide by these recommendations. Despite that declaration, the duties, the collection of which the Government now seeks to validate, were imposed on the advice, no doubt, pf departmental experts,' who are very competent gentlemen, probably more competent even than members of the Tariff Board to make recommendations as to what should be .the rates of duties. They, however, are the very persons who were criticized by the Minister for Trade and Customs when he was a private member in opposition. The Labour Government was told ""then that the departmental officers were no better than office boys; and that no reliance could be, placed on their advice. That was the attitude of the Minister for Trade and Customs as a private member, but his attitude as Minister for Trade and Customs is the same attitude as that which was taken by me when I held the same office. The Minister cannot have it both ways. The Government came to the conclusion that, pending a public inquiry by the Tariff Board, there was need to increase certain duties. Accordingly, in May last, the Government introduced a new schedule in which the duties were increased on a number of lines. I do not object to that because I have no doubt that the increased duties are necessary and that departmental experts satisfied themselves on all points before they made any recommendation to the Minister. I am constrained to point out, however, that it is obvious that if they are right in their recommendations now, they must have been equally right when they made recommendations to the : Labour Government, although honourable members opposite declared then that they were wrong. ""When certain honourable gentlemen opposite pressed for the limitation of the period in which a tariff schedule could on the table of the House without ratification, and a time limit of six months was adopted, it was said that the old system resulted . in. unauthorized collection . of taxes behind the back of Parliament. Some .illuminating, speeches were made in this House in July, .193.4, when legislation to amend, the .Customs Act 19011930 :was before.(honourable .members..:"" I shall quote certain extracts from the speeches of certain honourable gentlemen, but .before I do so, let us. examine the legislation. It was brought down by the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. 1 White) and 'the bill sought''to add these words to the appropriate section- . or before the expiration' of six months after such tariff or tariff alteration is proposed, whichever..first happens -' The honourable gentleman said that the amendment would become operative from the 1st January, 1935, and that it was intended that all schedules would be considered item by item by Parliament before the expiry of six months after their hav» ing been tabled. At first it was proposed to impose a time limit of three months. That proposal was contained in a requested amendment from the Senate, but it was decided by honourable members in their wisdom - to decline to accept that period as the time limit, because the Minister for Trade and Customs himself pointed out the difficulties that would arise if Parliament had to be called upon to' discuss seriatim a tariff schedule within three months of its coming into operation. Before the adoption of ,the amendment, fixing the time limit at six months, tariff schedules had remained in force from the time they were tabled until the end of the parliamentary session in which they ' were tabled. Before general elections it was absolutely necessary to validate the collections of customs duties, because, otherwise, all the sums collected in pursuance of the schedules - would have .had to. be returned to the persons who i m : ported the goods on which the duties were collected. The present Minister for Trade and Customs properly rejected the time limit of three months and suggested that it should be six months, but the then honourable member for Darling Downs, Sir Littleton Groom, an lie . eminent ..constitutional lawyer, who had been a Minister for Trade and Customs in a former administration, as well as haying been the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, indicated the difficulties that would arise in the future if the Minister for Trade and Customs tried to placate certain honourable gentlemen in both Houses of this Parliament, who were seeking the imposition of a time limit. The late honourable gentleman saidIf a provision sncli ns that now before lis had been included in the first Customs Act, this House would have had to put on one side all other legislative business in an endeavour to complete the consideration of the tariff within six months from the date of the tabling of the schedule. That would have been absolutely impossible. The first customs tariff schedule was tabled in this House on the Sth October, .1901, but it was not considered and passed until the 6th September, 1902, a period of approximately eleven months. The second comprehensive schedule was tabled on the Sth August, 1907, and was not considered until the 3rd June, 1908. The third tariff schedule was tabled by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, Sir Walter Massy-Greene, on the 24th March, 1920. It was not ratified for a year and nine months. The then honourable member for Darling Downs had those facts in mind when he made an interesting speech on the subject of an imposition of a time limit. He saidJ. think it would be unwise, in all circumstances, to accept the proposed six months period provided for in this clause. This provision may force the Government into a false position, and place a limitation not only upon the Parliament, but also upon the administration in connection with the affairs of the nation.",58
140,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Where lies the difficulty when bills of this description can be introduced?,60
141,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"This bill does not permit us to examine the schedule; we are asked to accept it without examination. Not two honourable members know what it contains. . For the last two days we have been debating a motion of want of confidence in this Government, and one of the reasons advanced by the. Government for the application of the gag, when at least eight honourable members on this side and probably eight on the other side .desired to speak, was that the Government had to have passed through both Houses of Parliament a bill to validate the collections of customs duties by tomorrow, because otherwise the Commonwealth Government would be open to action in the courts of law for the recovery of the collections. If Parliament had been called together at an earlier date, there would have been no need for this bill, because honourable members could have had full opportunity to discuss the items contained in the schedule.",60
142,Mr OLAR,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"K - As a matter of fact, there was opportunity earlier in the session for Parliament to discuss the tarifl.",60
143,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Yes , Parliament met for a few hours and adjourned for a week. On the slightest pretext honourable members who had travelled to Canberra from ""long distances were sent away again for another week, tf the Government had no other business to place before Parliament, it could at least have placed before it the tariff schedule that it now seeks to validate. Everything indicates that the Government was not serious when it accepted the time limit of six months. At any rate, it saw means whereby the desire of the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory) could be circumvented. The Government has by devious means taken action to avoid the discussion of the tariff item by item. The Minister for Trade and Customs realizes now the difficulties that would be encountered in having to discuss a tariff schedule within six months of it3 having been tabled, but when he was in opposition, he voted for an amendment moved by the honourable member for iSwan, which would have made it necessary for tariff schedules to be considered, not within six months, but within 90 days. He made a very eloquent speech on the subject. I admit that wheneven the honourable gentleman speaks on the subject either of defence or of tariffhe knows as much about defence as any member of the Ministry although he has not been allotted the defence portfoliohe is most eloquent. He was particularly eloquent when he said that there was no justification for a tariff schedule to be left on the fable for more ""than 90 days after being placed before Parliament. The honourable gentleman said that he could not conceive of any difficultv arising.",60
144,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,I said a good deal more than that.,61
145,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I am referring to the most eloquent passages in the honourable gentleman's speech - When pressure was brought to bear upon him by his newfound friends of the Country party, whom he had roundly chastised on other occasions for their fiscal outlook, the honourable gentleman saidThe effect of this clause, if agreed to, will be that tariff schedules must be ratified within six months. That was no doubt intended as a concession to the indefatigable honourable member for Swan, who may always be relied upon to take whatever steps are possible to compel Parliament to consider tariff items at the earliest possible date, and, if possible, to reject them. The Minister also observedIf the clause is adopted the old schedule will litivc to be validated or money collected under it will have to be refunded. This will Bpur the Government to speed up its tariff debates. However, I do not intend to oppose the bill. I believe in - considering tariff schedules item by item at the earliest possible date. I simply point out that the adoption of this method of dealing with the tariff does not achieve the desire of the honourable member for Swan to have tariff schedules discussed item by item within six months of being tabled. In this connection I remind honourable members of the fine speech made on this subject by the late honourable member for Darling Downs on the 4th July, 1934, when he directed attention to the difficulties that would confront the Government if it accepted the amendment. The Minister for Trade and Customs did not see eye to eye with the honourable member for Darling Downs on that occasion, with the result that today he is appealing to the Parliament to pass this bill without delay because we are within one day of the expiration of the six months period during which the schedule should be ratified. Although I am not opposing the measure, I feel justified in directing attention to the inconsistencies of the Minister.",61
146,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Swan) [ 8 . 1 8 ] - I have listened with a good deal of patience to much ado about nothing. The Minister for Trade and Commerce (Mr White) is adopting the correct course in seeking the approval of Parliament to this bill. The object of the amendment which I , in this House, and Sir H a l Colebatch, in the Senate, were instrumental in having inserted in the Customs Act, was to ensure the supremacy of Parliament in regard to. tariff matters, and to make i i impossible for governments to give effect to tariff schedules year after year without seeking the endorsement of Parliament.",61
147,Mr LAZZARIKI,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The honourable member is fooling himself.,61
148,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Natur e did that for the honourable member for Werriwa. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Forde) discussed at some length the procedure adopted in connection with tariff schedules introduced in 1909 and 1920, but he did not tell the House anything about the tariff schedule introduced in the last period of the life of the - Bruce-Page Government and of the Labour Government in 1930, so I shall do so. That schedule was ratified in a some what similar manner to that which we are being asked to adopt on 'this occasion. But subsequently the Labour party introduced a. tariff schedule which remained in force for nearly two and a half years without the sanction of Parliament. In other words, the people were being taxed without parliamentary authority. Nowadays both Houses of the Parliament must agree to validate customs duties imposed by schedules that have been in force for six months without parliamentary consideration, or the schedules become null and void. The schedule introduced by the Labour Government was the most distorted ever placed before a parliament. The duties were not based upon reports of the Tariff Board. Apparently the government of the day said "" We shall double the duty on this item, and treble the duty on that one "". That was all there was to it , and Parliament had no say in ilie matter.",61
149,Mr FORDE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The introduction of this bill is only another means of depriving Parliament of the opportunity to express : its mind upon the particular items of one tariff schedule.,61
150,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"At least the Minister has to obtain the approval of both Houses of the Parliament to this bill and there is nothing to prevent the honourable .member from discussing every item in the.i schedule. >- In-this way Parliament is giving a tentative 'approval to the duties."" ii .

Mr.,LAZZARINI.(Werriwa.) [8.28] We have all heard of little children play1 ing-the! game of? ""make believe?'. The car honourable = member for - Swan .(Mr. .Gregory) seems to be in his second childhood, for he is playing''that Old game tornight. .He is ,-tryingi, to make the to Parliament"" believe, that, a different 300 course, is being adopted by .the Governr ment on this,,occasion-.in respect-.of the tariff schedule now under notice than that which was adopted by the Scullin Government some years ago in respect of its tariff schedule. Actually there is no difference whatever. The honourable gentleman's chiding of members of the Opposition is a good illustration of Satan reproving sin. Although Parliament may pass this bill, honourable members will still not have an opportunity to discuss the tariff schedule item, by item. That, after all, was the purpose that the honourable member for Swan wished to serve when he obtained the approval of this House in 1934 to his amendment of the Customs Act. He has seen fit to charge the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Forde) with inconsistency, but he himself is most inconsistent. His amendment was not an amendment at all. It is not serving the end that was desired, for the tricksters in the Cabinet are getting away with it just the same. The honourable member will swallow the pill whether he likes it or not; even if he thinks it to be coated he will find in the end that it is bitter aloes. The honourable member cannot get away from the fact that what is being done to-night is what was done when the Labour Government was in office. I challenge the honourable member to say that there is anything different in the procedure adopted now and that adopted then.  difference.",61
151,Mr LAZZARINI,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I have stated the facts, and neither the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr White) nor the honourable member for Swan can get away from them. I rose only to emphasize to the honourable member for Swan that he is swallowing the pill proffered by the Minister for Trade and Customs, and passing a schedule of duties and approving of their collection for twelve months without having an opportunity to say whether he believes in them or not. It will be another six months before he even gets a chance to amende these duties, and he knows only too well that that chance is but a slender one, and that he probably will not get such an opportunity until next May at the earliest. When the Parliament meets after the Christmas recess honourable members will find as usual that they have been summoned here for only a few days. They will be asked to validate this tariff again, and the Parliament will immediately go into a lengthy recess. If Parliament were kept open, and honourable members were given an opportunity to discuss proposed tariff duties, as was done during the regime of the Labour Government, no complaint would be raised. This schedule should have been disposed of at least three months ago. Perhaps the honourable member for Swan thinks that he might be able to get into the Cabinet, and makes this contribution towards his claims for consideration. I expected him to trounce the Minister for Trade and Customs, but he failed to do so.",63
152,Mr GREGORY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,It is said that fools rush in where angels fear to tread. I have not seen any Tariff Board reports.,63
153,Mr LAZZARINI,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"There are none. This Government gets the honourable member for Swan both going and sugar- coming. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that he would submit all matters to the Tariff Board, but a schedule of duties has been brought before the House for validation without any reports having been obtained. This is merely making a dummy of the Tariff Board. Neither the Minister nor the honourable member for Swan can get away with that. This Government is doing in an underground way what the Labour Government did quite openly. Duties are to be collected and the people are to be taxed without their parliamentary representatives having been given an opportunity to discuss the merits or demerits of the duties imposed.  - The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) has worked himself up into a state of synthetic indignation, and has shown a good deal of confusion of thought in stating that the position today, with reference to the powers of Parliament, is exactly the same as it was during the period in which a government, composed of members of the party of which the honourable member is such a distinguished ornament, was in office. The difference between the position today and then is that even though opportunity is not given to discuss the actual items themselves"", the Parliament must at least have an opportunity, within six months of the schedule being tabled, to say whether or not it shall be validated, whereas during the regime of the Labour Government a tariff schedule could be laid on the table and taxes could be collected under it right through until just before Parliament was dissolved, when a validating bill had to be brought down. That certainly is a very essential difference, even if the honourable member is not capable of seeing it.",63
154,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Balaclava-Minister for Trade and Customs) [8.35] - It would not have been necessary for me to say anything further except for the assertion of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini)-and after all it is a mere assertion-that what the Government is doing now is what the Labour Government did openly when in office. It was made perfectly clear by the  ing my absence abroad that these duties were of a temporary nature and were imposed in the first place so that industries would not be injured because of arrangements made under the trade diversion policy. the Assistant Minister said, they were to remain in force only until the Tariff Board's reports were received. All of the matters concerned have been referred to the Tariff Board. The Tariff Board Act says that no action may be taken to change duties until a report has been received from the Tariff Board. Does the honourable member wish to debate each of these items, put them into law, and alter them next month? The honourable member for Swan moved his amendment in order to hasten Parliamentary consideration of tariff proposals. I admit that it causes some inconvenience to governments, but it also ensures that these proposals must be debated within a reasonable time.",64
155,Mr MAKIN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,What is the record of the present Government in that respect?,64
156,Mr WHITE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I shall remind the honourable member of the record of the Government which was in office when he tvas Speaker in this House. The different Ministers for Trade and Customs in the Scullin Government within a period of two years brought down no less than 30 tariff schedules, eleven cu*toms, one export, four primage, three special duty, ten excise and one Canadian. Were they debated in this Parliament? The Scullin Government tried to have them debated and had such an unhappy experience that only two out of 30 were ratified, the rest being validated when that Government was turned out of office and went to the country. I have been Minister for Trade and Customs for nearly six years and I have brought down numerous schedules, every one of which, after discussion, has been passed into law. This schedule is to operate only for a few months and after the expiration of that period a new schedule will be brought down and debated. If it be found that these duties suffice the House will then have an opportunity to pass them iiito law. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and reported from committee without amendment or debate; report adopted. Bill-by leave-rea d a third time. APPLE AND PEAE ORGANIZAAs TIONBILL , 1938.

157,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Flinders) [8.45] I move That after the definition of "" approved growers organizations"" the following definition be inserted:"" ' grower ' in relation to a poll of growers taken for the purpose of this Act, means the occupier of an orchard from which at least two hundred and fifty bushels of apples or pears were exported in each of at least two of the three years preceding the taking of the poll in relation to which the expression is used; "". This definition I have taken from previous legislation introduced by the honor son), but I have altered it slightly. That proposal related to a grower who had exported 250 bushels of apples or pears in each of the three preceding years. My proposal relates to two at least of the three preceding years so that, should a grower lose his crop on account of some disaster, and be unable to export in one year-quite a common occurrence-h e would not thereby be precluded from having a vote in any poll that was taken. I intend later to move an amendment providing for the taking of a poll, and if that be agreed to this definition will be necessary.",64
158,Mr AKCHLE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"BarkerAssistant Minister for Commerce) [8.46]. - I suggest that, if the honourable member proposes to move for the insertion of a provision for the taking of a poll of growers, it might be as well to state the franchise under which the poll is to be",65
159,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Minders) [8.47] C am prepared to meet the Minister in any reasonable way. I have been informed that this is where the definition should be inserted. From conversations I have had with the honourable gentleman I understand that, if this be tlieThat introduced, the result will be that a State."" grower, wherever referred to in the act, will have to come under the definitionwhich might well have embarrassments. Sta te "". I can see the Minister's point, but should like an undertaking from him that if the amendment which I propose to move is agreed to he will provide an opof portunity for the insertion of a definition of this sort.",65
160,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I give that undertaking. Amendment-by leave-withdrawn . Clause agreed to. Clause 4(1.)

On the occurrence of any vacancy the membership of the board by reason of death, resignation or removal from office of any member, the Governor General may appoint a person to f ill the vacancy, and any person so appointed (other than the Government representative) shall hold office for the residue of the term of the member whose place became vacant: Provided that, where the member whose place became vacant was selected from a panel submitted by the approved growers' organizations in any State, the person appointed to fill the vacancy shall, subject to sub-section (0.) of this section, be selected from such a panel.",65
161,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"BarkerAssistant Minister for Commerce) [8.49]. - I propose to move That the words "" such a panel"", sub-clause (12), be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words, "" a panel submitted for the pur.pose in accovdanee with the foregoing provisions of this section."" On account of a panel being of considerable age, it might be necessary for arrangements to be made for the submission of a new panel in the event of a vacancy occurring on the board. The only remaining person on the panel might represent an organization which already had representation, and the effect of the operation of the clause in its present form might be to disfranchise for the time being a very deserving body of growers.",65
162,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Flinders) [8.52] I have a prior amendment."" I move the words "" from a panel submitted by approved growers' organizations in that sub-clause (5 ) . be omitted, with a view to insert in lien thereof the words "" by a poll of apple and pear growers in that II am particularly keen to have this alteration made, because I feel that in the setting up of a board for the control the export of a product by an industry the correct procedure is for the organization of the industry to approach the Government, with a definite proposal in relation to the board, and for the Government then to introduce legislation constituting that, board with statutory powers. In this case, not through any fault of the Minister but due, I think, to shall a certain degree of disorganization, this proposal did not come from the industry. In Victoria, owing to a faction fight from a which existed at the time, the only organization with which the Minister was able to get in touch, or which was recommended to him by the Minister for Agriin culture in that State as being the the authoritative organization, was considered by a very large number of growers as not representative of the industry. I have no wish'to criticize that particular organiza-. tion. I have seen a good deal of the work that it has done, and know that it has done very good work indeed; but it was felt that the board was not truly represent tative of the growers. Shortly after the introduction of this legislation, a poll was taken of the 400 members of that particular organization, and those, who considered that the previous hoard was not representative"" were' elected to the new board, indicating that ""there was"" some real .substance in the. feeling that the' board to. which the Minister originally put his proposal did .not-at.that time have the complete confidence of the industry. I feeh that if this legislation-is. to be successful, it. .is essential that,-those in-the - industry, shall .consider-that their representatives on the board-have-been-in actual fact elected by the growers themselves."" I know it is very easy to-say that there .are definite virtues in-.submitting-.a panel' and allowing a manof the Minister's abilityi-to-select those who,-in-his opinion;* are the-most efficient'. I have* no doubt whatever 'in;my own mind of-the ability of the Minister,- given, a reasonable panel, to select,very adequate representatives.,:. It is not of what may happen, but of - the principle, that - I am - afraid. I agree that there may be something in thq argument that' given a panel,, the Minister might select more adequate representatives than in certain_ circumstances the growers themselves might elect. I point; out, however, that, the same argument may be ,u.sed in respect of Parliament, itself.., You,, Mr Temporary Chairman ,(Mr Rollins.), may well think: that if .you we.re given the task of selectins:, .members of . this Parliament, you might materially improve i,ts personnel. I ant, sure that, if the Minister were .given the right to select a parliament from the people, of Australia, his selection would be an excellent one: but, great as is my confidence in him, I should not suggest that he be given that power. I do not think that any member of this Parliament would suggest that the Minister, or any individual in Australia, should have the right to select a parliament from a panelv I believe that Signor Mussolini performsthat task with some degree of Mr Fairbairn-. success. I have heard it said that the Fascist Council which he selects is a much more efficient body than was the old Italian Parliament. But we in Australia still consider that we are capable of electing suitable representatives to this legislature. That is how the growers feel in this matter; they want to have the right to select their own representatives, and I regard their claim as a reasonable one. My support of this measure was conditional on that right being given to the growers. In the circumstances, I am not prepared to compromise on this point, although I am willing to meet the Minister as far as possible, because I appreciate' the very great efforts he made, before introducing the bill, to ascertain the views of the whole of the growers in engaged every State. Every honourable member who' has spoken-has testified to his efforts. But, nevertheless, if the bill is to have the 'real confidence of those who are engaged' in the industry, he must, in my opinion, grant to the growers the right to select their own representatives.",65
163,Mr FROST,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Franklin) [8.58] - I support the amendment of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn), and' trust that the Minister will accept it. I agree that the growers will wish to know who are to represent their industry. I would not support the proposal if it related to growers who produce only for the local market. , Mr LANE - Why should not the local growers be represented?",66
164,Mr FROST,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"This bill deals with the expo.rt of apples and pears, so why should the growers who sell their products on the ; local market have any say in the appointment of a body to control the export industry? In my opinion, it is wrong to place upon the Minister the responsibility of selecting the members of the board. It is provided in the bill that Tasmania shall have four representatives on the board, and the growers in that State are to submit a panel of eight names from which the Minister will make a selection. Western Australia is to have two representations who will be chosen from a panel of four. The same applies to Victoria, while South Australia and New South Wales are each to have one representative, and the growers in each of those States will submit a panel of Apple and Pear [3 NOVEMBER, ' 1938.] two. It - would be much better, I believe, if the growers were to choose their own representatives by ballot. According to the present proposal, the Minister will make the final choice, and he may not select the' best men'. He will not know them as well as 'will' the growers among whom they have lived all' their ' lives. The Minister will probably' have to accept the advice of the Ministers for Agriculture in the various States.' It would be easier and more satisfactory if the growers were allowed to select their own representatives. .'In Tasmania, where the industry is highly organized, the growers at'present 'select their own representatives' on the' State' board, 'and they are quite satisfied with the way the system works: It is the same principle as is applied in electing'representatives to Parliament. The people choose the men they want, and, in the same way, the fruit-growers should be allowed 'to choose''those whom-they think are best able->to advance their interests. I ' a m in favour of ""the amendment - ""- , I support the'amendment of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn), and I endorse'the remarks''of the honourable' m'ember' who is ' representing the Opposition' (Mr Frost) in this' matter. It is not proposed to'take a poll to decide whether this organization shall cOme into existence. Tha't' being' so, T think ""it is at' least-desirable that a poll should be taken to determine the' membership of the board: "" I agree with'the' honourable' member' for Flinders that, if that were ""done"", the'growers would have more' confidence in the board. They would feel that the members of the hoard really 'were their : representatives: I know that'there may be some difficulties in the way of obtaining a list of growers, but it has been done in the past, and if the difficulties have been surmounted in >the-past,' they can be overcome in' the future.",66
165,Mr BARNARD,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Bass) [9.5] - I find myself to some' extent in disagreement with my colleague from Tasmania,'the 1 honourable' member ' for Franklin (Mr. Frost), in regard to this clause, and I do not agree-with what has been said by the honourable member for' Flinders (Mr. Fairbairn), or the honourable member for  Organization Bill 1938. 1243 require' time to take a poll of growers for the election of a board, and this would delay the coming into operation of the act. The proposal in the bill to select the board from' a panel nominated by the growers seems to me to meet all difficulties.' The honourable member for Gippsland said that the growers wanted to elect their own representatives, but they will be virtually electing their own* representatives if they nominate a panel from which the final selection is made by the Minister. That is, undoubtedly the best way to constitute the board in the first instance. After the scheme has been in operation for some time, the system might be varied; and the members of the board'-appointed by-election. The proposal of the Government' regarding the appointment of the' board is much the same' as the"" system bywhich the workers' 1 delegate is appointed 'to the International Labour Conference in''Geneva. He is selected by the Government from a panel nominated by the trade unions in the various' States. ' I am fortified in my opinion by the suggestion of the growers' organizations themselves. The Fruit Bo.ard of Tasmania suggests that the growers' representatives on- - the federal board be . elected by a. vote, of members of the .principal organizations of growers. 1 Failing,, that, they: suggest that - the growers' representatives shall, elect the members of the federal board. , It seems to me that the difference between, what is proposed in. the bill, and-what is suggested by the. Fruit. Board in .Tasmania, is ,so slight as not,.to be. wor.th consideration. I am convinced that the proposal in 'the bill will prove satisfactory, and therefore I support.the clause as it. stands. :",67
166,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Barton) [9.10] - 1 desire to point out' to the members of this PaS 1 liame'nt, and . to Australia generally, that there is anotn'er party to' this, arrangement besides'the growers, There is the 1 '' - public. We should not make this board too restricted in its representation. Even the' two representatives from Tasmania who have spoken on the bill cannot agree as to how the.board should be constituted. The amendment of the honourable member for Flinders (Mir. Fairbairn) is all right 1 as'far as it goes, but this Parliament ought to take into consideration the fact that the consumers are also interested.  in Great Britain.",67
167,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"-This arrangement will not work any better than did the Paterson butter scheme, under which the worse butter was sold in Australia at the highest price, and the best butter sent overseas.  , Mr LANE --It is not nonsense, as the consumers in Australia know, because they had to eat the butter.",68
168,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION, The clause under discussion has to do with the constitution of the board.,68
169,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Othe r boards representing primary industries have been formed, and have failed to give the best results as far as the consumers are concerned. If I am able to show that this proposed board will be no more successful, I am entitled, as a representative of the consumers, to suggest that the board should be constituted in such a way as to guard the people of Australia from exploitation,  affected.",68
170,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I am aware that tht honourable member for Gippsland has never given any consideration to the consumers. All that he has ever thought of is to get the highest price for products of the poorest quality sold in the home market, and to send the best of the stuff abroad.",68
171,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,- I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the constitution of the board.,68
172,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The proposed constitution of the board is wrong. In the first place, it is proposed that it shall consist of one person nominated by the Commonwealth Government, four members to represent the growers of apples and pears in Tasmania, two representatives of the growers in Victoria, two more from Western Australia, and one from each of South Australia and New South Wales. I point out that New South Wales, which has the largest population of any State in Australia, is to have only one representative.  is the smallest exporter.",68
173,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,It is the largest consumer.  do with this bill.,68
174,Mr NAIRN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I rise to a pointof order. The amendment before the Chair has nothing to do with the representation of the States on the board. The point raised by the amendment is whether the board shall be appointed by the Minister from a panel nominated by the growers, or whether it shall be elected directly by the growers.",68
175,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Clause 4 has not yet been passed, and I submit that I am entitled to discuss all matters pertaining to the constitution of the board. I submit that I am entitled to discuss the whole of the clause as well as the amendment. I am , surprised that the honourable member for Perth, who is a lawyer and sometimes occupies the Chair, should take such a point.",68
176,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The honourable member may proceed.,68
177,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I point out to honourable members what many of them have probably not noticed previously, namely, that not the bill provides for a representation of the growers on the following basis:New South Wales, one; Queensland, one: South Australia, one; Western Australia, two; Victoria, two, and Tasmania, four. The representation of exporters is: Victoria and South Australia, one; Western Australia, one, and Tasmania, one. Queensland and New South Wales have no representatives of the exporters at all. Why should Tasmania have such an overwhelming preponderance of representation on this board ? The honourable gentlemen who represent Tasmanian constituencies in this Parliament are the biggest squealers in it. Their attitude is that if they cannot sell their potatoes on the mainland and if they cannot have a board that will do what Tasmania wants it to do, the mainland is at fault. I shall move an amendment which will give the consumers in each of the States representation on the proposed board. ",68
178,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,It would be ridiculous to the honourable gentleman who foisted on this country the Paterson butter scheme.  board and to have the consumers represented they would have to be brought from England.,68
179,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The representatives of the consumers would be able to prevent the best apples and pears from being sent abroad and the inferior from being sold to the Australian public. The Labour party, I am sure, will support me in this. This board is designed to supervise the export of apples and pears and if it decides that the best shall be sent abroad and the worse kept in Australia, there will be no representative of the consumers in Australia to protect their interests, unless the board's constitution is altered. That is the injustice of a bill which seeks to set up a board whose sole purpose will be to suit the needs of Tasmania, Victoria and, in some measure, Western Australia. The interests of the larger States are being subjugated to those of the smaller States. I concede that Victoria in point of population is large, but in point of size it is small. It is merely a chip off New South Wales. I impress upon Tasmania that although the bulk of the apples and pears grown in New South Wales are sold locally, the market in New South Wales still provides an important outlet for the apples and pears from Tasmania. The population of Sydney alone is 1,350,000. Offhand I do not know what the population of Tasmania is, but I know that it is exceedingly small compared with that of New South Wales. New South Wales, therefore, should not be represented merely by one person while Tasmania is represented by five. Moreover, the interests of consumers must be protected, and for that reason I impress upon the Ministry the necessity for giving them direct representation on the proposed board. Another aspect of this bill that worries me is the fact that the Assistant Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) has Hitler-like powers in selecting the personnel of the proposed board. I can see how it happened. The producers in Tasmania had a good talk to him and agreed to leave the choice of the personnel in his hands so long as he gave them a larger number of representatives than is to be given to any other State. I am surprised that the Assistant Minister should take upon himself the responsibility for selecting the personnel because, if the board is to be worth anything at all as the representatives of the growers, - the growers themselves should be the people to choose who should be their representatives. My surprise, however, is not so great as it would be if any other Minister were concerned, because the Assistant Minister has glorified himself. He feels that no other man can guide the marketing destinies of Australia. This bill gives satisfaction only to those persons who are interested in obtaining the highest prices and the widest market, and who have no concern for the health of the Australian community. Whatever the honourable member for Gippsland may say, it is a fact that, if the bill is passed in its present shape or as proposed by the honourable member for Flinders, the best apples and pears will be carefully selected and packed and sent to London, and the inferior ones will be left for disposal in the home market. The honourable member for Gippsland knows that that is true, because he inflicted upon Australia for years a board which sent away the best of our butter and forced the Australian people to pay enhanced prices for an inferior product. I do not doubt that the proposed apple and pear board will be any different from the butter board. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! I ask the honourable member for Barton to confine his remarks to the construction of the board proposed under this bill. The butter board or any other boardChas nothing to do with the subject under discussion.",69
180,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I submit that it is only by comparison with other boards that I can show the usefulness of the board proposed under this bill. I can cite many boards which have been set up as the alleged representatives of the producers which, if the authorities were game enough to take a referendum of the producers, would pass into limbo. It is a known fact that if the Government had the courage to take a poll of the growers in the apple and pear industry they would have nothing to do with this scheme.",69
181,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired.  is .regrettable that we should have to .listen to a display of ignorance from, the honourable .member: for Barton (Mr. Lane).. . It . is regrettable also that the honourable, member for Barton was not present when the Assistant Minister. :for Commerce. (iMv. -. Archie Cameron) introduced this bill, which vitally affects the interests of a hard-working section of the primary producers. In his second reading speech, the . Assistant Minister indicated to the House the portents of the measure and the reason for its introduction,, its effect upon primary production and upon .the export market, and, incidentally, its effect upon the consumers for whom the honourable member for Barton appears to be so concerned. The honourable .member shed crocodile tears about the necessity for the growers to be given the right to elect the proposed board, but he knows full well that the work that the board will do justly, equitably and fairly is now being done in a. voluntary fashion, though not so efficiently and effectively as it will be done by the new board. If the honourable member had taken sufficient interest in this measure he would have discovered for himself that to a great degree the apple and pear industry has regulated its own exports and. that this bill becomes necessary because certain organizations and other interested parties, including certain growers, have been breaking away from the voluntary organization in order to reap additional profits to the disadvantage of thcfee who have remained in it.",69
182,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The honourable member for  second-reading speech and is not dealing with the constitution of the proposed board.,70
183,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable member for Ballarat is quite in order.  orable members that this measure does not propose that control should of the produce of the growers. Consequently the claim for the growers to elect their own representatives is not so strong as it otherwise would be. The board will allocate export quotas, and every apple and pear grower in Australia who desires to export will be able to export - The Commerce Department itself could do ment, the job. . In these , circumstances,. the claim that a.poll should be taken of .the growers,is,.not so strong as it . would be if a board .were being set. up to take full control of the .produce in, order to. buy, sell,,ship, and speculate in the market. I .concede that, it is democratic to take a poll,,, but I point out to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) that at least in some of the States the apple and pear .growers are badly organized ; there is even multiplicity of organization and,, according to the Assistant Minister, the situation is rapidly arising in the markets of the world under which the facilities which exist today for us to rid ourselves of surplus production are diminishing. In these circumstances I submit that there is a strong case for the committee to pass the bill as it stands and not to press for a poll of the growers which would waste valuable time and prove costly. I am satisfied that if a poll were decided upon, internal dissention would arise among the growers. If a man with five acres of apples for export were given one vote, a man with ten acres might want two votes, a man with fifteen acres three votes, and so on. I hope that the Minister will not accept the amendment. I even hope that the honourable member for FlinderB will agree to withdraw it.",70
184,Mr FRANCIS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Moreton) [9.31] - I support the amendment. The apple and pear industry of Australia haB been in difficulties for a long while. The purpose of this bill is to try to solve at least some of its difficulties by making effective arrangements to dispose of a considerable quantity of Australian apples and pears in Great Britain. The proposed' board is to have statutory authority.,70
185,Mr BEASLEY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,How does the honourable gentleman suggest that the register . of voters could be prepared ?,70
186,Mr FAIBBAIBN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The Department of ; Commerce already has a register of all be taken apple and pear groAvers.,70
187,Mr FRANCIS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The background to this whole subject suggests to .me the wisdom, of providing that the growers shall. elect their own representatives, on the board. During the regime of the Bruce-Page Government a hill very similar to this was introduced into Parliabut the. poll of growers, which was. necessary to determine whether the proposed board should be established, yielded a negative result. As the honourable mem Minister for Markets at that, time, he could, probably tell us a good deal about the .subject. On this occasion we have decided that a board shall be established. In, these circumstances I . think it .is highly desirable, in the interests.of harmony among the growers, that they shall at least be given. the .right to elec.t. their own representatives. It is quite true that the Government has had the benefit of the advice of representatives of growers' organizations in connection with this matter, but it is nevertheless desirable, in my opinion, that a poll shall be taken of all growers for the election of the first board. Mr BiflAS-LEY - Is it not a fact that the growers already have a voluntary organization, and that the purpose of this measure is to establish a statutory body?",70
188,Mr FRANCIS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"That is true; but we want the new board to begin operations under the happiest possible auspices. As the Bruce-Page Government's proposal to establish a board of this kind was negatived years ago, the growers should themselves eleut the board now proposed to be set up. I believe strongly in the orderly marketing of primary products, and I advise the growers to support this board; but I shall, nevertheless, vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Flinders. I believe that the principle is democratic and will give the growers an opportunity to indicate whether or not they approve of the proposed organization.",71
189,Mr HUTCHINSON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Deakan) [9.35] This bill has evolved from the Australian Agricultural Council. So far as I am aware, no very strong demand has been ""made by the apple and pear growers for the setting up of such an organization. As the growers feel that they have not been fully consulted in regard to this matter, we should at this stage at least do everything possible to meet their wishes. Otherwise the board is likely to encounter suspicion, if not a measure of active hostility. I am well aware that farmers have through the Apple and Pear Council agreed, in principle, to the regulation and - control of the export of apples and pears, but certain provisions of this bill have not been-given unanimous support by those most deeply concerned, mainly, I admit, because .it has not been fully - understood. If we can do anything to prevent the development of opposition to the board we should do it. . i i . we, give the growers the right to elect the members of the board, we shall forestall a good deal of antagonism. The apple and pear industry, .like many , other primary , industries, has a good many organizations connected with it, and. these do not , all see eye to eye with one another. Many of the members of - one organization are, I know, definitely opposed to this bill, and.many growers feel that the proposed board is being foisted upon them. As the establishment of boards.of this kind by act of Parliament to regulate the marketing of primary products has in the past been determined by a poll of producers, and as Parliament - has thought fit in its wisdomto create this board without - reference to producers, I can see no reason why a poll of growers should not be taken on this occasion to elect the members of the board. If this is done the growers will undoubtedly feel that they have control of their own industry. It w.ould be .wise for the members to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Flinders. It has been suggested that some delay may be occasioned in the appointment of the board if the amendment be accepted, but I do not think that that need necessarily be so. the board will not be able to operate until the 1939 season and, as the machinery for the taking of polls of this kind is already established, a poll could be quickly taken, and it need not be expensive. The growers should be given the right to choose their own representatives, and I believe that if this concession is made to them the board will have a much greater chance to act with the unanimous' support of the producers.",71
190,Mr NOCK,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Riverina) [9.40] - During the second-reading of the debate I brought under the notice of the Assistant Minister (Mr Archie Cameron) a request from the exporters of apples and pears in New South Wales that they should be given a representative on the board as well as the producers in that State. I understood the Assistant Minister to say that would give consideration to the request. I hope that he will let us know without delay whether he can grant it or whether there is any real justification for ciples, refusing it.  Democratic principles are, in my opinion, preserved in the bill as it stands, for is provided that the members of the Doard appointed by the Government to represent the growers shall be selected from a submitted to the Government by industry. approved growers' organizations in each State. The amendment of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) seeks to disregard the growers' organizathe tions and to go hack to the individual growers. That seems to me to be a roundshould about way to elect the board. It surely not unreasonable to allow the growers' organizations to nominate panel from which the Minister may make a selection. No injustice will be done to any one if that course is followed. work of the board will be principally deal with export quotas and the like, every endeavour will undoubtedly be made to deal justly by growers parts of the Commonwealth. I shall oppose the amendment.",71
191,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,Wide Bay; -[9.43] - The principle underlying the amendment of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn) is far more democratic than that underlying clause in the bill. Wo should be prepared to allow the growers to determine by ballot who shall represent them on this board. Why should the Minister be given the power to appoint the growers' representatives ? Surely no one will deny that the growers are entitled to control their own business. The honourable memboard  think that appointment from a panel satisfactory. I disagree with him. I direct attention to the fact that subtime clause (6) of Clause 4 provides that the names of the persons in the panel subthat mitted to the Minister shall be approved and perhaps lost. by the Minister administering the Department of Agriculture of the concerned. Why should State Ministers for Agriculture be given the right approve of panels in this way?  he member torpedoeing his own Minister?,72
192,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"So long as I obtain justice for the growers, and adherence to democratic prinI do not care who is torpedoed. The apple and pear growers are entitled to control their own business. .Some years ago, under legislait tion passed by this Parliament, butter producers in all the States were given an opportunity to vote for representapanel tives on the board dealing with their Under the clause as it stands growers are to be asked to select a panel but a State Minister for Agriculture, who has really nothing whatever to do with matter, may veto their selection if he does not ajpprove of it. The Government give apple and pear growers the is right to select their own representatives and manage their own business. Therea would be strong objection to any legislative proposal dealing with workers' wages, or the control of unions, if it conThe tained a provision similar to that now to before the committee. I hope that the and reasonable and democratic amendment submitted by the honourable member for in all Flinders will be carried.",72
193,Mr RANKIN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Bendigo) [9.47J - 1 support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr. Fairbairn), but I see danger in insisting on a vote of the growers for appointments to the first board. In my opinion, it is the essential that the board should be appointed as quickly as possible, and T suggest that the Minister and the honourable member for Flinders should confer with a view to reaching an agreement to select the board from a panel as provided >""n the bill, but that at the end of three years, when the industry is organized, the should be elected by a poll of the growers. This, I believe, is a reasonable is proposition, and one that would be acceptable to growers in every State. If is occupied at this stage with an election of the board, there is a danger this excellent bill will be delayed,",72
194,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"BarkerState Assistant Minister for Commerce) [9.49] - There are several reasons to why I cannot accept the amendment of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Fairbairn). The arrangements necessary for the introduction of the bill have been varied and complex. As I explained in my second-reading speech, the apple and pear industry is not in a very happy position. If an election is held for the constitution of the first board, the adoption of some sort of franchise will be necessary. I have visited every State of the Commonwealth except Queensland, and have made careful inquiries' on this subject. In Tasmania there is a wholly elective State Fruit Board, and the franchise, I understand, is on an acreage basis, one vote being given for every 3 acres of orchard* and additional votes for additional acres.",72
195,Mr WARD,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,That is not fair.,73
196,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I note that the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) thinks that that method is not fair. It may interest him to know that that system of plural voting was instituted by the State Labour Government. No doubt, the principle is one to which a large section of the committee, including the honourable member for East Sydney, would take strong objection if applied in this bill. I know that some growers, whose political opinions receive the endorsement of the honourable member for East Sydney, object to it. Other growers consider that the franchise should be on the export basis, as suggested by the honourable member for Flinders a little earlier in the discussion. Still other growers believe that the franchise should be on a production basis. This view finds support in some parts of New South Wales.  for this bill.",73
197,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I agree that it would, but New South Wales growers approve of it, because they produce about 1,250,000 cases of apples yearly, and export only 60,000 or 70,000 cases. From the view point of other States, of course, a franchise on a production basis would be entirely unacceptable. We, therefore, say that in a bill this description the growers themselves should decide what is a fair basis for the franchise for the whole of Australia. If they cannot agree on this matter, the hill provides for the submission to the Commonwealth Minister for Commerce of a [45] panel of names from which the board is to be selected. There is nothing in the measure to prevent growers in every State from taking a poll on any franchise which they may approve for the selection of their representatives on the board. The conditions vary so much between the States, and even within the boundaries of some of the States themselves, that the committee would be well advised to allow the growers to settle this matter for themselves.",73
198,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The Minister is not allowing the growers to do that. He is settling it for them.,73
199,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The honourable member is wrong. Under the bill, growers in any State will be free to adopt whatever kind of franchise that suits them. All that the Government asks is that they shall submit their panel of names for selection.",73
200,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The decision of the growers could be vetoed by a State Minister for Agriculture.,73
201,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"That is a point which the Commonwealth Government is prepared to discuss with the various growers' organizations. It is not vital to the bill. There is a good deal in what the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Rankin) said about the difficulty in constituting the first board. I agree that if after three years' experience of the working of the act, the growers could agree with regard to the franchise, it would be unwise for this Parliament to take the responsibility for doing this. If honourable members are so inclined, I have no objection to reporting progress and discussing this aspect with the growers' organizations, but if the committee insists on putting into the bill something which I think is wrong, it will have to accept responsibility for its action. I assure honourable members that I have given much time and consideration to this question. I have heard arguments of 'for and against various franchise proposals in every State, and I am unable to say what 'system would be acceptable to all growers. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane) has said much about the need for consumer representation on the proposed board. If I understood him aright, he said he intended to move an amendment to provide for consumer representation. Evidently the honourable gentleman has not read the bill. The consumer is not affected by it.",73
202,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The consumer will be affected by it.,74
203,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,It is purely an export bill.,74
204,Mr LANE,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I know it is, but there is nothing to prevent an exporter from retaining certain types of fruit for the home market.",74
205,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"^So long as I remain in charge of the Department of Commerce I shall prevent the export of poorer grades of fruit from Australia. The honourable member for Barton apparently does not appreciate the keen competition for fruit which exists in other parts of the world. Australian exporters to the United Kingdom market have to meet competition from low-priced fruit from the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina, as well as from some European countries. If we were not prepared to keep up the standard of fruit exported from Australia, there would be no need for a bill of this description, but there would be urgent need to consider some other form of assistance to growers.",74
206,Mr HOLLOWAY,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,What interests does the Minister think he is safeguarding by insisting upon the panel system?,74
207,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"It is not a question of safeguarding interests, but of finding a workable method under which the board can be constituted, owing to the fact that there is no effective organization of this industry in a number of States. Tasmanian growers are organized on the acreage basis, and Western Australian growers on an entirely different basis. In South Australia, there is practically no organization, and in New South Wales very little. In the latter State, the distances between areas in which apples are grown-Armidal e in the north and Batlow in the south-is so great that there is considerable variation of conditions.",74
208,Mr WILSON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,It would take twelve months to get a Commonwealth-wide poll of exporters.,74
209,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"The Government has no record of exporters. In Victoria there are two major, and two, three, or four minor, organizations in the apple and pear industry. On several vital points these organizations are unable to agree. If there is no agreement within the borders of one State on a matter such as this, I submit that the committee will be undertaking a rather awkward job if it endeavours to arrive at a system of franchise acceptable to all growers from one end of Australia to the other. M i i FRANCIS - What was the franchise adopted in legislation passed by the Bruce-Page Government?",74
210,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I do not think that has any bearing on this issue. Circumstances then were altogether different. The market at that' time was an expanding one; today it is contracting. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Nock) raised the question of the representation of New South Wales, dealt with in sub-clause 1 of this clause. I have already told the committee that in the export of apples and pears New South Wales is of very little importance. Exports from that State in 1937 amounted only to 71,000 cases out of a total production of 1,250,000 cases. In Queensland the position is even worse. Exports last year amounted to only 15,000 cases. Tasmania, on the other hand, exported 2,500,000 cases, Western Australia 422,000 cases, Victoria 633,000 cases, and South Australia 224,000 cases. It will be seen, therefore, that exports from New South Wales and Queenslandconstitute only a very small proportion of Commonwealth total exports.",74
211,Mr FRANCIS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The Minister is dealing with representation on the board. The question before the committee is the method of franchise.,74
212,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"I was under the impression that I had dealt - fully with the question of the franchise. Apparently I have not. The figures which I have just given in relation to exports supply the reasons why I have thought it unwise to agree to representations made for inclusion on the board of a shippers' representative from New South Wales. No request has been received from Queensland for the appointment, of a shippers' representative.",74
213,Mr SCHOLFIELD,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,The Assistant Minister has said that there is no organization in South Australia. How will a panel be appointed in that State?,75
214,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"There is an organization in South Australia, but it is not an organization consisting solely of apple and pear growers. It is a fruit growers' and market gardeners' organization which includes apple and pear growers amongst its members. In the case of South Australia, that organization will have to be responsible for the nomination of representatives on the board.",75
215,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"Flinders) [10.2] I do not feel that this disagreement about the franchise is as great as the Assistant Minister for Commerce (Mr Archie Cameron) seems to think. Although there is a difference of opinion as to whether there should be a democratic poll of the growers or not-and the honourable members for Ballarat (Mr. Pollard) and Bass (Mr Barnard) have definitely submitted the views of their constituents in regard to that matterno honourable member, irrespective of what State he represents, has criticized the franchise proposed by me in the amendment which I subsequently withdrew. The honourable member for Ballarat made a spirited attempt to explain the real purposes of this bill to the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane). One of the reasons he advanced for the necessity for taking a poll-and I think it is held very strongly by many growers in my electorate also-wa s that there is a feeling that a certain section in the industry is wangling things for its own purposes. I have the word of a very influential man in my electorate who thinks that that is so. He says that certain shippers have exploited the industry very much for their own purposes, and he advances that as one of the reasons why this board should be set up. People who have advanced this theory to me have also suggested that these shippers have a very big influence in the existing Victorian Fruit Marketing Association. I am certainly not prepared to join in any such criticism of the Victorian Fruit Marketing Association Board, but there is that feeling that this wangling goes on and that the shippers' representatives have too much influence. That is why I think the growers should have the right to elect their own representatives on the board. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. RESIGNATION OF POSTMASTEB-GENEKAL.",75
216,Mr LYONS,CUSTOMS TARIF FVALIDATION,"""Wilmot-Prime Minister) [10.4] - I move That the House do now adjourn. I have to intimate to honourable members that this afternoon I received from the honourable the Postmaster General (Senator A. J. MCLachlan) the following letter:On the notice-paper of the House of Representatives today, 1 find a question by Mr. George Lawson, making inquiries as to the companies of which I am* a director, and furthermore asking if the department of which I am at present in control enters into contracts with some of those companies. I have made no secret of the fact that I am a director and chairman of directors of the Hume Pipe Company of Australia Limited. The supply of materials for p'ost office requirements is arranged by inviting public tenders, which in addition to being advertised in the Commonwealth Gazette, are brought under the notice of firms from whom 1 it has been.customary to receive tenders. On receipt of tenders, the details are scheduled and analyzed from the point of view of determining those which will provide the most economical supply of the materials needed to meet the department's requirements. They are then examined by a tender board consisting of three of the most highly-placed officers of the department, who submit a recommendation, wit h the necessary details supporting their views to the Director-General. The Director-General reviews the basis of the recommendations and the extent of the orders to be placed, and issues the necessary instructions to the Chief Inspector of Stores, who then executes the contract with the successful tenderer. It is not the practice to bring these matters under the notice of the Postmaster-General excepting in unusual circumstances, such as, for instance, the placing of substantial orders with foreign firms. I have never been consulted in regard to the placing of contracts for pipes or ducts with firms with whom I may be associated or wit h any others, nor have I any departmental or personal knowledge of such contracts. Having regard to the suggestion underlying the question, that I may in some obscure way have influenced the department, I feel that one course only is open to me, and that is to tender my resignation as Postmaster-General. This I do with some reluctance at such a time, but the protection of my honour and the honour of the Government against any insinuation that underlies the question on the notice-paper leaves no other course open to me, and appears to be the one I should adopt under the circumstances. 3, shall carry on the business of the Senate and of the department until I hear from you. I beg to inform the House that I have recommended to His Excellency the Governor General that the resignation be accepted. I have asked Senator A. J.

I take this opportunity to express my great regret, and also the regret of my colleagues, that Senator A. J. MCLachlan has found it necessary to resign from the Government.

Some months of the past financial year had elapsed before the Commonwealth grant was made available to the States. This fact, ami also the fact that the establishment of schemes on a sound basis necessarily occupied a certain amount of time, has resulted in the expenditure during 1037-38 being considerably less than the contributions provided by the Commonwealth and States. Advice has been received from the States that the schemes now in operation and those contemplated will ensure that the funds available wil l be utilized to the f u ll extent during the current financial year. The progress of the schemes and the results which have been achieved in each of the States to date are briefly summarized hereunder from letters received from the State governments:New Bouth Wales. The New South Wales scheme provides for employment in the first instance and technical training concurrent with employment. Up to the 20th August last, 1,310 youths hod been placed in employment in apprenticeship trades and callings requiring some period of training. Portion of the wages of these trainees is paid from the grant. The State Government arranged for an extensive survey to be undertaken to ascertain the number of youths who required training and the occupation for which each was considered most suitable. Owing to the preliminary work involved, the programme of training could not be commenced until March, 1038. At present approximately 660 youths arc undergoing training and new classes are being formed as rapidly as accommodation and machinery can be made available. Many of these trainees will shortly be placed in employment and portion of their wages paid until they become thoroughly efficient. While it has not been found possible to provide training for all applicants suitable employment has been found for approximately 1,000 youths since the inauguration of the movement. Queensland. Up to the 31st August, 311 lads had received or were receiving training-som e for commercial work, some for farming pursuits, and others in mining prospecting. Of these, 74 had been found permanent employment as a result of the training received. South Australia. At the 4th August, 360 youths were receiving technical training. In addition, 30 youths, whose training had been completed,. had been placed in employment up to that date. Allowances are made to trainees for fares and maintenance. Western Australia. The Western Australian Government has under consideration recommendations which have recently been made by a royal commission which inquired into the whulo question of youth employment.
